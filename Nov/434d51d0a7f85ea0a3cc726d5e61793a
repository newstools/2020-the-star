Classic 105 presenter Maina Kageni has added his voice to the ongoing debate about cyber bullying. This comes a day after President Uhuru Kenyatta said he quit Twitter because of mean words on social media. "I'd rather get some sleep after chatting with my wife. I wake up the following day, go to work and the world continues peacefully," he said during the launch of BBI signature collection at KICC. Speaking during the morning conversation, Maina said, "You can never control what people think and say. Donâ€™t let it hold you hostage!" Most of his listeners agreed that social media is a rough place, where a thick skin is needed for one to survive. The President's Twitter account was deactivated in March 2019, with State House saying it was to clean up access.
