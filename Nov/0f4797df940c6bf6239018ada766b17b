Former Tetu MP Ndungâ€™u Gethenji on Wednesday denied charges of creating a disturbance at the upmarket Kihingo estate in Kitisuru after failing to reach an out-of-court settlement. Gethenji alongside Josiah Otimu, Godfrey Ochieng', Kennedy Asewe and Ouma Ogonji denied the charge before magistrate Bernard Ochoi. The suspects are accused of forcibly breaking the door of a server room and chasing away Wells Fargo security guards who were manning the premises on October 16, 2019, at Kihingo Village (Waridi Gardens) in Kitisuru. Gethenji's brother Gitahi Gethenji was the original complainant in the case. Prosecutor James Gachoka said Gitahi had written a letter to the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions wanting to withdraw the case but later abandoned the plan leaving the DPP with no choice but to prosecute the case. Magistrate Ochoi released the suspects on a cash bail of Sh10,000 each. The case will be mentioned on November 25 during which a pre-trial date will be agreed. Ndungu and his family were the original developers of the Kihingo estate but he fell out with his brothers Gitahi and Bob over control of the Sh20 billion estate. Ndungu claimed to control the estate through 60 B shares held by a company he created in 2010. However, on November 2, Justice David Majanja ruled that there were no B shares and endorsed a residents meeting in April 2019 that removed Ndungu as chairman of the management company. Kihingo Village in Kitisuru consists of 55 houses that each has one share in the management company, a clubhouse and social amenities.
