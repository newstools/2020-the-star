A 33-year-old woman who stabbed a lawyer with a knife three times has been charged with attempted murder at Makadara law court. Linda Okumu was on Tuesday arraigned before chief magistrate Heston Nyaga for plea taking. The court heard that on Sunday at Umoja Inner core in Kamukunji subcounty, Nairobi, she willfully and unlawfully attempted to cause the death of David Ochieng by stabbing him three times. According to a police report, Okumu, a student at the University of Eldoret, allegedly stabbed Ochieng while at his house after he received a text message from another woman. The 33-year-old Nairobi based lawyer started bleeding and was taken to Mama Lucy Hospital by Okumu and neighbours. Ochieng was then referred to Kenyatta National hospital as his condition looked critical. It was then that Okumu was arrested by an AP - Victor Robs and police constable Benson Lesu - who were manning the facility as she allegedly tried to escape. Okumu was booked in at Buruburu police station and upon interrogation, she told the investigating officer corporal Julius Omwoyo that the incident occurred after the two had a quarrel which escalated to a fight. It is then that she saw Ochieng bleeding, she told the officer that she could not recall which weapon she had used. The officers then visited the scene of crime and retrieved a kitchen knife with blood and there was a pool of blood in the kitchen. The accused was then taken back to the police custody. Omwoyo told the court that the P3 form has not been filled as the complainant is still hospitalised in a critical condition. Okumu however pleaded not guilty and was freed on bond of Sh300,000. The matter will be heard on April 13.
