Nzamba died on October 24 at the age of 64 after a short illness. The late Senior Counsel was eulogised as a constitutional law stalwart and a patriotic Kenyan with unmatched legal prowess. Chief Justice David Maraga and Law Society of Kenya officials were among those who attended the mass. The family of the departed was joined by other senior government officials including Attorney General Kihara Kariuki and Defence CS Monica Juma. ODM party leader Raila Odinga together with his Wiper counterpart Kalonzo Musyoka condoled with the family. The AG said Kitonga made remarkable achievements in his life as well as to the country. Kitonga chaired the Committee of Experts that produced the 2010 Constitution. Kalonzo said Kitonga was to be airlifted to Nairobi for medical treatment but lack of an airstrip in his rural home prevented the journey. "If the airstrip was functional, it would have been easy to send Amref to airlift Nzamba but it is closed and dysfunctional. It is sad to know that he had to die on arrival at the hospital yet he would have been airlifted," Kalonzo said. "Nzamba had gone to Kitui to bury his relative when his wife noticed that he was not looking well. She told him that he needed to visit a doctor but it was not easy to convince him," Kalonzo said.
