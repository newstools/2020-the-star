The Directorate of Criminal Investigations has rescued six out of seven teenage girls reported missing. This comes following a viral video of a woman begging members of the public to help them trace the girls. According to the woman, the seven girls disappeared on November 14 in the morning after they were lured to cast auditions. The seven, all aged 16 years, were last seen in Nairobi's Komarock area. The woman in the viral video had said, "We are afraid that my cousin and the other six girls are being trafficked for sex because we have identified the last number to communicate with her is an American line that is no longer going through." "We are just begging and pleading with everyone who might see them to please contact the police," she added.
