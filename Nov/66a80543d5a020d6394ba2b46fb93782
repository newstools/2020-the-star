Arsenal believe they can inspire fans across the globe to be more sustainable after signing up to a United Nations plan to help tackle climate change. The club are the first in the Premier League to join the UN Sports for Climate Action Framework. It means pledging to help fight climate change and helping others do the same. “We’ve already implemented a number of environmentally friendly practices across the club,” Arsenal operations director Hywel Sloman said. “We will continue to use the power and reach of Arsenal to inspire our global communities and push each other towards a more sustainable future,” he added. In 2019 Arsenal finished joint-top in a BBC Sport Premier League sustainability table - produced in partnership with UN-backed Sport Positive Summit. “One year on, we are proud to build on the work we are already doing in this area and encourage positive climate action to our millions of supporters around the world,” the club said. “Football inspires so many of us around the world and there is a remarkable potential for the game to become greener, more climate-resilient and lead by example for millions of global fans,” said Lindita Xhaferi-Salihu, Sports for Climate Action Lead at UN Climate Change. Arsenal are the third British club to sign up to the framework after League Two side Forest Green Rovers and Hibernian in the Scottish Premiership.
