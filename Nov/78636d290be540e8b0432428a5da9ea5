Fifteen western Kenya legislators have pledged to support President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga's push for constitutional amendments. Led by National Assembly Majority Whip Emmanuel Wangwe, the MPs said they will promptly embark on the popularisation of the Building Bridges Initiative. “We will begin popularising the BBI report as we head to the weekend while observing measures announced by the government to fight the spread of Covid-19,” Wangwe said. The Navakholo representative urged other leaders campaigning for the report to strictly adhere to the Ministry of Health guidelines. On Wednesday, President Kenyatta suspended all political gatherings and rallies for 60 days in new measures to combat the second wave of Covid-19. The President said anyone wishing to hold such meetings should do so in town halls and observe all Covid-19 protocols. The ban came as politicians were gearing to hold rallies to popularise the BBI report ahead of a referendum next year. Wangwe said they support BBI because it will make the country a better place. Kanduyi's Wafula Wamunyiyi said they resolved to support the BBI process after consulting leaders and residents. “We resolved to unwaveringly commit ourselves to support the process,” he said at a press briefing in Nairobi. Also present at the briefing were Simiyu Eseli (Tongaren), Alfred Agoi (Sabatia), Florence Mutua (Busia Woman Rep), Raphael Wanjala (Budalang'i), Bernard Shinali (Ikolomani), Ayub Savula (Lugari), Petronilla Were (nominated senator) and Tindi Mwale (Butere). Wamunyinyi said they are developing strategies to effectively popularise BBI. “We urge residents of western Kenya to support President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga in their efforts to unite the country,” he said. -mwaniki fm
