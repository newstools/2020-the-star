Wazalendo will not rest on their laurels despite the postponement of the African Cup of Club Championship from next month to next year. Coach Fidelis Kimanzi said the postponement is to the advantage of the team as they will have more time to bond. "Irrespective of the time, we hope to use the event to  expose players and enhance their chances of donning the national team colours," he added. "Wazalendo are not seasoned participants but we want to keep improving from last year's second place finish in the league," he noted. Wazalendo took only two players to the Olympic Qualifiers last year in South Africa. However, in 2019, no Kenyan team participated in the Africa club show in Ismaila, Egypt due to financial problems. Blazers, USIU-Spartans (women)  Butali and Kenya Police (men) booked slots in the continental showpiece but failed to travel. 2017 was the last time Kenya men's team featured in the tourney that was held in Nairobi. Kimanzi, however, remains optimistic that his players will be fit and ready when the competition will be called. "We are facing difficult times and we are unable to train normally. We are a younger team  with less fitness issues but not to the levels the African competition demands. " Malawi, who were the hosts, confirmed through their social media page that the tournament has been pushed forward with new dates to be confirmed later.
