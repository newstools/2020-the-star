Kenya Harlequins have bolstered their roster for next season by signing internationals Joshua Chisanga and Emmanuel Mavala from Homeboyz RFC. Chisanga and Mavala rejoined the deejays last season after a year-long stint with Polish club RC Orkan Sochaczew. Speaking on Monday, Quins chairman Michael Wanjala said the duo will be a big boost to Ngong Road outfit, who missed out on the playoffs last year. "The two are quality players and will be a big boost for us. We are planning accordingly for the 2020/21 season as we look at ways of improving our performances from last season,” said Wanjlala. Quins finished ninth last season with 28 points, winning five and losing 11 matches in a lukewarm campaign. Chisanga and Mavala will join former teammate, Mark Wandeto, who signed for Quins in May. Wanjala said they hope to complete the signing of hooker Phillip Ikambili from Homeboyz by the end of this week alongside two players from United States International University (USIU) to create depth in the side as they seek to challenge on all fronts. He said despite the Ministry of Sports banning contact sports in the country, the club has been planning for the new season. "We can't rest on our laurels. We have to plan despite the challenges of Covid-19. The coaching team are looking forward to the start of the season and ensuring attention to details in all facets of play,” added Wanjala. Meanwhile, the club have renewed their partnership with Samurai Sportswear for all their official match-day, training and leisurewear in a three-year deal.
