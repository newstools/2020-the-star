Kwale Health department has been told to ensure maximum safety of medics after two health facilities in Mombasa near the common border were shut last week over Covid-19 fears. Deputy Governor Fatuma Achani said since most Mombasa hospitals are reportedly full, some residents of the neighbouring county are seeking medical services in Kwale. Achani spoke at Matuga Subcounty Hospital on Tuesday where she launched a gender-based-violence rescue centre. There has been a spike in Covid-19 cases in the Coast region. “I read in a newspaper that Likoni and Shika Adabu hospitals recorded some positive cases and it raised concern about our safety because the neighbours have been getting medical services in this side,”she said. This threatens the lives of both doctors and residents given that "Mombasa is considered one of the virus hot zones," the deputy governor said. The number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in Kwale since March is 212. Achani told county Health executive Francis Gwama to promptly supply doctors and nurses with their preferred personal protective equipment. “We must do our best to protect heath workers at Ng’ombeni, Waa, Matuga and Kwale health facilities,” she said. She asked residents to give the medics maximum cooperation in the combat against Covid-19. The best way of doing so was by observing Health ministry's protocols such as wearing masks in public places, washing hands and social distancing.  - mwaniki fm
