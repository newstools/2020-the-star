The main opposition leader in the concluded Tanzania elections Tundu Lissu has been arrested by authorities. According to his Chadema party, Lissu was arrested on Monday evening while outside the German Embassy. Lissu was the flagbearer for the Chadema party, which has accused Magufuli of sabotaging the rights of Tanzanians by rigging. He was expected to lead the thwarted demonstration on Monday against the elections, which he said were marred by rigging. Chadema demanded a repeat of the election. Incumbent president John Pombe Magufuli won the election with over 80 per cent of votes, securing his second term in office. Lissu's arrest comes hours after that of his Chadema counterpart Freeman Mbowe. Lissu had earlier confirmed Mboweâ€™s arrest and demanded his release. US Ambassador to Tanzania Donald J. Wright had raised concerns over the arrest of opposition leaders. J. Wright urged the Tanzanian government to ensure the safety and security of all opposition leaders, cease targeted arrests, release detainees, restore telecommunications, and afford due process under the law to all citizens. The same sentiments were shared by the US Secretary of State Department Mike Pompeo. Pompeo said that had asked authorities to fully address concerns of irregularities and will review allegations of the use of force against civilians.
