Kenya Morans camp got a huge morale booster following news that playmaker Grifin Ligare will link up with the team at the 2021 Fiba Africa AfroBasket qualifiers in Kigali, Rwanda. Kenya Basketball Federation (KBF) assistant secretary Ambrose Kisoi confirmed the playmaker had travelled to Kigali although he missed the team’s opener against Senegal last evening due to a mandatory 24-hour quarantine. “Yes, Griffo is traveling to join the team. He left at 11 am and should be able to be in the team’s line up for the second game tomorrow (Thursday) against Angola,” said Kisoi. Ligare will now replace Patriots’ Tom Wamukota, who is reportedly held up in Kinshasa, DR Congo where he had gone for a tournament following the conclusion of the Rwandese league. In addition, Kisoi said they are still keen to have Preston Bungei line up for his first national team assignment after a passport hitch. Meanwhile, France-based Joel Awich said he is now focusing on the second qualification tournament in February after missing the Kigali edition due to logistics. “My sights are set on February. I just need to handle logistics on my end well,” said Awich. Speaking from his base in France, the 6’7 centre said he did not get his regular work visa upon entry because things were unclear. “My temporary visa here in France was expiring and with the nation’s one-month lockdown, it would have been complicated to travel without one. So I just need to secure my long-stay visa,” he confided. Awich said it would have been an honour to play for the national team but noted that all is not lost. “Missing out is upsetting,” said Awich, who plays for French Division 1 side, Dax-Garmade. Awich is the son of former national team forward Lynette Awich, who played for Kenya at the 1986 AfroBasket in Maputo, Mozambique. She is based in USA. “My mom introduced me to the game and I would love to keep the family legacy alive. There are some big shoes to fill,” he said.
