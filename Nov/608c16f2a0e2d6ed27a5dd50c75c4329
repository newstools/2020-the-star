The Sh2.5 trillion Lapsset project could get additional funding if a promise by the National Assembly Committee on Finance and Planning goes through. Committee chairperson Gladys Wanga termed the new port as having the capacity to open up Northern Kenya to more trade and industrialisation. Speaking at the port site when the committee visited Lamu to assess the level of completion over the weekend, Wanga said the committee would push to ensure the port receives all the financial help required to enable speedy completion and full operation. “We will therefore cooperate in terms of finance in ensuring the Lamu port and its related infrastructure is completed and attains full operation,” Wanga said. The port, which is located at Kililana in Lamu West, has already registered completion of the first three berths that now await commissioning anytime. Wanga said the work at the site was impressive and termed the project as key in raising Kenya’s economic profile once complete and functional. The Lamu port will go down history as the first project of its kind to be solely financed by the Kenyan government without loans. “This is an infrastructure that will definitely trigger  more development in Lamu and the entire Northern Kenya Corridor as well as transform the lives of citizens in the region as a whole.The government is still fully committed to ensuring readiness for the commissioning,” Wanga said. The Lapsset regional manager said the Lamu port will be the second seaport in East Africa after Mombasa and will have the ability to dock larger ships and vessels. Wanga was accompanied by committee membersMPs Gichuhi Mwangi (Tetu), Qalicha Gufu Wario (Moyale) and Waihenya Ndirangu (Roysambu). The committee also inspected the Sh.10.8 Billion Lamu-Garsen road which is currently at a 70 per cent completion. Edited by Henry Makori
