A 14-year-old girl who was in April raped by two brothers in Hindi area in Lamu West has delivered twins. The KCPE candidate was allegedly lured into a relationship by one of the men who promised to help her family out of poverty. A visit to her boyfriend’s house at Jua Kali area in the town turned awry when the man together with his brother turned on her and raped her in turns. They threatened her into silence or she would pay with her life. On Wednesday, Lamu World Vision Education and Child Protection officer Schollar Mghoi confirmed that the girl had safely given birth to twins, a boy and a girl, at the Mokowe Hospital in Lamu West. “She delivered safely but they have been referred to King Fahad Hospital because it happened before her due date and so the babies are premature,” Mghoi said. A doctor at the King Fahad Hospital said the girl and the babies were in stable condition. The girl’s mother said all she wants is justice for her daughter as she is still traumatised by the rape ordeal. “The suspects were arrested but were released on bond. I am a widow, my husband died years ago. I am not in a position to take care of these babies. They should compel the men who did this to help me raise these children,” she said. Edited by Henry Makori
