Former Churchill Show comedian David Kagongo, alias David the Student, has tested positive for Covid-19. Announcing on Instagram, he said he started feeling sick last week on Friday and went for testing. "I got diagnosed with Covid-19. I am now on quarantine and I trust and believe I'll get through this." he wrote. "Thank you all for the support I've been receiving. Please stay safe. Wear a mask, wash your hands and social distance." This comes a few days after he was involved in an altercation with a racist white man at work as a taxi driver in the US. David requested him to put his mask back on but he took offence. He refused to put it on and called David a stupid n***.
