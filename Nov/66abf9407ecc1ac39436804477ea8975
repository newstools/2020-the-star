Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya has asked parents to monitor their children as part of efforts to contain rising cases of teen pregnancies. The governor faulted parents and guardians, saying they have neglected their duties. He said moral decadence has breached the traditional fabric, creating space for the vice to thrive. “If society takes up the matter and actively gets involved in instilling and maintaining our moral values, then our children’s future could successfully be salvaged,” Mvurya said. He spoke on Monday at Kwale Cultural Centre in Matuga subcounty. Kwale recorded a 70 per cent drop in the number of teen pregnancies, resulting in about 2,821 cases this year compared to 2019. Mvurya said the county can record zero cases if parents, the community and the county government all play their roles. He said the majority of residents have shirked their duties and left the burden to the teachers and the government. The governor said everyone has a role to play in ensuring schoolchildren don’t get recruited into bad companies. He warned the cases might rise unless parents seriously carry out their responsibilities without delegating them. “The situation may get out of control if we don’t jealously protect our children,” Mvurya said. He urged men to support women in parenting saying the job of raising children should not be left to mothers alone. Edited by P.O
