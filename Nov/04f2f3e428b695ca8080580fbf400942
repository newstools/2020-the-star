Safaricom and e-commerce leader Jumia have partnered to reward customers shopping on Jumia with a five per cent discount through the month of November. The discount will be available to all Jumia shoppers for transactions of Sh1,000 and above on M-Pesa with the discount redeemable for the first such three transactions starting 1st November 2020 to a maximum of Sh250 per transaction. “Throughout November you can save by shopping on Jumia. We are happy to partner with Safaricom to offer consumers using M-Pesa at checkout an extra five per cent off. Don’t forget the biggest deals will be exclusively on the Jumia App and we urge our consumers to download it for the best deals.” Jumia Kenya CEO Sam Chappatte said. Customers will automatically have the five per cent discount applied to their total shopping value once they choose M-Pesa as a payment option on both Jumia and Jumia Food. The offer will run for a six-week period beginning November 1st, 2020, with shoppers eligible for discounts for the first three transactions within the period. “ We are excited to partner with Jumia to reward online shoppers across the country for paying with M-Pesa, even as we continue to celebrate our 20th Anniversary,” Safaricom CEO Peter Ndegwa, Chief Executive Officer, Safaricom. The move comes as more customers and businesses have rushed to embrace online shopping on the back of the Covid-19 pandemic. The two firms are looking to cash in on the Black Friday rush that marks the start of the holiday shopping season with many businesses extending discounts to buyers. Jumia has emerged as the leading online shopping destination in the country hosting more than 10,000 businesses and attracting millions of shoppers every month.
