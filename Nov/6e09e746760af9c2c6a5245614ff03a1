MHC founder Dr Margaret Kagwe said about six million Kenyans suffer from common mental conditions, such as stress and anxiety, depression and substance abuse. "The negative psychological effects of Covid-19 have created a gap in coping with stress, which has inspired me to create Mental Health Champions to serve our communities,‚Äù she said.
