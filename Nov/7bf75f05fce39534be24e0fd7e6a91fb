Five married women who underwent FGM in Bomet county have been arrested in a crackdown by police aided by the public. The five, aged 22 to 27, were arrested following a tip-off by the public over suspicious activity  at a homestead in Kaplomboi village in Sotik, Area assistant chief Peter Tele told the press that he received a report of women who being cared for at the home of an old woman after they had been mutilated. Tele said the women confessed to having been forced by their husbands to undergo the cut. Otherwise, they could be divorced or kicked out of the house. FGM is illegal under all circumstances; child victims are not prosecuted but married women, parents, circumcisers, abettors and chiefs who stay silent are. Administrators can lose their jobs. A number of married women choose to undergo the cut because they are humiliated and ostracised for not being 'real women' without undergoing FGM. The administrator said the security team raided the home where they found the women, said to have been brought from Kaplong village, 30 kilometres away. “We arrested them all and took them to Ndanai police station where they are set to be interrogated before  necessary charges are against them,” Tele said. A caregiver fled and police were still searching for her. Sotik subcounty police commander Francis Nganga  said the women were to be arraigned following hospital reports on their status. “We are going to prefer charges against them…people must know that this is a criminal offence under our laws,” he said. The arrest of the five comes a year after a similar incident at Chepalungu where 10 women were arrested at Roborwo village. A circumciser was arrested. While there has been sensitisation on the dangers of FGM, the traditional practice is still carried out in secret. (Edited by V. Graham)
