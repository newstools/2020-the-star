A crackdown on the violators of Covid-19 mitigation protocols netted 122 people in various parts of Kisii on Tuesday. They were arrested for not wearing masks and drinking after curfew hours, county police commander Jebel Ngere said. “We arrested 122 suspects found contravening Covid safety protocols. Among them were those without masks and revellers found leaving bars past the curfew hours,” Jebel said. He appealed to the public to strictly observe the regulations to avoid arrest. "The regulations are for your own safety,” he said. President Uhuru Kenyatta imposed a 10pm-4am nationwide curfew a week ago following a surge in Covid-19 cases. Bars are required to close at 9pm to allow revellers to get home before the curfew starts. Inspector-General of Police Hillary Mutambayi warned those flouting the regulations risk a fine of Sh20,000 on the spot. County commissioner Abdirisack Jaldesa expressed alarm that the number of those flouting Covid-19 regulations was on the increase. He said wearing masks was mandatory in public places, so are social distancing and washing and sanitising of hands. Jaldesa, who co-chairs the County Response Emergency team with Governor James Ongwae, said security officers will intensify patrols in the nine sub-counties to ensure that normalcy is back.
