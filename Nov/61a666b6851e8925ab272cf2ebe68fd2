Deputy President William Ruto has called for the inclusion of a Covid-19 cover for the four million Kenyans on the ordinary NHIF package. This follows the Treasury's announcement of the inclusion of the cover for civil servants on the enhanced package. Ruto took to Twitter on Wednesday and said, "With the ravaging pandemic, as Government of Kenya, we should channel resources to NHIF to enhance the other 4M ordinary members' cover. Health care workers must be given special attention." On Monday, the Teachers Service Commission announced its medical scheme would cover Covid-19. Ruto lauded TSC for the bold step taken to protect its members from the pandemic. Ruto on Tuesday said that NHIF should emulate the step taken by the teachersâ€™ employer. He said that NHIF should offer a similar cover to its members, especially students who are set to resume school. Last week, Health CS Mutahi Kagwe and NHIF CEO Peter Kamunyo said it is expensive and unsustained for the NHIF and private insurance firms to foot the bills. "It is not practical for NHIF and private insurance companies to cover pandemics," Kagwe said. The CS, however, said that the government has come in handy to subsidise and write off treatment costs for poor Kenyans unable to pay their bills.
