The government has said that the moratorium on logging in public and community forests which was imposed in 2018 shall continue. Environment CS Kerioako Tobiko said in a statement on Monday the decision was reached after considering recommendations of both the Board of Management of the Kenya Forest Service (KFS) and the Multi-Agency Team on Mapping. However, the CS said that the moratorium shall be modified to allow for harvesting and disposal by KFS of mature and over-mature forest plantations for an area not exceeding 500 hectares. Tobiko said that harvesting and disposal of the forest plantation material shall be overseen by a multi-agency team and done in a manner that is transparent and ensures value for money. The CS added that the details of particulars of the forest areas to be harvested and the terms and conditions applicable shall be published in due course. In June 2020, Chief Conservator of Forests Julius Kamau had asked heads of conservancies and ecosystem conservators to release foresters to train in Londiani. The foresters, the letter said, were to be trained on independent mapping, verification, and valuation of mature forest plantations in the country by a multi-agency team.
