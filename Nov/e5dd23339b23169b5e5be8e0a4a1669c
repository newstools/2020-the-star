Chief Justice David Maraga took the opportunity to address President Uhuru Kenyatta during his last official function, saying he has nothing personal against the Head of State. " To our President, wherever you are, it is clear that there is a difference of opinion between me and you. But I want to assure you, and the entire nation, that I have nothing personal against you," he said. "To the contrary, as you know Mr. President, I have given you respect as our Head of State. Why would I want to fight you, as some people are suggesting? I am apolitical and I hold no brief for any politician. The Security and the Intelligence Services can assure you of that; and I am sure they have assured you of that." Speaking on Friday during the launch of the State of Judiciary and Administration of the Justice Report said it was a wonder how he has managed to achieve a lot as the CJ despite difficult circumstances like the interference and frustration of the Judiciary and disobedience of court orders. He said that after the Supreme Court nullified the 2017 presidential elections, Uhuru is on record saying he will revisit the matter and true to his word, the Judiciary budget was reduced substantially in 2018. According to him, it's a miracle that they have managed to deliver justice in such circumstances. He commended judges and magistrates for reducing caseÂ backlog to 617,582 as at June 2020. He anticipates that this will be cleared in the next two years. "Despite the challenges I beseech the judges and magistrates to continue dispensing justice. I am very proud of you and remember that the Judiciary plays a critical role in the political stability of the country. "As I exit in the next few days I want to assure Kenyans that I leave behind a solid Judiciary. The Judiciary should be allocated at least three per cent of the national budget, the CJ said. The annual allocation for projects should be between Sh5 billion to Sh10 billion, he said.
