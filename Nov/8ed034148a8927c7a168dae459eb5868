Before he became a household name, comedian MC Jessy was a homeless boy in Nairobi, who had to hustle his way up. Speaking during the Bonga Na Jalas live show, the comedian narrated how he relocated to the city after completing his secondary education. "I used to sleep at the Sunbird bus stop in the storeroom, where loads are kept," he said. He bumped into an old classmate, who turned out to be the son of an MP at the time, and moved to his friend’s family residence in the leafy suburbs of Kileleshwa. "I prepared breakfast for them in my first visit at their home and the MP liked it a lot," he said. According to the comedian, the MP liked him and decided to keep him as the houseboy. "I could not leave the comfort of the house and decided to stay beyond the end of my visit. Before I knew it, I was a houseboy at Ebony apartment in Kileleshwa," he said. In an earlier confession, Jessy also said he used to do Nameless’ hair before he got into comedy, adding that Nameless used to give him clothes. "At one point in my life when I had two to three T-shirts to wear, this man @Namelesskenya allowed me to raid his closet and pick anything I wanted," he wrote. "I used to be mtu wa mkono for this good friend of mine Juvinaris Chalo (extreme left). We used to go and roll dredi za Nameless and that’s where we knew each other." MC Jessy met Churchill in a toilet and talked and was later hired to host Churchill Raw, where he built his brand. "We met in a toilet. I told him I wanted to go back to Meru a different person and change the lives and mindsets of young people. Churchill and I brought the best event in Meru," he said. "God has used him to be a blessing to us. We honour him like that. Personally, he has changed my life in a major way."
