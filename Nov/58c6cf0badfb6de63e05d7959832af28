Zablon Kathurima is mentally challenged. On October 2  at 8pm, he left their house in Jomvu, Changamwe in Mombasa. He hasn't been seen since then. His uncle told the Star the family has informed authorities that Zablon could be at Kwale Children’s home. He wasn't there. Zablon, 17, is an orphan and lives with his uncle Stanley Marete. He is a firstborn and his only sibling, a brother, is also developmentally challenged. Marete told the Star his nephew had left home at 8pm and disappeared. The family didn't really understand him and his ways. Their frustration and pain are there every day. They have walked around all of Changamwe, Kongowea, Miritini, and Jomvu. Nothing. The family reported the matter to Changamwe police station on October 23 under OB number 11/23/10/2020. “You know with his mental condition, there is no way you would tell where he went. It has been tiringly frustrating,” Marete said. The fact that he went missing at night made the problem worse. “It was night and so not even neighbours saw him going wherever he went,” his uncle said. It was not the first time that Zablon has gone missing, the uncle said. Unlike his younger brother who is equally challenged,  it is common for Zablon to just go missing but he wouldn't go far. He would be found in hours or a day. The family has someone watch over him. This day, they seem to have let their guard down. The worst happened. The uncle is going to Kwale Children's home today but why didn't the home call him. "We may say with certainty that we have found him only tomorrow (today) when I go there and see him with my eyes," he said. It is also not clear how the boy could have found his way to the neighbouring county. If you have a missing person, share your story with us via missingpersons@the-star.co.ke  (Edited by V. Graham)
