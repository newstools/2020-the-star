@itsetyang No more long treks for water every day, no more filthy Lake Turkana water, no more crocodile attacks. Residents of Lobolo village and pupils of Lobolo Primary School in Turkana Central are benefiting from a Sh1.2 million borehole drilled by the Maisha Project. About 5,000 people will benefit. Many residents had been trekking more than two kilometres every day to draw dirty water from the lake for domestic use and for livestock. Crocodiles lurk near the shore and people have been attacked. Beatrice Williamson, the founder of the US Maisha Project, said the borehole will also supply Lobolo Primary School and a health facility. "We have handed over the borehole to help transform the region," Williamson said on Monday at Lobolo village. “I believe everything good begins with clean water for good health and this will create the ability for children to study,” she said. Williamson urged the community to take good care of the borehole and urged well-wishers to help drill more boreholes. Nominated MCA Mathew Allany said residents have been facing a shortage of clean water for many years and the borehole will help greatly. “For schoolchildren and others, the borehole will reduce the risks of attacks by crocodiles in the lake" he said. Allany said leaders would work with the county to partner with the Maisha Project to upgrade the system and instal water pipes to the school, health facility and community. Pastoralist David Ekitela said the borehole will help the community feed their animals and stay health with clean water at home. (Edited by V. Graham)
