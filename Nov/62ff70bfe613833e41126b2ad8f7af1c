The University of Nairobi will on Monday reopen for freshers taking science-based courses, postgraduate students undertaking practical research projects and learners with disability. The institution, in a notice to students and posted on Twitter, requires first-year students taking science-based courses from the College of Agriculture and Veterinary Sciences and the College of Health Sciences to report on November 9. Those taking Architecture and Engineering, those in the College of Biological and Physical Sciences and those in the College of Education and External Studies are also expected to report. In October, institutions were allowed to reopen progressively, under strict conformity with the Health ministry guidelines on the prevention of Covid-19. Education CS George Magoha announced that universities could begin reopening for in-person learning, but only if they comply with health guidelines and Covid-19 protocols. These requirements include monitoring of the body temperature for all learners and all other persons accessing the institutions and observance of high levels of hygiene. Institutions are also required to uphold guidelines on physical and social distancing and the use of face masks or shields. “The Ministry of Education will commence with the reopening of universities and tertiary institutions with effect from Monday, October 5, 2020,” Magoha said. The CS also allowed university councils and their senates to decide and announce classroom learning for students in other academic years. Consideration was to be given to those undertaking science-based courses.
