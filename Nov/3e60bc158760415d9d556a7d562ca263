Three children cheated death after they were attacked by a vicious huge crocodile in the flooded Lake Baringo on Friday. Sabato Tiren-10, Kemboi Tumaa 12, and Betty Lowar 14 from one family are currently recuperating at the County Referral Hospital-Kabarnet. “The children were fetching water at the volatile lakeshore before the crocodile attacked” Lake Baringo game warden Jackson Komen said. The afternoon incident occurred at the swollen lake near Airstrip, a few meters from Kampi ya Samaki town. The lakes were flooded owing to heavy rains since April. “It started attacking the younger boy-Sabato and then injured the two while helping to rescue their brother,” Komen said. He said people heard the children screaming before rushing to rescue them. They were taken to Marigat Sub-County hospital for first aid, adding that they were in stable condition. However, Sabato who was seriously bitten on his right leg was referred to Kabarnet Hospital for further treatment. The County Referral Hospital medical superintendent Charles Maswai confirmed that Lesabato is also in stable condition. “We have managed to stabilize the wounds and the boy is recuperating well," Maswai said. Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) Warden-Baringo Peter Lekeren noted increased cases of human-wildlife conflicts in the swollen water lakes. He regretted that this year alone the county registered five deaths, 38 injuries of snakebites, crocodiles, and hippos. The warden attributed the upsurge attacks by crocodiles and hippos to the rising water levels in the past six months, warning the residents to be on alert. Komen said the most affected are children fetching water or livestock quench their thirst. He urged the locals living along the lake shores to be extra careful calling upon the parents to take care of their children and avoid sending them alone to fetch water. Ends
