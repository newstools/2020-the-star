A man found in possession of bhang hidden in his underwear has been sentenced to one year imprisonment after he pleaded guilty. Ramadhan Said alias Resco was arraigned before Makadara principal magistrate Stephen Jalang'o on Wednesday. He was accused of being in possession of cannabis on November 24. The court was told that the drug had a street value of Sh1,500. Ramadhan was arrested at Kiambiu slums within Kamukunji subcounty in Nairobi by police officers who were patrolling the area at night. Upon search they were able to recover the two roles of bhang hidden inside his underpants. When the chargers were read to him by the court clerk, Ramadhan pleaded guilty. He said that he was only tasked to sell the bhang upon which he was to be paid a small fee. While delivering the judgement, Jalang’o said that the accused person was not remorseful for the offence. “Having pleaded guilty to the offence, I hereby sentence you to a one year imprisonment or pay a fine of Sh50,000,” he ruled.
