Two days after the launch of the collection of signatures for the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) by President Uhuru Kenyatta and his handshake partner Raila Odinga, Malava MP Malulu Injendi has made a U-turn and declared his full support for the BBI. Malulu, who was initially opposed to the BBI, addressed the press at the CDF office in Malava on Friday, declaring his full support to the process in the company of all the members of county assembly from Malava constituency. The MP who was elected on a Jubilee ticket is a supporter of Deputy President William Ruto. The legislator said his decision had been informed after realising that important issues had been taken into consideration in the amendments. “We have had a meeting with all the elected leaders from this constituency and have all agreed that we shall throw our support behind the BBI," he said. "This is after noticing that the amendments that have been made and revealed during the launch of signature collection are good for the people of Malava and Kenyans as a whole." Injendi said the initial document wanted to scrap the constituency development fund, which he was opposed to. He added that the document had also factored in the cry of Malava residents who "have always wanted the vast constituency divided into two constituencies". “We have been getting Sh135 million per year but now with two constituencies, we would get Sh270 million..." The legislator urged Kenyans to overwhelmingly support the process. Kevin Mahelo, the MCA for Butali-Chegulo, who was also elected on Jubilee ticket stated that, “Money coming directly to the ward level without going through the County executive is a very imperative factor for development on the ground and for that BBI should be supported.”
