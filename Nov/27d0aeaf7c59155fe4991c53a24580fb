 The Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organisation is promoting the use of non-chemical pesticides to shield consumers from excessive chemical residues in food products. The move is also aimed at protecting the environment. They are urging farmers to use organic pest control methods including neem leaf sprays and sound agricultural practices such as rotation. Kalro scientists Violet Kirigua and Agnes Ndegwa told reporters in Kirinyaga on Friday excessive use of chemicals was also eating into farmers' profits besides posing grave dangers to human health. They said poor incomes were demoralising growers and threatening food security. Kalro is working on a situation where chemical pest control would be the last resort after bio-friendly methods are established to have failed. The two scientists spoke after taking a group of 60 farmers, agricultural extension officers and agro-vet operators through a tomato demo farm after a week-long training on how to get higher benefits from the tomato value chain. The farmers and officers from Kajiado, Mandera and Garissa will be expected to teach their colleagues on best methods of managing their tomato crops, including how to get more value from the tomato fruit. The training is among several being held by Kalro and county governments' under the World Bank-funded Kenya Climate-Smart Agriculture Project (KSCAP). The project focuses on sharing innovations, technologies and management practices in farming. The aim is to increase productivity, enhance farmers' resilience and reduce greenhouse emissions. Farmer Gabow Hassan Aden from Garissa said farming in the hot semi-arid region has been fraught with a myriad of challenges that include a lack of seeds specially developed for such hot areas. He said their crops also tend to earn low prices during peak seasons. He said value addition techniques learned during the training will help them make more money from their produce.  Edited by P.O
