A 39-year-old woman is believed to have committed suicide on Friday because of her brother's arrest at Kombani, Kwale county. The woman was hanging by a leso. She did not leave a suicide note. The mother of four is said to have been stressed following the arrest of her brother who is remanded at Shimo La Tewa prison in Mombasa.  Her brother was the breadwinner. County police commander Joseph Nthenge confirmed the incident. “She killed herself using a piece of cloth that was tied on the ceiling,” Nthenge. The police report indicates that there were no other physical injuries except the bruises made by the leso on her neck. A close relative said her 16-year-old daughter found the body. The body was taken to Kwale Subcounty Hospital mortuary.
