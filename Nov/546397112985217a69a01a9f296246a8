The government has raised serious concern over the increased number of Kenyans traveling out of the country with the fake Covid 19 clearance certificates. Health CS Mutahi Kagwe decried a new approach where some unscrupulous individuals are attempting to travel out of the country without genuine covid 19 certificates. Kagwe was speaking in Malindi on Friday, confirming that the country recorded 1,554 new positive cases of the virus in the last 24 hours. ''When we opened our space in August we developed protocols to govern all players in the international travel sector. Many of our stakeholders have complied with these protocols but we have lately noted a trend where some people are trying to cheat the system,'' he said, This comes hours after 17 passengers were arrested at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) after being found in possession of fake Covid-19 clearance certificates. The arrests come after the United Arab Emirates listed Kenya among 13 countries slapped with a visa ban due to coronavirus. UAE is said to have taken the action after speculations that some of the passengers from Kenya are presenting fake clearance letters upon arrival in Dubai. The CS added that many people have been arrested and have already been taken to court. He said the port health officials are on high alert and anyone found contravening the protocols will face the law. ''Already many have been arrested and charged in court . I urge travelers not to play with the law only to become part of the statistics."
