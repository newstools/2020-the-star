A remandee was shot dead Sunday morning as he tried to escape from Bungoma prison. He was in the company of another prisoner who was arrested. The two fled in different directions. Bungoma South police boss Wilson Nanga said 25-year-old Caleb Masinde who was arrested over a rape case, was confronted by prison warders as he was scaling the perimeter wall. "Masinde was rearrested by a prison warder who was on patrol as he tried to scale the perimeter wall so that he could jump over," Nanga said. The second remandee, Douglas Khaoya, managed to jump over the perimeter fences and the police gave chase. He was being held in connection with a murder case. Nanga said Khaoya defied orders by police officers and ran towards Bungoma High School, where he was fatally shot on a napier grass farm. "After jumping over the fence, Kahoya was spotted by a sentry officer who told him to stop but he refused. The police were forced to shoot him at a farm near the school," he said. Nanga said the body has been taken to Bungoma County Referral Hospital mortuary. He said the area DCI boss was dealing with the case to establish the motive of the escape.
