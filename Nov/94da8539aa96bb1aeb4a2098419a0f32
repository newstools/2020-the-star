Chief Justice David Maraga has again faulted President Uhuru Kenyatta for not swearing in 41 judges as ordered by the court. Maraga, who retires on January 12, 2021, said the President should swear in the judges. He spoke on Friday during the launch of the State of Judiciary and Administration of the Justice Report. It was his last last official function. Maraga said he has managed to achieve a lot as the CJ despite difficult circumstances like the interference and frustration of the Judiciary and disobedience of court orders. He said that after the Supreme Court nullified the 2017 presidential elections, Uhuru is on record saying he will revisit the matter and true to his word, the Judiciary budget was reduced substantially in 2018. According to him, it's a miracle that they have managed to deliver justice in such circumstances. He commended judges and magistrates for reducing caseÂ backlog to 617,582 as at June 2020. He anticipates that this will be cleared in the next two years. "Despite the challenges I beseech the judges and magistrates to continue dispensing justice. I am very proud of you and remember that the Judiciary plays a critical role in the political stability of the country. "As I exit in the next few days I want to assure Kenyans that I leave behind a solid Judiciary. The Judiciary should be allocated at least three per cent of the national budget, the CJ said. The annual allocation for projects should be between Sh5 billion to Sh10 billion, he said. Maraga said there was no bad blood between hin and the President - "only difference in opinion." He added: "... it is clear that we have different opinions but I want to assure you (President) I have nothing personal against you."
