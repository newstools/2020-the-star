Kisumu journalists have called for police to act against one of  Education CS George Magoha's bodyguards whom they accuse of assault. People Daily photographer Viola Kosome and Nation's media's Ondari Ogega raised the alarm after being assaulted by the bodyguard on Thursday. CS Magoha was inspecting desks at Kosawo Primary School with journalists invited to cover the function. According to Kisumu Journalist Network chairman Rushdie Oudia, Ondari accidentally bumped into the bodyguard - whose name is yet to be identified - and apologised. However, Oudia says, as Ondari made his way out of the classroom, the CS’s bodyguard followed him and reached for his fly before squeezing his genitals and threatening to do more outside the classroom. "In the same classroom, the said officer also grabbed Viola's bottom and pushed her to give way for the CS," he said. The bodyguard, whose photo was captured by journalists according to Oudia, is said to have harassed another journalist in Vihiga inserting his fingers into his mouth. "The network would like to condemn in the strongest words possible the attack and consequent actions by one of the bodyguards," he said. Oudia said the incidents have not only instilled fear among journalists, but also amounts to sexual assault and suppression of the freedom of the press as enshrined in Articles 33 and 34 of the Constitution. "As journalists in this region, we take this incident with great concern, and shock especially with the utter irresponsibility and daring face the officer went on with his harassment in broad daylight and in the presence of the CS," he said. " KJN takes this opportunity to draw the attention of the CS Magoha, Inspector General of Police Hillary Mutyambai and the Minister for Interior Fred Matiang'í to take action against the said rogue officer with itchy fingers."
