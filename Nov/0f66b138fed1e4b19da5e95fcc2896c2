A strong start and defensive resilience will be key to Kenya national football team, Harambee Stars chances of success away in Moroni on Sunday for the return leg fixture against plucky Comoros. Captain Victor Wanyama said in the wake of the 1-1 stalemate against the Islanders, Stars will need create chances and impregnate in defence to make it count. “We have to be strong defensively because if we play the way we played in the second half we will create many chances to score and get the result we want,” said Wanyama. Experienced shot-stopper Arnold Origi concurred with the team captain, reiterating the importance of starting strongly. “We know our capability but we will need to show it from very early on like we did in the last five minutes of the first half, and the entire second half. That way, I believe we will get a positive result,” he said. Stars will be monitoring keenly what happens in Saturday’s clash between their group rivals Egypt and Togo before they take on surprise leaders Comoros. After three matches, Kenya have three points two less than Comoros.
