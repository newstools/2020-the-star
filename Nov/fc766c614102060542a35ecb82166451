Police in Mwea, Kirinyaga county, have launched a manhunt for a man suspected of killing his ex-wife. Simon Tama allegedly stabbed his estranged wife Beth Karimi after a domestic row and inflicted serious injuries on her. She was pronounced dead on arrival at Karira Hospital in Wang’uru. Murinduko chief Joseph Kariuki told the Star by phone that Karimi had sued Tama for assault. The court case was ongoing. Elsewhere, a family in Busnia village in Mwea East has appealed for help to retrieve the body of a child who drowned in River Thiba last week. The family said seven-year-old Simon Mwangi slipped and fell into the swollen river while fishing with a friend. “We have been camping by this river daily and with the help of area residents we have attempted to search for the body to no avail. The raging waters have been the greatest hindrance,” a relative said. The family has urged local leaders and well-wishers to send divers to help in searching and retrieving the body. In November last year, another boy drowned in the river that feeds the Mwea Tebere rice irrigation scheme. Six-year-old Nicholas Macharia was swept by the waters while playing with his friends. His body is yet to be recovered.  (edited by o. owino)
