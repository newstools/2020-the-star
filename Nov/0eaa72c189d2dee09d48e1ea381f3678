Nadia Mukami fell in love during her mid-campus years, only to find out the man was cheating on her with a light-skinned girl. This put her off dating. In an interview with Mseto East Africa, she said she was born to a military mother and a journalist father, who brought her up in strict discipline. She said she remembers her father’s advice to her about boys before going into campus. It so happens that most girls in her extended family fell victim to early pregnancies and dropped out of school, but her dad wanted her to be the exception. "Since I had excelled in high school and got a scholarship into university without falling pregnant, my dad was so proud of me. He sat me down and told me; 'Jichunge sana, sitaki aibu'." Nadia met her first and only boyfriend, who taught her lessons for life. "I deeply loved someone who I found out was not dating me alone. On that fateful day, as I was escorting him home, we drive past one light-skin lady by the road and he quickly asks the driver to speed off, but it is like the lady noticed me," she said. "I was shocked beyond words and that is the last time I ever dated. It will take Jesus and angels for me to date again. I’m just not ready," Nadia said. "I have already been hurt. Yes, I have moved on, but I haven’t healed." Nadia was recently said to be dating Arrow Bwoy, but the singer explained that when rumours started going around about their relationship, they decided to ride the wave to push their music. "He's an amazing friend. We tried dating but it didn't work," she said. "I am single and working on my business, Arrow Bwoy and I never dated. What happened was that a blogger wrote the story and we just decided to run with it, we used it to push our music," she said. Edited by T Jalio
