Construction of Wang'uru Stadium in Mwea, Kirinyaga county, is on course, county commissioner Jim Njoka has assured. He equally expressed optimism that the Sh300 million project will be completed in six months. "I’m satisfied with the progress. The contractor has managed to complete 40 per cent of the project and we expect by April 13, 2021, the work will be done," Njoka said during an inspection tour. Works started in August this year. This followed President Uhuru Kenyatta’s directive during his visit to the county in February. Though not revealing the sitting capacity, Njoka said once completed, the stadium will be a 24-hour facility. It will host local, national and regional sporting events, as well as other activities. The administrator urged other contractors working on various government projects in Kirinyaga to emulate the contractor by fast-tracking their assignments. He at the same time appealed to residents to take precautions following a surge in the Covid-19 infection. He warned of an ongoing crackdown on those defying the government's Covid control directives, saying 128 people in the county have been arrested. “Everyone must take individual responsibility by following all the laid-out Ministry of Health protocols. We will enforce in full force the President’s directive by ensuring no service is delivered to defiant wananchi."
