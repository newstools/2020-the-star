Slum Frames on Saturday held a kids' film production at Mathare 4A. The films by the Wakanda and Transform groups are creative and informative contents developed and produced by children. “Amid the Covid-19 pandemic, we have seen huge numbers of teenagers getting pregnant, engaging in drug abuse and crime. With this initiative, we provide them with tasks and classes to keep them active and safe," said Jacob Onyango, who’s the founder. Speaking during the production, Evans Onyango alias Spartan, said they are teaching children how to apply creative film makeup. “Locals have received us so well and we aim to make the society a better place.”
