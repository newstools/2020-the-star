President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto both agreed there should be a consensus on the Building Bridges Initiative report. The two said this was important because it would prevent the country from being divided as we debate amendments to our Constitution. But when we begin to politicise issues in the BBI report, we get the country divided. So if the top leaders can guide us into a consensus building process, it would be the best way to deal with the proposals in the report. We should not go to a referendum divided. Of course there are those leaders who are saying if their demands are not met, they will oppose the document. There is nothing wrong with that because they are expressing their views. Leadership requires that in the midst of all the voices that one is hearing, you make sense of it and give direction. The people at the top should listen to what the people are saying and give direction without taking a very firm stance whether they support or oppose the proposals. Leaders should make sense out of what is being said and give direction so that we don't fall into the trap of just making noise and misleading the public. Before embarking on consensus building, all the contentious issues should be identified first. The key contentious issues will determine the route to consensus building. The issues that people are raising will be key in this process. This will determine if the individuals raising the issues would be called for discussions or if there would a need for a nationwide consultation on the contentious matters. At this point in time, I cannot say what is the best way to address the contentious issues because people are still raising and pointing out problems. The country first needs to identify all areas that people have problems with. It is only then that we can know how to move forward.
