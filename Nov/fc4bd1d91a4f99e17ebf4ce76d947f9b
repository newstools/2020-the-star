President Uhuru Kenyatta in his seventh State of the Nation address has been able to capture some of the things he has achieved. It was a good speech because it gives us hope. We are in a state of worry as a country. People are worried that we are not going in the right direction. The reason for this is that the effects of Covid-19 are too heavy on them. People cannot tell if they will feed their families tomorrow. Talking about what we have achieved in this situation and what we are likely to achieve going into the future, given the steps he has taken, is good. As a leader, it gives me a platform on which to talk to the people, assuring them that their concerns have been heard. I was able to relate with the speech very well given what I have seen on the ground. I also liked the issue of security and the Building Bridges Initiative, having had the opportunity to observe the elections in the US. There is no solution to our problems outside our boundaries. In the US, people also have their problems and they can be even worse. We have to get our homegrown solution and BBI provides us with that opportunity. It is up to this generation to do what is best for the future generation. The President also said any economic ideas or proposals do not have a meaning if they do not have tangible impacts on the lives of the people. There are many economic policies being implemented and tried but we can only ask people for patience because their impacts will come later. People are however hungry and they cannot feed on the promises. We must nonetheless be able to keep people hopeful. Remember in the last administration, when we were in this situation, the government came up with the economic stimulus package. This administration has also done that but we need a little bit more.
