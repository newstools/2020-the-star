The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission has opposed the call by governors to be exonerated from collective responsibility in acts of corruption detected in their administrations. Through the Council of Governors, the county bosses sought the removal of collective criminal responsibility in the management of county resources. They wanted to be incorporated in the BBI report, the proposal that anti-graft agencies apply the principle of personal criminal culpability. EACC boss Twalib Mbarak said such a law would give immunity to some of the main perpetrators of corruption and economic crimes. “This would hence promote impunity in Kenya,” he said in a statement to the press on Friday. Mbarak said from the commission’s experience in conducting investigations, the provision may shield the county bosses whom he say are good at concealing their role when engaging in the graft. “Our investigations have demonstrated the modus operandi of several governors to conceal their role when engaging in corrupt conduct.” “This includes issuing verbal instructions to junior employees, intimidation and eventually receiving benefits through proxies,” Mbarak said. He said that due to the concerns, the EACC will not support any move that excuses governors from collective criminal responsibility. “Corruption is a white-collar crime committed by government and business professionals. It is well planned, executed and characterized by deceit and concealment,” the anti-graft boss added. He restated that “responsibility for crime has both elements of personal and collective culpability.” EACC has cautioned the BBI proponents against considering the proposal by governors to remove the element of collective criminal responsibility. The agency wants “legislative reforms that will go a long way in strengthening the institution and the laws and not those that will erode the gains made so far.”
