A Meru MCA has urged his colleagues to stop whining over a meeting with Interior CS Fred Matiang'i in Nairobi to discuss miraa market. Meru leaders, led by Kiraitu Murungi and Igembe South MP Maoka Maore, last week met Matiang'i and discussed how to reopen the miraa market in Somalia. The meeting was attended by some MCAs and farmers. Those who did not attend are grumbling about their exclusion. But Majority leader Victor Karithi (Athwana) said people should stop throwing tantrums “Some MCAs attended but it was not possible to accommodate all of us in the assembly and we should not read too much out of nothing. We should not be like cry babies,” Karithi said. He said some leaders were using miraa as a sideshow for 2022 politics. Karithi said it is important for Meru farmers to get a market for miraa regardless of who comes up with it. “It is not important who met Matiangi and who did not,” he said. The MCA said the Building Bridges Initiative report should be devoid of politics. Karithi said the report is good, citing the proposal for increased allocation to counties. “BBI is also good as it has outlined a willingness to fight graft. It has so many good things but all issues cannot be adequately addressed as it is a policy framework.”
