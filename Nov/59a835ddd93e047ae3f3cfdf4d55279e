Media personality Adelle Onyango says she hated her body for years after she was raped in 2008, while leaving a house party. "I am so proud of the intentional work I’ve done to get to a point of loving my body," she captioned an Instagram pic of herself in a bikini. "I think at the time, parts of it reminded me of getting raped… the scars. Then came eczema with its own scars, as if to mock me. "I’ve been a swimmer all my life and I loved it! So I hid it – tights, long sleeves, double sleeves, don’t swim, the works! I hardly looked at it." "But right now, I respect and honor the divinity in this body. It’s carried me through battlefields and continues to do so to date. Here’s to intentional healing. It’s hard. It takes time. I’m not all the way there. But it really is the gateway to freedom!"
