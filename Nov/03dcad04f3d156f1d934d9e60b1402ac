Kenya Airways is set to flag off the first direct cargo flight to the UAE on Wednesday from the Moi International Airport. In attendance will be Mombasa Governor Ali Hassan Joho and KQ CEO Allan Kilavuka, among other delegates. Meanwhile, Qatar Airways announced it has expanded its interline agreement with Kenya Airways to cover 43 destinations across the continent via its 14 weekly flights to and from Nairobi. The agreement with KQ will provide two local connections to Mombasa and Kisumu. Qatar Airways operates 41 international connections across the continent, including Abidjan, Ivory Coast; Antananarivo, Madagascar; Bamako, Mali; and Monrovia, Liberia. The flag off comes as the United Arab Emirates last week suspended the issuance of new visas to visitors from Kenya and 11 other countries. The other countries include; Pakistan, Iran, Yemen, Syria, Somalia, Iraq, Turkey, Afghanistan, Syria and Libya. However, only Pakistan appeared to confirm the news through reports in its media quoting government officials. The Pakistan Foreign Affairs Ministry said the suspension will not affect those with already issued visas. It is not clear what categories of Visa were also affected by this directive from the UAE.
