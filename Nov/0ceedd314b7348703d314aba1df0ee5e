The recruitment of 236 village administrators in Bungoma county is in limbo after members of a civil society group moved to court to challenge its legality. Barasa Nyukuri and Raphael Were of Torch Africa on Monday filed a petition at the Labour court in Kisumu seeking to stop the process. They said the move is unconstitutional. They argued that the wage bill in the county government is at 54 per cent, which is much higher than the 35 per cent recommended under the Public Finance Management Act. "We will not allow the county government to operate without following due process even if many people have applied to be village administrators," Nyukuri said. He also said the boundaries had not been delineated, while the county government has failed to employ 463 casuals as ordered by a Kakamega court in June this year. The Labour court had ordered that the casuals be absorbed and paid overdue allowances. The 463 casual labourers have been serving the county government under different positions without official contracts and some without pay. The county was directed to pay the workers their outstanding salaries within two months of the date of the ruling. "There is no budget allocation to employ village administrators, some boundaries have not been delineated based on the law, no scheme of service and policy guidelines for advertised jobs," Nyukuri said. He said the county government should first pay their dues and confirm the casuals who have not been paid since 2014.
