Ethiopia prime Minister Abiy Ahmed Ali has sent a message of encouragement to Ethiopians over the current state of security in the country. Hundreds have died in Ethiopia since the fighting began, with reports of a civilian massacre emerging this week. According to reports by BBC, rockets fired towards the cities of Bahir Dar and Gondar, in the state of Amhara - whose forces have been fighting with the federal government's against Tigray. An Ethiopian government official said one rocket hit the airport in Gondar and partially damaged it, while a second fired simultaneously landed just outside of the airport in Bahir Dar. The Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) said it had targeted two sites in the Amhara region on Friday and warned of further strikes. In a statement on Sunday, Prime Minister Abiy said government's endeavors to uphold the rule of law is 'progressing well'. Justice will prevail,. Ethiopia will prevail. By advancing rule of law and holding accountable those that have been looting, destabilizing Ethiopia, we will lay the foundation for lasting peace and harmony," Abiy said. "Those who are committing crimes against humanity and peace will be held accountable. We remain steadfast in our resolve to justice and the rule of law." This comes as the conflict in Ethiopia seem to be pouring into neighboring countries. On Sunday morning, reports by local media indicated that rockets were fired from the restive Tigray region of Ethiopia across the border at the capital of Eritrea. Explosions were heard in Asmara as several rockets landed on the outskirts of the city but there were no immediate reports of injuries. Tigray's ruling party, which is locked in a conflict with Ethiopia's federal government, had threatened an attack. Prime Minister Abiy, awarded the Nobel Peace Prize last year for sweeping political reforms, faces the sharpest consequences yet of the country’s recent shifts in power.
