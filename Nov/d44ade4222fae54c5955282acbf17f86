Busia residents are not attending forums to educate them on Covid-19 because no hand-outs are given, health officials say. County disease surveillance coordinator Evans Shiraku said the disease is spreading fast because locals lack knowledge on how it is spreading. Shiraku and other health officials appealed to leaders to create awareness on ways to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Covid-19 county coordinator David Mukabi stressed the need for political, social and administrative leadership to use available forums to encourage people to observe the Ministry of Health (MoH) regulations. Speaking at the Busia County Referral Hospital during a stakeholders meeting convened by the World Health Organisation to discuss the Covid-19 status, particularly in Matayos and Teso South Sub Counties, Dr Mukabi noted that residents were still ignoring the preventive measures. “The big question remains why are people reluctant in adhering to coronavirus precautionary measures like frequent hand washing, wearing of masks and social distancing?” Asked Dr Mukabi, who is also the Universal Health Coverage (UHC) director. He added: "The Salvation Army Kolanya Boys High School Covid-19 positive cases that were recorded among them 52 students, six teachers and two support staff is just a sample of what is happening in other learning institutions within the county." Health Promotion officer Nelson Andanje challenged stakeholders to join hands in the fight against the pandemic. WHO Covid-19 consultant Ben Adika called on leaders to take up the Covid-19 campaign considering that the burden of the disease was high. Participants included religious leaders, women groups, Boda boda, police, clearing agents, commercial sex workers and the youth, where they resolved to work together in strengthening efforts to combat Covid-19.
