The chairman of the National Assembly Public Accounts Committee Opiyo Wandayi has called on the government to punish the people behind the degeneration of Kenya Power company, saying it is technically insolvent. The Ugunja legislator who spoke at Nyasanda Technical Training Institute during the launch of collection of BBI signatures said time was up for the company to take the first step in asking for voluntary liquidation instead of waiting to be taken to court. He called on President Uhuru Kenyatta to put to task the Energy Cabinet Secretary to explain the failure of the company, lamenting that the country could not develop with persistent power outages. “Kenyans who cannot prosper without power know those behind the running of the company and it is a pity that a faulty transformer can take up to a year to be replaced,” he said. Wandayi warned those responsible, adding that they will be named in public in the next three days and will not go scot free. On BBI Wandayi, who is the ODM director of political affairs, said the party was proud to be associated with the document and urged Kenyans to append their signatures in big numbers. He called on those spearheading the signatures collection to stop petty politics, adding that the initiative should be approached collectively by representatives of all parties. Nyanza BBI coordinator Jakoyo Midiwo told politicians to stop forming parallel teams to collect signatures but work under the established committees. Midiwo, a former Gem legislator, further told those spearheading the signature collection to adhere to Covid-19 rules because the disease is real.  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
