A notice of motion for the impeachment of Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko was tabled on Thursday. Minority leader Michael Ogada tabled the motion. A total of 86 out of 122 MCA have appended their signatures to the motion, surpassing the threshold required to table a notice of impeachment motion. So what happens next? According to the Nairobi City County Assembly  Standing Orders 67, before giving a notice of a motion, a member shall deliver to the clerk a signed copy of it stating the grounds for impeachment. The notice of motion must be verified by at least a third of all the members of the assembly. Each of them signs a verification form provided by the clerk, which the clerk submits with the proposed motion to the speaker for approval. The MCA who has obtained approval of the speaker to move the motion shall give a seven-day notice calling for impeachment of the governor. The  seven days  are relating to the maturity period of the motion on impeachment referred to the ‘calendar days'. Within that time, Sonko will be expected to appear and give reasons to the house why he should not be impeached. Upon the expiry of the seven days, the motion shall be placed on the Order Paper and be disposed of within three days. Within the seven days notice, the clerk shall prepare a list of MCAs supporting the motion with their signatures. Any signature appended cannot be withdrawn. The assembly will be back at the chambers next week on Thursday to finalize on the impeachment motion. For the motion to pass, two-thirds of all members of the county assembly (83 MCAs ) have to vote to impeach Sonko. If the motion sails through, the speaker shall inform the Speaker of the Senate of that resolution within two days.
