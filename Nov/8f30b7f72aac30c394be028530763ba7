Lang'ata cops must break into the office of an OCS who died of Covid-19 and crack his safe to retrieve Sh20,000 bail. Only Lang'ata police station commander, chief inspector George Kabii, had the keys to his office and the combination to his safe. Kabii died of Covid-19 last week at Nairobi West Hospital. This has delayed the plea-taking of motorist Andrew Kimathi Gitonga at a Kibera court. His police cash bail of Sh20,000 must first be refunded since he appeared in court - but it's in the safe. A junior officer from the station said the OCS’s office must be broken into in the presence of senior officers. An office inventory must be taken, the safe cracked and the cash retrieved. Procedurally, police must return the cash bail after Gitonga presented himself in court. This means Gitonga cannot be charged until the safe is cracked or police get the refund money elsewhere. Gitonga is accused of killing Ramon Owiti, a pedestrian crossing Muhoho Avenue in Lang'ata on October 2 at 2.30pm. He is expected to be charged with causing death by dangerous driving. He had been freed on police bail pending his court appearance. Gitonga declined to take a plea until he got his refund  when he appeared before senior principal magistrate Esther Boke of the Kibera law courts. Prosecution counsel Nancy Kerubo said Gitonga had agreed to answer the charges and get a refund later. The ODPP wanted Gitonga to plead to the charges, then get a refund on December 15 after the OCS's office and safe are broken into. Boke said, however, the case cannot proceed until Gitonga gets his money. She said he may need the Sh20,000 to top up the bail he will be granted after pleading to the charges. Police wanted two weeks to refund the money but Boke said it must be returned by December 2 for the next court appearance. She extended the police bail. (Edited by V. Graham)
