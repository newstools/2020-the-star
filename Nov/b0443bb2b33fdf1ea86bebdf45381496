There's never a dull moment for lawmakers whenever their Ruaraka colleague Tom Kajwang' (pictured) is around. He often cracks them up at the height of serious business.  He is never shy of expressing his opinion, no matter how controversial. During a recent oversight team meeting, his colleagues burst into in laughter when he said he had received a call from US President Donald Trump to "swear" him in for a second term. Kajwang' was dragged to court over the oath by Nasa leader Raila Odinga as the People’s President on January 30, 2018. His friends in Bunge call him the 'People’s Chief Justice'. *** Hands in the cookie jar? There is a growing appetite for Army Biscuits, so sweet that folks,  including journalists, cannot resist carting off a few packets. What may strike a keen observer is the extent to which some people take advantage of the abundance of biscuits to lift as many as they can. MPs barely have time to eat so a committee session provides a perfect spot to bag the brittle cakes. Our mole says that so bold are the reapers that they ignore the lenses focusing on their brazen, gluttonous acts. Some members feel it's time the store's personnel started to strictly ration their biscuits. *** Talking of rations, lawmakers seem to have challenges when witnesses who appear before them happen to their former colleagues. There is a cardinal rule in the House that for ethical reasons and to avoid conflict of interest, members must stay away from witnesses who appear before them for oversight sessions. Recently, an MP was overheard asking his former colleague who had been invited to shed light on some matter for “a tot of whiskey”. The ‘thirsty’ boisterous lawmaker had to be slowed down by the team’s leader who reminded him that he risked having the remark go on the record, and was only lucky that the sitting had already been adjourned.
