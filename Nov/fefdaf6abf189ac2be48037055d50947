Ugenya MP David Ochieng says he was the first ODM lawmaker in Siaya to launch collection of BBI signatures. While launching signature collection in his constituency on Saturday Ochieng  asked the Independent and Boundaries Commission to rush and organise the referendum.  Time shouldn't be wasted after signature collection, he said. Ochieng was elected on the MDG ticket after defeating the ODM candidate in 2017. He said the country has spent so much time  preparing the BBI document that they don’t want to waste any more time on passing it. The MP said he is fully behind the BBI document as he has read and understood it in detail. He said he will personally ensure its passage at all levels. “Some ill-informed leaders were waiting for me to reject the document and start running up and down in my constituency with no good intention,” Ochieng said. He said changes in the Constitution will bring 'sanity' in every election cycle. “I’m sure President Uhuru Kenyatta and Raila Odinga would have loved to see many other things changed in the Constitution but it cannot happen at once,” Ochieng said. “Those who feel their issue was not captured this time around should know that there is always next time,” he said.
