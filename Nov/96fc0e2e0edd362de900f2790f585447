Victims of police brutality and killings witnessed during the Covid-19 period want the court to declare the actions of state agents a crime against humanity. Through Kituo Cha Sheria, the victims on Tuesday asked High Court judge Anthony Mrima to allow them amend their earlier suit to include certain prayers. Their lawyer John Khaminwa told the judge that his clients want to include in their suit papers a prayer that acts of violence by police enforcing the curfew amount to a crime against humanity. The class suit was filed by Amnesty International, IJM, Haki Africa and Kituo Cha Sheria. The rights groups decried the violence meted by police officers on innocent civilians hours before the effective time of the curfew order. They want the state to be held liable for actions of its officers and be compelled to pay the victims of brutality. The groups said there have been several instances of brutal, disproportionate and unnecessary use of force while enforcing the curfew order. They said members of the public have been beaten, shot at and tear-gassed, leading to serious injuries and deaths. “The petition also calls out the government for the intentional failure by the state to operationalise the National Coroners Service Act, the Prevention of Torture Act and the Victims Protection Act,” the suit says. One of the victims, Hussein Moyo, is seeking Sh17,000 as burial fees while Judith Simiyu seeks Sh158,300 and Daniel Waithugi Ng'ang'a wants to be paid Sh140,800 by the state as compensation. Amnesty argues that the dusk to dawn curfew order by the state was enforced in the most brutal, unreasonable and disproportionate manner. The case will be mentioned on January 26.
