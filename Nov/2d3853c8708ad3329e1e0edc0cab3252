They are Makueni, Nairobi, Nakuru, Kericho, Kisumu, and Kakamega counties. This comes after the government launched a road safety campaign dubbed ‘Usalama barabarani’ on October 28 in partnership with the European Union (EU) to reduce road accidents. In a statement, NTSA’s Director-General George Njao says working with partners, continues to play its role in ensuring the reduction of road traffic crashes through a number of interventions. “It is clear that this emerging challenge to our economic and social development.  We lose an estimated 3,000 lives annually as a result of road traffic crashes.
