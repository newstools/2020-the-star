Safaricom has announced plans to provide 100 per cent 4G network coverage across the country by end of this year as part of its growth strategy focused on being the technology partner of choice. The giant telco has embarked on its next phase of growth that will be driven by a vision to become a purpose-led technology company by 2025. Safaricom CEO Peter Ndegwa made the announcement as he released financial results for the half year ended September 30, 2020, which saw net profit decrease by 6 per cent to Sh33.07 billion with service revenue hitting Sh 118.41 billion. “Our business has proved to be resilient despite tough operating conditions. There is no doubt that Covid-19 has dealt a huge blow to many people not just in Kenya, but across the globe," Ndegwa said. "This has been a tough period for businesses—small and large alike—and our customers. We are committed to walking through this journey together." Despite a 4.8 per cent drop in Service Revenue, Safaricom increased capital expenditure by  25.5 per cent to Sh22.75 billion. Voice service revenue dropped by 6.5 per cent to Sh40.19 billion while M-Pesa revenue dropped by 14.5 per cent to sh35.89bn. “As we go into our third decade as an organization, we aim to create a technology business by developing new digital ecosystems in health, agriculture and education sectors as we aim to provide digital solutions for our customers,” Ndegwa said. Board chairman Michael Joseph said they are encouraged by the positive trajectory witnessed going into the second quarter of our financial year. KEY HIGHLIGHTS
