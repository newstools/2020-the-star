Zari Hassan has told off haters claiming she is using her children to get back with Diamond. Zari and her two kids with Diamond, Princess Tiffah and Prince Nillan, were in Tanzania a week ago to visit him. Now Zari says she wasn’t moved by naysayers as long as her kids were happy. "As long as my babies are happy…. the rest is background noise," she wrote on Instagram. Earlier, she told Wasafi TV she and Diamond are co-parenting. "He gets to see the kids and be in their life and support them emotionally and financially," she said. "So as a parent, I am also happy he is back in their lives. Getting back together for love, it has never crossed my mind and I do not even think about it."
