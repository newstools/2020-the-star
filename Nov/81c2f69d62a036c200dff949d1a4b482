A vocal MP in Deputy President William Ruto’s camp who was the only one invited to the BBI launch at Bomas has had people question his loyalty. Foot soldiers are pondering at how he got in the good books of those who were in charge of dishing the invitations. It is understood the party leaders in the House from both sides combed the list with a cursory eye before deciding on who was going to set foot in Bomas. The MP has been seen in some quarters with top architect of anti-Ruto machinations and has heightened speculation about where his true allegiance lies. A first-time MP from Nyanza with a penchant for hooliganism recently called a county police boss to cancel a fundraiser for the construction of a bridge. The man reads 2022 politics in nearly all projects not funded by the NG-CDF kitty. Corridors overheard the man ask the officers to do anything possible to stop the fundraiser, and any other he has not approved. The legislator is pointing an accusing finger at a head of a government parastatal whom he blames for his political woes. Members of the community have vowed to put up the bridge as it is the only link their children use to access the area’s school. Just to what extent can one panic in any situation they find themselves in? Well, a second-time legislator recently shocked many with his frantic calls for help after he got stuck in a lift — for five minutes — following a power outage at one of the city buildings. The man from Nyanza, who is never shy to boast how brave he is to anyone who cares to listen, called his colleagues, family and even journalists at the heat of his desperation to get out of the blockade.
