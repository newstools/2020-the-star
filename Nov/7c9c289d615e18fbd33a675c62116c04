Busia Deputy Governor Moses Mulomi has given clear indications of his desire to succeed his boss, Governor Sospeter Ojaamong in 2022. Also in the race is Nambale MP John Bunyasi, who is also Mulomi's relative. Bunyasi said they will come to a consensus on the matter. "My aunt's son John Bunyasi also wants the same seat. Given that I am now in position two, it would be prudent to aim for the top position like any ambitious student," Mulomi said. The deputy governor said, however, his priority right now is to ensure all ongoing projects are completed in time to cement the governor's legacy. He was speaking during the burial of Mzee Vincent Panyako, 77, in Apatit village, Amukura Central, on Saturday. Mulomi urged residents and leaders from the area to join hands and build Busia. Bunyasi, who was present, confirmed that he will be racing against Mulomi. "I am in the 2022 gubernatorial race. Mulomi is also eyeing the same seat andÂ  being a relative, we shall look for a way forward together," he said. Bunyasi praised Ojaamong and Mulomi for helping "build my political foundation". "We shall hold onto that foundation to steer the county to greater heights." Bunyasi said there is a need to forge a united front, side by side, noting that there is still a long journey to go, including having a consensus on the Building Bridges Initiative report. "The document is good, especially on the increased allocation to the counties. What we need is to make copies available for county residents to read before making an informed decision," he said.
