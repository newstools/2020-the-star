Convicted former City Council legal director Mary Ng'ethe has been allowed to withdraw funds from her bank accounts to cater for her sick child. Ng'ethe is currently serving a sentence at Lang'ata maximum prison. She was in September sentenced to three years imprisonment over her involvement in the Sh283 million graft for a cemetery land. The deputy registrar of the Anti-Corruption Division ordered the officer in charge of Lang'ata Women's Prison to allow Ng'ethe to access and draw her consolidated bank account either by herself or through an agent to enable her law firm to run and to supply the needs of her sick child. Ng'ethe is an advocate with a practice in Nairobi. Her firm has a clientele of 1,500 individuals and corporate clients. She is the sole proprietor of the firm while the office manager is Nelson Kiarie. Documents filed in court indicate that for the period she has been in custody the management of the law firm has been rendered impossible. She is a single mother of one son who has special needs and requires constant attention in terms of medical and therapy sessions. The order of the court was issued after Alex Waweru said he had instructions to swear an affidavit on Ng'ethe’s behalf. In the affidavit, Waweru states, “I have been advised by prison authorities in Lang'ata, which advice I believe to be true, that Ng'ethe cannot access and draw her consolidated cheque book without the order of the court.” Among the specific instructions from Ng'ethe was for Waweru to make an application to Lang'ata prison to facilitate her access her consolidated bank account to make payments. “Ng'ethe is a single parent with a special-needs child who requires constant attention and therapy sessions, which my client is apprehensive the child may not receive if the adequate financial assistance is not provided,” he said.
