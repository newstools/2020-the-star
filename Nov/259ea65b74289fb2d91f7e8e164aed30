History was made on Friday when the Ministry of Lands issued the first community title deeds for 27,000 acres in Laikipia county. Leaders of the Ilngwesi and Musul communities in Laikipia North received the documents at a ceremony attended by Laikipia Governor Ndiritu Murithi and top government officials. The title deeds were handed to the chairmen of the two communities, Tom Putumoi (Musul) and Kip Olepolos (Ilngwesi). Lands CS Farida Karoney said the ministry would roll out a programme to recognise, protect and register community land as required by the Community Land Act. The programme by the UN Food Agricultural Organization (FAO) and the European Union targets nine counties. Prior to the issuance of the titles, dozens of representatives from the two sub-communities were taken through a week-long induction on planning, land use and food security by ministry and FAO officials. Governor Ndiritu urged the communities to serve as an example to other counties by increasing their productivity. He promised to expand the watering points for livestock in the communities. The ceremony was also attended by EU Ambassador Simon Mordue, FAO deputy Country Representative Hamisi William, National Lands Commission vice chair Gertrude Nguku, FAO land programme lead Husna Mbarak and representatives from the Council of Governors and the county commissioner. Mordue announced that President Uhuru Kenyatta signed a Sh50 billion agreement to finance roads during his visit to France last month. Out of the amount, Sh2.5 billion will go towards opening up pastoral areas in Laikipia. FAO deputy country representative Hamisi Willilam urged the communities to manage their resources to ensure food security. The Community Lands Act enacted in 2016 gives rights to communities that share a distinct ancestry, ethnicity, unique livelihood, socio-economic circumstances and have a geographical claim to an area to register and administer land they occupy jointly to avoid conflict.
