Bungoma has stopped testing most people admitted in health facilities for Covid-19. Executive committee member in charge of health Dr Antony Walela said the county had run out of reagents. Walela said health officials will now be testing critical cases until the government provides them with testing kits. "The number of patients is overwhelming and yet we have run out of the reagents. So we are only going to test patients in critical conditions in our health facilities," said Walela. The number of people who have contracted the virus in Bungoma is now 224. Walela was flanked by his chief officer Patrick Wandili. "We are not to going to carry on testing our patients until the government provides us with enough testing reagents and kits, as its the only sole supplier," said Walela. Wandili said they will only start their routine surveillance immediately they get the testing kits and reagents. "Our patients will now bear with us as we wait for the supply from the national government," said Wandili. Walela said they were waiting for a Gazette notice to start enforcing Covid-19 protocols in the county. He asked locals who had disposed of their handwashing jerrycans to replace them immediately adding that no premises will be allowed to operate without it. "Most of our people had disposed of washing tanks both in the villages and at the business premises. I am asking them to replace before we come for them," warned Walela.
