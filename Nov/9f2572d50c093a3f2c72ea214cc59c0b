Police are planning to arrest a Standard 6 pupil who was shot and injured during a clash between security officers and squatters in Migingo, Malindi town. The pupil was allegedly shot and wounded in the leg by police who were helping a businessman survey the land. The boy is said to have been fleeing from the police when they shot him in the calf of his leg. Malindi police boss Joe Lekuta confirmed the incident, saying the squatters invaded private property. He said the boy would be arrested when he gets better and charged with invading private land. Two other people have been arrested for allegedly invading private land. Trouble started after residents confronted the businessman and demanded to know why he was surveying land that does not belong to him. They demanded that he produce a title deed to prove he was the rightful owner. After he failed to produce ownership documents, chaos erupted and the squatters started pelting him and the police with stones. Police officers fired live bullets and lobbed tear gas canisters to disperse the protesters. It was during the melee that the pupil was shot. A good Samaritan rushed him to the Malindi Subcounty Hospital, where he is undergoing treatment. When journalists arrived at the scene, they found roads had been blocked. Tyres were still burning. There was blood at the scene and tension was high as some police officers were still guarding the house of a local who is said to be working with the businessman to frustrate residents. Resident Morris Kenga said people are living in fear because of the constant harassment and arrests. Resident Mercy Wanjira urged the President to intervene and resolve the matter to enable them to live peacefully.
