Deputy President William Ruto has said the country needs to give more attention to the surging cases as well as deaths related to coronavirus. Ruto said on Sunday in a tweet that the virus is clearly ravaging the country. “The pandemic is killing people including health workers while destroying livelihoods,” Ruto said. He added that “We should stop everything and mobilise every human, material and financial resource to fight.” The DP’s comments come as the move to amend the Constitution through the Building Bridges Initiative report gains momentum. The BBI team is expected to start collecting one million signatures from Kenyans, in preparation for a referendum. Speaking in Kisumu on Sunday after meeting governors from the Western Region, ODM leader Raila Odinga said that those who are criticising the report are not honest. Ruto has been calling for an all-inclusive report, which will give opportunity to all Kenyans with varying proposals. Ruto’s call comes as Covid-19 caseload stands at 70, 245 following the confirmation of 972 new cases on Sunday. Twenty more people succumbed to the virus in the last, totaling the number of deaths to 1,269. Health CS Mutahi Kagwe has also convened for a special meeting of the National Emergency Response Committee, which will be on Monday. Kagwe said that the meeting is to review among other issues the rise in positive cases and the current containment measures. The committee will also deliberate on issues affecting healthcare workers countrywide.
