Scientists at the Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organisation have raised concerns about the use of harmful pesticides by some tomato farmers. Kalro researchers said some farmers are using pesticides that are potentially poisonous to consumers and the environment. Eliud Kireger, Kalro director-general, said the organisation has come up with integrated pest management strategies to deal with tomato pests and diseases. Farmers have complained that the pests and diseases harm the quality, production, and consumersâ€™ safety, thus reducing markets and profitability. Kireger said production of tomatoes is hampered by pests and diseases such as Tuta absoluta, whiteflies, red spider mites bacterial wilts late blight Fusarium wilt. Tomato spotted wilt virus, tomato yellow leaf, curl virus and nematodes are other challenges. The director-general said tomato is the second-most important exotic vegetable in the country and is widely consumed. It accounts for 20 per cent of the value of the foreign vegetables in 2018 and made Sh23.4 billion for farmers. He said tomato production has improved owing to better farm gates prices and enhanced irrigation in open fields and expansion of greenhouse production in Kirinyaga, Kajiado, Taita Taveta, Laikipia, Bungoma and Trans Nzoia, Kireger met farmers from Garissa and Kajiado being trained on the new tomato farming value chain technologies in Embu. The farmers and 60 staffers toured a tomato farm in Mururi area of Kirinyaga county. He said the purpose of the training is to provide the trainers of trainers with knowledge and skills on how to increase productivity through the adoption of good agricultural practices.
