Deputy President William Ruto on Sunday mourned the death major John Koech. Koech, former deputy chief of General staff lieutenant died after a short illness at a Nairobi hospital. In his message of condolences to the family, Ruto said Koech was a leader of character, a hero, a true patriot and a brave man in uniform who was dedicated to serve and defend the country. He described him as a quick-witted, strict but fair-minded person. "General Koech was a progressive and vibrant leader who became a central figure in the transformation of our military. We will miss his wise counsel, and vision and vigour to empower the people of Ainamoi," read his message. He added, "Our thoughts and prayers are with General Koech family, their loved ones, friends and the people of Kericho County". The late Koech passed on Sunday morning. On his part, Kericho Governor Paul Chepkwony said he learnt with profound shock and sorrow the sudden passing on of Koech. Chepkwony said the death has robbed the nation of a dedicated, diligent and a humble long service senior military officer who served the late former President, Daniel Moi with exceptional loyalty, commitment and trust. "The late Koech was a model farmer who contributed immensely to the transformation of both tea and dairy sectors in the county... I have also lost a dependable friend and a man endowed with wise counsel," he said. Upon his retirement in 2008, the late Koech gave a stab in politics where he ran for Ainamoi parliamentary seat on his united democratic movement (UDM) party but lost it. He later ventured into farming where he rears more than 150 dairy cows at his 300-acre farm in Ainamoi. He also owns a private tea factory-Siomo-at Konoin in Bomet. Koech was also a commandant of the National Defence College between 2004 and 2005.
