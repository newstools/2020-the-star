Vihiga Queens are hoping to overcome regional opposition in the quest to make a bow at the newly-introduced Confederation of Africa Football Club Champions League. In the schedule released last month, Queens will face fellow Cecafa nations of Uganda, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Rwanda and Burundi in regional qualifiers whose dates are yet to be confirmed. Queens' coach Alex Alumira said his charges will have to be at their best to overcome Uganda and Tanzania, whom he termed as their major threat owing to the well-laid structures in their respective countries. "For the record, Uganda and Tanzania have competitive teams largely because of the systems in place. Uganda Under 17 team is one step away from qualifying for the Olympics. They won the Cosafa trophy by beating hosts South Africa and everything seems to be working well with their clubs. This also applies to Tanzania. We have to be watchful over them," said Alimura. Despite Harambee Starlets winning the Cecafa trophy last year with Queens boasting a fair share of players in the team, Alumira downplayed Queens' pre-zone favourite's tag saying most of them will be playing at the big stage for the first time. "It is a new challenge for the team. Quite a number have not played beyond the Women's Premier League. Our national team was triumphant in Tanzania in 2019 but this is different from club duties," he added. The Kakamega-based Queens are the Women's Premier League champions, having won the title three times in a row. The inaugural 2021 CAF Champions League will consist of eight teams, which will be determined through regional qualifiers to be held in each of CAF's six zones. The host nation will produce two teams while the host region will have an extra slot. The eight teams will then be drawn into two groups of four but details of the knockout stages, whether to follow a single or double-leg format, will be communicated in due course. The tournament will be held annually.
