The British government has been commended for its steadfast support for development projects in Wajir county and Kenya at large. Governor Mohamed Abdi said the support has contributed to the socio-economic upliftment of Wajir. Abdi spoke on Wednesday when he received British High Commissioner Jane Marriot in his Wajir town office. "We don’t take this for granted," the governor said. The envoy said the cooperation between her country and Kenya had led to fruitful engagement in many aspects of development. “The future looks really bright with sustainable and positive relationship between the Kenyan government and my government. Things can only get better,” Marriot said. Abdi said his administration is focused on sustainable development, noting that the motto of the Wajir County Integrated Development Plan 2018-2022 is “leaving no one behind”. He appealed to the high commissioner for enhanced assistance for the devolved unit to achieve grassroots economic development through integrated ward-based development project model in the 30 wards. He said the county government alongside partners like UK's Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office will sensitise the grassroots communities on the integrated ward-based development approach which combines community development planning processes, disaster risk reduction and market systems. The governor sought the assistance of the British government in the finalisation of the preparation of the Covid-19 Economic Recovery Strategy. Abdi also wanted to be helped in the resourcing and implementation of the Wajir CIDP 2018-2022. Further, he appealed for support in the achievement of universal health coverage, investment and empowerment of youth and women. His list also included assistance in geological surveys, desalination of borehole water and resourcing and implementation of the county counter-violence and extremism work plan. The High Commissioner and the governor toured some of the projects supported by the British government.
