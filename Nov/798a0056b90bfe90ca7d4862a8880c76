The Vihiga government has set aside Sh10 million for Luanda market facelift. Addressing traders at Mulukhoro, Governor Wilber Ottichilo blamed lack of space and corruption perpetrated by market leaders for Luanda town's failure to develop even though it contributes significantly to the county's economy. Ottichilo said Luanda is the second-largest market in Kenya after Karatina but is poorly managed, with its leadership not delivering required standards to the business community. He said his administration will use the available space for market buildings and where expansion is needed, residents will be requested to sell their land. “Compulsory land acquisition for the expansion of Luanda town with proper consultation of the business community will have to take place if communities around fail to sell the land around the town,” Ottichilo said. The Trade department has also budgeted for the construction of a building to accommodate more traders, hence solving the space problem. Ottichilo said all streets will remain closed for traders to conduct their business if they will observe Covid-19 regulations. On sanitation, he said, “We have been battling for a site to dump our garbage from the market and have space in Luanda South at the moment.” The governor said the site will employ a number of people who will be in charge of recycling. Ottichilo said water shortage in Luanda market and its surroundings will end once the Maseno water project is completed. The traders were urged to apply for Trade and Enterprise Fund loans provided by the county government to grow their businesses. Ottichilo cautioned them against flouting Covid-19 rules, reminding them to observe set health protocols, lest they attract another lockdown given the spike in infection. The county chief was meeting the residents to deliberate on the relocation of some traders and seek a solution to some of the long-term challenges bedevilling the market. Edited by Francis Orieny
