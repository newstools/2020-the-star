The UN will today, December 1, mark the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian people. The day marks the United Nations Resolution 181, which was passed in 1947, calling for the partition of Palestine into Arab and Jewish states, with the city of Jerusalem as a separate entity to be governed by a special international regime. In a press release, Palestine Embassy in Nairobi said various events and meetings will take place at UN Headquarters in New York, UN offices in Vienna, Geneva and Nairobi. "In the UN headquarters in New York, the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestine People, a body of the UN General Assembly promoting the right of Palestinian people to self-determination and independence, will convene high-level officials of member states, the Secretary-General, intergovernmental organisations and representatives of civil society," the statement read in part. The participants are expected to make statements on the question of Palestine and the wall built in the occupied Palestine territory, which was ruled to be illegal by the International Court of Justice on July 9, 2004. The UN General Assembly will also convene on Wednesday for its annual debate on the question of Palestine, where it is expected to adopt a resolution outlining its parameters for a just solution to the problem.
