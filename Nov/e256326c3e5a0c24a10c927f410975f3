The National Super League side Migori Youth may be forced to look for alternative home ground as county government has failed to complete the stadium. On Wednesday, the team forced their way and trained at the stadium as they are preparing for the season set for November 29. A spot check by the Star showed that effluent from Migori county referral hospital, especially the mortuary  has left the pitch waterlogged hence unplayable. “We risk stalling our preparation due to lack of home ground,” Steve Alando, the club organising secretary said. Migori Youth head coach Robert Ojienda said they only need the grass in the stadium to be slashed and drainage system repaired. “Our main aim this season is to earn promoted to Kenya Premier League but we will need the county government to help us to this end,” Ojienda said. Migori County Municipal member Joseph Nyambori said over 200 metres of wall between the stadium and referral hospital risk collapsing and is a hazard to players and members of the public. He said they have already contacted the ministry of health to construct a septic tank and improve drainage around the wall. Migori health chief officer, Dalmas Oyugi, said the department did a supplementary budget and forwarded it to the county government for a new septic tank. “We are moving with speed to make the bad situation right,” he said. Despite spending an upward of over Sh30 million to upgrade the stadium, it has continued to be an eyesore. Migori director of sports Silas Jonyo said the department was still waiting for an audit from the contractor before they can officially handover the pitch to the team.
