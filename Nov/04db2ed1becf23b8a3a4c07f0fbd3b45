Tomato farmers in Kirinyaga want the county government to guarantee minimum prices (see P24). They are complaining about low prices and middlemen. A proposed tomato processing factory being set up in Kangai by the county government should increase demand and stabilise prices for local farmers. However, middlemen are a good thing because they smooth out supply and demand and facilitate distribution across the country. In February, there was a shortage of tomatoes in Kenya and those same middlemen bought them from Ethiopia. Local farmers were then getting a great price for their tomatoes. Price fluctuations are unavoidable in agriculture. Similarly, macadamia farmers have been complaining of low prices from middlemen and demanding more regulation by government. But both macadamia and tomato production have been growing steadily in Kenya. The value of the Kenya tomato market is now Sh23 billion annually while Kenya is now the third biggest macadamia producer in the world. On balance then, farmers have been doing very well with tomatoes and macadamia. They should be careful of what they wish for when they demand government to set prices. They might end up killing the market which gives them a living. Quote of the day: "Do not fear the enemy, for they can take only your life.
