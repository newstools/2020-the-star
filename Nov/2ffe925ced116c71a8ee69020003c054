The Kenya Film Commission on Tuesday selected 'The Letter,’ produced by Christopher King and Maia Lekow, to represent the country in the foreign-language category of the 2021 Oscars. The film tells the story of a young man, Karisa, who travels to his grandmother’s rural home, where he learns she has been accused of witchcraft. Filmed with a gentle pace and incredible closeness, 'The Letter' is an intimate family portrait that also reveals an indestructible female power. The documentary film was directed and produced by Maia Lekow and Christopher King with the support of Docubox, the East African Documentary Film Fund. Speaking to Word Is, executive producer Judy Kibinge said in a month or so, they will wait to see if it rises to the top to be longlisted. "'Softie' is also eligible as it screened at three qualifying festivals. So historically, Kenya now has two entries for the Oscars and even more historic, both are documentaries," she said. The committee is urging producers to work with the KFC to understand the requirements of Oscars submissions. They are available on the Kenya Film Commission website and also on The Academy Website under Academy Special Rules and Regulations.
