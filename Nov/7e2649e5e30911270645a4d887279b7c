Kirinyaga MCAs have expressed optimism that all stalled health projects will be completed. The house last week passed a supplementary budget of Sh6.7 billion for roads, health, education and other development projects. At least 20 stalled health facilities were initiated by former Governor Joseph Ndathi’s administration. Political squabbles between the county executive and the assembly have delayed completion of the projects. Budget and Appropriations committee chair David Mathenge told the Star already Sh556 million has been allocated to health projects. “In all wards in the county we have at least one incomplete dispensary. We expect the county government to finalise the projects, inclusive of equipping the facilities, before the lapse of this financial year as we have already done our work”, Mathenge said. His ward has two incomplete dispensaries. “As we agreed in our reconciliation talks, the county government must see to it that the pending projects are completed within the agreed timelines,” Tebere MCA Gudson Muchina said. He said it would be a relief to many residents who have been travelling long distances to seek medical services. “This will also ease the burden on Kerugoya and Kimbimbi hospitals where our people throng to seek services for lack of nearer dispensaries”. During Mashujaa Day celebrations, Governor Ann Waiguru promised her administration’s commitment to complete the stalled health centres. Health was among the biggest gainers in this financial year’s supplementary budget. Edited by Henry Makori
