Nairobi’s Koinange Street has for many years had bad reputation for its twilight activities in 1990s. A first-time MP from Central region appears to be keen to give the street a new lease of life. The youthful MP was seen frolicking, kissing and smooching along the busy street last Friday evening. The tipsy lawmaker couldn’t resist public display of affection in the middle of the road, right outside the entrance to City Market. This prompted road users to hoot violently to jolt the MP back to his senses. It is not clear whether the MP had had one too many or he was trying too hard to please the subject of his desire. Moments after he saw off the young lady board a taxi, the legislator took a hasty walk towards Loita Street. *** A female MP is said to be going through hell trying to explain to her constituents what she was doing at at the Naivasha meeting that brought together pro-BBI legislators. The little-known legislator comes from an area that is opposing amendments to the Constitution and residents are now calling her a traitor and hypocrite. It is understood that the press briefing that was held after the meeting sold her out as she was spotted in the back row as she tried to avoid being captured by the cameras. The MP has taken to various social media platforms to hit back, saying she does not owe anyone an explanation for attending the meeting. *** Talk is rife along corridors of Parliament that a businesswoman  from a Coastal county is planning to storm Parliament. Reason? The lady  is said to be rearing for a fight with a Woman Representative who has “stolen” her husband and now living together in a rented apartment in Nairobi. The woman is said to be armed with all manner of photos of her husband and the vocal and abrasive legislator . Keep it at Corridors of Power for the unfolding scene.
