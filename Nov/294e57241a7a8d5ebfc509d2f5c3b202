Migori Woman Representative Pamela Odhiambo has launched a kitchen garden project to help 231 women's groups across the county. Representatives from her office led by Jael Lumumba distributed sukuma wiki (Kales), spinach and onion seedlings at Love World Green Youth Group nursery in Piny Oyie village in Suna West constituency. “The women groups were drawn from across all the 40 wards in the county and their representatives will get seedlings to help them propagate their kitchen gardens,” Lumumba said. He said with the current rainy season and the Covid-19 restrictions, the gardens will come in handy to boost women nutritional value and economy. “The groups were trained on the best way to propagate their farms, maintain the farms and how to sell produce from their kitchens,” Lumumba said. Tom Oluoch, horticulture specialists who led the training of the groups said from five square meter kitchen garden, an individual stands to make an impact. “This space can have 830 onion seedlings which can fetch a kitchen garden Sh8,000 in two months as an onion sells for Sh10 per bulb,” Oluoch said. He said the same space can have 80 seedlings of sukumawiki and spinach which can add additional income. “We want the propagation of kitchen gardens to be among groups and other members especially in villages,” he said. The two said they have also educated women in towns to have gardens in small space using sacks and buckets to help propagate planting in small spaces. The Migori Woman Representative office will distribute tree seedlings to more groups in the coming weeks.  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
