The BBI Secretariat has relegated Kitui residents to passive bystanders after failing to create new constituencies and making Mwingi a county, area MPs have said. Six MPs, led by their parliamentary group chairman Makali Mulu and Senator Enoch Wambua, said they would continue to push to have Kitui get more constituencies and the creation of Mwingi county. The leaders spoke following a meeting held in Nairobi on Thursday evening to interrogate Kitui's hits and misses in the BBI document. Mulu said their proposal to create Mwingi county was completely ignored. The Kitui Central MP said the unfolding scenario left Kitui people disillusioned. "There is no proper reason why Kitui could not get at least one constituency,” Mulu said. Senator Wambua said the leaders must engage the BBI Secretariat to ensure Kitui residents wishes were granted. “We need to have Mwingi county hived off the larger Kitui county for better services to residents. Among all the districts that were created by 1993, only Mwingi was denied a county and it was time it became one,” he said. Wambua said Kitui leaders also want green gram that grows in plenty in Kitui and other semiarid lands to be recognised as a cash crop just like tea, coffee and pyrethrum.
