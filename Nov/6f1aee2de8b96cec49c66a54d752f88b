After sealing a place in the National Super League, Soy United is targeting promotion to the Kenyan Premier League by 2023. Club patron Edwin Ayiro said: “We are going to engage some corporates and if one or two come on board, our aim is to play in the top tier league in two years. When we founded this team in 2018, our strategic plan was to play in KPL in five years. It is not easy for an individual to run a team because the magnitude of responsibility is big. ” Ayiro added that they will beef up the squad with young, talented players. “The competition in NSL is stiff. We are going to compete with experienced teams like Shabana, who will be buoyed by the recent goodies donated by President Uhuru Kenyatta. For us to be competitive, we must strengthen the team,” he added. Ayiro said they will stick to their policy of recruiting young players and developing them. The youthful advocate who is the Taita Taveta County Attorney warned KPL sides that his players are not for sale. “We are not keen to release any of our players at this stage because we want to continue developing them,” noted Ayiro. He also revealed that they are yet to settle on a home ground since Ivugwi primary school which hosted their Division One matches is not approved to host NSL matches. “We are thinking of Bukhungu Stadium in Kakamega or Eldoret Showground in Uasin Gishu County. We have to sit as management and decide on a venue that is ideal,” he added. During the promotion playoffs played at Utalii Grounds in Nairobi, Soy United defeated Mully Children’s FC (MFC) 10-9 on post-match penalties to qualify for the NSL. The teams played to a 1-1 draw after 90 minutes. Lwamba Bebeto had put MCF in the 65th minute while Timothy Muganda levelled in the 77th minute. The teams had finished second in Division One Zone 'A' and 'B'. Mwatate United and Silibwet FC gained automatic qualification after being declared champions following the cancellation of the league due to the coronavirus pandemic.
