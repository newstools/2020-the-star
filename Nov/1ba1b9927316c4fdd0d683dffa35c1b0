An alleged lover of the late Matungu MP Justus Murunga has filed a case in court seeking to stop his burial. Through lawyer Danstan Omari, Agnes Wangui wants the two widows of Murunga - Christabel and Grace and Lee Funeral Home stopped from conducting the burial. Also sought is an order for collection of DNA samples from the deceased and Agnes' children to ascertain their paternity. She also wants the the remains of the decased at Lee to be preserved until DNA samples have been collected in the presence of licensed pathologists appointed by both parties. Agnes, in an affidavit, says her two children are biological children of the decased. She is apprehensive that there may be concerted efforts by the two wives to lock her and her children out of the burial arrangements and the actual burial. "I have known Murunga for seven years. Our first encounter was in 2013 when he was a supervisor at Embakasi ranching , while I was a business woman engaged in vendition of beverages and snacks within Sewerage area, Ruai," she says. Agnes says shortly after they began a romantic relationship and out of the said union they were blessed with their first child and Murunga rented a house for her in Ruai. The relationship according to the court documents started hitting rock bottom in 2017 when Murunga won the his Matungu Parliamentary seat.
