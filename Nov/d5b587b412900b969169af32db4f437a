The Kilifi county assembly has been closed for 14 days after a staff member tested positive for Covid-19. Speaker Jimmy Kahindi urged all MCAs and staff members to go for voluntary testing and self isolate. Kahindi made the announcement on Tuesday at the county assembly together with the county Assembly Clerk Michael Ngala and Leader of the Majority  Kadenge Mwathethe. "The assembly and the chambers shall be fumigated during the time of closure," Kahindi said. "I urge residents of Kilifi county to be vigilant and follow the Ministry of Health guidelines and Covid-19 prevention protocols." More and more county assemblies have been closing as Covid-19 cases are registered. Last Wednesday, the Kakamega county government headquarters was closed for a week following a surge in Covid-19 infections. Kericho county assembly also suspended operations for 15 days after one staffer tested positive for the coronavirus. Machakos County Assembly speaker Florence Mwangangi has tested positive for Covid-19. In Machakos, the County Speaker, who is also the mother of Health Chief Administrative Secretary Mercy Mwangangi, went into self-quarantine after she tested positive. Mwangangi said she had resolved to have all the county staff get tested after one of her colleagues started exhibiting flu-like symptoms.
