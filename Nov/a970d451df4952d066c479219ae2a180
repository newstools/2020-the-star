A legislator from Kiambu has urged residents to support the Building Bridges Initiative report, saying it upholds the spirit of equitable revenue allocation. Limuru MP Peter Mwathi said on Friday the document automatically supports the 'one man, one vote, one shilling' concept and has put into consideration the population-based representation and resource sharing. He said the county will also benefit from an increased number of MP seats. "Some constituencies in our county have grown to over 100,000 thousand people, while others in other counties have about 20,000 people," Mwathi said. "We get the same amount of money for different services such as Uwezo Fund, bursary and even CDF allocations. Really, this has not been fair." He spoke as he distributed cheques worth Sh8 million from the Uwezo Fund kitty to 70 groups of youths, women and people living with disabilities. Mwathi rooted for the BBI to spur development and peace across the country.Â "Even when [President] Uhuru [Kenyatta] leaves office, everyone in the country will feel financed well; development will be felt by everyone." Also present were Public Service and Gender CAS Rachel Shebesh, Kiambu Woman Representative Gathoni Wuchomba and Limuru deputy county commissioner Charles Mukele.
