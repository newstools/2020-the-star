West Kenya Sugar Company has handed over a Sh4.5 million newly built classroom block to Shamberere Primary School in Kakamega county. The firm has also donated 100 desks to the school. The project was undertaken through the firm's Education Trust Fund. The school had dilapidated classrooms and leaking roofs which posed danger to the pupils and teachers. Speaking during the handover ceremony on Saturday, company managing director Tejveer Rai said they had decided to invest in education to give the younger generation a stepping stone to a brighter future. “We are happy that we can put smiles on the faces of pupils in this school. They can now concentrate on their studies." “As you may be aware by now, West Kenya Sugar Company and the Rai Group as a whole, have been supporting and improving the general infrastructure in schools as well as offering scholarships to needy children within our communities," Tejveer said. The firm has given over 100 scholarships to students joining secondary schools, colleges and universities. Tejveer said they have committed resources by setting up an education trust fund whose role is to ensure that there are resources set aside for such projects. “We are happy that we can put smiles on the faces of pupils in this school. They can now concentrate on their studies," added the company MD. Parents who spoke to journalists expressed their joy, saying their children can now learn in decent classrooms. Members of the Rai Group, Tejveer said, are committed to starting an apprenticeship programme in which students at local universities and vocational training institutes get a chance to receive the much-needed practical aspect of their studies. He urged the teaching fraternity to work with them in identifying bright students to join the programme. Tejveer also urged everyone to take personal responsibility and adhere to the Covid-19 protocols set by the government. Edited by A.N
