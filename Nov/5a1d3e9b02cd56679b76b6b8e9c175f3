KCB RFC chairman Xavier Makuba expects a three-horse race for the Kenya Cup crown once the new season kicks off in January. Makuba expects perennial rivals Kabras and a rejuvenated Homeboyz to be the bankers' closest rivals for the coveted crown. “I believe it will come down to three teams for the title and I expect Kabras and Homeboyz to push us hard once we get underway. Our two games with Homeboyz last season were close affairs and we expect them to be competitive in the upcoming season," added Makuba. Makuba said they will not make any signing for the upcoming season but instead will trust the squad that did duty in the cancelled 2019/20 season as they chase their fourth title in a row and equal the achievements of the great Nondies side of the 80s and 90s. “Our strategic plan for five years was to win five consecutive titles. We have done three and I am confident in the coaching group and players that we can win the next two,” he said. The bulk of the squad that has won multiple titles remains intact with the likes of Kenya sevens skipper Andrew Amonde, Oliver Mang'eni, Nick Ongeri, Brian Nyikuli in the forwards. Shaban Ahmed and internationals Johnstone Olindi, Darwin Mukidza, Jacob Ojee and Vincent Onyala are the core in the backs. The team is doing individual training at the KCB Sports Ground in Ruaraka but cannot do rigorous set-pieces like scrums and lineouts due to the Covid-19 protocols against contact sports. “I'm happy with where we are so far in terms of pre-season strength and conditioning,” added Makuba. He added that there are grey areas on the testing of  players for Covid-19 and asked the union for clarity on the process. “It is quite expensive and we don't know  at the moment if it will be a weekly process and are the teams going to be put in a bubble. We await for direction from the union," he said.
