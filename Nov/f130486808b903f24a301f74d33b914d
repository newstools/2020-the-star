68 students and five teachers have tested positive for Covid-19 at Bahati Girls Secondary school in Nakuru county. In a statement on Thursday, CEC health Kariuki Gichuki said one student who tested positive developed some complications. "And is being treated at the Nakuru isolation and management centre. A medical team is monitoring the condition of the students and teachers in isolation at the school," Gichuki said. He assured the public that the health department is monitoring the situation in Nakuru. The numbers of positive cases in schools are worrying after anotherÂ 52 from Salvation Army Kolanya Boys High School tested positive. In as much as the cases are rising, President Uhuru Kenyatta has said learning has to go on. Uhuru directed that basic education classes resume in-person learning in January 2021. Uhuru during the 13th Covid-19 national address said examination classes will continue with learning but under heightened health protocols. Uhuru said this will see the examination classes adequately prepare for exams. It had been reported that schools could in the next three weeks reopen for in-person teaching for three other classes in primary and secondary institutions. In a proposal seen by the Star, education stakeholders had proposed that the in-person learning for Grade 3, Standard 7 and Form 3 learners to resume. The three classes account for about three million learners. The proposal is to be presented to the President. If adopted, it would mean those in Grade 1-2, Standard 5-6, and Form 1-2 and pre-primary will remain at home.
