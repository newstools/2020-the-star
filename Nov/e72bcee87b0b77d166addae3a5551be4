Churches, schools, malls and hospitals charging for parking with their premises might be forced to reduce their fees, if a motion set for debate in the Senate is approved. Wajir Senator Ali Abdullahi has asked the national government to intervene and stop exorbitant parking fees charged by public or private institutions that offer critical services in urban centres. Senator Abdullahi says the outrageous parking fees being levied on motorists have no legal basis. The lawmaker has faulted hospitals, schools, malls and churches for exploiting people seeking parking services from them. As such, the senator reckoned that access to hospitals, educational institutions and other places offering essential services might be hindered due to the exorbitant parking fees. Charging entry fees, the senator noted, amounts to double taxation as the motorists who would have paid the parking fees will still pay for other services they seek. “Whether the services are delivered by public or private providers, essential services such as health, banking, education and other utilities are considered to be public services because they are public goods that sustain the well-being of every citizen and help in the development of society as a whole,” Ali’s motion reads in part. It adds: “Access to hospitals, educational institutions and other places offering essential services might be hindered due to exorbitant parking fees levied on motorists accessing these services,” The motion to be debated in the Senate on Tuesday seeks to have all the 47 county governments ensure patients, parents and the general public are not exploited by owners of premises through high parking fees when they visit such premises for services. In addition, the senator has asked lands and Physical Planning CS Farida Karoney in collaboration with the Council of Governors to develop a policy framework to create an enabling environment for protection of motorists accessing essential services from paying exorbitant parking fees.
