The government plans to employ more doctors to fix the existing shortage, Health CS Mutahi Kagwe has said. He did not, however, reveal how many doctors will be hired. "Even before the beginning of Covid-19 we were still short of doctors and as we are aware, we very quickly got some hospital staff, doctors and other people and health workers on contract basis and some of them have expired, and we are looking at renewing them once again,‚Äù he said. Currently, there are 9,826 doctors licensed to practice in Kenya. Of the number, 2,606 are specialists in various fields. One doctor serves at least 5,000 people. The World Health Organization recommends at least 23 doctors, nurses and midwives per 10,000 people. This means there is a shortage of at least 370,000 nurses and 149,000 doctors. The Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union and clinicians have been pushing the government to employ more doctors. The announcement comes barely two days after the doctors' union raised concerns over plans by the government to bring in more specialists from Cuba. KMPDU secretary general Chibanzi Mwachonda said Kenya has more than enough specialists to treat citizens.
