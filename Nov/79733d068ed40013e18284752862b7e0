Embu church leaders have been told to stop 'knocking down faithful' during prayers as one way of preventing the spread of Covid-19. Embu County Interfaith Council treasurer Bishop Mike Ngari said they had decided that preachers should also stop laying their hands on their faithful and instead pray for them from a safe distance. Ngari, who is also the chairman of the Assemblies of Pentecostal Churches and Ministries, said worshippers can easily spread the virus if they fall on each other. “Pentecostal churches have resolved not to be placing hands on people or knocking them down during prayers. If a person falls on another, he or she might get infected," he said "For this reason, we resolved that we should pray for people when they are seated. The God who hears our prayers when they come forward [at the altar], will still hear us.” Ngari spoke during a meeting on the prevention of Covid-19 at the Full Gospel Churches of Kenya in Embu. Council chairman Bishop Samuel Nginyi of the Redeemed Gospel Church and Bishop Paul Kariuki of Embu Catholic Diocese attended. Nginyi and Kariuki said some residents continue to ignore the Covid-19 protocols as many of them do not wear masks or keep social distance. The leaders threatened to shut down any church that does not obey the protocols. They, however, said most churches were doing their best to follow government guidelines.
