Political parties will pursue the Building Bridges Initiative campaigns separately and not under ODM leader Raila Odinga, former Medical Services minister Amukowa Anangwe has said. He said on Tuesday that ANC will campaign for the document in Western while popularising its leader Musalia Mudavadi. "We're going to campaign as ANC alongside other like-minded outfits, but we're not going to be surrogates of anyone by joining teams we have not participated in their formation," Anangwe told the Star on the phone. "In Luhyaland we will be saying BBI na Musalia. Let them form their own teams, and we shall form ours. We are going to support BBI for ourselves and not for Raila or any other person." President Uhuru Kenyatta and Raila are planning to launch the collection of one million signatures in preparation for the BBI referendum. Anangwe said the BBI would improve the 2010 Constitution by addressing some of the shortcomings in the document. He said if passed, it would strengthen devolution by recommending more funds be allocated to counties and the establishment of the Ward Development Fund. "The ward fund will be a replica of the NG-CDF and you know what the fund has done in terms of development," he said. Former Kakamega county assembly minority leader David Ndakwa said the campaigns for the document should not be used to seek positions in 2022. “We don’t want a situation where some politicians are scheming to make political capital out of the impending referendum. Let individual parties campaign for the document and later prepare for the 2022 polls,” he said.' MPs leaning towards Deputy President William Ruto have held that the BBI process was meant to create positions for Raila Odinga and President Uhuru Kenyatta rather than for posterity of the country. The leaders behind the BBI process have since denied these allegations.
