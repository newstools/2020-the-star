Students joining Mount Kenya University have been challenged to adapt to diverse learning styles, including online. University VC Prof Stanley Waudo said on Tuesday Covid-19 has redefined teaching and learning in institutions of higher learning. He spoke during the orientation of new students joining the university on Thika campus. “In an academic environment with diverse learning styles, over-reliance on one learning style is not the best thing to do. Adapting to all learning styles is necessary for fulfilment of one’s academic aspirations,” Waudo told the students. He said that after learning institutions were closed in March because of Covid-19, MKU transitioned to educational digital platforms. “The university leveraged on innovative and collaborative technologies to deliver its mandate of teaching, research and service provision,” Waudo said. He said they had entered into a partnership with Safaricom to reduce internet costs so learning could continue. Waudo said online learning encourages students to take responsibility for their own studies. It encourages students to learn through solving problems, practising, progressing, and having fun, with real-time feedback from educators, he said.
