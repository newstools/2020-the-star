Politicians have been blamed for escalating wrangles in the Pentecostal Assemblies of God church, with caretaker committee now urging them to keep off. Speaking to the media at Mwibona on Friday, the committee said politicians had led to the escalating wrangles in the church. Philip Owasi, the dean of the bible college, said incumbent superintendent Patrick Lihanda will not deliver for any political leader in the county after failing to help former Governor Akaranga defend his seat in the 2017 election. "The political class belief Patrick Lihanda has got votes that will help them clinch their relevant seat," Owase said. "They are totally doomed and they should ask Rev. Moses Akaranga did Lihanda deliver for him in 2017," cited Owase. Efforts to reach the incumbent general superintendent Patrick have been futile. Owasi’s sentiments come after Vihiga Deputy Governor Patrick Saisi had urged the church leadership in Hamisi to end their wrangles, saying it creates a bad image. Saisi said if the wrangles continue, this may lead to bloodshed, as was witnessed in 2015. Saisi's concerns come after wrangles emerged at the PAG headquarters in Nyang’ori, Hamisi subcounty, on October 20, in which a caretaker committee was kicked out by the general superintendent's team.
