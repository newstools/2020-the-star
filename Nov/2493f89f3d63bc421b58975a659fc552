Posta Rangers head coach Sammy 'Pamzo' Omollo has earmarked a top eight finish as the team's irreducible minimum in the forthcoming Football Kenya Federation Premier League season. Rangers have in the recent seasons been among the teams battling to keep their top flight status but Pamzo, who ruled his team out of the race to fight for the title is instead keen to fire them to a respectable finish. The league-winning tactician with Tusker in 2011Â  banks his hopes on the motivation in the playing unit after the management cleared the outstanding five month salary arrears. The mailmen, who yesterday played the brewers to a barren draw in a warm up match, were supposed to open the season this weekend against debutants Bidco United. However, FKF announced that the league which was set to take off this weekend will now start on November 28, a move which Pamzo said will gift the team more time for their final touches. "From the training sessions and friendly matches which we have had, I can confidently say we are ready for the new season. We have covered everything we were aspiring for within the short time we have trained as a unit and the extra week added will give us ample time to do our final touches. We are not yet ready to battle for the title but I will be seeking to guide the team to make it to the final eight. We are glad the management cleared the outstanding salary arrears which gives us motivation going into the new season,"' said the retired Kenyan international In the meantime,Pamzo revealed that the club's skipper Jockins Atudo had resumed training after recovering from a knee injury which saw him go under the knife in September last year. "The new players have settled well and have brought competition in various departments. We do not have any major concern apart from Atudo who is has been training well but he is not ready for selection yet," he added.
