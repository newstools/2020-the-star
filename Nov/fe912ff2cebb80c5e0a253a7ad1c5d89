Gem MP Elisha Odhiambo has condemned individuals fighting Education CS George Magoha for allegedly insulting an official in Uasin Gishu. Magoha is on the spot for allegedly calling Uasin Gishu Education officer Gitonga Mbaka 'stupid' over the state of Langas Primary School. Mbaka has recorded a statement with the EACC about the incident. The Public Service Commission has recommended the withdrawal of Magoha as the person-in-charge of the human resources department at the ministry. But Odhiambo said the people in the Ministry of Education have conspired against the CS because he has been pushing for efficiency in service delivery and the prudent use of public resources. He said some of those fighting the CS are linked to mismanagement of resources at the ministry. Odhiambo invited the EACC to investigate some of the officials at the ministry. The legislator said it was petty to see individuals in the ministry 'regroup to fight' Magoha, while the Public Service Commission 'cheers'. “Many senior officers have ranted to their junior officers just for service delivery and no one has taken action against them as it’s not a crime to put them on track,” he added. The MP wondered if Magoha’s case is peculiar enough for him to be crucified.
