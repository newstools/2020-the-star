President Uhuru Kenyatta has said that a surge in infections at the county level could attract intercounty lockdowns. "Where there is an upsurge of cases in counties, the government will consult and issue localised lockdowns as may be necessary to tame the spread," he said. Addressing the Nation on Wednesday, Uhuru further directed the Interior Ministry to form an enforcement unit to enforce Covid-19 protocols. He also suspended all political gatherings and rallies for a period of 60 days "Anyone wishing to do such meetings to do so in town halls; to limit attendees to a third sitting capacity of the hall," he said. Uhuru said the positivity rate shot up to 16 per cent in October. "This is four times what it was in September; 38 days later it is most unfortunate that we have experienced a reversal and a serious one at that," he said. Uhuru said Kenya is staring at a new wave of the pandemic. "Where did we go wrong and what could we have done differently? The stringent measures saw the fall of infections," he said.
