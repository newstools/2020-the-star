Israel Scud are firmly in contention for the 10th edition of the annual Chris Oguso Betika football tournament after beating Managa's Indomitables 2-0 in the opening match at Chevavo High School in Vihiga. Charles Chuma capitalised on Sadique Ayew’s defensive howler to break the deadlock in 39th minutes and completed a brace in the 60th minute to put his side beyond reach. Chuma said he was elated with his performance and had his eyes firmly fixed on the ultimate prize. “I am happy we have had a positive start this year compared to last year when we were knocked out on the first day. This time, we are optimistic of going all the way and winning the Sh200,000 prize money,” said Chuma. The tournament’s organiser Charles Onguso said this year’s competition has attracted 48 participants including women teams with online betting firm Betika as sponsors. “I started this tournament in 2011 and the objective is to empower the youth and give back to the community. I came up with this idea after I saw what teams in my county Vihiga go through,” said Oguso who is a Chief Inspector of Police. He added: “I grew up in this county and I have picked Ebwali High School as the venue of all finals because that is where I acquired  my secondary education.” Reigning champions Red Bees have registered for this year’s competition and are optimistic of retaining the title they won last year. Onguso said former Stars’ captain Dennis Oliech will lead a team of former national team players including Musa Otieno, Francis Chinjili, Francis Oduor ‘Killer’, John Shoto Lukoye and Josephat Murila among others, against a local combined team.
