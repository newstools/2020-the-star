The Higher Education Loans Board has been faulted for opposing the proposal contained in the BBI report that requires graduates to start repaying loans after four years. Former Nairobi mayor Habir Omar Kongo said on Monday that the proposal is meant to cushion youths who have just completed university or college and are yet to establish themselves. “Someone needs time to look for a job and settle so that he or she can start repaying Helb,” said Omar, who is also Kanu Nairobi chairman. Nairobi Jubilee politician Francis Mwangi said the views contained in the BBI are a collection of what was presented by Kenyans. The loans board has opposed the recommendation, saying that if the current one-year grace period is extended to four years, thousands of students will miss out on university funding. The BBI proposal also seeks to exempt jobless graduates from paying accrued interest for payment of loans until such time as the loanees shall start earning an income. Helb has however said if this is adopted, the amount allocated per student may also be reduced as loan recoveries shall be affected. The two also commended the proposals contained in the BBI on the expanded Executive, saying it is a sure way of ending the winner-take-all syndrome. They said all communities must be well represented in the national government. They added that the proposal to increase county funds from the current 15 per cent to at least 35 per cent of the last audited accounts would boost growth in the devolved units.
