The Covid-19 pandemic has worsened levels of malnutrition in Kwale, county nutrition officer Rachael Kahindi has said. Kahindi said due to the rise of the cost of living many residents can’t afford nutritious food on a daily basis. She said many are incapable of having three meals per day and end up surviving on unhealthy food. The officer said Vitamin A supplementation was at 75 per cent in July unlike in December last year when it stood at 110 per cent. She said those hardest hit are pregnant women and children below five years residing in the rural drylands of Kwale. “People living in areas experiencing frequent drought are highly affected compared to others,” she said. She said 29.7 per cent of children under five years are suffering from a condition known as wasting. Wasting is a disorder that makes a person weak and very thin. According to the Global Hunger Index report, 26.2 per cent of children below five years are stunted and four per cent suffer from wasting in Kenya. Turkana is leading in wasting with 22.9 per cent followed by Marsabit 16.3 percent, Mandera 14.8 per cent, West Pokot 14.3 per cent and Wajir 14.2 per cent. Kahindi said stunting and wasting were likely worsened by the Covid-19 pandemic. She said the situation puts families at risk of contracting malnutrition-related diseases. The nutritionist said children below two years and expectant mothers are susceptible since they lack strong immunity to fight infections. She, however, said plans to scale up Vitamin A supplements are underway. “The county is looking forward to using community health volunteers to reach the grassroots and help contain the situation,” she said. Kahindi urged the affected residents to reach out to government health facilities for routine supplementation and therapeutic feed. Edited by Henry Makori
