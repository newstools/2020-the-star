The government has released Sh4.3 billion cash transfer programme payments for the months of July and August. The money, which was channelled through the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection, will be paid out to 1,091,166 beneficiaries. The payments started on Monday. Each beneficiary will receive Sh4,000. The programme targets beneficiaries enrolled under the three Inua Jamii cash transfer programmes which include orphans and vulnerable, older persons, and persons with severe disabilities. Of the amount, the ministry said 293,665 orphans and vulnerable children would receive Sh1,174,728,000, while 763,553Â older persons would be paid Sh3,056,096,000. "A total of 33,948 beneficiaries enrolled under persons with severe disability cash transfer programme will receive Sh135,820,000." "Beneficiaries or caregivers can access the payment at any time over the next six months. A beneficiary is allowed to withdraw all or part of this amount at any time during the six-month period." Beneficiaries will receive their payments through the contracted Payment Service Providers which include Co-operative Bank Ltd, Equity Bank Kenya Ltd, KCB Bank Kenya Ltd, and Kenya Post Office Savings Bank Ltd. "Beneficiaries or caregivers are required to produce their Inua Jamii payment cards and identity cards to receive the payments. Those going for payment for the first time must transact biometrically." Due to the delayed payment of the July-August cycle, after this payment, the government plans to effect the payment of two cycles (a double payment) thereafter. The ministry urged the banks to report any cases of forgeries, fraud or theft involving the cash transfer. Edited by A.N
