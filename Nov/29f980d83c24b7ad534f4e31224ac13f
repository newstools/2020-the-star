Fresh from winning the Senior Challenge tournament on Tuesday, Africa junior champion Angela Okutoyi has landed an invite to play in Tunisia in January. The 2018 Kenya Open champion, who recently landed a scholarship at the ITF centre in Casablanca, Morocco, will rub shoulders with the elite of the continent at the mid-January tournament. Okutoyi's coach, Francis Rogoi, said the scholarship to Morocco has opened doors for her to play in tournaments across the continent come next year. "It's a good opportunity for her. Her first event will be the Tunisia Open in the New Year and we are excited about it,‚Äù noted Rogoi. Okutoyi was in scintillating form as she breezed past Cynthia Cheruto 6-4 6-2 in the Challenge final at the Nairobi Club but she said the best is yet to come. "I'm delighted with the win over Cheruto this being the first tournament in seven months. Now that I have a few matches under my belt, I look forward to the next tournament with confidence," she said. Okutoyi said the Senior Challenge tournament is a good way to end the year in addition to preparing for the 2021 season, where she is targeting to be among the top 100 from her current 240 placing. In the men's category, Albert Njogu defeated Ibrahim Yego 6-4 3-6 7-5 in an entertaining match. Tennis is one of the sports that have been given the green light to resume under strict Covid-19 protocols and administrator Nancy Nduku hopes to have international tournaments in the new year.
