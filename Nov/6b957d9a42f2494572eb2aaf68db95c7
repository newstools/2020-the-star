Kenya Morans will be going all out for a win against Senegal in their opening Fiba AfroBasket qualifiers in Kigali, Rwanda. Head coach Cliff Owuor said a strong start will give his boys confidence in their other two games. Kenya open their Group 'B' campaign on November 25. He tipped the Senegalese as the favourites for top spot but pointed out that should Kenya get a result against the West Africans, then the scales will shift. "Winning this game will be important because it will give us a lot of confidence going forward," said Owuor.Â  "This will then give us so much energy in our last fixture against Mozambique. " Senegal and Angola have both won the continent's biggest prize. The Lions head coach Boniface Ndong unveiled a 25 strong man squad that is led by their NBA superstars Tacko Fall and Georges Niang. Morans shift camp from Nyayo Stadium to Moi International Sports Centre, Kasarani today where they will intensify their preparations. Owuor said he will do what it takes to return the national team to the African Championships for the first time in 27 years. Owuor said he is targeting at least three wins in the two tournaments, whose second window is in February. The top three teams will qualify for next year's AfroBasket. Three groups will battle it out in Kigali with the last one in Egypt. GROUP 'A': Tunisia (defending Champs), Central Africa Republic, Madagascar and DRC Congo. GROUP 'B': Senegal, Angola, Mozambique and Kenya. GROUP 'D': Rwanda, Nigeria, Mali and Algeria(South Sudan might replace them) Group 'E' (Alexandria, Egypt): Egypt, Morocco, Uganda and Cape Verde.
