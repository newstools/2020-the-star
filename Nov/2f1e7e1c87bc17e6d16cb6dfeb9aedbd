The move by the Director of Criminals Investigations George Kinoti to revisit the 2007/2008 Post Elections Violence continues to trigger reactions from Kenyans. Kinoti clarified his point on Tuesday, saying that his office was only going to probe threats received by the PEV victims. In his statement on Tuesday, Nakuru County Governor Lee Kinyanjui said the move is ill-timed. The governor said that the Rift Valley region has been an arena of electoral conflict for a long time. “The climax was to be seen in 2008 where many people lost their lives and property. While these acts are regrettable and punishable by law, persons living in the region are more concerned about their future and not the past,” Kinyanjui said. While acknowledging that the best gift to the victims would be an assurance of 'never again would the same happen', he said the decision to reopen the post-election violence files ill-timed and likely to have a negative impact on inter-communal relations. “The scars of 2008 will take long to heal and we must be alive to the enduring emotional burden that families have to carry.” Kinyanjui said that everyone has a responsibility to demonstrate sensitivity, and caution when dealing with persons who are struggling to settle after such a difficult experience in their life. He further said that the build up of negative ethnic emotions in the run up to elections can have a devastating effect after the polls. “We urge the DCI and other state agencies to stay vigilant and ensure post-election violence does not recur.”
