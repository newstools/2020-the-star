Efforts by the Mombasa government to control the number of tuk-tuks operating within the city centre have once again flopped after a court temporarily stopped a suspension notice of the vehicles' registration. Justice Njoki Mwangi suspended a notice issued by the county stopping approval or registration of tuk-tuks. Mwangi gave the applicant, a civil society group, 14 days to file and serve a substantive application for judicial review. The suit filed by Commission for Human Rights and Justice (CHRJ) lists the county as the respondent. Mombasa Tuk-tuks Association, Anwar Said, Agnew Omanga and Chrispine Opondo are interested parties. The notice stopping the registration of tuk-tuks was dated October 9 and signed by Transport CEC Geoffrey Nato. Nato said they were concerned with the increasing numbers of tuk-tuks operating in the CBD and the subsequent disruption of traffic they had caused. He directed the transport chief officer to suspend approval of tuk-tuk operations within the CBD as the county audits the number of those already in operation and comes up with appropriate measures to address the mess. But the applicant said the notice was biased and unfair and was made in bad faith as the residents and operators were never given an opportunity to be heard. The commission said commuters, owners and sellers of tuk-tuks are set to suffer if the countyâ€™s decision is left unchallenged. It said the reason given by the CEC was not strong enough to warrant the suspension. The civil society group said hundreds of Mombasa youths who highly depend on the three-wheelers are set to be rendered jobless if the notice is implemented.  Edited by P.O
