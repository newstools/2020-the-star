West Ham vs Fulham 07.11.2020 11pm Fulham received a massive boost when beating West Bromwich Albion on Monday. The win took them up to 17th in the table and they now travel to West Ham United who are 14th in the Premier League. Neither of these clubs win on a regular basis so a bet on a home or away win is a risky one to take here. Fulham returned to the Premier League this season and have struggled with just a single point from their first six league games. Then on Monday, that first win of the league season finally arrived as they beat West Brom 2-0. Both goals came early on and the win took them out of the relegation zone and if the season ended today, they'd be delighted. Away form this season has seen them earn just one point but they have scored four goals. They are yet to concede a first-half league goal at home and since the start of last season, scoring first as hosts has been profitable. They also haven’t lost any of the last ten home league matches H2Hs, with two of the last three producing a goal inside the first five minutes. In the match, both teams are nearly equal strength. The result of the game seems to be completely open. A small advantage for the away team but a possible draw to cover the bet is also a good way to minimize the risk.

In that match, Union Berlin managed 40% possession and 9 attempts on goal with 6 of them on target. Union Berlin have been on a persistent run of goalscoring form, netting in one hundred percent of their last 6 games. Recent history favours Union, who were unbeaten last Bundesliga season against promoted sides winning both home games ‘to nil’. Union are unbeaten in their last two Bundesliga home games each time scoring exactly once before HT. After a loss in their previous game against Borussia Dortmund in Bundesliga 1 competition, Arminia Bielefeld will be hoping to turn things around here. In that game, Arminia Bielefeld managed 25% possession and 5 attempts on goal with 2 of them on target. At the other end, Borussia Dortmund had 21 shots on goal with 10 of them on target. Mats Hummels (53', 71') scored for Borussia Dortmund.The stats tell the story, and Arminia Bielefeld have been scored against in 5 of their last 6 games, letting opponents get 10 goals overall. Defensively, Bielefeld have been far from perfect. Though yet to score a Bundesliga goal before the 51st minute this season, Bielefeld have still managed to open the scoring in two matches this season, avoiding defeat both times. Naturally, Bielefeld are yet to lead at HT this Bundesliga season, while each of the three matches they trailed at the break ended in defeat. Meanwhile, each of Bielefeld’s three away league matches have seen the same result at both HT and FT. Both the losses saw Bielefeld concede the opening goal between the 16th-30th minutes of play.

Man City are eager to regain the domestic trophy, and, following a slow start to the season, they have been showing signs of improvement of late. Gabriel Jesus marked his return from injury with a goal as City beat Olympiakos to maintain their 100% record in the Champions League on Wednesday. Jesus came off the bench to score City’s second and is now in contention for a place in the starting XI this weekend. His return is a timely one, particularly with Sergio Aguero unlikely to be back in action until after the international break. Benjamin Mendy and Fernandinho are also ruled out of Sunday’s clash, but manager Pep Guardiola has no other major injury concerns. While Liverpool are yet to concede a goal in Europe, it has been a different story in the Premier League during the early part of the season. Although still favourites to retain the title, they have run into the usual second-season problems with injuries and resolute opposition. The Reds have conceded 15 goals in their seven league outings to date and have kept just one clean sheet during that time. Liverpool, on the other hand, should welcome Matip, Thiago, and Keita back to the squad, while Fabinho, Chamberlain, and aforementioned Van Dijk are definitely out of contention. City triumphed 4-0 in their last meeting in July, although Liverpool had already clinched the title by that point. That result was the third successive time City have won this corresponding fixture, and it would be no surprise to see them enhance that record this weekend or even a draw.
