Kisumu All Stars coach Andrew Aroka has warned his charges against being complacent ahead of their second leg promotion/relegation play off against Vihiga United at Moi Stadium in Kisumu on Wednesday. All Stars won 2-1 against Vihiga at Mumias Complex on Saturday but Aroka noted that despite the advantage, they will take the return leg seriously. “We are not going to let the guard down despite scoring two away goals. We are not safe yet so we have to take the second leg seriously. This is a very critical game for us,” said Aroka. He hailed his players for the win in Mumias saying they gave their all. “They fought gallantly and I want them to maintain the same spirit in the second leg so that we finish off the job. We expect a tough match against on Wednesday but I’m confident my boys will rise to the occasion,” added the tactician. During the game, Willis Otenda and Shadrack Omondi scored for Kisumu All Stars while Dennis Wafula scored Vihiga United’s lone goal. Kisumu Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o congratulated the team for the first leg win. “Congratulations to our own Kisumu All Stars for beating Vihiga United 2-1 in the first leg of relegation/promotion play off. Well done Otenga,” the Governor tweeted. At the same time, AFC Leopards have completed the signing of winger Peter Thiong’o from Kakamega Homeboyz. The club confirmed the signing on their Twitter handle. “AFC Leopards  is delighted to confirm the signing of winger Peter Thiong'o from Kakamega Homeboys on a two years contract.” He will don jersey number 14.
