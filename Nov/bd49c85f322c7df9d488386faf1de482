Gem MP Elisha Odhiambo has condemned hat he termed as 'crooks' in the Education ministry for regrouping to fight CS George Magoha. Magoha is on the spot for allegedly insulting Uasin Gishu education officer during a recent inspection tour of a school. It’s alleged Magoha insulted Uasin Gishu County director of education Gitonga Mbaka over the state of Langas Primary School. The Public Service Commission has already recommended the withdrawal of Magoha as the person-in-charge of the Human Resources department at the ministry. Odhiambo has differed with the move saying some people in the ministry of education have ill-intentions towards Magoha. The MP said some in the ministry have been used to do things differently by stealing from the government and now have conspired against the CS to advance their agenda. The MP asked the president not to be hoodwinked by conmen in the ministry of education who want Magoha out of the ministry to continue stealing from the government. “Many senior officers have ranted to their junior officers just for service delivery and no one has taken action against them as it’s not a crime but to put them on track,” he added. The MP wondered if Magoha’s case is peculiar to be crucified by the perpetrators who deserve to be in prison for corruption allegations. Odhiambo said the officers at the ministry of education are fighting Magoha because he is not into corruption deals at the ministry and they fear they might soon be exposed/
