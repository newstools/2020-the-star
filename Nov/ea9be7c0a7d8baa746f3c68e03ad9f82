World Motorsport Federation (FIA) has announced a plan to support Kenya’s road safety and climate change adaptation programs ahead of next year’s Safari Rally. The commitment was made on Wednesday by the FIA president  Jean Todt during a meeting with President Uhuru Kenyatta at State House, Nairobi. Todt, who is also the Special Envoy of the UN Secretary General on Road Safety, is in the country to asses Kenya’s preparedness ahead of the World Rally Championship event which makes a comeback after 18 years. The FIA boss said Kenya is a key partner of his organisation and pledged to continue working closely with the Kenyan government to ensure the return of the Safari Rally contributes to the socio-economic progress of the country. President Kenyatta welcomed the offer by the FIA , saying a road safety campaign will be rolled out ahead of next year’s Safari Rally. He regretted the postponement of the rally to next year due to Covid-19 but said Kenya will be better prepared to host the iconic global motor sport event. Once again, President Kenyatta thanked Todt for overseeing the Safari Rally’s return to the global stage, saying this will  raise Kenya’s profile as a sporting nation. The two leaders discussed several other programs of mutual interest including the ongoing digitisation of vehicle number plates so as to enhance enforcement of road safety measures. Also discussed was the partnership between FIA and the Kenyan private sector in the manufacture of certified motorsport gear such as helmets. The President was joined in the meeting by Sports CS Amina Mohamed, Head of Public Service Dr Joseph Kinyua and WRC Chief Security Officer Julius Kabiru while Todt was accompanied by WRC Kenya Chairperson Phineas Kimathi and FIA Vice President Surinder Thatthi.
