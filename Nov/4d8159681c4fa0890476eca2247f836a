A Kirinyaga police officer suspected to have killed his colleague while on night duty failed for the second time to take a plea because he had not yet taken a mental assessment as per the request of the DCI. Luka Kimuge, 52, was arraigned before Kerugoya senior resident magistrate Erick Wambo after the lapse of the two-week period investigators had requested. The suspect was first arraigned at Baricho law courts . However, the prosecution requested for adjournment of the case so as to pave way for a mental assessment that is to be carried out at the Murang'a County Referral Hospital. Wambo directed that the suspect continues being remanded at Baricho police station and brought before court on December 2 to take a plea. Kimuge is suspected to have fatally shot his colleague James Oburu, 32, earlier in the month after a quarrel broke out between them. At the time of the incident, it is alleged that both officers from Ndiriti police post were armed with G3 rifles while guarding Gathambi coffee factory in Kirinyaga West subcounty.
