Nakuru Governor Lee Kinyanjui has raised concerns as Covid-19 cases continue to surge in interior parts of the county. "Areas like Subukia and Olenguruone, which are way off the main commercial arteries, have recorded coronavirus infections in alarming numbers," the governor said in a statement Monday. In Nakuru, close to 4,500 cases of Covid-19 have been confirmed. Of the number, 68 cases are KCSE candidates and five teachers in one of the secondary schools in the county. In another high school on the outskirts of Nakuru town, several students tested positive last week. Kinyanjui urged residents to remain vigilant and uphold the Ministry of Health guidelines to prevent the spread of the virus. He promised that his administration will map-out vulnerable groups and recommend necessary precautions. “The spread of the disease remains a key challenge to the rural elderly, especially those with underlying conditions,” Kinyanjui said.
