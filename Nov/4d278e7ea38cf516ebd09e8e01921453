Siaya has signed a partnership deal with four organisations to help revive the growing of improved varieties of tomatoes in idle greenhouses abandoned by farmers. The improved new tomato varieties to be planted will include Anna F1, Talyka F1 and Chonto F1. Agriculture chief officer Charles Siso said the department will collaborate with Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organisation (Kalro) Embu and the University of Nairobi. Others include Jomo Kenyatta University of Science and Technology and Kenya Plant Health Inspectorate Services (KEPHIS). Siso said the project, which will be funded by Kenya Climate-Smart Agriculture Project (KCSAP), involves research, demonstrations, training and identification of viable sites. He said the collaboration will help revive the sustainable growing of tomatoes as an income-generating venture. Siaya county KCSAP coordinator Willis Atyangâ€™ said the funding would be used in the training of farmers, purchase of tomato seedlings, research and transport. The officials were speaking in Gem subcounty during a field tour of some of the abandoned greenhouses. A section of farmers interviewed said they abandoned growing of tomatoes in greenhouses because of poor harvests. Others cited lack of reliable sources of water and transport of the produce to markets.
