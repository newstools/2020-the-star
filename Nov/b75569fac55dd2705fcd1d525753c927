Nairobi governor Mike Sonko has publicly declared that he is ready to go home. Minority Leader Michael Ogada with the support of 82 MCAs intend to impeach the Governor over Sh37.2 billion county budget. Ogada wants Sonko ejected based on four charges including gross violation of the Constitution. Nairobians have until Wednesday next week to submit their views in support or against the planned impeachment of the governor. But Sonko via Twitter on Friday night put on a brave face saying that he isnot afraid of any outcome. "I'm ready to go home as I said before there's life after politics. My father was not a politician," Sonko said. Sonko claimed that he did not need to be saved from the process an indication that the governor had lost hope. "I don't need to be saved, I will stand firm like the Senate when they were dealing with the County Revenue Bill," he said. "I will not, I shall not and I'm not going to append my signature to give funds to an illegal entity." A total of 86 out of 122 MCA have appended their signatures to the motion, surpassing the threshold required to table a notice of impeachment motion. MCAs allied to Governor Mike Sonko had said the plot to  impeach the county boss is over his refusal to assent to the bill on the Sh37.5 billion 2020-21 budget. They allege that impeachment was the top agenda of two meetings held on Monday and Tuesday at Capital Hill. The Tuesday meeting was attended by the county assembly leadership which, however, said the gatherings were about the Building Bridges Initiative. The house leadership comprises the speaker, deputy speaker, Majority and Minority leaders, deputy Majority and Minority leaders, Majority and Minority Chief Whips and their deputies. In February, a court saved Sonko from impeachment after he was accused of a litany of misdeeds, including abuse of office and financial mismanagement. Sonko says he will not grant the Maj-Gen Mohamed Badi-led NMS Sh27.1 billion, its share of the budget.
