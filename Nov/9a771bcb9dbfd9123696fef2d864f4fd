Poor infrastructure, lack of sponsorship and unavailability of players are some of the challenges facing national hockey teams as they prepare for the African Cup of Nations North East Africa qualifiers next year. Kenya Hockey Union secretary general Wycliffe Ongori said for these reasons, the national teams cannot invite strong opponents for friendly matches in Nairobi or travel abroad for the same. “The City Park Stadium has not been upgraded to international standards and therefore no team would want to come and play in Kenya. In addition, international teams only want to play in matches that add to their points in the FIH rankings,” said Ongori. The former Jamhuri High School captain said the union is forced to provide alternatives to try to convince their opponents while lack of funds makes it tougher for Kenyan teams to travel abroad. “It is difficult for us to make arrangements to go and play abroad. When we were at the helm of the world, Kenya played in many international tournaments, particularly in India and Pakistan. If we had sponsors we wouldn’t mind. These players would go and play hockey outside Africa but all is not lost,” added Ongori. The sport is, however, on an upward trajectory according to Ongori, who said the men’s junior side qualified for Youth Olympic Games in 2018, Buenos Argentina without playing an international friendly match. “Our youth team made it to the world show two years ago. That shows that we have the talent and doing the right thing even though they did so without any friendlies. In fact, things are looking up,” said Ongori.
