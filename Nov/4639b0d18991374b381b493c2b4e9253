Seven MCAs in Malava have declared their support for the Building Bridges Initiative document. The MCAs said the document had captured the changes they wanted and that is why they support it. The ward reps, who are drawn from various political parties, spoke to the press outside Malava CDF office at the weekend. Batali-Chegulo MCA Kevin Mahelo, who was elected on a Jubilee ticket, said the ward fund will help mama mbogas. “Money coming directly to the ward level without going through the county executive will boost development and for that, the BBI should be supported,” he said. Mahelo said the oversight role of the MCAs will now be effective since no one will be worried about being denied development by the county executive when he or she questions them on the use of public funds. West Kabras ward rep David Ndakwa said ANC is advocating for money to come to the ward level, the independence of the Judiciary, a powerful Senate to check devolution and an independent police service. "All of these have been provided for in the document,” he said. East Kabras MCA Lazarus Luchebeleli said the money set aside for a referendum should be used in the fight against Covid-19 because "over 70 per cent of Kenyans are supporting the BBI". “I want to ask President Uhuru Kenyatta to use the money in fighting the pandemic that is killing our people. We have lost senior doctors and many other important people in this country to Covid-19 and it has become a major concern that should be tackled urgently,” he said. The MCAs said they will rally their people at the ward level to endorse and pass the document because the constituency will be divided into two to create more jobs and take services and development closer to their people. Other MCAs present were Jason Lutomia (Chemuche), Samson Tali (South Kabras), Jacob Luvisia (Manda-Shivanga) and Mildred Walubengo (nominated).
