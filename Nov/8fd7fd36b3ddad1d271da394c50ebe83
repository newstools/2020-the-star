Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua has pledged to help a girl back to school after she wrote a heartfelt letter to the president. In a letter to President Uhuru Kenyatta dated November 10, Philomena Mutheu, 17 , said she is  ‘an orphan going through unbearable challenges that needed intervention.’ “I am not in school, I was sent home a week ago due to unpaid school fees and other basic needs,” Mutheu who is a form four candidate at St Mary’s school said. In the handwritten document, Mutheu said she is always top ten in her class adding that she has no one to support her. “..this has led to a lot of stress and depression. I aspire to be a teacher but I have lost hope in life. I need a lot of guidance and counseling to gain strength,” she said. “May the almighty give you strength to continue leading us . I look forward to hearing from you.” This letter that went viral on social media on Tuesday evening attracted the attention of Mutua who pledged to help her. “I feel her pain. When I was in Form 2 I dropped out of school for lack of fees and was saved by a church elder who paid for me. I will personally ensure Philomena is back in school and gets to sit for her exams,” Mutua said. “This courageous girl has highlighted the plight of many poor students in all counties all over Kenya where we are supposed to have “free” primary and secondary school education.” Mutua said that he suspects others in her school have also been sent home. “Kenya needs to start afresh where all are given a chance. Although secondary education is not devolved, I will ensure she is fine. Like we quietly and privately do for many students in Kenya,” he said. “Lillian and I will support her and others in our own private capacities. I am who I am because of the support I received, so this is personal to me.”
