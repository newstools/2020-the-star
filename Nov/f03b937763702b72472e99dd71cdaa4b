The police have arrested a middle-aged man suspected to have killed his brother in Kahuro, Murang’a. Eliud Kung'u and Obadiah Munyoroku are said to have engaged in a fight on Saturday evening. The fight escalated, leading to the murder at their home in Muriranjas. Muriranjas assistant Chief Stephen Kuria said he received a call at 8pm and was informed that Kung'u and Munyoroku were embroiled in a fight. Kuria rushed to the home, only to find Munyoroku’s body lying in a pool of blood. Kung’u had already left. He said Munyoroku started the fight, hitting Kung'u with a stick. In retaliation, an angry Kung'u took a hoe and hit him on the head, killing him on the spot. The suspect then headed for Muriranjas Subcounty Hospital to seek treatment for head injuries. He was arrested and taken to Kahuro police station. He will be arraigned on Monday and charged with murder. “When I got to the home and confirmed that Munyoroku had died, I called the police and the body was moved to Muriranjas hospital mortuary. We then found the suspect receiving treatment at the hospital and arrested him,” Kuria said. The assistant chief said the incident is the first to occur in the village and appealed to residents to find amicable ways of solving domestic problems. “When people find themselves with irreconcilable differences, let them talk to an elder uncle or even come to our offices to avoid such occurrences,” he said, noting that the two brothers had long-standing disagreements.
