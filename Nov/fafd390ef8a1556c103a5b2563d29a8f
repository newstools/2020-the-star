Detectives attached to the Serious Crime Unit closed in on a fake gold syndicate on Thursday night and arrested two Nairobi businessmen who had swindled a foreigner. The directors of Airlink Freight Limited were arrested after a Burkinabe filed a complaint at the DCI claiming he had been swindled by the two between October 27 and November 16. The man said the two had claimed they could sell him gold. Officers consequently stormed house No 91 in Nairobiâ€™s Convent Drive, Lavington, and arrested Jackson Maina and Awuyene Mbombo. Four metal boxes containing fake gold nuggets, assorted stamps, and gold smelting equipment were seized during the operation. Detectives have appealed to any other person who might have fallen victim to the syndicate to file a report at the SCU offices at Mazingira Complex on Kiambu Road. The two are in police custody waiting to be arraigned on Monday. In August, DCI boss George Kinoti said that they are looking for suspected gold scammers said to be conning investors of billions of shillings. The gang which is on the run is said to be fleecing traders by selling fake gold in the country. The manhunt for the suspects comes after a licensed Korean gold exporter reported to the Directorate of Criminal Investigations about the operations of the scammers. In September, four men who allegedly posed as DCI officers pretending to sell gold obtained Sh29.9 million from city doctor, were arraigned. They were charged with obtaining money under false pretences. Arthur Agutu, George Mbugua, Erick Odinya and Antony Ngeso pleaded not guilty before Kibera senior principal magistrate Charles Mwaniki.
