Diamond's baby mama Zari Hassan has clapped back at critics after they pointed out that she has gained a lot of weight. "I’m the one putting on weight, you are the one who is having a headache, I don’t understand, how?" she said. Zari is currently in Tanzania with her two children, Tiffah and Nillan, to visit their father, Diamond. Her response came days after photos and videos of her surfaced online, and netizens noticed a change in her appearance. When Diamond's mum first saw Zari, she commented, "And you have grown so big." Zari explained she had gained some kilos after being indoors during the lockdown in South Africa. "I have heard some females who are 5kg say I am fat. We’ve been in lockdown for five months going six, and we couldn’t go anywhere or do anything," she said.
