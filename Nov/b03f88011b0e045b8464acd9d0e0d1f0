Kenya Lionesses could face World champions New Zealand, Australia and Wales if they qualify for 2021 Women's Rugby World Cup. The Lionesses were due to face Colombia this year in a qualifier but the match was postponed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. If Kenya advance past the South Americans, they will head to a four-team repechage with the winner of the Final Qualification Tournament — a first for a women’s Rugby World Cup — set to play in Pool 'A'. The pools have been confirmed for Rugby World Cup 2021 with less than 10 months to the ninth edition of the tournament kicks off in Auckland on September 18, 2021. Pool 'B' sees Canada set to face USA for the first time at the pool stage of a Rugby World Cup alongside Europe 1 and Asia 1. 2017 Rugby World Cup runners-up England are drawn in Pool 'C' alongside bronze medallists France, South Africa and Fiji, who are set to make their World Cup debut. Seven teams qualified directly for RWC 2021 courtesy of a top-seven finish at the previous tournament in Ireland in 2017 including champions New Zealand, runners-up England, bronze medallists France, losing semi-finalists USA, Canada, Australia and Wales. Fiji and South Africa confirmed their places through the regional qualification process in 2019 at the Rugby Africa Women’s Cup and Oceania Rugby Women’s Championships respectively. Lionesses head coach Felix Oloo is upbeat about the team's chances of advancing to the World Cup and hoped they can resume training either next month or in the New Year if the government gives the go-ahead. "We have been out for a while but looking at the path to the World cup next year its something we can achieve and I believe in the girls," said Oloo.
