Past victims of post-election violence will record statements at DCI headquarters beginning Monday. This follows complaints and growing fear by most of past victims of post-election violence. Preliminary reports established a number of injustices that DCI boss George Kinoti will address during a press conference on Monday at 2 pm. Some 1,300 people were reported dead in clashes between supporters of former President Mwai Kibaki and ODM leader Raila Odinga. The victims’ legal representative at the ICC, Fergal Gaynor, said the biggest losers of the Kenyan cases were the victims, of whom “thousands still live in abject poverty, uncompensated for the destruction of their homes and their families. They have received almost nothing from the entire ICC process”. Following the 2007/08 chaos, Deputy President William Ruto was charged with crimes against humanity alongside journalist Joshua Sang and former ODM chairman Henry Kosgey. The general charges also applied to President Uhuru Kenyatta, Francis Muthaura, and former police commissioner Mohammed Hussein Ali. The ‘Hague Six’ were accused of murder, deportation or forcible transfer of population, persecution, rape, and other inhumane acts during the poll chaos. ICC terminated their case on April 5, 2016, about a year after President Kenyatta’s, which was dropped on March 13, 2015. The prosecutor, in the case that exposed the ICC bareback,  cited interference of witnesses as the core reason the matter could not proceed.
