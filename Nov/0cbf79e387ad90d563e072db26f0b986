The Nairobi Metropolitan Service has announced plans to reclaim all grabbed public spaces within the capital. NMS boss Mohammed Badi said on Wednesday that the process of reclamation has started.  He said some of the land was grabbed by former leaders. He did not give names. “We have several green spaces that were grabbed, some of them by previous leaders in Nairobi, but we are winding up their legal issues and soon we will restore them into green spaces,” he said. “Digging up all areas that were green spaces is not easy, but we will go as per the maps and plans previously done by the former City Council.” Badi spoke in Westlands where he said the iconic fig tree would not be cut to pave the way for the Nairobi Expressway road project. The push to have green spaces in the city comes against the backdrop of an inventory and assessment of public spaces in Nairobi by the United Nations Habitat. The inventory, which was released in September, is aimed at reclaiming the once 'Green City in the Sun'. It shows trees enhance the landscape, ameliorate the city image, and abate noise through natural mechanisms like transferring sound to other objects and altering the direction of the sound. The inventory indicates that there are 826 documented public spaces in the city. Of the number, 357 are under the custodianship of the county government and 39 under the national government. It calls for the protection, revitalisation and reclamation of grabbed public spaces.
