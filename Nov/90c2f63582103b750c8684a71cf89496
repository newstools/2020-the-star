Nanyuki on Tuesday marked 100 years since it was gazetted as a town. Laikipia Governor Ndiritu Muriithi said over the next three weeks several activities will be held as part of the celebrations expected to end on Jamhuri Day. Some of the activities include cleaning of Nanyuki River, trimming of bushes in estates under Kazi Mtaani programme, medical camps, rabies vaccination and awareness among others, the governor said. Other activities will be announced as the celebrations continue. The town, which majorly serves the people of Laikipia, Nyeri and Meru counties, was gazetted on November 24, 1920 by the then protectorate of the British Empire in the country. Since the country gained Independence, Nanyuki remained a relatively quiet town. However, in the recent past several improvements have been made to boost its economy. In August this year, the revival of the 240 kilometre Nairobi-Nanyuki metre gauge railway line was completed. It started operations by transporting petroleum products to the Shell Vivo Energy depot in Nanyuki town. Mining and Petroleum CS John Munyes, who toured the petroleum facility, said the revival would offer a safer way of transporting petroleum products to the Mt Kenya region and the northern parts of the country. “What this brings is the security of our products. It is going to be cheap and safe, because we are taking trucks off our roads,” he said. “We have had cases of neighbouring countries complaining that fuel transported there through Kenyan roads is adulterated.” Governor Muriithi said the revival of the railway that cuts across the five counties of Kiambu, Murang’a, Kirinyaga, Nyeri and Laikipia that form part of the Central Region Economic Block would greatly boost the region’s economy. “This is a fantastic investment in this region for us to be able to increase the efficiency of our logistics,” he said.
