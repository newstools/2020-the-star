Football teams from Nairobi are set to benefit from equipment donated by a leading online gaming platform, BetLion. Community teams from Kawangware, Maringo and Huruma that participated in a soccer tournament dubbed the Five Star tournament and those who made it through to the semis, went home with kits and a token prize. At least four teams from the specified estates were taken through a mentorship program after a brief session of physical fitness which was conducted by ex-Harambee Stars captain Musa Otieno. They included Ziggy Zaga FC (Kawangware), Kick-off-to Hope (Maringo) and HSC (Huruma). BetLion picked Otieno to spearhead the campaign as brand ambassador. The firm’s managing director Spenser Okach said they intend to change as many lives as possible by casting their nets wider in the community. “BetLion Streets is more than just awarding the teams with equipment. We want to leave everyone we meet, with an intangible value that they can carry on with as they pursue their dreams in sports. BetLion Streets is breaking away from the norm, and has been set out to guide and nurture these talented individuals, in any way possible,” said Okach
