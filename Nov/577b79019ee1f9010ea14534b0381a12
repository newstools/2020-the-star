Disturbing child defilement statistics in Lamu have forced police to seek an alternative way of fighting the problem. They have launched campaigns to raise awareness in schools and communities, with officers deployed to educate the public. More than 100 cases have been reported since January. Child defilement cases are more rampant in Hindi and Kiunga, in Lamu West and East respectively. Teen pregnancies are also on the rise, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic. The girls, not wanting to raise children as single parents, are ending up getting married early. Boda boda operators are said to be the main culprits, impregnating mostly primary school girls. Locals have been urged to report child defilers to the police. County Child Protection Officer Aziz Sadiq warned parents and guardians against colluding with child defilers to hush up the crime. Sometimes the cases are reported too late when evidence has been tampered with. Sadiq said it will be impossible to keep the children of Lamu safe if the community chooses to dine with the very people assaulting them. “There is only so much we can do as an office. The community must get on board to support and provide all the leads. Otherwise, these shameful figures will not go away anytime soon,” he said. A 2018 report by World Vision stated that more than 25 girls had been sexually abused by their biological fathers in Hindi between January and May of that year. The report highlighted a spike in cases of girls molested by their biological fathers. According to a report by the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions in Lamu, Hindi had the leading number of child defilement cases between 2015 and 2017. Edited by Josephine M. Mayuya
