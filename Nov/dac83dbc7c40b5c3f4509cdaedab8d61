Grace Ekirapa says an ex-boyfriend dumped her thrice, in four years. Speaking to Massawe on Radio Jambo, Grace said that before she got into the relationship, she prayed about it and was sure that the guy would be her husband. A few months into the relationship, the guy said that he was not at peace with their relationship, and needed time to pray about it, for clarity. "He told me he is not at peace and that his mind is not peaceful with our relationship," she said. "It was like four months into the relationship and by that time I had gotten an accident and I was in bed, I couldn’t even walk by the time he was breaking up with me." Grace says that after she was discharged, he visited her home saying he was not at peace again. He went silent after that visit. "I started looking for him eventually we met. She went on saying that, she waited for the guy for one year assuming that he had gone to pray about it, a period during which learnt that the ex-boyfriend dated other women. Grace Ekirapa said the guy came back but looking unsure of what he wanted to do, and so she told him to go deal with whatever baggage he had before coming back. The guy disappeared for another year. "I took him back because I had already met his parents. We went out again and this time I knew very well he was not ready, nikamkalisha chini nikamwambia you still have baggage unafaa kudeal nayo. So he left again for one year and then he came back the third time," she said. When the guy came back for the third time, he said he was ready for life with her. They met their parents and even went on to set a wedding date. A few months down the line, he disappeared before the wedding could happen. "This time I knew it’s done. I was tired of being thrown around."
