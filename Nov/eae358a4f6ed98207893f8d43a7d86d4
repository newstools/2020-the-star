Politicians opposing the Building Bridges Initiative report have no strong grounds against the document, ODM national treasurer Timothy Bosire has said. Bosire asked Kenyans to support the document when it is presented at the referendum. “We should not engage in sideshows. The report is good for the country. Constitutions all over the world are built incrementally,” he said. Bosire spoke at Isoge Settlement Scheme in Borabu, Nyamira county where he represented ODM leader Raila Odinga during the burial of Pastor Alfred Rosasi. Rosasi was a staunch ODM supporter. Nyamira Senator Okong’o Mogeni, Borabu MP Ben Momanyi and former MP Joseph Kiangoi were also present. “The issue of the imperial presidency is just a perception. Kenya has very strong institutions where an imperial presidency is not possible,” the former Kitutu Masaba MP said. He added: “The BBI report is a good document. The proposal to increase county allocations to 35 per cent will ensure that devolution succeeds. Having more funds to counties is what we have been campaigning for,” Bosire said. Bosire asked the Kisii community to support the report, saying it will help unify the country. “This report entrenches negotiations to avoid chaos in case of disagreements,” Bosire added. Meanwhile, Senator Mogeni said the Senate will oppose the move by the Sessional Committee on Delegated Legislation and the Standing Committee on Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries to reject the tea regulations. The two committees on Wednesday last week rejected the Crops (Tea Industry) Regulations, 2020 saying the interests of counties were not considered. Mogeni said senators will shoot down the report when it’s tabled in the Senate on Tuesday. “I don’t agree with the report. The regulations are in the interest of small scale tea growers,” Mogeni said.
