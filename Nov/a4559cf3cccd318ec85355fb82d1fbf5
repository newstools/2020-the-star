Kisumu residents want Governor Anyang Nyong'o to prioritise health, unemployment and projects during his third state of the country address on Thursday. The annual event will be held at Mama Grace Onyango Social Centre. The governor will be reviewing his scorecard for the last three years in office and what he intends to achieve before the 2022 General Election. Residents who spoke to the Star on Wednesday said they expect the governor to touch on healthcare matters, especially because of the pandemic. Resident Peter Opondo said he also expects the governor to talk about the infrastructure, the progress of development projects in the county and agriculture. He said that the issue of diversification in farming should also be addressed because residents need to stop thinking of only sugar cane and maize. "This mentality is outdated." "I also expect that the governor will talk about issues of youth, persons living with disabilities and women-initiated projects," he said. Michael Nyanguti, an environmentalist, said they expect him to explain to the county why the fishing industry was not prioritised in the BBI document. Audi Ogada, the Kisumu residents Association chairman, said the governor should highlight the preparedness of the county in relation to Covid-19. "How prepared are they in addressing the issues of health workers protection?" Ogada posed. Apart from Kisumu Urban Projects (KUP) being implemented within the county, Ogada said the governor should state what other mega projects the county is undertaking.
