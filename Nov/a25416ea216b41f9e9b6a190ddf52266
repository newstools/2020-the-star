Former 'Machachari' actor Tyler Mbaya, better known as Baha, has paid tribute to his late mum Beth Nyambura Mbaya. He emotionally wished his late mum happy birthday on Instagram by sharing her throwback photo and recognised how hard it was for her to raise and provide for two boys without breaking a sweat. "Today is your birthday, momma. I celebrate you on this day because I now understand how hard it was raising two fine young men. Love you forever, mummy." A few weeks ago, he paid another tribute to his mother as he marked seven years since she died. He wrote, "Mothers are the greatest gift from Jah, Miss you so much." Baha's mother was an actress popularly known as Wanade for her role on the famous TV show 'Mother-in-law'. She died in 2013 after a long battle with cancer.
