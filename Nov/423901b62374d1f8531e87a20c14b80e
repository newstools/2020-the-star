Football fanatics from Narok County have a chance once more to enjoy Kenyan Premier League action after  Wazito FC decided to make Narok Stadium their home ground. The team have been using Kenyatta Stadium Machakos. Wazito CEO Dennis Gicheru said they decided to settle on the Narok Stadium so as to improve their fan base and help the region in nurturing talents among young football lovers. “The league requires you to have a home ground and we settled on Narok because it is centrally-located and we know the region has talents that need to be tapped,” said Gicheru. Their first home match will be against Mathare United on November 29. Sofapaka have been using the stadium but have since relocated. While thanking Narok County Government for allowing them to play at the stadium, Gicheru urged locals to turn up in large numbers to watch their matches because they are now a part of them. “The Narok people should now be our number one fans because Narok Stadium is now our home,” said Gicheru. He also exuded confidence that his team will perform better in the league when the season is expected to start late this month. “We have signed 13 new players as part of our preparations for the new seasons. Also, we have lined-up a series of friendlies in bid to improve the team performances,” said Gicheru.
