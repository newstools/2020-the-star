Naivasha Subcounty Hospital has been allowed by the court to dispose of 20 unclaimed bodies in its mortuary. The bodies, some of which have started to decompose, will be disposed of at Longonot public cemetery anytime this week. Some of them have been lying in the morgue for over eight months. The majority of the bodies were collected by police from accident scenes and have remained unclaimed. Superintendent in charge of the hospital Dr Angeline Ithondeka said 16 were of males, while the rest were of females. “We have received a court order to dispose of 20 bodies that have remained unclaimed for months, and we are in the process of finishing this exercise,” she said. Ithondeka expressed concerns about a new trend in which families abandon bodies for the hospital to dispose of. She said this was straining their budget and services as the mortuary has a capacity of 25 bodies. The facility serves the counties of Nyandarua, Narok and parts of Kiambu. “This mortuary serves parts of the Nairobi-Nakuru highway, but we are glad that the county government is building a bigger one within the hospital,” Ithondeka said. Meanwhile, police have identified one of the unclaimed bodies as that of 45-year-old John Lungi Wamaitha, who hails from Ruiru in Kiambu county. The officers have contacted relatives and friends to visit the police station before the body is disposed of. The deceased was hit by a car on the Nairobi-Nakuru highway on March 20 this year. The body has been lying in the mortuary since then. “We collected his fingerprints and sent them to the Registrar of Persons who positively identified him. We are calling on relatives to report to the area police station,” Naivasha police boss Samuel Waweru said.
