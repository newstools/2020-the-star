Detectives on Friday were granted 14 days to hold a woman linked to the murder of her co-wife. Jescah Kalumu Mungatu is suspected to have strangled Abbisseneh Katungu to death after pouring hot water on her on the night of November 14 in Makadara, Nairobi county. According to the affidavit filed before court, the incident occurred after the two women had a quarrel while the husband was away. While seeking a 14-day custodial order on Friday, Police Constable Gikoi Nathan attached to DCI Makadara subcounty told Makadara chief magistrate Heston Nyaga that Mungatu was the only adult occupant in the house at the time of the incident. Nyaga granted the application. Gikoi said the matter was reported to Lunga Lunga police post by Sinai Original Slums chairman Kioko Musau at 8pm. “From preliminary investigations, the suspect might have participated directly or facilitated the death of the deceased,” Gikoi said. The police report indicated that Mungatu who is the first wife, had been living upcountry after having a difference with the man. It was while she was away that the husband married Katungu. After Mungatu got wind that she had a co-wife, she visited her husband in Nairobi. Gikoi said a postmortem has not been conducted and the team needs more time to take the suspect for mental exam. He said once investigations are complete, he will forward the file to the office of the DPP for perusal and advice. The matter will be mentioned November 2.
