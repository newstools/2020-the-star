A magistrate's court will on Thursday rule on whether a statement recorded by one of the accused persons in the Sh26 million Wajir graft case will be subjected to a forensic document examiner. It is said that between October 5 and October 9, 2018, Daudi Abdullahi used his office to confer a benefit of Sh26.1 million to Jeff Mworia by unlawfully authorising him as a sole signatory of the county government of Wajir imprest account. Ahmed Sahal Omar, Abdullahi and Mworia are accused of having withdrawn the money in question from Kenya Commercial Bank, Wajir branch, on October 9, 2018. Abdullahi is facing a separate count of abuse of office and failure to manage public property. The prosecution told magistrate Teresia Murigi that they need to subject Mworia’s witness statement to a document examiner since he appeared to be disowning the document. The witness while being cross-examined by the prosecution was having a difficult time answering questions posed by the state from a statement he recorded in 2018. “This court ought to establish the truth and if the accused person is unable to tell whether the signature is his or not, it is only fair that the document he is disowning, the signature be subjected to examination,” the prosecution said. But Mworia through Lawyer Sam Nyaberi urged the court to disallow the application and for the court to direct the DPP on how they will be asking questions. In the case, Mworia alongside Ahmed Sahal Omar, Daudi Abdullahi were placed on their defense in June this year after the court found they have a case to answer. The three are currently at the stage of defending themselves. The court heard that the statement was never in contention from the onset until now. The accused persons were arraigned in court in November 2018 and charged with conspiring to defraud the county government of Sh26 million. Edited by Kiilu Damaris
