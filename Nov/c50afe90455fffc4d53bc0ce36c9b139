Garissa Township MP Aden Duale has accused some governors of supporting BBI to 'sanitise' themselves from court cases. Speaking in Garissa over the weekend, Duale said the governors are blindly supporting the document thinking that it will clear them of cases in court. "They think that when they support BBI they will ensure their cases diminish. Your case is with the DPP and EACC not BBI," he said. "They want to use BBI to escape from their accountability to the people because they are under investigation. We want to urge the president to ensure that every view is heard," he said. Duale said all sectors must be heard to ensure that Kenya enters into a consensus. "If you put everyone's ideas in the document then I will be the first to support the BBI ," he said. There have been proposals from governors, clerics, pastoralist communities and other groups on what they want amended in the document. Governors want the IEBC devolved to the counties, a pension fund for themselves and county assembly speakers, a Senate with veto powers on all bills and deletion of the Ombudsman proposal. Catholic bishops have said the BBI proposals give the President too much power and are also against the creation of a police council. The new proposals might, however, come to naught because BBI proponents plan to start collection of signatures next week. Raila last week said the only changes that will be done on BBI are 'editorial' but no major change. BBI proponents also hold that there will be no further amendments to the report beyond the editorial elements referred to by Raila. National Assembly Minority Leader and Suba South MP John Mbadi said those pushing for further amendments are saboteurs.
