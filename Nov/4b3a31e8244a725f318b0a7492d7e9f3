Kiss FM presenter Jalang'o graduated last Friday with a degree in community development. Speaking yesterday on the Morning Kiss, the comedian thanked himself for finally finishing his studies. "You just do not graduate, you graduate with honours. And they even put it on your seat, 'Dean's Award'," he said. "I want to thank myself for now for believing in myself and making myself go to school when everybody doubted me and for working hard myself. I did it for me." After his graduation, he went to an intimate dinner at Golden Ice Bistro attended by his close friends, among them Daniel 'Churchill' Ndambuki, Otoyo and Alex Mwakideu. The event was organised by his wife. Jalas had previously taken to social media, dedicating the degree to his late dad. "With pride, I lift your name, Jehovah! In your own time, you did it! Today the 13th day of Nov 2020, I graduate! The sacrifices, late nights and now we win! This is for you, Dad. I know you are smiling from heaven! Mum, I told you I will do it! I will always make you proud!" read part of his caption. Another post read, "I just wish my Dad was here to see me fulfill His wishes…You might not understand why my undergrad means a lot to me… But I will live to tell this story why I had to graduate or go to school at my age." He has in numerous times said his dad didn’t have the money to pay for his university fees after high school. He started selling fish in Homa Bay and later came to Nairobi to look for employment. Speaking in a past interview, Jalang’o said his choice of course was driven by his interest in politics. “I chose community development because as MP for Lang’ata constituency, I have to be able to take care of community matters,” he said.
