Some Machakos MCAs have said there's no reason to panic after their speaker Florence Mwangangi announced she was positive for the coronavirus. The ward reps said there was likelihood that Mwangangi was not infected at the assembly as she had been away for several weeks. “The speaker hasn’t been coming to the assembly for close to a month now. There is a high likelihood that she contracted the virus away from the Machakos county assembly,” an MCA told the Star. The assembly went on a three-week recess on October 27 and there was no mass testing conducted for members and staff. Mwangangi on Sunday said she had gone into self-quarantine after she tested positive for Covid-19 nine days ago. The speaker said she resolved to have all the county staff tested after one of her colleagues started exhibiting flu symptoms. "Since then, I've been receiving treatment from home. Since there is no vaccine yet, I have made sure that I eat healthily, take in lots of fluids and healthy drinks as well as taking Panadol for my headache," Mwangangi said. The MCAs said they suspected the speaker had contracted the virus during one of her trips. “Mwangangi has been in lots of trips outside Machakos county, with the most recent one being in Mombasa where she attended a Machakos County Public Service Board meeting,” a source said. He said those named by the Speaker to might have tested positive were among those who accompanied her to the meeting in Mombasa. Sources who spoke to the Star said they were safe and were adhering to the Ministry of Health directives on combating the virus. Machakos on Sunday recorded six new cases — all in Athi River.
