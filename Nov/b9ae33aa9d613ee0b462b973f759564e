Jubilee secretary general Raphael Tuju has dismissed reports that he is admitted in hospital under critical condition. In a response on Thursday, Tuju sarcastically said that claims of his being in ICU are an improvement from earlier false reports. "They say in media business that all publicity is good. It keeps you in the minds of the people. I can live with that. If any one asks you please tell them that since the initial reports were that I was in the mortuary, the ICU is definitely a great improvement and therefore I will soon be in the general ward," Tuju said. Tuju went ahead to joke that anyone concerned about his well being should send him money. "If anyone wants to confirm that I am okay, let them send something on M-Pesa. I have a special sound for all M-Pesa messages of over Sh1,000 and they should expect a prompt thank you call or acknowledgement," he said. In March this year, Tuju, a close ally of the President, was involved in a grisly road accident while enroute to Kabarak for the burial of the late President Daniel Moi. He was later flown to the UK for specialised treatment.
