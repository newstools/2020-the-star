The Kitui administration has set up eight intensive care unit beds at the Kauwi Covid-19 Isolation Centre and the county referral hospital to boost the fight against the disease. Five more ICU beds will be set up at Mwingi Level 4 Hospital to take care of patients in the northern section of the county. Director of medical services Dr Alan Owino said the county is installing 300 beds in Ikutha, Katulani and Mwingi hospitals for patients deserving admission. Owino told journalists on Monday that since the first Covid-19 case was reported, Kitui had done everything possible to mitigate the impact of the infection. “We have always ensured that health workers have PPE while on duty. Although 25 health workers were infected with Covid-19, we have not registered any deaths among them,” Owino said. He added that by the end of last week, 12 people had died of Covid-19 in Kitui. Kitui county commissioner John Ondego said last week that the county referral hospital was well-equipped to care for Covid-19 patients. He spoke after leading a team of officials to inspect the facility. Ondego said that County Development Implementation Coordination Committee was impressed by the ICU facilities already installed at the hospital. “In the ICU, we have beds that are connected to ventilators and oxygen. We have now been able to debunk claims that there is no oxygen at the hospital. The services available here cannot be found even in the best of the local private hospitals,” Ondego told reporters.
