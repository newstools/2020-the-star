Jayme's debut single 'Yarinya' was released in 2015, and in 2018, he released 'Feel Alright'. In 2020, he has released '2' and 'Long Story'. Speaking of his latest song, titled 'La Tan', which means 'Take it all', he said: "It is a phrase to mean that, for example, when you take a lady, kindly let her be all yours." He is also one of the rising Nigerian artistes who is not signed to any record label. He aspires to start a record label to support other new acts.
