Residents of Riting in West Pokot have started cashing in on the fish that was introduced by the county government to Turkwel Dam two years ago. However, residents fear the boon might not last as the dam is expected to spill over soon due to heavy rains in the region. They have been advised to move to safer areas to avoid a disaster. The dam can hold up to 1150 cubic metres of water. The current level is 1142 cubic metres. Businessman Samuel Komor said the dam had helped bring peace to the centre as many youths who were engaging in cattle rustling have now turned to fishing. “For the past two years, cases of cattle rustling have not been reported in this area and residents are now living in peace,” he said. Governor John Lonyangapuo said he is glad that Turkwel Dam is benefiting residents. He said apart from the economic benefits, fish has also helped improve nutrition in areas where malnutrition is a challenge.
