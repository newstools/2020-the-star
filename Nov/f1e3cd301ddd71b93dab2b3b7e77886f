The accident happened at Bondors near Simba Cement at 3.20pm. “Those who perished are five male and four female matatu passengers,” Matu said. The matatu driver was admitted to Mariakani sub-county hospital in serious condition. The lorry driver and the loader are also in the same hospital. “It's all because of speeding and careless driving. That’s all I can say,” Matu said.
