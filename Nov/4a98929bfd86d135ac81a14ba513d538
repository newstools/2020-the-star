Koromait dispensary in Lugari subcounty, Kakamega, has been closed for two weeks after a staff member tested positive for Covid-19. Subcounty medical officer Dr Patrick Ndambuki said closure was a precautionary measure to prevent the spread of the disease. “We have closed the facility for fumigation after one staff member tested positive and advised other staff to go into 14-day self-quarantine,” Ndambuki said. The dispensary will reopen in 14 days when quarantine ends. The patient is in stable condition, he said. The officer advised residents who rely on the facility to seek medical services at Chekalini and St Charles Lwanga health facilities. The medic called on residents to be vigilant and strictly observe the anti-Covid-19 protocols to stop the spread of the virus. He expressed dismay that many residents were living in total disregard of the fact the disease is real, serious and can be deadly. “This virus is with us here in the community and therefore we should strictly adhere to the guidelines for the safety of all of us,” Ndambuki said.
