The national government will next year tarmac 65-70km of road in Gichugu, Kirinyaga county, area MP Gichimu Githinji has said. The billion-shilling construction will be the biggest ever road project in the area. Residents are excited, especially farmers who for years have had a hard time transporting their produce to markets. Githinji said the project will connect all five wards in the constituency. “I have nicknamed this project 'The belt of Gichugu' as it touches all the five wards. The road will snake through Kiamatugu, Kamugunda, Karumande and connect to the murram Kimunya Road," he said. "Another bit will start from Nyagithuci, Kiangwenyi, Kiang’ombe and connect with Kirinyaga Central constituency through Kirinyaga University road.” Githinji asked the contractor who will win the tender to build bumps and proper drainage as requested by residents. He also asked that residents be hired in the construction. Githinji said he would have preferred the work be handed to a Chinese firm as they work faster, but was quick to add that this does not mean he doubts local contractors' capability.
