Archbishop of Nyeri Antony Muheria - who helped design health protocols for places of worship - has been admitted to Mater Hospital with Covid-19. He is on oxygen but said he is improving and "now can eat well and sleep well". The bishop, who is also chairman of the Interfaith Council, announced that he has tested positive and has been admitted. Muheria has been part of the Covid-19 response taskforce, guiding places of worship on how to design protocols to ward off the coronavirus. “Thank you very much for your continued prayers for me during these days I am admitted in hospital with Covid-19,” he said in a statement. Muheria said he was thankful for the prayers offered on his behalf, but he still needs more prayer because he has "a long way to go" in treatment. “I am still on oxygen as they continue treating me,” he said. The bishop called on the public to comply with government directives to contain the spread of the coronavirus. He urged people to spread the word on safety. “Finally, please become ambassadors of compliance in our homes, meetings and funerals. Please let us lead the way of responsibility,” he said. Born in 1963, Muheria is a trained civil engineer from the University of Nairobi. After working for five years after graduation, he joined Opus Dei and trained in theology at the Holy See. He was ordained a priest in 1993 and served as an Opus Dei priest until October 2003. In 2004, he was consecrated as the Bishop of Embu; he became Bishop of Kitui in 2008. In 2017 he was elevated to Archbishop of Nyeri. (Edited by V. Graham)
