An assistant chief in Busia County has been slapped with a 115-year jail term. Andrew Odato was found guilty of having incited and instigated arson that left several houses razed. Senior Principal Magistrate Patrick Olengo in his judgment said the 115-year jail term was arrived at based on the evidence submitted before the court by the prosecution and defence lawyers. Odato was arrested in 2016 alongside other suspects and charged with arson after at least 10 houses belonging to one family were razed. According to preliminary reports, Odato publicly made inflammatory remarks regarding the death of Ceremin Ongamo who died after an illness. The administrator is said to have blamed a family in Okame village, Teso South for the death of Ceremin, instigating the torching of the houses and destruction of property. Odato in his argument claimed that the incident happened at night and he could not visit the scene for security reasons. But while rejecting the argument, the magistrate said the prosecution had proven beyond reasonable doubt that Odato played a key role in the events that contributed to the arson. As a result, more than 32 family members were left homeless. “When the houses were being burnt, he did not bother to find out what was going on despite being in-charge of security of that area,” read part of the judgment. “I am satisfied by the testimony of the prosecution witnesses who revealed that they were able to see the first accused person at the scene and even recognised him by his voice on that fateful night,” he said. The magistrate said Odato betrayed the people he was charged with the responsibility of taking care of as an administrator by taking sides. “A prosecution witness said she identified the first accused through the crack of the door. She even identified the clothes the accused person was wearing. I find the identification free from any error if indeed the first accused person was at the scene,” read the judgment.
