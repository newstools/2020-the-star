Giant Telco Safaricom has invited women who are unable to control urine or stool to a free Fistula treatment camp. The free treatment will be at Machakos Level 5 Hospital from November 21-27, 2020. This message was sent widely to all Safaricom users on Thursday morning. Every year, an estimated 3,000 Kenyan women develop fistula and to date, at least 30,000 are living with the condition classified as a disability. Obstetric fistula is a severe injury which occurs mostly due to prolonged obstructed labour. It is common for women who deliver without skilled attendants. It creates an opening between the urinary tract and vagina, or between the vagina as the colon/rectum. This causes uncontrolled, continuous leakage of urine and/or faecal matter. The condition is treatable through corrective surgery available in a few hospitals. Only eight surgeons are active in fistula work. Surgery costs about Sh75,000 at KNH and as much as Sh500,000 at the Nairobi Hospital.
