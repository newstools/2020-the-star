 The Nairobi Metropolitan Services on Wednesday started an eight-day staff validation to weed out imposters. The exercise targets all workers under the Compliance and Enforcement Directorate. It will be overseen by an ad-hoc NMS committee between 8am and 4pm. The committee is expected to report on its findings 14 days after the completion of the job. All staff, including those off-duty and on leave, are required to present themselves at their respective stations or the venues indicated for the validation exercise,  NMS director of Compliance, Enforcement and Delivery Rachel Maina said in a notice. Each worker is required to present his/her letter of secondment to NMS from Nairobi City County Government and original national identification card to the  validating panelists. The other documents include letter of appointment, last promotion letter if any, academic certificates, professional certificates and the last payslip. "Note that the documents should be both original and photocopies for each. Please expedite,” the notice, which is copied to NMS deputy director-general Kang’ethe Thuku and the director of Human Resource Management and Development, states. The reporting stations are Waithaka sub-county offices, Lady North offices, Inspectorate Training School at Kibra and Dagoretti, Embakasi Social Hall, Kayole Social Hall and Embakasi West sub-county offices. The others are Makadara Social Hall, Madaraka sub-county offices, Mathare sub-county offices, Kasarani sub-county offices, Roysambu sub-county offices, Ruaraka sub-county offices and City Park. There are 6,852 employees seconded to NMS, the majority under the Directorate of Compliance and Enforcement. The NMS has been concerned about "imposters who mislead the public and give false information" about it and the affiliated services.
