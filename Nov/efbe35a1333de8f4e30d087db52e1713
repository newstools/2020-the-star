Portugal Vs France Saturday 22:45 Portugal host France with the winner expected to go on and finish top of Group on the final match-day. Both teams head into this weekend’s crucial qualifier in excellent form. Portugal are unbeaten in their last five outings, securing three wins and two draws. France are also unbeaten in their last five international matches, picking up four wins and one draw. France have won the majority of their recent matches against Portugal, but the last two meetings have produced a win for Portugal and a draw, just last month. Of their last 26 encounters, France have won 18, drawn two and lost six, but Portugal have improved significantly over recent years and offer much more of a challenge these days.

Germany are second in the group, unbeaten after four games, and level on six points with third-placed Ukraine, but with a better goal difference. Ukraine’s unexpected win against Spain last time out has reinvigorated their campaign. Question marks remain over Germany’s backline with Joachim Low’s side yet to keep a clean sheet in the group stage so far, but whilst Ukraine do have the firepower to find the net in this game, the strength in depth of the Germans should prove the difference in this match.

If they beat England, and Denmark drop points against Iceland, Roberto Martinez’ side will open up an unassailable lead at the top of the section. They have won their last ten competitive home games, scoring 46 goals in the process. England are third, tied with second-placed Denmark on seven points, but with a slightly inferior goal difference. The Three Lions have won their last four competitive away games without conceding. England will be without Liverpool rising star Trent Alexander-Arnold, who suffered an injury in the Premier League derby against Man City while Reece James and Harry Maguire are both banned for the visitors. With three wins, one draw and one defeat from their last five international matches, Belgium and England are level in the form guides heading into Sunday’s big clash. These two countries have met a total of nine times before. With four wins, two draws and just three defeats, England lead the head-to-head record. Belgium have only beaten England once at home before, and that was on penalties back in 1998.
