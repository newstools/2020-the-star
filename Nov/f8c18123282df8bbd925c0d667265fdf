West Pokot leaders have resolved to support the Building Bridges Initiative report and called on the government to distribute copies to residents. Led by Governor John Lonyangapuo, the leaders held a consultative meeting at Kishaunet grounds and agreed to support the BBI reform proposals. The leaders hired experts to help explain to them the contents of the report. Lonyangapuo, who read the resolutions, said they will, however, push for certain amendments. They affirmed their support for President Uhuru Kenyatta and called for the translation of the report to local languages. “The report should be translated into local languages for easy interpretation and understanding. The report should also be presented to vernacular radio stations so that residents can understand its content and make informed decisions,” the governor said. The leaders also suggested that the prime minister should not come from the same political party to help foster inclusivity. The BBI proposes the expansion of the Executive to include the prime minister and two deputies. “We have agreed on the proposals to devolve 35 per cent of national revenue to the counties. This will mean West Pokot will get approximately Sh16 billion,” Lonyangapuo said. West Pokot Woman Representative Lillian Tomitom proposed that the Woman Representative position should be retained at the National Assembly to continue with the mandate of overseeing the Affirmative Action Fund. The BBI wants the women reps in the Senate.
