Comedian Flaqo Raz has warned his fans against comparing him with fellow comedian Crazy Kennar. Kennar creates the funniest vine and parody videos, while Flaqo creates several characters from a typical African mother through the ‘Mama Otis’ character. Writing on Instagram, Flaqo said the comparison is not auguring well with Flaqo’s understanding of art, and he believes it is only draining his energy. "I wake up every day to this happening mara who is better… It is not a competition, I don’t care who is what, art is a platform to express yourself, entertain, break ribs and teach at the same time, it is not a game of thrones," he wrote. "I don’t care about being or not being the king of comedy.” He added that he supports the great work by Crazy Kennar and other comedians.
