Despite finishing ninth at the World Half Marathon, Brilliant Jepkorir says the experience she gained competing in a championship will come in handy as she plans for her next course of action. Jepkorir, the Boston Half Marathon champion, anchored Team Kenya to a silver medal in a race that was won by compatriot Peres Jepchirchir in a world record time of 65:16. “For now, I am just training after a week of rest," she said. "I am doing light training with my husband and coach Hillary Maiyo.” Apart from road running, Jepkorir is also big on grass where she won the 2019 Discovery cross country championships but revealed she is now keen on the 21km discipline before shifting to full marathon. “I have concentrated much on the half marathon and I want to continue doing the same in the next two years before venturing into full marathon,” said Jepkorir.
