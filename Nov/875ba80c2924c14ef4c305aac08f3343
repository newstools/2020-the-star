ODM has dismissed claims party leader Raila Odinga was caught unawares by changes made to the BBI bill. Spokesman Dennis Onyango on Thursday said that Raila was party to the changes and in agreement with the contents of the Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill, 2020. “He (Raila) used yesterday's (Wednesday) event to highlight the contested proposals that found their way into the Bill as well as those that were abandoned and also to make the point that not all views,” Onyango said in a statement. He added that “However, strongly held, including his, were accepted into the Bill and it should not be a reason for actors to oppose the process.” During the launch of the BBI signature drive on Wednesday, Raila had said,  "Those of you who have been around will agree that the most fair elections were held in 2002. The 10 commissioners appointed by [President Daniel] Moi were being counter-checked by those appointed by opposition parties.” The BBI bill, however, dropped the proposal that political parties nominate IEBC commissioners. The new bill also makes no mention of plans to kick out the current IEBC commissioners led by Wafula Chebukati.
