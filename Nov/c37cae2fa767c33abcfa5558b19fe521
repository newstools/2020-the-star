A former Nyeri MCA has called on the county government to revive and properly equip technical institutions to empower young people with skills. Former Nyeri nominated MCA Eva Githaiga said technical skills will help them start self-employment and create jobs for others. She said many young people end up disappointed after failing to secure white collar jobs after graduating. “My prayer to the county government is that since the Constitution gives it full mandate to run polytechnics, it should take an upper hand and support our youth from the eight subcounties,” Githaiga said. She said the county government could segment each subcounty to have a specialisation of its kind. Segmentation in each subcounty will produce experts in areas of specialisation that are the major economic activities in the respective subcounties. Githaiga cited Iria-ini ward, which she said is an agricultural zone and therefore can create a research centre for agriculture. She said asked the county government to sensitise residents on the enterprise bill that was enacted in 2013 to cater for micro-entrepreneurs. “We hope that the county government is going to ensure that people benefit from this fund. Sensitisation needs to be done because not many people are aware that there is such a fund,” Githaiga said. She spoke at her home at Gathumbi village in Othaya, Nyeri county, during her graduation thanksgiving ceremony after she graduated from Kenya Methodist University with a degree in Business Administration.
