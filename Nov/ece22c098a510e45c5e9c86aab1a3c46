A Facebook post claiming that ODM leader Raila Odinga has been asked by his doctors to take a year’s rest is FALSE. The post, which has also been published here by another Facebook user, adds that the doctors warned if Raila does not rest from active duty, he risks suffering “permanent brain and throat damage.” However, Raila's spokesman, Dennis Onyango, has dismissed the claim, terming it propaganda. Speaking to PesaCheck on the phone, Onyango said the former PM is well and continues with his duties as the African Union’s (AU) High Representative for Infrastructure Development in Africa and as the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) party leader. Raila travelled to the Democratic Republic of Congo on an official assignment on November 19, where he held a meeting with President Felix Tshisekedi and other government officials, the spokesman added. He also tweeted about his DRC visit on November 20th and 21st. The visit was to review progress on the Grand Inga Hydropower Project on November 20, two days after the post with the claim was published. PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post claiming that ODM leader Raila Odinga has been advised by his doctors to take a one year break from active duty and finds it to be FALSE.
