Striking Garissa health workers have until Wednesday to resume duties or find themselves jobless. County Secretary Abdi Sheikh declared the strike illegal as the devolved unit had complied with "all terms of the return to work formula" signed last month. The strike started on Monday morning barely a month after another industrial dispute was settled. Abdi told human resources officers to conduct headcounts starting Wednesday morning and give the feedback by close of the day to the chief officer of health for administrative action. He said locum and UHC workers should not take part in strikes and those who do will have their services terminated. The county secretary cancelled all leaves and day-offs. He ordered HR officers to give him the feedback from Wednesday afternoon. Abdi implored union officials to desist from politicising healthcare services. Early last month, health workers called off a strike after signing a return-to-work formula with Abdi and other senior county officers. The agreement covered promotions, re-designation, NHIF medical cover, statutory deductions and prompt payment of salaries. Other issues sorted out were uniform allowances for nurses and leave allowance arrears to be paid in three-month staggered phases effective from January 2021. The agreement required the county government to start expediting promotions within 60 days. The government committed to improving the working environment immediately funds from the national government were received. The agreement stated that all statutory deductions would be remitted immediately funds were received from the National Treasury. The executive committed to promptly pay salaries since the issue of revenue allocation had been resolved.
