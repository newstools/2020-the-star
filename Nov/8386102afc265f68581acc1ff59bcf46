Nairobi residents will have dry taps for some time as engineers try to repair damage to an electricity power cable at Ngethu treatment plant. The Nairobi City Water and Sewerage Company said a statement on Thursday that part of the plant has been shut down for works. “Would like to inform its esteemed customers that the Northern Collector contractor while laying Kigoro - Ngethu -Gigiri pipeline has damaged underground electricity power cable to Ngethu Treatment plant. Our technical team is on the ground to address the issue,” managing director Nahashon Muguna said. All 85 wards, except parts of Kilimani and Central Business District, including Nairobi and Kenyatta hospitals, will be affected. Residents were urged to use available water sparingly and to be patient as the problem is being restored. Last month, Nairobi water company shut down a supply pipeline along Mombasa road to allow works on the JKIA-Westlands Expressway near Bellevue to Southern bypass. This shutdown was to facilitate the interconnection of the new and old pipelines and enable the release of the road median to the Expressway contractor.
