President Uhuru Kenyatta is set to deliver the State of the Nation Address in a joint Parliament sitting on November 12. Speaker Justin Muturi in a statement said that he had received a message from Uhuru dated October 23, conveying that he intends to deliver the 2020 State of the Nation Address to Parliament on Thursday, November 12, pursuant to Article 132(1) of the Constitution. ".. I wish to notify all Members that a Special Sitting of Parliament will take place on Thursday, 12th November, 2020 at 2:30 pm in the National Assembly Main Chamber, Parliament Buildings,"Muturi said. "...and that the Speakers of the Houses of Parliament are making necessary arrangements to facilitate the special Sitting of the Houses of Parliament." The President is required to address a special sitting of Parliament once every year. The President is also expected to hold a crucial meeting with governors to agree on how to manage the second wave of Covid-19 amid lockdown fears. County chiefs have already indicated that they would be pushing for re-introduction of tough measures to curb the spread of the coronavirus. A possible lockdown and increased curfew hours are among the measures on the card with the President expected to meet the National Security Council later in the week to to make a decision. On Tuesday, Council of Governors chairman Wycliffe Oparanya said counties are getting overwhelmed with virus cases after the country officially crossed over into the second wave phase. The country is currently under a 11pm-4am curfew without any lockdown after the President reviewed stricter measures initially imposed to curb Covid-19.
