A man was on Monday charged with obtaining Sh3.5 million from a pilot attached to Qatar Airline after lying to him that he was in a position to sell him a Toyota Land Cruiser. Godrey Aniala was charged before Kibera senior principal magistrate Esther Boke. He denied the charges. According to the prosecution, Aniala obtained the money from Steve Brian Odhiambo by falsely pretending that he was in a position to sell him a vehicle, a fact he knew to be false. The complainant was interested in buying a car for his personal use while in Kenya. He was introduced to the accused person through the assistance of his long-time friend. The police allege that an agreement was made between the accused person and the complainant. Aniala claimed to be an agent of the original registered owner of the car. Police later learnt that the motor vehicle was not registered in Kenya, leading to an inquiry. The magistrate ordered that Aniala be detained at Kileleshwa police station until Monday for bond ruling.
