Harambee Stars once again complicated their chances of qualifying for the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations after playing Comoros to a one-all draw in the third qualifier match at the Moi Stadium, Kasarani. The wasteful Stars were forced to come from a goal down to force the home draw against the ten-men visitors, leaving them with three points in Pool C. Youssouf Mchangama proved the difference between the two sides at half time after his 36th minute free-kick sailed past an hapless Arnold Origi. The visitors had been awarded the freekick after Victor Wanyama brought an opponent few yards from the area. Mchangama, however, reduced himself from hero to zero after receiving his marching orders few minutes later for a second bookable offence. The forward was first cautioned for time wasting antics which appeared to have irked Stars bench leading to a bitter exchange with him. The burly striker was not spared by the centre referee who sent him for an early shower, prompting angry reaction from the player who reverted to kicking water bottles at the touchline and the match day ball to the stands. Before the restart, Ghost made his first change introducing David 'Calabar' Owino for Samuel Olwande as he sought to seal the problematic right flank. Stars buoyed by the numerical advantage leveled matters in the 67th minute through Masoud Juma with a well taken bicycle kick. Despite dominating, Stars failed to notch in the winner, leaving them with an uphill task of seeking their first win of the qualifier as well as resuscitating their hopes of qualifying in the away match scheduled for Sunday away in Moroni, Comoros. Deputy President William Ruto has gifted the team Sh 1 million.
