Keroche Breweries heiress Anerlisa Muigai says her biggest fear is how she will look after giving birth. Anerlisa, who married Tanzanian singer Ben Pol a few months ago, has been working out to get her sexy body, and it seems she’s afraid of losing it after giving birth. In an Instagram post, she shared her photos and captioned them, "My biggest fear is after giving birth will I go back to this? Daah, the way I have seen people blow up, I am even scared." In an earlier interview, Anerlisa admitted to having an eating disorder that saw her weight hit 124kg and her dress size made it impossible for her to find clothes, restricting her to only three outfits. She decided enough was enough and took matters into her hands. After eight months of rigorous training, she revealed her new weight and workout plan that helped her shed over 30kg. A few weeks ago, she said her late sister Tecra was the one who inspired the dramatic weight loss. Anerlisa said by losing weight, she was able to help her family see Tecra through her. "My family and I miss Tecra so much that I promised I’ll lose weight to her size so every time they look at me they see her, but when I speak, they hear my voice. God bless us all," she wrote.
