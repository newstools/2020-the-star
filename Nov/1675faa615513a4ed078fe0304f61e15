A man who assaulted his former wife has been sentenced to one year in prison or pay a fine of Sh50,000. Julius Nzioka Munyao was charged with assaulting Rose Wanjiru and causing her bodily injuries. He was before Makadara principal magistrate Stephen Jalang’o. The court was told that Nzioka assaulted Wanjiru on November 18 at Mlango Kubwa in Starehe subcounty within Nairobi. He pleaded guilty to the charges and told the magistrate that he was angered after Wanjiru moved out of their house. According to the prosecution report, the accused became violent after he found Wanjiru at an M-Pesa shop in Mlango Kubwa talking to a female friend. He told her to explain why she had moved out of their house and when she failed to give an answer, Munyao descended on her with blows and kicks. He then held her hand and banged her head against a metal grill at the shop. Wanjiru was rescued by members of the public after Munyao picked up a stone and attempted to hit her on the head with it. The accused is said to have warned Wanjiru that since she had left his house, she should never be seen anywhere near Mlango Kubwa. He threatened to kill her if he ever spotted her within the area. Wanjiru was rushed to Nzoia Nursing home in Pangani where she was treated. She then reported the matter to Pangani police station upon which Munyao was arrested. Delivering the judgment, Jalang’o warned that no woman should be subjected to that kind of humiliation. “Do you have a sister or a mother? How would you feel if any of them is subjected to such public humiliation, someone just gets to slap and beat them in public?” he asked.
