Boda boda operators in Naivasha are living in fear after their colleague was beheaded by two men who fled without stealing anything from him. Two men had hired the rider on Monday at 7pm to ferry them to one of the estates in the area. They cut off his head using a kitchen knife in a thicket along the Mai Mahiu-Narok road. Resident John Kirusa said he saw the motorcycle go into a thicket near his home with three people on board. “After 30 minutes, I decided to enquire, only to meet the two men fleeing on foot claiming that they were escaping from a hyena,” he said. Kirusa said he decided to investigate and found the beheaded body lying next to the motorcycle. He informed police at Mai Mahiu police station. Naivasha police boss Samuel Waweru confirmed the incident, saying they had ruled out robbery in the murder. He said the body had been taken to Naivasha Subcounty Hospital mortuary. The murder weapon has been recovered. No arrest has been made. “The suspects did not steal the motorcycle, cash or mobile phone from the victim,” Waweru said.
