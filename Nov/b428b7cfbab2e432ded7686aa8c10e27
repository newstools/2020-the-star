Nigerian singer Tiwa Savage says she tried to kill herself twice for being bullied. In an interview with Black Box, the mother of one said she moved to London with her mother when she was 10 years old. "When I got to school, it was horrible and I had an accent," she said. "My first day I clearly cannot forget. I got to school late and my teacher could not pronounce my name. She then asked why I was late for school. Everyone started laughing. I was teased so badly." She was referred to as an African girl. "It was so bad I tried to kill myself two times. I was depressed and bullied," she said. "At some point, I used to have a police escort me to the bus. I wanted to bleach and started growing my hair. It was terrible."
