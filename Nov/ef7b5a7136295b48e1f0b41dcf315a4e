Fire on Wednesday night gutted the Kisii University Student Centre destroying property worth millions of shillings. The fire is said to have begun minutes to 6pm, spreading fast across the vast centre. The Centre had remained closed since March when universities closed over Covid 19 pandemic, university officials told the Star. Mattresses stored inside quickly fanned the flames destroying everything on sight. Eric Onsongo, a University Registrar told the Star they will await independent investigation from the security agencies to ascertain the exact cause of the fire. He, however, said a fault in the electric cable may be to blame. Onsongo said he had already checked out of the office when someone called to inform him of the fire at the centre. "We have however managed to mobilize fire emergency services who are still trying to contain it," he said. Kennedy Chemase, a student University leader said mattresses, some computers, and several pool tables were destroyed during the incident.
