The wife of Buuri MP Rindikiri Mugambi has pleaded with Environment and Natural resources CS Keriako Tobiko to buy 70,000 tree seedlings from poor women. Doris, who has brought together 112 youth, women and men groups to whom she issued free seeds, now wants the ministry to buy seedlings from them. She said this will help them overcome challenges brought about by the Covid-19 crisis. Buuri is semi-arid and many residents work in flower farms, some of which are still closed. The Ministry of Environment targets to plant about two billion trees towards achieving Kenyaâ€™s 10 per cent forest cover to mitigate climate change effects by 2022. Kenya Forest Research Institute director Joshua Cheboi said he will take up the matter and assured the women the government will prioritise buying their seedlings. He said they are under pressure to produce 160,000 tonnes of different varieties of seeds to fit different climatic conditions experienced in the country. He spoke at Karimba and Ntirimiti where he represented PS Chris Kiptoo during the launch of Rejesha programme, a project to restore forests. The officer said the ministry is committed to achieving the 10 per cent forest cover by 2022 and not 2030.
