The church has been praised for its role in combating the spread of Covid-19. Busia Deputy Governor Moses Mulomi said churches were sensitising their congregants on the need to observe coronavirus protocols. Addressing mourners during the burial of Lay Canon Jacton Koli Sibuda at  Bujumba village in Marachi West ward on Monday, Mulomi said the efforts put by churches had helped curb the spread of the pandemic. "County residents need to emulate that gesture by churches by observing the Ministry of Health regulations," he said. He said the war against the disease cannot be won if people violated the regulations. The deputy county chief said their administration recently lost a top surgeon and county director of revenue to the pandemic. He eulogised Sibuda as a man whose role in spreading the word of God was unmatchable. "The late lay canon was a great pillar of the Anglican Church in the region who will be remembered for steering the church to great heights," Mulomi said. Edited by Henry Makori
