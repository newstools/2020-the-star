 County assemblies have formed a 13-member team to analyse the BBI report and come up with a common stand. The County Assemblies Forum, the umbrella body of the assemblies, settled on its former chairman Johnson Osoi to lead the team. Osoi is the Kajiado county assembly speaker. He was appointed to lead the team on Saturday following a weeklong consultative meeting held at the Whitesands Hotel in Mombasa. Osoi is expected to ensure that gains on devolution are protected. The task force will also develop solutions to challenges that affect devolution. The BBI report was launched last week with President Uhuru Kenyatta urging Kenyans to read its contents and make informed decisions. The report has recommended the expansion of the Executive citing the need for inclusivity. The steering committee of the Building Bridges Initiative also recommended the creation of the office of the opposition leader. But the county assemblies will be more interested in the proposals that increase revenue allocation to the devolved units to at least 35 per cent. Counties currently get 15 per cent of national revenue. Osoi's team will also consider the formation of the county assembly fund, the ward development fund and the health service commission. MCAs are keen on the ward development fund which they will manage. The health commission is being seen as a solution to perennial strikes by doctors working in the counties.
