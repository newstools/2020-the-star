Agriculture CS Peter Munya's personal assistant Kofia Kaulani on Monday urged Meru farmers to pay for the minister, saying cartels are not happy with his interventions. Kaulani said Munya has cut off intermediaries who were swindling farmers and that the middlemen were not happy with the reforms the CS has initiated. He said the cartels are not good people and asked farmers to pray for the CS. “Munya has new enemies each day due to the reforms he is making in the Agriculture sector to transform farmers' lives. The good thing is that he has the goodwill of President Uhuru Kenyatta. I ask you all to pray for him,” Kaulani said. He was speaking at Tutua in Buuri, Meru, where he led the distribution of BT cotton seeds. He was with Munya's Cooperatives adviser Jame Mutia. The two also distributed knapsack sprayers. They urged farmers not to be worried about markets because the government is doing everything possible to revive textile industries. Kaulani said cartels want coffee and tea reforms not implemented so farmers can continue suffering. In Meru, more than 300 acres will be under BT cotton plantations where not less than 4ookg of high yielding cotton will be planted. Mutia accused Meru Governor Kiraitu Murungi of lobbying the Council of Governors to oppose the implementation of tea and coffee reforms for political gains.
