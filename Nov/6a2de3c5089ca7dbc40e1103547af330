Traders on Migori's busy Osaka Street have asked the county government to collect garbage that has become an eyesore and threatens their businesses. The garbage has not been collected for more than five months. Osaka business community chairman Josephat Kisaka said despite paying taxes and levies every day, their trading area is dirty and exposes them to the risk of illnesses. The traders complained that youths employed in the Kazi Mtaani programme  dump garbage on their street. “We have given the Migori county government two days to clear the garbage, which is an eyesore and a health hazard to us and customers,”Kisaka said. He said the garbage attracts flies, stray dogs and cats. Kisaka said the stench from the mountain of garbage drives away customers. “We want value for the levies charged on us and in the absence of good services we shall have no option but to stop all payments to the county government,” he warned. A trader Billy Osodo said that businessmen on the busy Osaka Street are law-abiding, paying their taxes promptly. “We have been prompt in payment of taxes and levies. We will stop until this problem is sorted,” he said. “They are quick in asking for the levies but very inept in offering quality services. We now tell them that enough is enough; we will not pay for nothing.” He said attempts to seek redress from the Migori town market master failed after the official said they lacked fuel for vehicles to collect the waste.
