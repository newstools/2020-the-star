Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital in Eldoret is providing more PPEs and other assistance to frontline healthcare workers following a surge in Covid-19 cases. The North Rift region has recorded more than 200 Covid cases among healthcare workers. Hospital CEO Dr Wilson Aruasa said they are prioritising the safety of healthcare workers. He said the Kenya Covid Fund Board and the Equity Foundation had donated another consignment of 300,860 PPEs. It was the third consignment; the first two consignments were used up. â€œAs we continue managing rising patient numbers, we assure our partners we will deploy the gear appropriately," Aruasa said at the hospital while receiving the consignment on Tuesday. He said the hospital continues to scale up monitoring and treatment. Aruasa urged all members of the public to observe all preventive measures. He said community transmission has risen to WHO's Level 4 and the hospital is continuously training frontline staff. (Edited by V. Graham)
