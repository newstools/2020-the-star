Kenya Morans have lost their Fiba AfroBasket 2021 Group 'B' qualifiers opener after going down 92-54 to Senegal at the Kigali Arena in Kigali, Rwanda. After a brilliant third quarter where they trailed 58-52, Kenya only scored two points in a massive fourth quarter collapse as the continent's top-ranked team wrecked havoc.It was Morans who got off to a bright start, taking a 3-0 advantge after an opener by Desmond Owili before Senegal moved up 6-5. Captain Eric Mutoro buried a three and Tyler Ongwae gave Kenya another 12-10 edge. But slams by Ibrahim Lefaye and Yusuf Ndoye lifted the victors to a 19-16 first quarter lead. Morans started the second stanza on a poor note, committing turn-overs as Senegal broke away 29-19 with less than three minutes played. They ran to a 32-19 cushion before Kenya had their first score by Ronny Gundo. Immediately, coach Cliff Owuor called a time-out to stem the tide. Despite commiting nine turn-overs, the Lions were all over Kenya racing to a 37-21 scoreline before Owili made it 37-23. Ongwae made it a single digit margin with two free shots at 31-39 before another Owili basket had the scores at 33-39. Adul Badji scored after a turn-over by Ongwae and completed a three-point play for a 47-33 half time edge. After resumption, Gundo made it 35-47 as Kenya out-scored Senegal 12-6 with two back-to-back baskets by Ariel Okal, making it 53-45. Kenya clawed back as a Okal and Valentine Nyakinda combination pegged down Senegal who hanged on as the third quartet ended 58-52. The last quarter was a disaster for Kenya as Senegal again raced up, building a 75-54 half way lead through this stanza. Lafaye tallied 19 points for Senegal while Hanna added 12 for Senegal. For Kenya, Ongwae bagged 12 and Owili 11. Kenya return to the courts to play 11-t ime champions Angola on Thursday.
