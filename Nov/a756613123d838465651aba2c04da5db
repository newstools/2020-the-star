Police in Ol Kalou have in the last one week arrested and charged 129 people for violating government directives on Covid-19. Nyandarua Central subcounty police commander Dahir Abdillahi said on Tuesday five public service vehicles were impounded and the owners charged with noncompliance. Abdillahi said three bars where people were found locked inside drinking past 10pm were closed. The county government, which is responsible for licensing, was notified to take action. The police boss said the move follows the directive issued by Inspector General of Police Hailary Mutyambai last week, pursuant to President Uhuru Kenyatta’s directions when he addressed the nation on Wednesday, November 4. "Since the President issued the directive, we swung into action to ensure the rules are followed. We are not going to relent until all residents stop being reckless,” he said. Those arrested were found out during curfew time, taking alcohol before or after the allowed time, not wearing masks and not observing social distance. Vehicles exceeding the recommended capacity were impounded and passengers found sitting in close arrested. Abdillahi said most of those arrested were youths mostly in their 20s and 30s, a high percentage being male. This group, he noted, is also most notorious for not wearing face masks and keeping social distance. He urged the locals to take Covid-19 seriously and observe the government protocols, saying the police will not relax in enforcing the rules. Edited by Henry Makori
