The Pan-African music competition Amazing Voices has opened the second season. The Old Mutual-sponsored competition will provide unsigned musicians from Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya, Zimbabwe and South Africa with an opportunity to show their talent to the continent, while competing for the coveted $100,000 grand prizes. Gospel, pop and RnB singing groups consisting of four, six or eight members are urged to submit their digital entries before November 26 to http://www.oldmutual.co.za/amazing-voices. Contestants should submit a two-minute video that introduces the group and includes one verse and chorus of their song. Shortlisted contestants will be called for closed auditions in the respective capital cities of the five participating countries between November and December. Thobile Tshabalala, head of brand at Old Mutual, said the company has championed mutually positive futures for 175 years. "We believe our youthful continent is endowed with talent and we are committed to using platforms such as Amazing Voices to unearth and amplify such."
