Nyanza Jubilee Party members have rallied behind the Building Bridges Initiative and urged youths to support it. Led by chairman Killen Omondi, the members said they are supporting BBI because it champions the interests of youths. He said BBI contains many gains for youths and they should play role in campaigning for the report. Omondi and party  members lauded President Uhuru Kenyatta for appointing Interior CS Fred Matiang'i in the Nyanza BBI coordinating team. “We acknowledge and appreciate the appointment of Matiang’i in the coordinating team. He is up to the task and with teamwork the BBI process will succeed,” Omondi said. While addressing the press in Kisumu on Thursday, the party members pledged to rally youths in Nyanza to support the report. The chairman said they are fully behind Matiang’i and ready to work with him to facilitate the implementation process. "We are going to make his work easier in marketing BBI in the region to the grassroots level. We are looking forward to working with him,” he added. The team comprising of governors Anyang Nyong’o (Kisumu) and James Ogwae (Kisii) will be responsible for the BBI activities in the region. Others include MP Timothy Bosire, former Gem MP Jakoyo Midiwo and Kisumu county protocol officer Bob Madanji. Omondi said since the handshake between the two leaders there has been peace in the country. “It has created a conducive environment for Kenyans to do businesses without fear. We are in support of the report,” Omondi said. He said the handshake led to the birth of the BBI that is aimed at ending perennial chaos, negative ethnicity and bloodshed witnessed during elections. Jubilee member Sheila Opondo said Matiang’i will help deliver BBI in the region. She said the report targets to unite the country and ensure inclusivity in governance. “It is pushing for the inclusion of women and addressing issues affecting them,” Opondo said. She commended Uhuru and Raila for working together to unite the country.
