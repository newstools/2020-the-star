Three traders are being held for allegedly beating two customers who refused to pay Sh11,000 extra for a TV they had already bought for Sh20,000. Daniel Kamau, Paul Wanyeki Nyambura and Paul Wanyeki Wangare will be held at Kamukunji police station for four days. They were arraigned on Wednesday before Makadara senior principal magistrate Merrissa Opondo on charges of robbery with violence. Police constable Rahab Muthoni attached to Kamukunji police station sought seven-day detention so investigations could be completed. Rahab said that on November 10 at about 1 pm, Daniel Ndungu and his brother Joseph Njuguna went to buy a smart 43-inch TV at a shop on Luthuli Avenue. They entered Bravo House Ramogi and entered a shop selling TV sets belonging to the three traders. After bargaining, they agreed on a Sh20,000 and paid through M-Pesa. They were then told to add an extra Sh11,000 or pick a smaller, 23-inch TV instead, police said. Ndungu said they didn't have enough money to pay extra and asked for a refund of Sh20,000. After the brothers insisted on a refund, the three traders assaulted them, calling them thieves and attracting members of the public who joined in the beating, police said. The two were saved by police officers who heard the commotion while patrolling the area. Constable Muthoni said she is yet to record witness statements and file P3 forms as the two complainants are still hospitalised at Kenyatta National Hospital. "I am yet to collect the CCTV footage and if the respondents are released they might interfere with my investigations,‚Äù she said. Opondo ordered the two be detained for four days after which they will be freed on a bond of Sh100,000 each. The matter will be mentioned on November 18.  (Edited by V. Graham)
