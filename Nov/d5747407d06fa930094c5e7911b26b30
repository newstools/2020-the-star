Mourners at the burial of former councillor Ezekiel Muya of Luanda South, Vihiga, threw caution to the wind by ignoring Covid-19 rules. Most of them failed to social-distance, sanitise or wear masks. Even some of those who had their masks did not wear them properly. This happened even as the country grapples with the second wave of infection. Politicians were no exception. Governor Wilber Ottichilo, Senator George Khaniri and former National Assembly Speaker Kenneth Marende, former county chief of staff Noah Okaya, Luanda parliamentary seat aspirant Albert Obbuyi, MCAs and former councillors were among those present. Despite the sad state of affairs, the politicians acknowledged the surge in cases and urged residents to comply with regulations, saying the virus is currently frustrating the Western region. “Covid-19 is real and is killing and it’s not selecting the poor or the rich, so we need to be more vigilant,” Khaniri said. His sentiments were echoed by Ottichilo and Marende. Ottichilo called for personal and collective responsibility to defeat the virus. He urged total compliance with Health ministry guidelines. "Covid-19 has caused much damage globally on our economy and our normal lives. We have no control over it. Follow state regulations to overcome the virus," the county chief said.
