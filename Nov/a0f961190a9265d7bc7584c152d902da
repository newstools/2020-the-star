Tanasha Donna has unblocked her baby daddy Diamond Platinumz. Diamond and his sister Esma recently commented on his son with Tanasha, Naseeb Junior’s photos, leaving many speculating that they are working to rebuild their failed relationship. Tanasha shared her son's photo and captioned it, "What's popping, fam?" To which Diamond commented with love emojis. His sister wrote, "Tom Kaka, we miss you." Tanasha had blocked Diamond and his family from accessing Naseeb’s Instagram account. "I confronted him, blocked him and called it quits. It was the limit for me, especially since I was loyal like crazy for him. It had been ride or die for me. I had to leave for the sake of my son and my mental health." Tanasha has in the past said she is raising her son alone as the Diamond has not been providing for them.
