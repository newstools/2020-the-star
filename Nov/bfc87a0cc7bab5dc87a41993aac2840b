Aspirants who join Maendeleo Chap Chap early will be given direct tickets, party leader Alfred Mutua has said. Mutua said those who register early will not be subjected to primaries so they can concentrate on popularising the party. “While promoting internal party democracy, aspirants who register with the party early and show commitment shall qualify for direct party tickets in 2022,” he said. Mutua spoke in Machakos after chairing the party's National Governing Council at his 2022 campaign logistics centre. He said he was confident that his party will form the next government. “Early preparations and campaigns will enable us to clinch various political seats across the country, even after political parties that had existed for ages failed to clinch even a single seat, which they contested for across the country,” Mutua said. He said that they had resolved to embark on popularisation and recruitment campaigns across the country with the aim of winning power in the counties and nationally. “As a party, we open our doors and urge those aspirants who want to vie for any political position across the country to come and register with us,” Mutua said. He said that party structures at the polling station, ward, constituency, county and National Executive Council levels shall be revamped to strengthen. The rebranding will commence in the next few weeks. The Machakos county chief said the party recognises that Covid-19 is real and deadly and urged people to adhere to the government’s regulations.
