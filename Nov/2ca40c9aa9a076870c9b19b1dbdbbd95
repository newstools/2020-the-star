Busia residents have asked the assembly Finance committee to use its authority to reduce the loss of county revenue through unscrupulous clerks. Resident Fredrick Ekasiba said Busia is capable of meeting its targets but only with prudent management of revenue collected. “There's need for the county assembly to effect regulations that impose stiff penalties on dishonest revenue officers who fail to give full disclosure of revenue collected,” he said. Ekisaba spoke on Monday during a public participation forum on the Busia County Finance Bill. Most contributors called on the Finance committee chair Fred Musirimba and his deputy Angela Nafula to ensure there is no theft of revenues collected. Boda Boda representative Robert Barasa said the proposed fee of Sh300 per month should be reduced to Sh150 and annual charges set at Sh2,000. Motorcycle Owners Association chair Isaac Obwolo said they are ready to pay Sh300 per month with no other subsequent charges. Caroline Makokha proposed that ambulance charges for referrals from subcounties to Busia County Referral Hospital should be pegged at Sh1,000, while referrals outside the county should be fixed at Sh3,500. Kenya National Chamber of Commerce official Raphael Emusala called for the segregation of the licensing regime, especially those involving women, youth and people with disabilities. The one per cent land and rent rates should be harmonised at 0.5 per cent, he said. Chamber of Commerce member Sebastian Sunya said the proposed survey fees should be reviewed to encourage people to get title deeds. He said charges for restaurants without accommodation should also be reduced to spur trade and stifle the influx to Ugandans in search of similar services. Nafula said residents' concerns will be captured by the secretariat to improve the document when it is returned to the assembly for adoption.
