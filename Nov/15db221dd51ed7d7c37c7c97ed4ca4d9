President Uhuru Kenyatta has sent a message of condolence and encouragement to the family, relatives and friends of Prof Samuel Kariuki Kabuitu who passed on early on Thursday after a short illness. Kabuitu, who was a botanist and an environmental professor at Egerton University, was father of Kepsa Chief Executive Officer Carole Kariuki. In his message, Uhuru described Kabuitu as a distinguished scholar and researcher whose work has had great bearing on education, agriculture and training in the country. “His in-depth research especially on classification and the economic value of plants greatly impacted our agricultural sector which is the backbone of our economy," he said. “Certainly his knowledge in natural resource management and sustainable agriculture boosted the cultivation of indigenous crops and helped farmers to improve production." The Head of State said Kabuitu's research work will continue to be a reference point to future generations as the demand for indigenous crops continues to increase. Uhuru noted that despite his great achievements and exposure to vast opportunities outside Kenya, Kabuitu was patriotic and opted to use his skills, knowledge and talent in serving the country instead of venturing abroad. “Kabuitu has indeed imparted our young people with great knowledge on environmental research not only through teaching but also through his published works," he said. “We will forever cherish his research work on climate change adaptation and mitigation, cultivation of indigenous mushrooms to improve food security in Kenya and the use of mycorrhizae in enhancing reforestation of the Mau water complex,." Kabuitu has authored several books and journals on  botany and environment which have continued to be a reference point to many organizations and institutions of higher learning in the country and beyond.
