Police in Bomet are investigating the death of a man who dropped dead after a drinking spree, causing panic among employees and patrons. The cause of death on Tuesday at 3pm was not immediately known but some people feared Covd-19. The man, a secondary school teacher, is said to have travelled with a colleague for lunch at 12pm and then continued to drink. The two are said to have taken undiluted drinks in a private room until 3pm when one of them departed. After 3pm, an employee went to check on the customer and found him unconscious on the floor. A bar attendant said they ordered 750ml of vodka without mixer. The colleague left. The two had been friendly and jovial, customers said. "When I returned to the room to check on how he is doing I found him unconscious. That's when I raised the alarm and alerted the manager," she said, asking not to be named. The man was rushed to a nearby health centre where he was pronounced dead. Bomet Central subcounty police commander Musa Omaru said his officers are investigating and are awaiting a postmortem report. Bar employees have recorded statements. (Edited by V. Graham)
