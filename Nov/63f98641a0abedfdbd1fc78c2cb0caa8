A man who allegedly entered a woman’s house and stole her panties denied the offence despite being captured by CCTV cameras. Pius Mugendi denied breaking and entering Juliet Mawia’s house and stealing six panties worth Sh1,500. The investigating officer in the case told the court that he had CCTV footage showing Mugendi stealing the panties. Cameras installed in the house of the complainant captured the suspect stuffing the panties into a bag before escaping. Mugendi told Embu senior resident magistrate Jean Ndengeri that he never entered Mawia's house and that the charges against him were fabricated. He denied he was the person captured in the CCTV footage. The magistrate instructed the investigating officer to present the CCTV footage in court as evidence. Mugendi is charged that on May 5 at around 11pm at Mikimbi village in Embu North subcounty, he broke into and entered a house belonging to Mawia in her absence and stole the six panties. The cases will be mentioned on December  17.  Edited by Henry Makori
