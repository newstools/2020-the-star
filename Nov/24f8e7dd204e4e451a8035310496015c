Former Churchill Show comedian Zainabu Zeddy says she does not want more children. Speaking to former 'Auntie Boss' actress Nyce Wanjeri, Zeddy said she would date or marry a divorcee who has children. "I would want to date a mature guy, someone who had a family, who has children like me. We bring up our children together and move on with life," she said. "I don’t want someone who will marry me and start asking for children. If you want me, just know we are not having babies. It is a no for me." Zeddy is raising her three children alone after parting ways with her husband. She said her preferred man should be Luo, light-skinned and know how to cook the local delicacies very well. In an interview with Grace Msalame, Zeddy said she parted ways with her husband last year when she was only two months pregnant. "I got pregnant and after two months, he left again," she said. "We had not disagreed and nothing was wrong, he just left to go stay with another woman."
