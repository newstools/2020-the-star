 Ahero in Kisumu county will on Monday be elevated to a town to unlock its economic potential. Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o will preside over the ceremony at Karanda Primary School. The event had initially been scheduled for Thursday last week but was pushed back to November 2. Initially a town council, Ahero will become the second township to be upgraded in the county just over a month after the commissioning of Maseno town. Famous for its rice fields and as a gateway to Kisumu city, Ahero is among five urban centres that were elevated to towns in a gazette notice on March 1, 2019. Others are Maseno, Muhoroni, Kombewa and Katito. Nyong'o said the elevation of the centres to towns would enable them to access financing from development partners. The Constitution says an area shall be eligible for the grant of the status of a town if it has a population of at least 10,000 and can demonstrate economic, functional and financial viability. The area must have an integrated development plan, the capacity to effectively and efficiently deliver essential services to residents and have sufficient space for expansion. The upgrade will see the county set aside annual allocation to cater for water and sewerage, road and lighting infrastructure, solid waste management and tourism development of the newly unveiled towns. Residents have welcomed the move, saying it will increase business opportunities. Already, Sh15 million has been set aside by the Urban Development department for town drainage and road networks. Ahero is an agricultural centre with rice, sugarcane, maize and sorghum plantations.  Edited by P.O
