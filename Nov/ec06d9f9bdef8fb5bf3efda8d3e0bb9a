Health CS Mutahi Kagwe has raised concerns over the rising number of Covid-19 cases in the country. Addressing the press on Monday in Malindi, Kilifi county, during an update on the virus situation in the country, the CS said that the responsibility to combat the disease lies with Kenyans. Kagwe said the country has to relook at Covid-19 measures in order to avoid further escalation. “It is the citizens' responsibility to combat the disease. We cannot afford to have over 100 deaths in a week. There is a need to relook at measures to contain the virus,” Kagwe said. The CS reported that the country recorded 724 new cases from a sample of 5,085 collected in the last 24 hours. “100 deaths reported last week. This is the highest number we have ever registered. It has been the worst week since Covid-19 struck the country in March.” Kagwe congratulated the county government of Kilifi for the investment it has made in the health sector. “We have managed to overcome the first wave. We now have another wave which requires us to be more vigilant.” He dismissed reports that hospitals have been overwhelmed with Covid-19 cases. "What people are talking about is Nairobi Hospital, Aga Khan Hospital, and maybe MP Shah Hospital which have been overwhelmed...they usually have little bed capacity in terms of infectious disease cases." The CS further said that there will be no movement of patients from one country to the other, asking county governments to increase capacity in their hospitals. He also urged families to discuss and train themselves on how to take care of their family members if they get infected with the virus. "I urge you to discuss it in homes and to ask yourselves how to manage yourselves," Kagwe said.
