Doctor Joseph Birundu Mogendi has resigned as a board member of the Youth Enterprise Development Fund. Mogendi in a letter dated November 18 said his resignation is a result of the Fund's 'inability to serve the youth'. "As currently constituted, the Youth Enterprise Development Fund board leadership is deficiently objective and prejudiced to serve the youth of this great country," read part of the letter. It further read, "I, therefore, tender my resignation as a member of the board and thank the appointing authority for this opportunity". The letter is addressed to ICT CS Joe Mucheru, copied to his PS, the Fund's Chairman and CEO. Mogendi was among three dons from Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology who were appointed to boards of state corporations to serve for a period of three years with effect from October 16, 2019. In a Kenya Gazette Notice, dated October 17, 2019, President, Uhuru Kenyatta appointed Prof. Losenge Turoop to be the Chairperson of the Uwezo Fund Oversight Board. In the same publication, Cabinet Secretary for Public Service, Youth and Gender Affairs, Prof. Margaret Kobia appointed Dr Susan Mambo and Dr Joseph Birundu Mogendi to be board members of the Youth Enterprise Development Fund. Mogendi is a Lecturer in the Department of Food Science and Technology and a Postdoctoral Fellow at the African Population and Health Research Centre (APHRC-2017), a US-based research unit operating in Africa. He was also appointed by the head of state as a panellist at the Salaries Remuneration Commission through Gazette Notice No. 47 of 2018. The Fund was created to help reduce youth unemployment by creating youth entrepreneurs by providing funds, training in business skills and creating market linkages for the youth entrepreneurs.
