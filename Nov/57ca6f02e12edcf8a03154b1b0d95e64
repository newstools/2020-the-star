 Doctors have convened a special meeting for Sunday to discuss their safety after four specialists died of Covid-19 in under 24 hours. The doctors' union said they will hold a meeting of the Special National Advisory Council to discuss the welfare and occupational safety of members in light of the coronavirus pandemic. The four doctors who died are said to have contracted the virus in the line of duty. They are Emarah Ashraf, Hudson Alumera, Jackline Njoroge and Faith Kanjiru Mburu. The union says the developments has stoked serious questions on the safety of healthcare workers, especially those in the frontline in the fight against Covid-19. “Today is a dark day for the medical fraternity, the death of four of our colleagues over the last 24 hours is devastating news to the profession,” Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Union secretary-general Chibanzi Mwachonda said on Saturday. “Meanwhile, all doctors are instructed not to risk their lives as per section 14(2) of the Occupational Safety Health Act 2007 pending the resolution of the SNB penal NAC meeting,” he said. The latest fatalities raise the number of medics who have died of Covid-19 to more than 20. Others include Doreen Lugaliki, Robert Ayisi and Daniel Alushula. Health workers unions have previously raised concerns about the safety of their members at the work place. There are 9,826 doctors licensed to practice in Kenya out of whom 2,606 are specialist doctors.
