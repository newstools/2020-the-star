The Orange Democratic Movement has promised to conduct a free, fair and peaceful by-election for the Msambweni parliamentary seat. This follows allegations made against the party that it was secretly plotting to disturb the peace if they lose in the poll. The parliamentary seat fell vacant after area MP Suleiman Dori succumbed to cancer in March. The Msambweni ODM women's chairlady Hanifa Mwajirani said the party was a peaceful organisation and had no intention to disrupt the forthcoming by-election. “Why would we bring chaos in the only place we call home and struggle hard to build? That’s rubbish,” she said. Mwajirani said ODM party leader Raila Odinga had the handshake with President Uhuru Kenyatta to preserve peace. She dismissed claims that the party is always involved in chaos whenever it is defeated in elections. The Kwale nominated MCA said she is not surprised that their opponents are making such accusations. She dismissed the claims, calling them mere propaganda. She said other parties have sensed defeat as Msambweni is an ODM stronghold. "It's no doubt that they have panicked and are coming up with issues that have no strong evidence, " she said. She warned of stiff competition, saying the party had gained a lot of support. Two weeks ago independent candidate Mariam Sharlet withdrew from the race to support ODM candidate Omar Boga. Boga will battle it out with Feisal Bader who has has the backing of Deputy President Wiliam Ruto. Other candidates include Sheikh Mahmoud Abdulrahman (Wiper) and Marere Wa Mwachai (National Vision Party).  Edited by Henry Makori
