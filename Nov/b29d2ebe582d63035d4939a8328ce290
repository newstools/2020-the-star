Gareth Bale is fit for Wales’ upcoming games against the USA, the Republic of Ireland and Finland, says Robert Page. Bale, 31, was pictured with an icepack on his ankle after coming off during Tottenham’s win at West Brom on Sunday. But Page, who is in charge for the three matches in the absence of Ryan Giggs, says only Aaron Ramsey and Ben Cabango have dropped out of the squad. “We have met up tonight and thankfully everybody else has come through unscathed,” Page said. “That’s the good news.” Giggs has mutually agreed with the Football Association of Wales that he will not be involved in this international camp. He has denied an allegation of assault made against him. Former Wales Under-21 coach Page, who joined Giggs’ senior coaching staff in August 2019, is at the helm alongside Albert Stuivenberg. “It’s Ryan’s team, it’s Ryan’s squad,” Page said. “It will be about us finishing off the job that he’s started. We have three tough games. The first one is important because we want to keep that momentum going into the qualifiers.” Wales face the USA in a friendly at Swansea’s Liberty Stadium on November 12. They then host the Republic of Ireland at the Cardiff City Stadium on November 15 in the first of two Nations League games, with Finland visiting the Welsh capital on November 18. Juventus midfielder Ramsey withdrew from the squad last week with a thigh injury, while Swansea defender Cabango pulled out over the weekend with a hamstring problem.
