Safaricom has rolled out new phone number prefixes starting with 0112, 0113, 0114 and 0115 to meet increasing demand for Safaricom lines. The new phone numbers are available free of charge with customers only required to activate their lines with a top-up of Sh 50 airtime after choosing the phone number they wish. The move is part of the company’s customer initiatives to mark 20 years since it was launched, with the new numbers available at all Safaricom shops, dealer outlets and agents countrywide. The launch of the new numbers also comes hot on the heels of the 0110 and 0111 prefixes introduced in February 2020. “The new phone numbers we are launching today will help meet a strong demand for our services that is especially driven by new mobile data customers,”CEO Peter Ndegwa said. Other Safaricom prefixes include 070X, 071X, 072X, 0740-43, 0745-46, 0748, 0757-59, 0768-69 and 079X
