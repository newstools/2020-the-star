A suspect linked to a spate of the disappearance of young college girls from their homes has been arrested. Rashid Barasa Omari was arrested by detectives attached to the Serious Crimes Unit on Saturday morning. According to DCI George Kinoti, the 21-year old suspect has been preying, pouncing and coercing his victims whom he fishes from the comments section appearing on Tour and Travel advertisements. The suspect presents himself as a person capable of sponsoring his victims to the advertised destinations. "Instead, he lures them to lodgings in Nairobi after sending them bus fare, then robs them off their valuables before disappearing to his hideout," Kinoti said. The DCI boss said upon arrest, the suspect led detectives to his house where valuables including laptops, mobile phones and handbags belonging to other victims were recovered. "We are appealing to young college students to be wary of such criminals preying on them on social networking sites," he said.
