Private schools in Nyeri have asked the national and county governments to waive this year’s taxes and other charges. They also called on the Education ministry to release Sh7 billion it promised private schools to mitigate the Covid-19 fallout. In August, Education CS George Magoha announced that the government would issue the money as a concessional loan to private schools which will prove they have the capacity to pay back. Ndima Kanini Academy headteacher Lincoln Njogu said most private schools are struggling to survive as they have not been in business for the last seven months. Schools were shut down in March following confirmation of the first Covid-19 case in the country. Njogu said although they have had no other sources of income, they had to foot bills incurred by the schools. They include taxes and other charges charged by the national and county governments, insurance cover for schools vehicles and the school, electricity and water bills among others. The bills, he said, were paid even during the seven months schools were shut. He said though only Grade 4 and Standard 8 have resumed learning, some expenses have not changed despite the small number of pupils. “Many parents lost their sources of income as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic and therefore were unable to pay school fees when Grade 4 and Class 8 pupils resumed school,” Njogu said. Teachers, Njogu said, reported to school but they are working without pay or on half pay. “Two classes cannot sustain their salaries in full and so some schools have not been paying teachers,” he said.
