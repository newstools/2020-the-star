The country loses 9,000 children to pneumonia every year. Health CAS Mercy Mwangangi said on Thursday pneumonia is the top killer of children under age five. Mwangangi spoke at Kiambu Level 5 Hospital during World Pneumonia Day celebrations. “It is a disease that we need to pay attention to as it also affects adults,” she said. The lungs fill with fluid and patients are starved of oxygen, causing death. Governor James Nyoro said the county government has invested in bulk oxygen, which has been installed in paediatric wards to save children with pneumonia. “We have also supplied drugs to all hospitals to reduce the mortality rate,” he said. Nyoro said the county health department is empowering community health volunteers to reach out to patients at home rather than have people visit hospitals. He said all markets, eateries and businesses risk losing their licences if they do not comply with health guidelines.
