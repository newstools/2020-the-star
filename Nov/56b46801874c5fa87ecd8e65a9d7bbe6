Nominated MP Maina Kamanda has criticised Deputy President William Ruto for his frequent visits to Mt Kenya. He asked why Ruto frequents Central at weekends, yet the President has banned early campaigns. “Why is it that the DP is only engaging in funds drives in Central? Does it mean that there are no churches in Rift Valley or other regions?” Kamanda asked. He spoke to the Star on Saturday. Ruto's visits to Mt Kenya are seen as aimed at neutralising ODM leader Raila Odinga's influence, which is thought to have grown since his handshake with President Uhuru Kenyatta. The region is Kenya's largest voting bloc and is highly sought after by presidential candidates. This past weekend the DP was in the Central again, visiting Murang’a, Nyeri and Kirinyaga. As Kamanda was speaking to the Star, Ruto was in Tharaka Nithi presiding over a church fundraiser hosted by Woman Representative Beatrice Nyaga. Kamanda said Ruto will not be barred from visiting Central but things will be different once Uhuru gives the region final directives. “We are not barring the DP from visiting Mt Kenya, but in 2022 people will make a wise decision and they won’t be trapped into politics of hatred," he said. The region's heavyweights are leading the fight against the DP as they align themselves with the Raila–Uhuru axis. Speaking to KTN on Friday, Jubilee Party vice chairperson David Murathe accused the DP of reviving the Mungiki sect. “The DP should stop using the hustler tag in Mt Kenya as it’s associated with Mungiki,” he said. On Sunday, Kamanda charged Embakasi East MP Babu Owino and his Starehe counterpart Charles Njagua with rallying Nairobi youth to support the BBI report. He made the call at Friends Church Kabete in Westlands constituency, Nairobi. Ruto has called for amendments to sections of the report before holding a referendum. Edited by Josephine M. Mayuya
