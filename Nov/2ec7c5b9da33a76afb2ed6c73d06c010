DJ Soxxy's wife Anne Wanjiku says the reason she posts photos of her children on social media is to give hope to those who are struggling to get children. Speaking on NTV breakfast show yesterday with Gladys Gachanja, Anne said, "We decided to put our children on social media not as a show-off but as a way to encourage those who have lost hope in getting kids." Adding, "That is why we do not push for people to follow them." In several interviews, DJ Soxxyâ€™s wife has said getting their firstborn daughter was close to a miracle. She said she was diagnosed in 2009 with polycystic ovarian syndrome, a hormonal condition and one of the leading causes of infertility. "I thank God that Soxxy chose to marry me despite the infertility report," she said.
