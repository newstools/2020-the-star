Algeria-based forward Ariel Okal is back in the country ready for national team training at Nyayo Stadium gymnasium today. Okal, who plays for Union Sportive Setif in Algeria, is the first diaspora player to arrive home as Morans prepare for the Fiba Afro-Basket qualifiers in Kigali, Rwanda later this month. He said he went up-country briefly upon arrival in the country but is already back now in the city ready for training. Morans started their training over two weeks ago. Coach Cliff Owuor plans to bring home at least five professional players to bolster the team’s chances in the tournament. His other targets are Australia-based duo of Preston Bungei and Desmond Owili; Ronnie Gundo (USA); Tyler Ongwae (Denmark) and Joel Awich (France). Kenya will battle former champions Angola, Senegal and Mozambique in Group ‘B’ showdown at the Kigali Arena from November 25-29. The second window of the qualifiers are slated for February and the top three teams will make the cut for the continent’s top championship next year. Meanwhile, 15 girls will be selected from an intense basketball program that starts today in Nairobi. Event coordinator Grace Wang’ondu disclosed that those successful will get opportunities for scholarships both in the country and abroad. She said everyone within the targeted age group of 14-17 years is invited for trials. The program will start at Diwopa Courts in Kayole today before moving to YMCA Shauri Moydsawa lo courts on Friday. “The program will run in accordance with the Kenyan government guidelines on sports during Covid-19,” she said.
