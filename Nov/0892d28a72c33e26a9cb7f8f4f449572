Athletics Kenya Nyanza North region have cancelled four major events that were lined up for next month. Regional AK chairman Joseph Ochieng said the 15th edition of the World Aids Day Marathon and the annual Safaricom Kisumu City 10km road race will now be held next year. Ochieng further added that the newly introduced Pamoja Half Marathon in Kisumu and Mbita 10km road race will also not take place due to the rising Covid-19 infections. Pamoja event was a charity half marathon meant to raise funds to purchase hearing aids for the deaf in Maseno, sponsored by Rusinga Blue Ridge Hotel. “Athletics Kenya submitted a calendar of events to the Ministry of Sports. However, due to the rising Covid-19 cases, the Ministry has not given us the go-ahead to hold any event. Consequently, we have cancelled all our December events,” said Ochieng. Ochieng, a certified World Athletics race walk judge added: “It is a very sad situation but the lives of athletes and officials are more important. We hope that athletics events will resume by January next year. I appeal to our partners and sponsors not to give up because we shall resume once the ministry gives the green light.” Since the Covid-19 pandemic hit the world leading to the suspension of public gatherings including sports events, the only athletics event to be held in Kenya is the Kip Keino Classic at Nyayo Stadium in October. AK is planning to hold the Under 20 trials on November 20 and 21 but the event might be postponed due to the rising Covid-19 cases.
