The Directorate of Criminal Investigations has warned the public, especially parents, on activities conducted by teens. DCI boss George Kinoti informed the public that they are hunting down members of a cartel that is luring teens into illegal activities and they’ll be apprehended to answer for their crimes. Kinoti warned parents to take keen interest in their children’s activities at home and on social media. "As the investigations go on, we wish to issue a stern warning to individuals taking advantage of the Covid-19 pandemic to prey on schoolgirls who are at home especially through the social media networks that their days are numbered," Kinoti said. Detectives are investigating an online cartel that has been luring high school girls from their homes to orgies that go on for days. The DCI rescued six out of seven teenage girls reported missing after a video went viral of a woman begging members of the public to help trace the girls. According to the woman, the seven girls disappeared on November 14 in the morning after they were lured out of their homes. The seven, all aged 16 years, had last been seen in Nairobi's Komarock area. The woman in the viral video said, "We are afraid that my cousin and the other six girls are being trafficked for sex because we have identified the last number to communicate with her is an American line that is no longer going through. "We are just begging and pleading with everyone who might see them to please contact the police."
