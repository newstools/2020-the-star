Coach Jacqueline Mwangi has said players will be drafted into the national team based on merit. The iconic Blazers' player was trusted to lead the senior national team and under-21 side early this year but questions have been asked about fairness in regard to selection. As the senior team prepares for the African Cup of Nations qualifiers scheduled for Nairobi in January next year, Mwangi has rubbished claims that she will favour Blazers players, terming them baseless. "I am a Blazers legend and I love my teammates without a doubt but that does not mean they have an upper hand in national team matters. I want to make this clear... anybody who makes the cut will be there because she deserves it. It's about hard work in training and nothing else because the competition for places is rife," she observed. "We have created an enabling environment where we accept each and every one. I am at liberty to choose the best players in the country irrespective of the clubs they play for. If for example Blazers or USIU-Spartans have five quality players and they prove it during training that they deserve a slot, why drop them? We must think above favouritism." Blazers took seven players to South Africa for the Olympic qualifiers last year. Mwangi said she has drafted 50 players for both sides but the final squads will have 18 each. Even though she has not been able to foresee group training at the City Park Stadium, she said players are in good condition as they await directive from the Ministry of Sports to return to training. "It's a challenge not to train the players together. As far as I am concerned, the players are in good condition. Their fitness levels are acceptable but we could be match-ready if we can return to training next month," said Mwangi.
