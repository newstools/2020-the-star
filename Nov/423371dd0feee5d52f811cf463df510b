Talk was rife on Wednesday along the corridors of Parliament about a political party is in dire financial need after it kicked out a member who is said to be its key financier. Sources told Corridors, the shadowy powers have capitalised on their disadvantage by taking the party top brass hostage. With the hollow pockets, the invisible powers gave Sh4 million to the party boss to hammer a certain narrative and do some rounds in certain parts of the country to test political waters. The party chief has since recoiled back after exhausting the "donation".  Members are now doubtful if he will even sustain a presidential campaign. A number of governors are said to have taken advantage of President Uhuru Kenyatta's directives to set aside 300 isolation beds in each of the counties to pocket millions of shillings. Corridors overheard this from a discussion among MPs attending a committee meeting on Tuesday.  The MPs cited three counties in the Rift Valley where governors installed fewer beds, a matter that is now subject to investigation by MCAs. This is even as the country waits for the EACC to forward the files of suspects involved in Covid-19 scandal to the DPP. The woes dogging one of the governors appear to have exacerbated, with a clique of powerful individuals conspiring to impeach him, if he does not approve some money to finance political activity. The individuals alongside a section of MCAs are baying for the blood of the county chief if the illegal fund is not operationalised. Central to the tussle is the control of billions of money from various streams and projects in the county. Corridors overheard the schemers saying the beleaguered governor was not meant to perform as strings are being pulled from elsewhere.
