A notice of motion for the impeachment of Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko was tabled on Thursday. Minority leader Michael Ogada tabled the motion. A total of 86 out of 122 MCA have appended their signatures to the motion, surpassing the threshold required to table a notice of impeachment motion. MCAs allied to Governor Mike Sonko had said the plot to  impeach the county boss is over his refusal to assent to the bill on the Sh37.5 billion 2020-21 budget. They allege that impeachment was the top agenda of two meetings held on Monday and Tuesday at Capital Hill. The Tuesday meeting was attended by the county assembly leadership which, however, said the gatherings were about the Building Bridges Initiative. The house leadership comprises the speaker, deputy speaker, Majority and Minority leaders, deputy Majority and Minority leaders, Majority and Minority Chief Whips and their deputies. In February, a court saved Sonko from impeachment after he was accused of a litany of misdeeds, including abuse of office and financial mismanagement. Sonko says he will not grant the Maj-Gen Mohamed Badi-led NMS Sh27.1 billion, its share of the budget. This is likely to stall the implementation of projects in the capital city.
