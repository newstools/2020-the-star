Burials in Vihiga county should be completed by 10am as one of the measures to contain the spread of Covid-19, county commissioner Ochillo Oyugi has directed. “The body should be collected on the very day of the burial,” he said on Tuesday. Speaking to chiefs, their assistants and law enforcers in Mulukhoro, Emuhaya, Oyugi said politicians who go against the President's directive on suspension of political gatherings and rallies will not be spared. He said no one is above the law and politicians will not be allowed to break rules put in place to contain the coronavirus. The administrator cautioned residents to wear masks in public, failing which they will face the law. Oyugi urged police officers to intensify patrols in the county to ensure curfew orders are complied with. “We have noticed that since the new directives came into place, most people are not compliant,” he said. On the BBI report, the county commissioner urged local administrators to read  and understand the document, so they can educate the public on the proposals. “When you have the right information, it will be easier to enlighten the public,” Oyugi said.
