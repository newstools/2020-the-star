As a major amendment to the 2010 Constitution approach, Thirdway Alliance Party continues to insist that all Kenyans must take part in such amendments. Through the statement on Sunday, the party secretary-general Fredrick Okango together with party national chairman Miruru Waweru said that the constitution belongs to Kenyans, hence needs to be involved during amendments. “We are of the school of thought that just like in the constitutional making, Kenyans must be involved fully in any constitutional amendment process.” With its coming amendment to the constitution through the Punguza Mizigo Kenya (PMK), the party said that the amendments have to be undertaken by the people either directly or through their elected representatives. The party said that the amendments to the constitution will make Kenyans incur a cost of Sh10 billion, which must be mitigated by short- and medium-term savings that will result from its PMK proposed amendments. Said the benefits from any constitutional amendments must be demonstrable and must outweigh the cost. The party said that PMK is not in any way meant to oppose the Building Bridges Initiative and that it was started long before the handshake. “The Constitution of Kenya 2010, Article 257 provides that any Kenyan by way of popular initiative can make proposals to amend the Constitution.” This comes as more calls continue to emerge, asking President Uhuru Kenyatta and Raila to open room for more proposals. Deputy President William Ruto has reiterated that there is a need to build a consensus, which will only be reached by engaging all Kenyans. “I hear those who are saying we’ve had we had two years, and there is no more time for views and they are saying that why are people giving their views now when we’d two years,” Ruto said. Ruto said that the proposals from churches, pastoralists, the Parliament, and the People with Disabilities among others should be considered by the BBI team.
