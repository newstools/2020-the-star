The chief government adviser has filed a notice challenging a decision awarding former PS Lillian Omollo one shilling for unlawful dismissal. In the notice dated October 21, the office of the Attorney-General informed the court that it was dissatisfied with the order of Environment judge Stephen Radido. “Take notice that the respondents (AG and CS Public Service) herein being dissatisfied with the decision and /or orders of Justice Stephen Radido given in Nairobi on October 21, 2020 via Microsoft teams, intends to appeal to the Court of Appeal against the whole of the decision and /or orders,” the notice reads. The AG further sent a letter to the court requesting to be given certified and typed proceedings plus judgment to allow the filing of the appeal. The letter was signed by principal litigation counsel Schola Mbilo. In the decision being challenged, the judge held that the removal of Omollo from office in June 2018 was unconstitutional. "Omollo was awarded a nominal Sh1 for the violation of her right to due process," Justice Radido said. Nominal damages normally refer to a 'small sum of money awarded as damages to someone who has suffered a legal wrong but no actual financial loss'. Omollo had opted to challenge a decision by the High Court which required her to forfeits Sh33 million to the state. In the case, the Assets Recovery Agency made an application for forfeiture of Sh33 million to the state, arguing that the money was from proceeds of crime. Omollo and three of her children further want the court to withdraw all existing freezing orders against their bank accounts pending the hearing of her appeal. She said they never got a fair hearing in the High Court ruling. According to court papers, the court erred by purporting to waive the ARA legal obligation to prove through evidence that their money targeted for forfeiture indeed constituted proceeds of crime. Omollo was charged in 2018 with several counts of fraud in relation to loss of funds at the NYS.
