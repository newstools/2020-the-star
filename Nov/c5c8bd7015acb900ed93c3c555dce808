Nairobi MCAs allied to Governor Mike Sonko on Monday urged President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga to mediate in the row between the governor and the NMS. Waithaka MCA Kiragu Karanja said it is important for the two leaders to step in so that service delivery in the city can resume. “Let the President and the former Prime Minister lead talks that will help bring this issue to an end,” Karanja said. The MCAs spoke after a meeting between Sonko and a team led by nominated MCA Silvia Museiya was disrupted by police. The MCAs who were drawn from both ODM and Jubilee Party were opposed to an impeachment motion tabled before the assembly last week. Police who were armed with tear gas canisters and guns stormed the private residence at Riverside and ordered the MCAs to leave. Governor Sonko appeared to argue with the police officers, asking them not to disrupt the meeting. The police lobbed tear gas in the residence in an attempt to disperse the MCAs.  They temporarily arrested Sonko, taking him outside the compound. He was later released and escorted out by the MCAs. Museiya dismissed reports that 86 out of the 122 MCAs had signed the impeachment motion against Sonko that is to be debated on Thursday. She said that only a few signatures were collected through coercion and intimidation “We are here to make it clear that the signatures that they purported to have collected were not true because they were collected from a Kamkunji meeting held two weeks ago," she said. The MCAs claimed that some 82 of their members have signed affidavits against the purported signatures. Karanja said the group allied to the governor has resolved to shoot down the impeachment motion. “We are here to say that we fully behind Governor Sonko and the NMS. We do not oppose NMS but all we want respect to the rule of law,” he said.
