Diamond Platnumz’s mother Sandrah Kassim, alias Mama Dangote, is sick. The celebrity mother shared photos while receiving medicine via a drip in her hand. She is yet to announce what she is ailing from. This comes just days after her daughter, Esma Khan, was admitted in the hospital after separating from her husband three months after a lavish wedding. Esma said it was the reason she did not go to see Diamond Platnumz’s kids Princess Tiffah and Prince Nillan, who had jetted from South Africa to Tanzania for a visit. A week ago, Esma said she is yet to fully recover. She was visited by her daughters, her mother and a couple of celebrities.
