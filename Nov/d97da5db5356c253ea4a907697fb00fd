A Meru county staffer has been charged in a Tigania court with attempted defilement of a minor. Rimita Mutethia Rukunga denied the charge of attempting to sodomise a 15-year-old boy. He was arraigned before senior resident magistrate Sogomo Gathogo. Rukunga was alternatively charged with committing an indecent act with a child contrary to the Sexual Offences Act. He was initially deployed as Tigania West subcounty administrator before he was transferred to his current job in the department of sports. The court heard that on October 16, 2020 at Muthara location in Tigania West subcounty within Meru, Rukunga intentionally attempted to sexually molest the boy. The minor is said to be a regular customer of the suspect from whom he bought eggs. Rukunga is said to have dragged the boy into his store and attempted to defile him. He was released on a bail of Sh100,000 with an alternative bond of Sh200,000 and a surety of a similar amount. The case will be heard on October 26. On Wednesday, the officer tried in vain to gag the media from reporting his case. Magistrate Sogomo ruled that the media is free to air anything that is of public interest.  Edited by Henry Makori
