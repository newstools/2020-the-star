It is becoming crystal clear that the former Vice President and Democrat candidate Joe Biden will become the 46th President Of the United States of America. Biden is within sniffingÂ distance from being declared the next resident of the White House, as he is closer to the 270 electoral college votes. The US went to elections on November 3, in search of their next president. The battle was between the incumbent President Donald Trump who was seeking his second term in office, as a Republican flagbearer. Trump goes down in history as the US president who openly doubted the early outcome of the results, making the baseless claims that there was a group of people who were stealing the votes in favour of his opponent. He also made it clear in media briefings that he would move to the Supreme court to challenge the outcome from some of the states, and stop the counting of mail-in votes. This election year becomes one of its kind where Americans have voted in large numbers. Most of the votes were voted early via the mail, a move which was prompted by coronavirus and a measure taken to curb the spread of the virus. Trump came to power after defeating Democrat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election, taking 304 of the 538 electoral votes. His presidency began on January 20, 2017. It is obvious that Trump will go into history as the US president who served for one term in office. He will join the likes of George H.W. Bush, a Republican who lost to Democrat Bill Clinton in 1992. George Bush was the 41st president of the US, serving from 1989 to 1993 before losing to a campaign for re-election in 1992 to Democrat William Jefferson Clinton, who went on to serve two full terms. George Bush lost the battle for the second-term despite his achievement of military and diplomatic triumph. Democrat Jimmy Carter was the 39th president of the United States, serving from 1977 to 1981. He lost a campaign for re-election in 1980 to Republican Ronald Reagan, who went on to serve two full terms. Democrat Jimmy Carter became the 39th president of the US, serving from 1977 to 1981.
