Kenyans infected with Covid-19 should make their status public to avoid spreading the virus. The call has been made by Kenya National Union of Teachers secretary-general for Bungoma East Aggrey Namisi, who contracted the virus but has since recovered. Addressing the press in Webuye town on Tuesday, Namisi said he contracted the virus on October 1 and but was given a clean bill of health 14 days later after undergoing self-quarantine at home. “I want to take this opportunity to tell all leaders in this country that for them to save our people, they need to own up instead of being a conduit for spreading the infection," Namisi said. He said he contracted the virus after sharing a microphone with Bungoma MCAs during a press conference in Webuye town. Some MCAs had tested positive for Covid-19. “We are being told that we have over 15 MCAs who have been infected but there is none of them who has come out to say he is positive. If we don’t own up as leaders, then we shall continue infecting other people,” Namisi said. He warned against the sharing of microphones. “I have now decided to buy my own microphone so that I use it and keep it because that is where I got that disease.” He criticised the MCAs for conducting themselves as if they were free of the virus. “If you ask some of the MCAs I have interacted with, they don’t want to own up. There are some I know because I was tested with them and I know they contracted this disease but they don’t want to own up as if it is a serious disease that will continue to be with them.” He has asked the county government of Bungoma to emulate Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya who shut down the county after his chief of staff died from the disease. “All the offices in Kakamega were immediately closed and the premises fumigated."
