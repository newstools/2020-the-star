Kenyan champions Gor Mahia could play their continental matches without their head coach after Caf ruled on Friday that he lacks the mandatory qualifications to sit in the dugout. Gor will be travelling to Kigali, Rwanda for their opening encounter against Armée Patriotique Rwandaise FC (APR). But the Confederation of African Football (Caf) have written to Football Kenya Federation (FKF) and the club asking to produce Roberto Oliveira Goncalves’ Caf A papers, or else he will not be allowed to handle the team during the Caf Champions League. Oliviera is in possession of Brazilian qualifications, which according to Caf are not at par with the minimum requirements for coaches handling sides competing in the Champions League. According to standards set by the continental football governing body, a coach should have at least a Caf ‘B’ qualification to sit in the dugout. Interestingly, Oliviera was of the Rwandese side Rayon Sports when they bundled K’Ogalo out of the Caf Confederation Cup two years ago.
