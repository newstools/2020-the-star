The number of street boys in Embu town has increased owing to failure by stakeholders to rescue boys immediately they are found in streets as happens with girls, a politician has said. Embu Kanu branch vice-chairperson Florence Wanjiku said there are a lot of boys who loiter and sleep on the town's streets and very few girls because residents, the children's office and nongovernmental organisations don’t bother to rescue them. But they are quick to rescue girls immediately they are found loitering in streets, she said. Wanjiku expressed disappointment that boys are left to loiter in the streets where they take drugs, sniff glue and engage in crime. But immediately a girl is found she is rescued and taken to a children’s home or any other safe custody. She called on the relevant agencies to mind the welfare of the boys, warning that in future there might be no reliable men to contribute to the sustenance of the generation. Wanjiku called on all stakeholders to give equal attention to boys and girls in all aspects and regretted that boys have been neglected. She spoke to the press in Embu in commemoration of the World Children’s Day marked on November 20 to promote international togetherness, awareness among children and improving children's welfare. Wanjiku at the same time decried rampant defilement and incest in Embu targeting underage girls. She called for amendment of laws to impose stricter sentences against perpetrators. She said defilement and other sexual abuse of girls have increased because culprits are given lenient sentences, released on bond during their trial and thus they don't see the seriousness of their offenses. Wanjiku also decried alcohol abuse among young parents, arguing that the trend has been contributing to breakdown of marriages and suffering of children in families, which forces some of them to go to the streets.
