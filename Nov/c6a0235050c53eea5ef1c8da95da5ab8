This year we’ve been through crazy times. Real crazy times. And through it all, we’ve all had to look inwards to find our unique hopes of better times ahead. I found a few. In human form and creative form. I’m so glad I can finally share them with you. I present to you 'A Better Time'." This is Davido's third studio album. In an earlier interview, Davido said he had not planned to drop an album in 2020, but when corona happened, he decided to hit the studio and make good music. "Before I knew it, I had 20 songs in the studio, all done and recorded and finished. Then I was like, ‘Should I just put it out?'"
