An Itallian - Maurisio Montcalli - who was captured on camera assaulting a woman, was on Monday arraigned before Kiambu law courts. The court ordered that he be taken to hospital for treatment for injuries that were inflicted on him by members of the public during his arrest. He will be returned to court after undergoing treatment. Montcalli, who is a resident of Edenville Phase One on Kiambu Road, was seen in a video assaulting his neighbour on Sunday. In the video that went viral, dressed in a red shirt and blue shorts, Montcalli was seen slapping the woman who was standing before him. This, even as his neighbours tried to stop him. "You understand....You understand...I know you're brilliant..where is my daughter..I know my daughter.." he said as he staggered.
