Some people believe the problems facing doctors should have been solved between 2003 and 2008 when I served as Director of Medical Services. However, as far back as 2000 when I was chairman of the Kenya Medical Association a lot was done, especially on enhancing salaries and allowances for medical staff. It is therefore with bitterness that we watch the efforts put in place to improve the welfare of doctors and health workers being reversed. The best we can do is to try and improve on the gains to ensure that doctors and other health workers have access to improved welfare. I broke down last week because I felt that the meeting should have been held at State House, with the President chairing it. The President would then listen to his officers make decisions about the plight of health workers and the issues raised. For instance, the Ministry of Health has policy guidelines and standards that must be adhered to by the national and county governments. The question should be whether ministry officials have gone to the counties to check if the standards are being observed. What would be the answer? This is a devolved function. What is the point of having a national government that cannot enforce policies? I don’t like what is happening because surely you cannot do that to your doctors and health workers. It is not fair at all to subject doctors and other health workers to hazardous working environments in the name of patriotism. Everyone is calling on health workers to be patriotic. Who said patriotism is suicide? Doctors and health workers should be provided with personal protective equipment that is to the required standards. The Health ministry should ensure that all medical supplies meet the required standards so users are not exposed to risks. The standards must at all times be enforced through inspections and being vigilant. The Seme MP spoke to the Star
