Mombasa ODM chairman Mohammed Hatimy, also a nominated MCA, has died. Hatimy, who was among a number of Mombasa MCAs reported to have tested positive for Covid-19, succumbed at the Intensive Care Unit of Mombasa Hospital. Speaker Ibrahim Khatri said Hatimy died at 3am on Saturday after his lungs collapsed. "He had initially tested positive for Covid-19, but he later tested negative. However, the lungs were badly affected and he was taken to the ICU, where he died this morning," the speaker said on the phone. He is to be buried on Saturday at Kikowani Cemetery after 1pm prayers at Ummu Kultum Mosque. On October 27, the assembly closed for 14 days after a number of MCAs and staff members tested positive for Covid-19. Hatimy had been chairman of the powerful Finance committee. The ODM party tweeted, "A beautiful soul has stopped beating. A great man has fallen. The ODM family has lost a good man and leader. Hon Mohamed Hatimy, our Mombasa County Chairman and a second-term nominated MCA,Â  is dead. We shall miss you, Kiongozi." (Edited by V. Graham)
