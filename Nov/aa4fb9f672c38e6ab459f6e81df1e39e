Health CS Mutahi Kagwe will on Monday convene a special National Emergency Response Committee meeting to deliberate on the rising of Covid-19 cases. The meeting will also discuss current containment measures and issues affecting health workers. So far, 30 healthcare workers have succumbed to the virus. Of the number, 10 are specialist doctors. The Kenya Medical Practitioners Pharmacists and Dentists Union has threatened to call a strike should the government fail to look into their plight. “This has been a bad week for us since the pandemic struck our country in March this year,” Kagwe said. “It culminated with the loss of four medical doctors on Saturday, considering that healthcare workers are our frontline soldiers in this war.” This week alone, 158 Kenyans died – the highest recorded in any week since the first Covid-19 case was reported in the country. On Sunday, the CS confirmed that 20 more people had succumbed to the disease, raising the fatality to 1,269. Some 352 patients recovered from the disease on Sunday.
