A Kibera court has sentenced a mechanic to one year in jail or pay Sh100,000 fine after he pleaded guilty to stealing Sh45,808 from an M-Pesa agent. Kevin Ouma, 19, admitted to stealing the cash from Naima Ibrahim on October 26 in Kibera, Nairobi county. He was before Kibera senior principal magistrate Phillip Mutua. Prosecutor Allan Mogere told the court that Ouma walked into Ibrahim’s M-Pesa shop and claimed that a Safaricom customer care staffer wanted to talk to an M-Pesa agent on his (Ouma's) phone. "The accused person visited the said M-Pesa shop purporting that he was in communication with a customer care staff member who urgently needed to speak to an M-Pesa agent," Mogere said. Ouma gave Ibrahim the earphones but remained with the phone. The prosecution told the court that the caller instructed Ibrahim to dial certain numbers and when she did, the cash was transferred to another line. "The cash was transferred to Ouma’s friend immediately," the prosecutor said. Ouma was arrested and taken to Kilimani police station, where he admitted to the theft. Ouma told the court he was remorseful and that the magistrate should consider that he was a first-time offender.
