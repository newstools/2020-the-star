Harambee Stars' chances of qualifying for the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations hang on the thread after losing 2-1 away to Comoros in their fourth qualifier match. Stars head coach Jacob 'Ghost' Mulee made two changes to the squad which played the Islanders to a one-all draw last week in Nairobi, starting David Owino and Lawrence Juma for Samuel Olwande and Eric Johanna respectively. Despite naming a strong squad for what was a must-win clash, Comoros took the lead through El Fardou Ben Nabouhane in the 21st minute but Cliff Nyakeya replied in the 35th minute. Mulee made his first change of the match with three minutes left in the first half, bringing in Kenneth Muguna for Lawrence Juma in a bid to double their efforts upfront. The hosts netted the decider early in the second half and resorted to sitting deep into their area until the final whistle to bag the three points which took their tally to eight points. After conceding, Mulee threw in the attack-minded Boniface Muchiri for Ayub Timbe while John Avire came in for Masoud Juma. The fresh legs seemingly gave Stars vigour to make inroads in the Comoros area but their defence proved equal to the task. With the defeat, Stars will now be forced to beat Togo and Egypt in the final qualifier rounds set to be played in March next year.
