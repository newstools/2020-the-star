Forty-five people were on Monday arrested in Teso North, Busia county, for violating Covid-19 protocols and traffic rules. Subcounty police boss David Muange said that of the number, 33 were not wearing masks. Another 10 were boda boda riders found carrying more than one pillion passenger, while two were passengers being ferried on one motorbike. The arrests were made following a crackdown by a multi-agency team led by Teso North deputy county commissioner Justus Musau. All those arrested were detained at Malaba police station. They will be taken to court. The operation was mainly carried out by police officers from Malaba and Amagoro police stations. “Our people are just ignorant. Some even tried to resist arrest despite being found carrying more than one passenger on their motorbikes,” Muange said. Muange vowed to continue with the crackdown until residents adhere to containment measures. “The operation will not stop until our people learn to take life seriously. Covid-19 is real. Our job is to enforce the law,” Muange said. On November 2, Inspector General of Police Hillary Mutyambai directed police officers to arrest people violating the Covid-19 protocols and charge them on the spot. He said being in public without a mask will attract a Sh20,000 fine. Mutyambai said that in case anyone feels they are being harassed by law enforcers, they should share the information with his office or the Independent Police Oversight Authority for action to be taken.
