She went to hospital expecting to deliver twins and gave birth to quadruplets instead. Eunice Wambui safely delivered the quadruplets at St Matia Mulumba Mission Hospital in Thika on Saturday but one of the babies, a girl, died. Njomo Kiogora told journalists he received the news while at work. Wambui and Kiogora are grateful but also worried about how they will take care of the babies. Kiogora is a tout while Wambui used to cook chapati on the roadside before she became indisposed. “It is a blessing and we’re very happy. But we are also worried because we were not expecting to have four kids,” Wambui said. Her last scan showed she was carrying twins. "We know the task ahead, of bringing them up, is huge. We will struggle a lot to meet their daily needs, including diapers, milk supplement, clothing and food," she said. The couple lives in a rented single room in Makongeni Phase 5, Thika town, together with their seven-year-old daughter. “We don’t have a steady income to comfortably bring up the kids. We are elated because it’s a blessing but the journey ahead of us is tough,” Kiogora said. The couple is now appealing to well-wishers to help them. "We will need milk supplement, which is costly, since the mother cannot sustain breastfeeding the three of them. We plead with people of goodwill to come to our aid,” Kiogora said. Members of a WhatsApp group called Thika Town Today set up by James Ng’ang’a, aka Jymo wa Thika, on Sunday afternoon started mobilising to raise Sh30,000 for the couple. “Children are a gift from God. We will celebrate with them with the little cash we will raise. We believe it will go a long way in assisting them with some expenses,” Ng’ang’a said. By press time, the group had raised Sh13,500. Wambui will be discharged on Tuesday. Edited by Josephine M. Mayuya
