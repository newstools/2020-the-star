The Mama Lucy Hospital CEO and two other clinicians who are alleged to be involved in a child theft syndicate have been remanded for two days by a Nairobi court pending investigations. CEO Emma Mutio, Makallah Fred a social worker and Administrative officer Regina Musembi were remanded on Thursday by magistrate Bernard Ochoi following a successful application by the prosecution. In his ruling, Ochoi said that the investigating officer has genuine concerns over the interference of documentary evidence by the suspects. "Having considered the concerns, I allow the respondents to be remanded for further two days to enable police to finish the investigations. The investigating officer will visit the hospital and collect documents in the presence of the suspects," the magistrate ruled. Makallah allegedly was exposed by BBC negotiating with an undercover journalist in a well-planned plot to sell a child who had been abandoned at the Mama Lucy Hospital. The court remanded the three at Kileleshwa Police Station until November 23 when the case will be mentioned. The three did not plead to any charges as the Directorate of Criminal Investigations sought 10 days to detain them pending further investigations. Investigating officer Wanga Masaki told Ochoi that the officers were arrested following information obtained from Makallah about their involvement in the crime.
