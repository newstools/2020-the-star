Machakos County Assembly speaker Florence Mwangangi has tested positive for Covid-19. The County Speaker, who is also the mother of Health Chief Administrative Secretary Mercy Mwangangi, has gone into self-quarantine after she tested positive nine days ago. Mwangangi who spoke to the Star said she had resolved to have all the county staff get tested after one of her colleagues started exhibiting flu-like symptoms. According to the county Assembly speaker, she and one other staff tested positive for Coronavirus. "Since then, I've been receiving treatment from home. Since there is no vaccine yet, I have made sure that I eat healthy, take in lots of fluids and healthy drinks as well as taking panadol for my headache," Mwangangi said. She said light exercises, as well as support from family members, has helped her psychologically. She urged Kenyans who have Covid-like symptoms to get tested and speak out without fear of stigmatization. This comes as the country's Covid-19 cases have increased to 55,192 after 1,395 more people tested positive on Saturday. The virus has hit many state offices including the IEBC which has recorded many seriously ill cases and some reported deaths. Similarly, Kilifi and other county administrations have been affected. ICU beds in hospitals across the country are rapidly filling up. A 'second wave' of Covid infections is sweeping across Kenya. This may be linked to the relaxation of Covid restrictions in September but it is primarily due to the complacency of citizens who believe that coronavirus is no longer a danger.
