Wycliffe Shamiah has been appointed as the Chief Executive Officer of the Capital Markets Authority. This follows the approval of the appointment by National Treasury Cabinet Secretary Ukur Yattani. “I would like to congratulate Shamiah on his appointment, having served in the authority for over the last 23 years and emerging as the successful candidate for the position,” said the chairman of the board, James Ndegwa in a statement. Ndegwa added that he was sure with the support of the board, management and staff, Shamiah will succeed in leading the authority in executing its mandate. Shamiah will also be tasked to implement the Strategic Plan 2018-2023 as well as other duties and responsibilities while maintaining the authority's track record and reputation. His appointment to the position in a substantive capacity, having acted since the beginning of the year, provides stability and continuity at a time that the authority, the Capital Markets, industry players and the whole globe at large have been dealing with the disruption brought about by Covid-19. Shamiah was appointed as the acting chief executive officer in December 2019 following the exit of Paul Muthaura. Prior to his appointment, Shamiah had served as the director of market operations since November 2011 and has held multiple senior positions in market supervision, research, financial analysis and compliance at the Authority over a career of in excess of 22 years. He is a Fellow of the Institute of Certified Public Accountants (FCPA)(K) and holds a Masters in Business Administration (Finance Option) from the University of Nairobi and a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Mathematics and Economics from Egerton University.
