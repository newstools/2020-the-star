Kenya's hopes of qualifying for next year's Fiba AfroBasket in Rwanda suffered a setback after an 83-66 drubbing by Angola. Olimpio Cipriano was the chief architect of the Morans' downfall as his 17 points consigned the Kenyans to their second defeat after Wednesday evening's 92-54 thrashing by Senegal. Morans started the game brightly, racing into a 7-3 lead before a series of turnovers and defensive fouls allowed the Angolans to recover and take a 16-7 lead. In this first quarter, Morans matched their opponents in all departments, trailing by 18-10. However, the Southern Africans' superiority showed in the second quarter as Valdélicio Joaquim and Jose Antonio tormented the Kenyans with their three-pointers and lay-ups. With the scores at 39-25 in favour of the Angolans, the third quarter began at a frantic pace as the Morans sought a resurgence. Valentine Nyakinda and Erick Mutoro were instrumental in the mini-resurgence as the former's three-point and the latter's lay-up helped bridge the gap at 54-36. The momentum was better captured by Tylor Ongwae's slam dunk after an impressive steal from the Kenyan half. The Angolans, however, recovered their footing through Jone Lopes Pedro, Jaques Conceicao and Jose Antonio, who nipped any hopes of a comeback to widen the scoreline to 68-38. The last quarter was all about a respectable scoreline as Nyakinda and Mutoro's gallant efforts brought the score to 75-52. The skipper was the highest scorer with 18 points whereas he also led the Kenyan team with the highest number of steals (three). Personal fouls and turnovers nonetheless proved to be the Morans' main undoing on which the Angolans capitalised through free throws and three-pointers. Cipriano —in particular —seemed to have mastered Kenyans' weakness in dealing with three-pointers, which he used to add to his game tally.  Attention now turns to Mozambique who the Kenyans face on Friday evening.
