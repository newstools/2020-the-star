Margaret Kinya Kirera was a hilarious and outgoing journalist who never failed to let people around her feel her presence. In the office, online platforms and family circles, if Kirera was not telling a joke to crack up their ribs, she was giving a religious quote of encouragement. On October 22, barely a week before she died, Kirera made this post on her Facebook page: "Pesa kidogo unanipita ni kama haunijui!! (You get a little money then start bypassing me as though you don't know me)." This would be her last joke on social media. Her friends hoped to get cracked up by her jokes in a bash to celebrate her birthday on Wednesday, November 3, when she would have turned 56. But that turned into mourning as news trickled in that the veteran news woman had died on Saturday, October 31. Kirera has a history of working as an information officer in the public service since 1989. At the time of her death, she was working as Laikipia county information officer seconded from the Ministry of ICT. Reports from the county indicate that she started feeling unwell on Monday, October 26. She excused herself from office duties to seek medical attention. But her condition deteriorated over the next few days. She breathed her last five days later. She died at the Nanyuki Teaching and Referral Hospital where her family members rushed her. Kirera leaves behind a daughter, Keziah Kagwiria Kirera, who works as a communication officer at the Laikipia County Revenue Board. Family sources say the writer who reported for KNA will be buried on Friday, November 6 at her familyâ€™s rural home in Kibirichia in Meru county. Her friends described her as a hilarious and industrious person whose death shocked many. "Rest in peace my sister. This is your last post. Full of humour. Laugh with the angels. Happy birthday in heaven," Schola Somi wrote.
