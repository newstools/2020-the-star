A man has been charged with murder after he allegedly stabbed a police officer to death after the officer was accidentally splashed with muddy water. Emmanuel Wekesa was accused of killing Corporal Tolbert Ochieng on September 5 at KCC estate within Kamukunji subcounty. Wekesa appeared before High Court judge Daniel Ogembo, denied the charges and appealed for bond. “We request bail terms as he is presumed innocent until proven guilty,” Kariuki said. The prosecution opposed the release, saying the offence is grave and attracts a heavy penalty. Ogembo directed Kariuki to file a formal bail application so the prosecution can formally respond. According to police records, on September 5 the officer was walking a few metres from his home at 7pm when he encountered Wekesa and his friend Eric Owino. As the officer passed them, Owino, who was being supported by Wekesa, stepped in a puddle and muddy water splashed on the officer.   An argument arose and the officer hit Owino who fell to the ground. Wekesa reportedly removed a knife, stabbed the officer in the chest and fled, the police report said. He left Owino lying on the ground. The public put the officer in a cart, then a friend with a car drove him to Moi Airbase clinic. He died while receiving treatment. Owino was arrested and informed the police where Wekesa was. He was arrested. Justice Ogembo ordered the accused detained at Industrial Area Remand Prison pending his bail application. The case will be mentioned on December 16.  (Edited by V. Graham)
