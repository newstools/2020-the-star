Comedian Dr Ofweneke says one of his most dramatic breakups was when a woman he was dating dumped him on New Year’s eve. In an interview on Switch TV, Ofweneke said 14 years down the line, he always remembers that situation every end of the year. "I was dumped on a New Year. The chick came and told me, ‘I don't think your comedy is going anywhere, and I don’t think you’ll ever succeed to anything and I don’t have the patience for that. "I had done my first concert and was paid Sh200. I bought her a bracelet and she asked, ‘What is this? I’m a model!'" The comedian-cum-MC also dated gospel singer Nicah, but they broke up after a few years. Nicah said Ofweneke was violent to her. "Domestic violence is such a bad thing. I had to walk away. I had to run. Yes, I’m a single mum of two and I know God will watch over me and my kids," she wrote. In an interview, Nicah further said Ofweneke assaulted her. "I had to run away. We are done. I can’t stand such violence." Speaking during the Switch interview, Ofweneke said his worst relationship was with the singer after their public breakup since kids were involved. "It was a very tough decision where you had to choose the happiness of your children and your happiness," he said. "I had to look for a house to stay and many times, I cried. I felt like I am a failure as a father and as a husband. By the time I was healing, I had destroyed too many souls because in between, I met other girls and I didn’t care." Ofweneke has since moved on and welcomed another baby this year. He shared the good news via Instagram, promising to do everything within his capacity to provide for his daughter and ensure she is accorded a decent life. Edited by T Jalio
