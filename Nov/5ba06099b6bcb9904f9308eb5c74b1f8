The Kisumu county government has ordered traders out of public parks to pave the way for rehabilitation. A letter from Kisumu City acting manager Abala Wanga dated October 26 gave the traders seven days to vacate. “Notice is hereby given to all office occupants, traders within Jomo Kenyatta Sports Ground, Jamhuri/Victoria Park, botanical gardens and Oile Park in Kisumu Block 7 to vacate the area immediately and not later than seven days from the date hereof.” Wanga said the direction is meant to make room for rehabilitation and improvement of the parks for 12 months. "This has been done in exercise of the powers conferred upon the county government of Kisumu by the County Government Act no 17 of 2012 and Urban Areas and Cities Act no 13 of 2011.” Wanga said traders who fail to vacated will be evicted. “Take further notice that in the event of non-compliance within the stipulated time frame, the county government shall itself move and remove on its own such office occupants/traders without further reference to the owners at their own risk." The letter was copied to the country secretary, park managers, inspectorate director, director city engineer, director city planning and Tourism executive. Edited by P.O
