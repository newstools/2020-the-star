The National Transport and Safety Authority has suspended nine driving licenses for drivers who have been risking the lives of passengers and pedestrians through their reckless driving. The authority said on Thursday that the action was prompted by a media report, involving Super Metro Ltd, Triple S Co. Ltd, Manmo Sacco, Baba Dogo 25 Sacco, Sony Classic Co. Ltd, and Metro Trans Co.Ltd vehicles. Officials from the named sacco operators were summoned to appear before the authority to discuss various road safety concerns including traffic rules violations. After deliberations with the officials, driving licenses and PSV licenses of all the nine drivers have been suspended. Also, the nine drivers will be required to undergo a driver re-test at the Likoni Road Driving Testing Centre to ascertain their driving suitability before the licenses are reinstated. The authority directed the operators to furnish them with various policy documents relating to the management of driver/conductor discipline and other road safety measures. Further, NTSA said that it will undertake road safety awareness training for all drivers and conductors of the 6 operators within seven days. At the same time, NTSA directed all the operators to present a percentage of their fleet for compliance inspection at the Likoni Inspection Centre within seven days.
