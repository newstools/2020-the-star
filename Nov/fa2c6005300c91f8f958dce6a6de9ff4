China's foreign ministry said on Friday that it extended congratulations to US President-elect Joe Biden and Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris, who won the November 3 election that President Donald Trump has refused to concede. "We respect the choice of the American people. We extend congratulations to Mr Biden and Ms Harris," foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said at a regular daily briefing. "We understand the results of the U.S. election will be determined according to US laws and procedures," he added. (Reporting by Yew Lun Tian Writing by Tony Munroe Editing by Catherine Evans)
