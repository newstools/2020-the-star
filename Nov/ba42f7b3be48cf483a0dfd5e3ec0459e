Parents need to guide their children. It is unfortunate that children are being exposed to sexual and drug abuse. What will become of the children once they get back to school? The Covid-19 pandemic has brought with it setbacks to all sectors, including the closure of schools, but this should not be a ticket for children to engage in immoral activities. There is nothing wrong with holding parties but parents should not allow children to consume alcohol and drugs. This is promoting immorality in society. The big question is, are parents even aware that their children attend parties flowing with alcohol and drugs? If yes, they need to be more strict; if no, they need to be more vigilant. Teen pregnancies are a huge societal problem. The idling and partying will take away children’s attention from education and they are likely to have a hard time adjusting when schools reopen. The government should punish all adults involved in planning such parties. They are ruining the future of an entire generation. As we head towards the festive season, the police need to be more vigilant to stop such parties from taking place. I would also caution children to tread carefully. Their behaviour now will affect their future. They should focus on their studies and on building their talents. Adults need to be good role models. Parents should especially be keen on who their children hang around. Children tend to imitate what they see their elders do. Hence, adults should always be careful to ensure that when they hold parties, children are not to around. It may be a long while before things go back to normal, let’s not add immorality of our children to the problems facing us.
