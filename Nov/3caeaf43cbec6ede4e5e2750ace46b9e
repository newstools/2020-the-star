Sofapaka captain Elly Asieche has urged local football fans to rally behind the national team as they prepare to meet Comoros in the first leg of the 2021 African Cup of Nations Qualifiers double header. Asieche says he is elated with his first call up to the national team following his inclusion in the 40-man strong squad named by head coach Jacob ‘Ghost’ Mulee late last month. The squad will be trimmed down to final 20 and Asieche hopes to be part of it. Besides Asieche, Mulee handed two other rookies their maiden caps as he sought to blend youth and experience. They included Gor Mahia wonder kid Benson Omalla and pacy winger PeterThiongo, who made a giant leap from Homeboyz to AFC Leopards. “I’m extremely happy to have been given this rare opportunity to don the national colours. I wish to thank coach Ghost for the chance,” said Asieche. The midfielder has experienced his glorious moments of late including his appointment as captain at Sofapaka after George Maelo gave up the armband and hung up his boots late October. The alumnus of Ofafa Jericho joined Sofapaka in 2011 after a season with National Super League side Bidco United. He has been exhibiting excellence on the pitch with a section of local fans weighing in on the thought that his inclusion in the national team was long overdue. He’ll, however, first battle it out for a slot in the final 20 and perhaps the starting line-up with a packed and talented midfield that includes Kenneth Muguna, Lawrence Juma, Ayub Masika, Eric Johanna Omondi and Cliff Nyakeya who was the toast of the day during the international friendly match between Kenya and Zambia’s Chipolopolo.
