A total of 72 murder cases, 44 land displacement cases and 118 of threats have been registered linked to the 2007-08 post-election violence, DCI boss George Kinoti has said. "Forgive us ! We will follow everything you have told us today in regards to the 2007-08 post-election violence," he said on Monday when he addressed victims of post-election violence. "We know those who grabbed and are feeling comfortable.. they are those who killed, who pass over graves for people who they killed." Kinoti said people were hurt and killed by people who knew what they were doing. "I  will defend you. My colleagues have done the drill to bury me. If I have served you well, our souls will meet our maker in heaven," he said. Kinoti said the government has instructed his office to ensure that no more violence and deaths are experienced. "Let them try again. We will follow the truth and we will prepare all the files and we will say this is the person who killed this person, " he said. "Very soon you will see the outcome of this event. We will look for them. I know they are waiting for another poll violence to occur."
