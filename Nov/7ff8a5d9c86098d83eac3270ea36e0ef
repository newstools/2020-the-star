A West Pokot church has been praised for the role it has played in bringing peace along the county's borders, which have been hit by conflict for decades. Known as Dini ya roho mafuta pole ya Africa church, it was registered eight years ago. Church members have been advocating peace and unity among the warring communities. It has been applauded for uniting the Pokot of Kenya and the Sebei of Uganda, who have been fighting over cattle rustling for decades along the common border. "Some years ago this place was a war zone but Dini ya roho has really preached the gospel of peace to the people of this region," Kapenguria MP Samuel Moroto said. The church has also fought retrogressive practices, changing the focus to developmental issues. Resident John Mwetich said it has helped fight FGM and early forced marriages among schoolchildren. "Since the church's inception, the cases have drastically dropped since the church doesn’t advocate for that,” he said. This has been achieved through preaching and educating locals to embrace education for all, Mwetich added. The church has also established a secondary school at its headquarters and in future, it plans to set up a university. Governor John Lonyangapuo thanked the church for coming up with programmes during the December holiday that teach the youth against FGM and early marriages. “A region that has no church has no future,” he said. "Dini ya Roho has played a major role in bringing  peace along the border. The youths who were going for raids and disrupting peace are now preaching in their respective churches." Senator Samuel Poghisio said the registration of the church has brought out members who participate in ensuring children go to school and introduced a sense of peace in the area, where cattle rustling was rife. “The faithful should do their job in bringing all people together. Let them come out strongly and pray for our nation,” he said.
