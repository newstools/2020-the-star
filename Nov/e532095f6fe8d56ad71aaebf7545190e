Cab service provider Safe Boda has announced its exit from the Kenyan market effective from November 27. In a statement released on Monday, the company said the Covid-19 pandemic had weighed heavily on its operation, turning its business sustainability into the future, a going concern. “Safe Boda has made a very difficult decision to pause rides and send services from November 27, 2020. “While Nairobi is seeing some economic recovery from COVID-19, boda transportation has been hit hard. "This has meant our business cannot sustainably operate in this environment and unfortunately the timeline for a full recovery cannot be certain,” Safe Boda stated.
