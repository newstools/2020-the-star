More than 10,000 small-scale farmers in Kisumu have received fruit and vegetable seedlings, irrigation equipment and day-old chicks in a Sh13 million Covid-19 recovery plan. Governor Anyang' Nyong'o said funds for the project were sourced from the Kisumu Covid-19 kitty, the National Irrigation Authority and the national government. The administration gave out 5,000 day-old chicks valued at Sh1 million to 25 groups in Muhoroni, Nyando, Nyakach and Seme subcounties. “We have purchased vegetable and cereal seeds worth Sh5.5 million which is enough to plant 2,200 acres of kitchen gardens by 10,000 households in the seven subcounties,” Nyong'o said when he upgraded Ahero to town status. In addition, the governor said they bought 3,600 metres of irrigation pipes to enhance horticultural production on 100 acres at Miguye in Kobura ward. The county chief said the national government has also given them 20.8 tonnes of rice seeds valued at Sh4.8 million that can plant 2,600 acres. “We have also received 10,000 grafted mangoes and avocado seedlings worth Sh3 million to be distributed to 1,000 farmers in Seme, Kisumu East, Muhoroni, and Nyakach,” he said. Nyong'o appealed to all to help the county in the fight against Covid-19. He said the virus has spun out of control and is killing many people. No one is safe. “The fight against Covid-19 now rests with you as an individual. Madam county commissioner and I have issued past warnings to remind you to adhere to the public health guidelines but many people still disregard them.” He reminded residents not to crowd in funerals and bury their dead on the same day they are removed from the mortuaries. “Stop eating at funerals. Wear masks all the time and seek medication if you suspect you are sick. Together, we will kick Covid-19 out of Kisumu,” the governor said.
