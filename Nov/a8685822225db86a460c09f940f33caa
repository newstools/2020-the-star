Kenya Morans will on Tuesday take on South Sudan in a friendly match at the Kigali Arena in Rwanda as they gear for their 2021 Fiba AfroBasket qualifier against Senegal on Wednesday. Kenya Basketball Federation (KBF) treasurer Peter Orero — who is heading the delegation — said Kigali all is well after everyone was cleared of Covid-19. Fiba Africa said all games will be played in a protected environment in order to ensure health and safety of all participants. Orero said the team also had their first training session at the Main Arena.  After Senegal, Morans are penciled to play Angola on Thursday and meet Mozambique a day later. The matches for the second qualification window are set for February. “We are training now then we go for late lunch. We train again in the evening and play South Sudan tomorrow (Tuesday) at 7 am in a friendly match,” Orero said on Monday.
