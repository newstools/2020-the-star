Two people were on Friday murdered in separate incidents in Kinango sub-county, Kwale. In one of the incidents, a 60-year-old man from Mukanyeni village was hacked to death over witchcraft accusations, Kinango OCPD Fredrick Ombaka confirmed. The police identified the deceased as Matari Ngome Mutuku. It is said Matari had accompanied a relative to solve a farm dispute that had been destroyed by cattle. On the arrival, one of the complainants Kutoka Chirima overreacted and started slapping Matari alleging that he bewitched his father. It is then that a Matari's brother-in-law Membeyu Ngome Mutuku ran for help and returned with the area village elder only to find Matari lying unconscious in a pool of blood. Matari's head had a cut and multiple bruises. They decided to rush him to Kinango hospital where he succumbed to the injuries while receiving treatment. In the other incident, 32-year-old Nyawa Kiroto was attacked and killed by unknown people at Kidzaya village in Vigurungani within Kinango. His head was cut using an unidentified sharp object that went through his back. Kiroto breathed his last outside his house. Passersby through the help of the area chief Nelson Lewa informed the police who reached the scene. They conducted preliminary investigations before moving the dead body. No weapon was recovered and police are still hunting for the murderer. Police investigations have commenced.
