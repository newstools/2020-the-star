Gospel singer Ruth Matete celebrated her first marriage anniversary yesterday. To mark the day, Ruth paid tribute to her late husband Beloved John, who succumbed to fire injuries early this year, leaving her three months pregnant. She also celebrated the birth of her daughter Reyna Toluwa and prayed she grows to serve God. "I declare today, that your feet are beautiful. Not just because they look like your father's but also because they will bring good news as the word of God declares," she wrote on Instagram. "We promised to be together till death do us part. But death came earlier than we expected. I miss him so much. But am blessed to have you as a gift that he left me with. I don't even understand how I've come this far. It can only be God."
