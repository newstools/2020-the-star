The Mombasa county assembly remains out of bounds except for five to six members of staff following increased numbers of Covid-19 cases. MCAs were to resume sittings on Tuesday after a two-week recess but were told by Chief Whip Junior Wambua to stay away until further notice due to the surging numbers of cases. “We have extended the recess because fumigation is being done at the county assembly offices after some more members tested positive," deputy speaker Fadhili Makarani said yesterday. Makarani said three members of staff tested positive on Friday. “All members of staff have been tested and results came out last Friday. Three  tested positive. That is why we have to take more precautions,” he said. Wambua said, “All the MCAs are supposed to undergo another test before we resume including those who tested positive and those who tested negative." Seven MCAs and one member of staff had earlier tested positive, leading to the closure of the county assembly. Five to six members of staff are working on a rotational basis in the offices of the speaker, the clerk, chief whip and the majority leader. The recess extension has affected the county assembly calendar "but we have to put into consideration the pandemic and the health of our people,”  Makarani said. Mombasa ranks second after Nairobi in the number of Covid-19 cases in the country. "Muslim cemetery in Kikowani is filled up. We need to take more precautions,” Makarani said.
