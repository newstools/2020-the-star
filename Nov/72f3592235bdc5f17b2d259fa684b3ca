The National Employment Authority has resumed clearance of persons migrating to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for work. The authority suspended the service eight months ago due to the Covid-19 outbreak. Recruitment agencies will now be required to submit the lists of candidates to NEA virtually. There will be no physical documents. Last year, the Labour department reported that 29,448 Kenyan migrants were working in Saudi Arabia as domestic helps between March 2019 and January 2020. “Kenyan migrant workers contribute significantly to the socio-economic development of the country in terms of skills, expertise and transfer of knowledge upon return. For instance, monthly remittances inflows in 2019 averaged Sh 23 billion shillings,” Labour PS Peter Tum said. Despite reports that most Kenyans migrating to the Middle East for jobs are subjected to domestic servitude, sexual abuse, torture and acute violation of terms of employment, the migrant numbers remain high. More than 90 per cent of women migrants in the Middle East interviewed reported being duped and exploited with promises of decent jobs, according to a report released by the ENACT programme. The state plans to establish a migrants workers' welfare fund to support Kenyans working in foreign countries during an emergency. It will offer insurance to Kenyan workers abroad who are in distress and also provide stipends when they return home. The kitty will be financed by workers themselves after the state contributes seed money to get the fund started. Labour CS Simon Chelugui said the government had difficulty repatriating Kenyans stranded in foreign countries at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. “We learnt lessons from this coronavirus when we had to repatriate over 1,400 Kenyans abroad through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other departments," the CS said.
