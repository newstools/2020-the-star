Two men have been arrested in connection with the beheading of a boda boda operator in Naivasha. The two are suspected of luring the rider from Ongata Rongai to Mai Mahiu, where they decapitated him and fled. The two aged 28 and 20 were arrested three days after the killing, which took place on Monday evening. The suspects are said to have hired the deceased to ferry them to Narok, more than 100km away, but turned against him along the Mai Mahiu-Narok road near Suswa town. Their attempt to flee with the motorcycle was thwarted by residents. Naivasha OCPD Samuel Waweru said the two were arrested in Ongata Rongai where they retreated after committing the murder. “We have also recovered bloodied clothes from their house and we shall arraign them in court facing a murder charge,” he said in his office on Thursday. Boda boda operator John Chege said the two approached several riders seeking to be ferried from Ongata Rongai to Narok. He said they offered good money but riders turned them down because of the long distance. “However one of our colleagues took the offer only for the two to murder him. But we have assisted police in arresting the duo,” Chege said. Meanwhile, residents of Mai Mahiu in Naivasha are up in arms over increased cattle rustling. The residents said they have lost more than 200 head of cattle and goats to a well-organised cartel in Narok in the last one month. MCA Stephen Ng’ethe said more than 10 people, including four grannies, had been left nursing serious injuries. “The most affected areas are Kigecha, Satellite, Muniu and other neighbouring villages and it's time that security officers moved in before we act,” he said. Last month, members of the Kikuyu community seized more than 100 head of cattle from the Maasai to protest the rising cases of rustling before police moved in to contain the situation.
