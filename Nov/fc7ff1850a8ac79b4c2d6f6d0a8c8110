The 2008 Kenyan Premier League champions Mathare United have announced the signing of Kenyan international David 'Cheche' Ochieng from Saudi Arabian second tier club Al Ansar. The experienced defender penned a one-year long deal with the Slum Boys, who have been on a spending spree in the recent weeks. "Kenyan international David Ochieng has joined us on a one-year deal from Saudi Arabian side Al Ansar," said the club. Cheche, a league winner with Tusker in 2016, returns to the local scene for yet another short stint after playing for AFC Leopards for three months last season. After his stay at the Den,Â  Cheche returned to Saudi Arabia and signed a one-year deal with Anasr but would leave just six months into his contract. With his international experience, the former Nairobi Stima player is touted as a replacement for Andrew Juma who decamped to Gor Mahia. Others who left the Slum Boys are David Owino, who joined KCB and Roy Okal, who signed for 2009 champions Sofapaka. Salim Swaleh returned to Bandari following the expiry of his loan stint. Apart from Cheche, Mathare have also signed former Posta Rangers and Tusker winger Danson Kago, Bonface Akenga who joined from NSL side Police FC and ,two-time league winner Lumumba Okeyo who previously turned for Sofapaka.
