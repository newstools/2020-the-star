The Kwale administration has stepped up efforts to provide quality cancer care to residents by allocating Sh40 million for the construction of an oncology centre. Deputy Governor Fatuma Achani said bids are being considered and the tender for the project will be awarded to the most qualified contractor. The centre will be fitted with the latest equipment for cancer screening and diagnosis. It will be able to admit up to 50 patients. Achani said the county will deploy oncologists, well-trained nurses and clinical officers to provide high standard cancer services. The deputy governor said the oncology centre will help residents to effectively fight against cancer. “You won’t be travelling to Nairobi to seek treatment because services would be provided just within your region,” she said. The county government aims at making the radiotherapy, chemotherapy and surgical treatment of cancer available by 2022. Currently, the Kenyatta National and Kenyatta University Teaching and Referral Hospital are the only public facilities actively offering radiotherapy services. Kwale has more than 250 cancer cases. Breast, cervical and prostate cancers are most common. At least seven out of 10 women aged 20-64 die from cervical cancer each year, according to county health records. About 47,887 Kenyans are diagnosed with cancer and 32,987 patients die from it annually, according to the National Cancer Institute. Achani said the facility will extend its services beyond Kwale and admit other patients from various counties. The facility will also contain a section for psychosocial support of cancer survivors and room for support groups. “Those who have successfully gone through the cancer treatment will have room for counselling and much needed support to encourage themselves and others going through the same experience,” she said.
