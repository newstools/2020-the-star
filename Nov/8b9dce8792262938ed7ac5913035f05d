A committee has been formed to fast-track the mapping and restoration of Kambu area in Kibwezi that was affected by an oil spill a week ago. A cargo train veered off the railway line and spilled the oil. Makueni county Nema director Leonard Tampushi will lead the technical committee which will include water, health, agriculture and livestock departments. Other members will be from the Water Resources Authority, Kibwezi deputy county commissioner, subcounty administrator and environment officers from the county government. The resolution was reached in a special county environment committee meeting chaired by the Lands and Environment executive Julius Kaloi in Wote town on Monday. The committee has been tasked with establishing the number of farmers affected, acreage of farms besides providing the census of crops affected by the oil spillage. The committee will also establish whether Kenya Railways has mapped out the affected area and monitor the restoration of the land as per the Nema regulations. The team will also quantify water needed for the families and animals that have been affected. WRA sub-regional manager Stephen Ngao issued a notice warning residents living near water sources that have been contaminated not to use the water until its safety is ascertained. During the meeting, members said Kenya Railways should provide water and storage facilities as a short-term measure to ensure the people have clean and reliable water. The Health department jointly with the national and county administrations will hold barazas to sensitise the community. “We have a duty to monitor and ensure the community in the affected area gets clean water and the area is restored according to Nema regulations,” Kaloi said. The committee will report to the CEC by November 30. WRA has taken samples from the scene of the incident to their laboratory in Nairobi to establish the quality of the water. Edited by Henry Makori
