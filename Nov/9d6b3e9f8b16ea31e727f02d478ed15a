The co-chair of the BBI Secretariat Junet Mohamed has announced that signatures will be collected from Wednesday for one week till the end of the month, before handing them over to the IEBC. Junet also announced that they have developed an app to help Kenyans sign digitally. "You can log into http://bbisignatures.org and sign because we are ready and roaring to go. Follow instructions, sign and you're signature and ID and all details will be captured and will be used for the signature," he said. He added that online signing will be just as effective as someone who is signing physically and the signature taken as valid and will be used. "We are ready to go, we are prepared and our agenda of uniting this country is achieved through BBI," he said. Speaking during the BBI signature collection launch at KICC, Junet said they will take the document to the county assemblies. He indicated 30 governors were present during the Wednesday launch, indicating a clear endorsement of the report. After the assemblies, the process will be taken to parliament and then to Kenyans. "We are going to take to parliament, the two speakers are here and it's as good as done. We will then take to the people of Kenya to make a decision on it. "We are going to go out there and follow the Covid protocols. We will do meetings in town halls with attendance not more than 100 people until Covid is gone. Life will continue." The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission on Tuesday released the BBI signature collection format. In a letter to the Building Bridges Initiative secretariat IEBC Chairman Wafula Chebukati said the commission has approved the proposed format for collection of signatures in support of a Constitution Amendment. This was a response to a letter the secretariat had sent to the IEBC on November 18, seeking approval of the proposed format.
