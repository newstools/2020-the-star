A well-known Christian preacher has skipped bail in South Africa and fled the country. Shepherd Bushiri, who had previously said he wanted to clear his name, has now returned to his home country, Malawi, with his wife Mary. Earlier this month they were released on bail after being charged with fraud and money laundering. He said there had been attempts on his life and he accused the South African authorities of not offering protection. Bushiri described his decision to skip bail as "a tactical withdrawal meant to preserve lives" while speaking to supporters on social media on Saturday. Observers fear the issue could cause a diplomatic spat between Malawi and South Africa - as questions are being asked about how Bushiri and his wife managed to leave. There had been allegations that Bushiri fled on Malawi's presidential jet with President Lazarus Chakwera - something that has been denied by Chakwera's office. There are also questions over whether the two countries will co-operate over bringing the couple back to South Africa. South Africa's Justice Minister Ronald Lamola said the government would not hesitate to move to extradite fugitives. But Malawi's Foreign Affairs minister Eisenhower Mkaka wouldn't be drawn on the issue. He told the BBC's Nomsa Maseko that it is the duty of the government to protect all Malawians but added that President Chakwera is a staunch advocate of the rule of law and that all diplomatic channels will remain open.
