An aide to Tigania West MP John Mutunga has been charged with beating a Meru-based Royal Media Services reporter. Jacob Ngeene denied the charges before Tigania senior resident magistrate Sogomo Gathogo. The charge sheet says Ngeene attacked and slapped Mainda Facii at Urru Stadium on October 17 during an event attended by Deputy President William Ruto. State prosecutor Michael Mutune said the attack was severe and that Ngeene should be taught a lesson out of the offence. "I ask for enhancement of the bail due to the severity of the offence," Mutune told the court. Ngeene was released on a bond of Sh30,000 or a cash bail of Sh10,000. The hearing will proceed on January 19, next year. During the event, residents had asked the reporter to air grievances on unmet road projects they wanted the area MP and DP Ruto to address. As Facii recorded interviews, Ngeene appeared and ordered the reporter to stop. Ngeene claimed Facii was coaching residents to make negative remarks against the MP. "He found me interviewing some women and held me by my back. He then hit me claiming I was coaching them to say No peu (clear the way — a slogan used by Eala MP Mpuru Aburi). The women tried to enlighten him that I was just getting the grievances but in vain,” Facii said. The reporter was shocked at the turn of events as he had hosted the MP live on the radio early that day. Several leaders have condemned the attack and called the MP to tame his officers. The MP, however, told the Star he is remorseful over the aide's actions. He said that the attack was an isolated incident as he has always endeavoured to work peacefully with journalists.
