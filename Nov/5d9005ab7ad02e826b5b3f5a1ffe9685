FormerÂ Tahidi High actor Dennis Mugo, alias OJ, says he was bullied by a Form 4 student in high school. In an interview with Dr King'ori, OJ said he was forced to sing a lullaby song to the candidate almost every night. OJ shared the topic while explaining how he managed to play his cast in Tahidi High, where he portrayed the role of a ghetto boy struggling to fit into a lavish school. "When joining high school, I realised several candidates were arrogant. I thus resorted to making friends with one of them, who appeared calm and outgoing. My new friend was so keen on passing his KCSE exams," he said. "He hatched a strategy to ensure he would recall contents of the set book and I used to sing him that song most nights at around 2am. When he would come back from class, I'd sing for hours." OJ says he did not hold a grudge and urged people to avoid grudges as it could lead to revenge. He advised that as parents, it is wise to also reach out to the school or the parents of the other children and solve the issue amicably. "Find a way to move on and accept it happened. Bullying in high school is not allowed. Bullying is not allowed anywhere in life, at work, at homes." "Parents should also find ways to help their children who are bullied in one way or another. You can find therapy for yourself or your children."
