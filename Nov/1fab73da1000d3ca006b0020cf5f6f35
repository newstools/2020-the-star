ODM leader Raila Odinga has dismissed chances of substantive amendments to the BBI report. He said it wouldn't be possible to incorporate major changes to the report considering it was subject of public input for over two years. Raila on Monday said the referendum drive is on and will move to the next phase - signature collection. "We will launch signature collection by end of this week," he said after a meeting with 21 current and former MPs from Central Kenya. Last week, the BBI signature collection exercise was postponed. In a statement on Wednesday, the national secretariat said the postponement was occasioned by late completion and publication of the Constitution Amendment Bill 2020. The statement was signed by co-chairpersons Dennis Waweru and Suna East MP Junet Mohamed. The two said the secretariat is working on a new date "with a comprehensive programme of rollout activities". This came as President Uhuru Kenyatta hosted his deputy William Ruto for a three-hour meeting at State House, Nairobi. The two discussed the ongoing BBI debate and how Ruto's concerns can be accommodated before the process moves further.
