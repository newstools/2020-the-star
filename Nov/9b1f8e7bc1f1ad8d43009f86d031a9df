Marsabit is mourning the death of County Secretary and Head of the Public Service Joseph Guyo. He died at Marsabit County Referral Hospital from Covid-19 complications. Guyo passed on early Tuesday morning at the hospital where he was rushed after developing breathing difficulties and chest pains as medical personnel made efforts to save his life. Marsabit Governor Mohamud Ali said in a press briefing at his residence that the county had lost a patriot and dedicated public servant who executed his duties professionally. Governor Ali appealed to Marsabit residents to strictly adhere to the Ministry of Health protocols to prevent the spread of coronavirus. “I have been briefed that the late engineer Guyo passed on some minutes after arriving at the hospital,” he said. While his Covid-19 status had not been determined, he exhibited classic symptoms of the disease. “Guyo was a seasoned and a highly respected public servant who served Kenya and Marsabit with utmost professionalism, dedication and commitment to quality public service delivery,” the governor said. He offered service to the country in the water sector for over 30 years. Marsabit County Referral Hospital executive secretary Liban Wako said the hospital management will ensure Covid-19 protocols are adhered to in handling the body of Guyo. Guyo served in various capacities rising to district water engineer to be the managing director of Isiolo Water and Sewerage Company. He joined the county government of Marsabit as CEC Water, Environment and Natural Resources before taking over as the County Secretary and Head of Public Service. His death happened barely a week after the county chief officer for Finance Abdullahi Barako died of Covid-19.  Edited by Henry Makori
