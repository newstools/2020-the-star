Detectives are investigating an incident where a 40-year-old man who was held at a Kitui police station died upon release. On Tuesday, Kitui county commissioner John Ondego said the man was arrested by members of the public in Kunda Kindu, Kitui town, last weekend on suspicion he attempted to rape a minor. The suspect died in the hospital where the police took him after his release. The suspect told police he had HIV and TB, and he appeared weak. He said he had left his medicine at home. “Detectives have moved in because it is shocking how a suspect died after he was released by police. A file had already been opened to get to the bottom of this mysterious death,” Ondego said. Kitui Central subcounty police commander Wilson Abdullahi said when the suspect told police officers he was HIV positive and had TB, they released him on free bond. “I do not rule out the issues of the suspects having been beaten up by the people who arrested him. But when he indicated that he suffered from HIV and TB, we gave him a free police bond to go and take his medicine,” Abdulahi said. He said once the man was released from police custody on Sunday, his relatives took too long to take him home and because he appeared weak, they took him to Kitui Level 4 Hospital, where he died.
