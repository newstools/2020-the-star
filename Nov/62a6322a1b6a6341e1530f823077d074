Dear President Uhuru Muigai Kenyatta. In 2022 (in sha Allah), there will be an election and there will be losers and winners, court petitions, riots, teargas notwithstanding the fact that BBI will be in place. It is happening even in the USA these days. BBI will not change that. What BBI will definitely do is to add to our already heavy economic burden. We are already in a difficult situation and it is time to downsize and consolidate. Not a time to create Prime Minister office, two deputies (remember these are not individuals but institutions). It is not also the time to create a 630 Parliament and hard code the transfer of Sh600 billion we do not have to the counties in the constitution. I am for devolution and I have seen the good stuff it does but the reality is we don't have the money for a bigger government - at both levels In two years time, you will be a private citizen like me. A commoner. A pensioner and maybe a businessman. By the time you leave office, we would either have defaulted on our debt or would be in an ICU run by the IMF & the WB. Why are you employing hundreds of more politicians? At a time when tens of thousands of civil servants would most likely be retrenched because of the conditions from the Bretton Woods institutions? At a time when millions of Kenyans have no jobs and when even sunlight is being taxed for the country to be run for an extra day? Your Excellency, I am not a politician. I am not in government. I do not intend to be in either. I have comfortably lived in the diaspora all my working life - Sydney to Tokyo to Riyadh. Mine is because I do care about my country - where both of us will retire to and for our children Now that the entire political class has agreed to support BBI, it is the best time to call it off. For the next 22 months, leave everything else and please personally supervise the management and stabilisation of the country's macroeconomic challenges. Please save KENYA. God bless
