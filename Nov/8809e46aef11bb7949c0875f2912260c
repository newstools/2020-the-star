In the latest case of illicit partying, police in Kisumu have arrested 25 teenagers and three adults celebrating a birthday party in Milimani Estate. Police said the partygoers on Monday night included 15 boys and 10 girls, who were turned over to their parents for counselling. "We could not put them in custody because we had issues of Covid-19 in the cells," county police commander Ranson Lolmoodoni said. The adults included the owner of the house. They were charged with violating Covid-19 protocols. Police raided the house at 8pm following a tip-off by the public. Police have recently busted teen parties involving alcohol, drugs and sex. Experts say young people cooped up at home are escaping to have fun. The police boss warned residents to strictly adhere to Covid-19 prevention measures or face arrest. (Edited by V. Graham)
