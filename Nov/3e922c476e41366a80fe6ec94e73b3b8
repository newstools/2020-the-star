With nearly 140 million votes counted, President Trump seems poised to lose the election. Nothing was more important than that for those who value human decency, fairness and a more just America and world. But Joe Biden's victory is still not 100 percent assured. In the four or five remaining battleground states whose votes have not all been tabulated and will determine who is the next president, the margin that stands between President Trump and Joe Biden is just a few THOUSAND votes. Not millions or even hundreds of thousands of votes, just thousands. Mr Trump could still win, although that is not likely. We all know America is deeply divided. It's divided for a reason: tens of millions of Americans in this richest of nations are hurting so badly that they would see Donald Trump as a saviour. In my lifetime, I have not seen any American leader so passionately loved as Donald Trump by tens of millions. Many of his supporters are racist and right wing extremists, but most are decent Americans who have been pushed by the policies of both parties into acute deprivation and desperation. The road ahead will be rocky. There are many, many lessons we have to learn if we want a better America and the world. But those who run our countries and the world are not about to give up their hold on power and wealth to usher in a more equitable world. It's also truly astonishing that all the pollsters and media once again got it mostly wrong, predicting an easy victory for Joe Biden. So its not just their predicting methodologies that need to be fixed. We wait anxiously but hopefully for a Biden victory in the coming hours or possibly days. TV and radio apart, this NY Times website is a good place to follow the denouement. More later. There is an interesting discussion on the election on my Facebook page.
