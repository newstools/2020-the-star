ACK Kericho Dioceses Bishop Arnest Ng'eno on Sunday urged all 2022 presidential aspiring candidates to give Kenyans their line-ups ahead of the implementation of the Bridging Bridges Initiatives (BBI). Bishop Ng'eno said all aspiring candidates should give names of those they intend to pick as deputy president, prime minister, and deputy prime ministers so as to justify the inclusivity factor in the BBI. The bishop expressed fear of Kenyans being ambushed by a president who may win the race and go picking his cronies. Speaking outside ACK Church in Kericho town on Sunday, Bishop Ng'eno said it is necessary for the government to avail BBI documents to the masses for reading and understanding. “Those who cannot read and understand the BBI document should be given civic education by non-politicians before the matter is subjected to a referendum,” Bishop Ng'eno said. He said the nine issues captured in the handshake between President Uhuru Kenyatta and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga were crucial.
