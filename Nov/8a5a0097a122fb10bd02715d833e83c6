Three people were killed in two separate road accidents on the Nairobi-Nakuru highway on Monday evening. The first accident involved a trailer and a van near Gilgil town. Four passengers were seriously injured. Gilgil police boss John Ondit said the injured were rushed to St Mary’s Mission Hospital. “The van that had six occupants was overtaking a fleet of vehicles when it crashed into the oncoming trailer killing two occupants and seriously injuring four others,” he said. In the second accident, a man died on the spot after two trucks collided near Kinungi trading centre. Meanwhile, police in Naivasha have launched a manhunt for a group of thugs who waylaid the area OCS at 2am on Lakeview estate, hit him in the head and stole his gun while he was on his way home. The incident occurred a few metres from Naivasha police station. The officer had hours earlier led a crackdown around bars and eateries operating past 9pm. Naivasha assistant county commissioner Mutua Kisilu said the OCS had just parked outside his gate when the thugs who were armed with an AK47 attacked him. He was seriously injured on the head and left unconscious. His neighbours came to his rescue. “He was rushed to one of the private hospitals in serious condition and unconscious, but he has since stabilised,” Mutua said. “During the robbery incident the thugs made away with his Ceska pistol which was fully loaded and other personal effects.”
