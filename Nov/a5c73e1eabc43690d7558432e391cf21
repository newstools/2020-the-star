The Directorate of Criminal Investigations is holding a Nairobi man accused of beating his son to death. Philip Odhiambo Owino was arrested on November 24 by officers from Huruma police station after his son was pronounced dead. On Thursday, detective Godfrey Munene told a Makadara court that he was investigating the case. He said that on November 23 at Kiamaiko on Huruma estate, Nairobi, the suspect whipped, kicked and beat up his seven-year-old son. He said that as a result, the child's condition worsened and on the same day he was rushed to Jumuia Hospital by his mother but was pronounced dead on arrival. His body was then moved to the City Mortuary awaiting a postmortem. In an affidavit filed before principal magistrate Stephen Jalang’o, Munene sought 14 days custodial orders to detain the suspect pending investigations. "In the meantime, investigations into the circumstances and facts surrounding this murder and the involvement of the suspect are incomplete as the matter was taken up by DCI Starehe from Huruma police station,” he said. He said they need more time to visit the crime scene, record witness statements, and take the suspect to Mathare Hospital for mental examination. However, Owino denied the accusations. He said he only whipped him with a belt and when he stopped the child was okay. Jalang’o granted the orders that the deceased be detained at the Pangani police station. The matter will be mentioned on December 14.
