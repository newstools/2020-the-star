Dozens of revelers were this weekend arrested in separate places as special squads moved to enforce Covid-19 pandemic protocols. Police say at least 1,000 revellers were arrested in the operations and are scheduled to appear in courts on Monday. Several bars had their licenses revoked after the operations that happened in Nairobi, Nakuru, Mombasa and Eldoret among other towns. The affected bars and restaurants have since been notified of the closure. In Nakuru, police had to lob a teargas canister into a bar in the town after the revelers started to haul objects and beers at them in efforts to deter their arrest. At least 86 revelers were arrested as others escaped in the confusion. President Uhuru Kenyatta had ordered the operations to reinforce the rules as part of efforts by authorities to control the spread of the disease. Respective police commanders are working closely with county inspectorates in cracking down on the bars which officials say are the main source of the spread. More than 1000 people have died out of the disease in the country. The president imposed a night curfew in the country as part of efforts to contain the spread. Bars are supposed to be closed by 9 pm.
