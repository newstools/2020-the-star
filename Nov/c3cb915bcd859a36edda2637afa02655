A Kenyan don based at the Technical University of Kenya has been appointed to a global team researchers to help in understanding Covid-19. Prof Dorcas Yole, also the director of the School of Biological and Life Sciences, becomes a member of the College of Experts for the joint Department of Health and Social Care and the United Kingdom Research and Innovation Global Effort on Covid-19 Health Research Call. The team named Global College of Experts also reviews proposals and seeks ways to mitigate health impact on low- and middle-income countries. The global effort on the pandemic is funded by Kingdom Research and Innovation and Medical Research Council in the UK together with the National Institute for Health Research in the UK. The call is based on the Department of Health and Social Care. Prof Yole noted that this is an opportunity TUK and Kenya at large would benefit from as part of global efforts in research towards combating the contagion. “I have already been involved in the review process and I am grateful that TUK is contributing to the fight against Covid-19 in this aspect,” she said.
