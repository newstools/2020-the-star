Ulinzi Stars' wingback Ephy Quintine Indeche is now the proud owner of a bachelor's degree in Business and Information Technology after graduating from Zetech University on Saturday. Indeche says he is willing to use his story as an example that it is quite possible to juggle football with education. "I want to use my story to inspire more upcoming youths especially those talented and let them know that you can still play football and learn because there is always life after football," said an elated Indeche after graduation. The 23-year-old Bungoma High School alumnus further said he is determined to use his knowledge to shape the destiny of children back home in his village. "God willing, I will get funds to open a computing institution to teach needy children in the society back home in Bungoma about technology and give them something to do," said Indeche. He, however, said his love for football is still intact and he is ready to step up to the plate to help Ulinzi Stars challenge for top flight title in the new season as he continues to battle for a starting slot in the line-up. "I just want to focus on the team given that the Ulinzi family has supported me throughout my studies. I want to bring all the attention I had back to the team and help them achieve something great this season and definitely get more playing time." The Soldiers wrapped up the last season in 4th position with 43 points, 11 adrift champions Gor Mahia. Indeche says he has always drawn a lot of inspiration from Brazilian wizkid Neymar and generally looks up to Adrian Jordan as a role model.
