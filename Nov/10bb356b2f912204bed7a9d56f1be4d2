The Busia County Assembly of Busia has been closed after four staff members tested positive for Covid-19. Deputy Governor Moses Mulomi said the assembly will be shut indefinitely until the Health department is convinced the risk of staff contracting the respiratory disease is minimal. “We are facing a very difficult time. Busia residents should realise coronavirus is real. "As acting Health chief executive, I have held a meeting today (Monday) because we have lost very prominent people to the virus,” Mulomi said in Butula during the burial of Canon Jackton Sibuda. “Beginning on Tuesday, we will close the county assembly for some time because four of our staff have tested positive for coronavirus," he said. Mulomi said the virus' second wave is strong and called on residents to be vigilant and take precautions. All stakeholders in the health sector should promote safe living by educating the public on the importance of health protocols. County Universal Health Coverage director David Mukabi told the Star business at the assembly will be suspended as the Health department moves to secure county staff and residents from the virus. Closure comes 10 days after Busia lost a highly qualified physician to the virus. The closure of the county assembly came ten days after Busia lost one of its highly qualified medical practitioners who succumbed to Covid-19. Dr Daniel Alushula, an orthopaedic surgeon, died on October 30, at Avenue Hospital in Kisumu. He will be buried on Saturday. Mulomi also said the county's Revenue director Moindi Andima died of Covid-19 last week. Busia is among counties with the highest rate of cases. On Saturday, the Health ministry said Busia had 30 of the 1,065 cases between Friday and Saturday. Authorities in Busia, particularly the police and officers from the Provincial Administration, have stepped up enforcement of Health ministry protocols. (Edited by V. Graham)
