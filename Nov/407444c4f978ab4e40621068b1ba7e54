The 40th Maragoli cultural celebration has been suspended due to the coronavirus pandemic. Speaking to the press at Lusavasavi hotel in Vihiga on Friday, Sabatia MP Alfred Agoi said the celebration cannot take place​ on December 26 as planned. The state had limited functions to 100 people and mandated social distancing and wearing of face masks, which would pose problems for the event. “The ceremony is not only attended by Maragolis. Other people across the country join us, and it attracts crowds of 30,000-50,000 people at the municipal,” he said. “So with such limits, the best way is only to suspend it.” Agoi said they don’t want to defy state orders or expose residents to the Covid-19 pandemic. “The Maragoli culture is not killed, it’s there and will remain to be there and will be celebrated year in and year out. But with the situation at hand now, we have to put things in that order,” he said. He said once the country goes back to normalcy in 2021, the celebration will resume. Vihiga MP Ernest Kagesi said the 60 days declared by head of state goes up to early January in 2021, so the event could be held thereafter. “But this came after having wide consultations with stakeholders and the cultural committee members,” he said. “We thank the steering committee for coming up with open minds with room for discussion over the issue.”
