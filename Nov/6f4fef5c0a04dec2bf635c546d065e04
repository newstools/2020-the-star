Odibets betting firm has donated 108 balls to 18 clubs in Busia County as part of its three-year deal to sponsor clubs taking part in county leagues. The balls issuance was done in a colourful ceremony held at the Busia County Stadium presided over by the OdiBets Regional Marketing Manager Aggrey Sai. Sai said each club featuring in the county league will receive two sets of uniforms, noting that one set was issued early this year with the remaining one to be delivered by next month. “Apart from the uniforms, the clubs received six balls each. The sponsorship deal will also see them receive an assortment of training kit and equipment,” he said. He said OdiBets signed a Memorandum of  Understanding with the Football Kenya Federation (FKF) in December last year to sponsor county leagues. The three-year-deal is worth Sh127 million. The regional manager announced the inclusion of Mayenje Santos  striker  Yasin Sije and Busia All Stars  central defender  Polycarp Okemer into the OdiBets family. FKF official in charge of football development, Stephen Otieno, told clubs to deal with only elected officials led by Chairman Hillary Musundi, noting that the county officials have what it takes to turn around  the fortunes of the game in the county. He also lauded the election of Margaret Omondi as the first NEC member in charge women football, adding that her vast experience will raise the profile of women football in the country. Omondi urged OdiBets to consider sponsoring women county leagues in a bid to match their male counterparts, noting that the move will help nurture talent in the country. FKF Busia branch chairman, Hillary Musundi thanked OdiBets for the sponsorship saying the move will go a long way in developing football in the county.
