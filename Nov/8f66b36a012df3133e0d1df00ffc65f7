Media personality Betty Kyalo felt intimidated in her early days on TV. In a QnA on Instagram, she admitted to feeling pressure when asked by a fan. "Most times I felt I was not good enough, especially the first years on TV. I was a colleague to people who were doing so great, Cynthia Nyamai, Beatrice Marshall, and I always felt intimidated," she said. Shrubbing also hurt her esteem. "I would feel like I did not do my research enough. Many times I would go home and feel like I should have done better. I would question whether I should be in this career, but somehow it happened." Betty, however, does not regret anything, and she is glad she went through that phase since it moulded her.
