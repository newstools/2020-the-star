Kimilili MP Didmus Barasa has up to Tuesday to pay a city-based lawyer Sh1.8 million or face six months in jail. Barasa owes lawyer Alfred Ndambiri the money for legal fees the lawyer represented him in an election petition filed against him by former Kimilili MP Suleiman Murunga in 2017. The lawyer has had to battle with the legislator since then before filling the case before magistrate D.M Kivuti. In seven different appearances before the court, Barasa had pleaded leniency and promising to pay which has not been forthcoming. On the October 9, Magistrate Kivuti had however directed that Barasa be given the last chance to appear before him on November 24. Kivuti ruled that if he would not have paid he will be committed to a six-month jail term. During the last adjournment, Barasa had pleaded with the court for the last adjournment saying he was Covid-19 positive and was in self-isolation and demanded to be exempted for 90 days. The magistrate, however, gave him only 45 days which elapses tomorrow.
