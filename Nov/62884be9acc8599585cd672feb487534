A judge has quashed a decision banning use of Sportpesa brand by a gaming company. Judge Pauline Nyamweya's order in effect allows the gaming company Milestones games limited use of its Safaricom pay bill numbers together with Sportpesa domains. The judge in a ruling dated November 16 further certified the case by the gaming company as urgent saying that there are likely effects of the decision being challenged in court. Her decision arose out of an application by the gaming company challenging a decision by the Betting Control and Licensing Board made on October 30, 31 2020. The board had stopped the Milestone games limited from using the trade name Sportpesa, the domains www.ke.sportpesa.com, www.sportpesa.co.ke, short codes 29050, 79079 and paybill numbers. Consequently Milestone games moved to court seeking orders to quash the decision of the board. The court was told that the board in reaching its decision acted outside its powers. The decision was made without the gaming company being given a chance to make any representation. Judge directed the parties to file their replies to the suit papers and scheduled the case for hearing on January 25, 2021.
