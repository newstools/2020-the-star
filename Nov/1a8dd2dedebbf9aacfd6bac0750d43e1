Grammy award-winning American singer Alicia Keys has praised Diamond Platnumz for his role on her ‘Alicia’ album. The album released last month saw Diamond feature on the ‘Wasted Energy’ track. While doing a recap of the album, Alicia Keys hailed Diamond for introducing a unique style to the project. She said it is a clear definition of the music world colliding to come up with a masterpiece. “I also love that Diamond Platnumz was part of this, an amazing Tanzanian artiste, who happens to come in and bless this track with his unique style. I love how the worlds collide here. This is like world music collision at its finest,” Alicia said. The Tanzanian singer took to social media to appreciate the 'Girl On Fire' hitmaker. "It's a privilege and honour to be featured in this iconic album of the Queen....Thank you @aliciakeys and my brother @therealswizzz for believing in me," he wrote. Diamond made history as the first African musician to feature on the album of an American artiste. Alicia drew backlash after featuring Diamond for only a few seconds. Leaping to her defence, her husband American record producer Swizz Beatz asked Diamond to tell his fans that it was his own decision to get a small slot. "My Brother 4 life. Please let your fans know you did as you pleased on the rec and this is just part 1," Swizz wrote on Instagram. In another post, the producer commented that they have another project together. "Let’s do the long version Asap." Diamond added, "This means a lot to me, Queen. Working with you was a dream come true. And I can't wait for the world to hear what we still have in store."
