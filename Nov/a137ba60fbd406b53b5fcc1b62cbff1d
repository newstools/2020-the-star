Police are pursuing a prisoner who tricked officers into using a toilet and using his feaces to attack one officer before escaping in Tana River county on Monday. A police report indicates that the prisoner Abdul Awadh, 19, asked permission to answer call of nature while held at Bura Police Station. He was then granted permission and escorted to the toilets which are outside the station by police constable Antony Wanjau, the report indicates. “In the course if the act, the prisoner took too long and when the officer enquired why, the prisoner opened the doors of the toilet and smeared the officer with his faeces on the face which he had out in a bottle of water and started running away,” the report recorded under OB 12/30/11/2020 reads in part. The report records that the incident happened at 7am. The officer ran after him, while whistling to signal help from other officers, but by the time the officers responded, the suspect had already jumped over the fence. While many prison breaks involve use of digging holes in cells and other menial work, Awadh's use of biological methods worked for him. He was facing an assault charge.
