The World Motorsport Federation (FIA) has announced its plan to support Kenya's road safety and climate change adaptation programs ahead of next year's Safari Rally. FIA's president Jean Todt made the commitment on Wednesday during a meeting with President Uhuru Kenyatta at State House, Nairobi. Todt, who is also the Special Envoy of the UN Secretary-General on Road Safety, is currently in the country to assess Kenya's preparedness ahead of the World Rally Championship event which makes a comeback after 18 years. The FIA boss said Kenya is a key partner of his organization and pledged to continue working closely with the Kenyan Government to ensure that the return of the Safari Rally contributes to the socio-economic progress of the country. Uhuru welcomed the offer by the FIA saying a road safety campaign will be rolled out ahead of next year's Safari Rally. He regretted the postponement of the rally to next year due to Covid-19 saying Kenya will be better prepared to host the iconic global motorsport event. The event was scheduled for this year on June 19 but was postponed. The president thanked Todt for overseeing the Safari Rally's return to the global stage saying the achievement raised Kenya's profile as a sporting nation. The two leaders discussed several other programs of mutual interest between FIA including the ongoing digitization of vehicle number plates so as to enhance enforcement of road safety measures. Also discussed was the partnership between FIA and the Kenyan private sector in the manufacture of certified motorsport gear such as helmets. The Safari Rally was first held onÂ  May 27 to 1 June 1953 as the East African Coronation Safari to commemorate the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, with stages in Kenya Uganda and Tanzania. The rally was renamed to the East African Safari Rally in 1960, and it has been known as the Safari Rally since 1974 following its inclusion in the World Rally Championship the previous year.
