Celebrity couple DJ Mo and Size 8 are looking for a couple who have gone through hardships to take them for a treat. They are doing this to mark their seventh-year anniversary in marriage. "DJ has this great idea of us celebrating our 7th anniversary with one or two couples from people who follow us and support us," wrote Size 8. She went on to give the conditions. "The couple must have gone through hardship but stuck together. Nominate your couple by sending their story." The two have had their fair share of drama after DJ Mo was accused of cheating on Size 8. He asked for forgiveness and patched things up, and since then, they have been sharing photos of their vacation in Coast.
