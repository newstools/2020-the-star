Kiambu Youth executive Karungo wa Thang'wa says a printing business thrust him into politics. Speaking to Jeff Kuria on YouTube, the former country music radio presenter said he had ventured into the printing business after retrenchment at Mediamax. Karungo was initially working in China but was given a contract at Mediamax by the former boss Rose Kimotho, who offered him Sh400,000. When he flew back to the country and visited the station, he got to learn that Kimotho had already left. "She handed the station over to someone who made journalists suffer. When I gave him my contract, he said it had been signed by Rose, who no longer worked in the company." The presenter tried to argue his case but the new management would hear none of it. "I ended up leaving China for a job I did not even clinch and later got fired." It was then that he started a printing business that thrust him into a political career after meeting politicians and making campaign posters for them.
