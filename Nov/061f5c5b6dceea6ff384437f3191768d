Is Deputy President William Ruto slowly changing his mind on the BBI Constitution Bill 2020? When the BBI report was launched at the Bomas of Kenya in October, Ruto had his reservations and has been campaigning for recognition of the small businesses in the country. Ruto had also said that the issue of job creation as well as boosting youths in business needs to be relooked at. On Friday, the DP claimed through his Twitter account that the ‘New Article 11A in the BBI Constitution bill introduced after Bomas will anchor the ordinary people.' He added that it will favour the ‘hustler economics of wheelbarrow, boda boda, Mama mboga, pastoralists/butchers and guaranteed minimum returns on coffee, tea,korosho, sugar and,maize. He was referring to the inserted Article in the Economy and Shared Prosperity. But according to the current BBI bill and the BBI report which was released in October, both anchored the need for an economic system that provides equitable opportunity. The only new article introduced is 11A(3), which says that: “Parliament shall enact legislation to give full effect to this article (11).” Earlier on the DP reiterated that a consensus is still possible even as the signature collection for the referendum goes on. He said that a consensus will end a non-divisive referendum that will give Kenyans the opportunity to express themselves without 'a US vs THEM, WIN vs LOSE contest.' "Unity is the strength needed to fight Covid-19 and organise the economy." President Uhuru Kenyatta and his Handshake partner Raila Odinga launched the signature collection exercise on Wednesday at KICC. Ruto missed the event which was thronged with political leaders including Interior CS Fred Matiangi, Governors Hassan Joho (Mombasa), Kitui's Charity Ngilu, Kirinyaga's Anne Waiguru, Narok's Samuel Tunai, Kisumu's Anyang Nyongó, Jubilee Secretary General Raphael, TujuKiambu's James Nyoro.
