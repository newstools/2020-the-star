A man whose hand was chopped off by unknown assailants in Nyando, Kisumu county, is nursing injuries in hospital. Nyando  subcounty poice commander Leonard Matete confirmed the incident, saying his officers had been sent to collect the severed hand. “Unfortunately, those who rushed to the scene to rescue him failed to carry along the severed hand for doctors to try restoring it,” Matete said Matete said a report by local human rights activist Jane Omanga revealed that they received news of the victim whose hand had been chopped off by an assailant  near Kochogo High School in Nyando. He said the man was admitted at Ahero subcounty hospital but the hand was still lying in the shamba where the attack happened. The  officer  said the circumstances surrounding the attack were still unclear but the investigating team was keen to unearth the story. Efforts to find out the condition of the victim at Ahero subcounty hospital did not bear fruit, although sources disclosed that he was stable and receiving treatment. Edited by Kiilu Damaris
