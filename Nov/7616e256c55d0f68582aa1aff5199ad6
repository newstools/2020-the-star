Nakuru County Assembly is yet again mourning the death of an MCA who has succumbed to suspected Covid-19. Governor Lee Kinyanjui confirmed the demise of Nakuru's London Ward MCA Samwel Karanja Mbugua on Thursday. Karanja's death comes barely two weeks after the death of Hell’s Gate MCA John Njuguna. In his condolence to Karanja, the governor said that the assembly is mourning a  third loss of its members in one year. Governor Lee said that Karanja had a unique responsibility of representing a highly multi-ethnic ward, which gave him a broader and more balanced political approach. "He was an honest and hardworking leader who displayed great zeal in resolving his constituents' problems," the governor said. He added that Karanja,  the sheng speaking member was an easy-going, likable leader who had no time for petty disagreements. He was a peacemaker per excellence. "At this difficult moment of sorrow, our hearts and prayers go to his family, friends, and constituents." Njuguna, who was popularly known as Wa-Sussy, had succumbed to the virus on November 9, while undergoing treatment at Nakuru Nursing Home. Nakuru is among the counties that has been heavily affected by the virus.
