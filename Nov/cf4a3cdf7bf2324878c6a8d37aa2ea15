Residents have intensified calls for the creation of Mwingi county through the Building Bridges Initiative. They said splitting of Kitui to create a Mwingi county was among the proposals they gave to the BBI task force. The residents said they would not be convinced to support the BBI report if it did not the mention creation of Mwingi county. Sammy Nzoka, a resident of Mwingi town, said it was high time all leaders in Ukambani led by Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka pushed for creation of Mwingi county. He said residents of Kitui should not be taken for granted and their views must be included in the report. Denis Mutisya, a youthful leader from Mwingi, said Mwingi having been gazetted as a district at the same time with Makueni and Tharaka Nithi districts, it deserved to be made a county as it had been promised by leaders years back. Geoffrey Sammy said that constitutional amendment was a people-driven process, and urged President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga to consider the views of the people of Kitui. He urged all leaders to make the process of amending the Constitution inclusive by bringing everyone on board. Solomon Mutemi, a resident of Kivou location in Mwingi, said residents of Kitui county had been sidelined in the BBI process and that was why they were reluctant to support the report. “Kitui is a vast county which needs to be split into two to ensure ease in service delivery,” Mutemi said.
