The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission has successfully reclaimed government land that had been illegally awarded to private owners. The land which belonged to the Kenya National Library Services and another four government houses in Kitale had been illegally allocated and title documents issued to private persons. EACC, through its North Rift Regional office in Eldoret, had filed cases on May 20, 2015, seeking to recover the land. The KNLS land is valued at Sh8 million, while the government houses are valued at Sh 10 million, totaling to Sh18 million assets recovered. The Kitale Municipality Block 4/87 and Block 4/88 which had been allocated to the Department of Housing had been taken by Kapsoen Estates Limited and Wilson Gacanja. Also, Wison Gacanja and five others had been taken to court by EACC demanding to recover a parcel allocated to KNLS. In his judgment, Justice Mwangi Njoroge agreed with EACC submissions and canceled the two titles. Justice Mwangi affirmed that the titles recovered should be issued to its initial owner. Mwangi noted that the Commissioner of Lands by then, Wilson Gachanja, did not have the power to alienate land, since that was the preserve of the President. Also, the suit land could not have been alienated to any other person as it had been reserved for use by KNLS and no intervening act could divest its interest. The commission was represented by its advocate James Mokua.
