Vihiga United coach Sammy Okoth expects a tough Kenya Premier League and National Super League promotion/relegation play-off second leg tie against Kisumu All Stars today at Moi Stadium in Kisumu. However, Okoth remained confident that they will overcome the Kenya Premier League side and seal a return to the top tier league. All Stars won the first leg 2-1 at Mumias Sports Complex on Saturday last week.  The two teams are sponsored by the county governments of Vihiga and Kisumu. “We have nothing to lose. We are going to attack Kisumu All Stars in numbers from the first minute. We want to recover the two goals we conceded at home and win the game. A win is what will count at the end of the game,” said Okoth. He added that a fourth-minute penalty which they conceded against All Stars disorganised his players who resorted to long balls which is usually not their style of play. “That penalty made them panic and resorted to shortcuts by abandoning our game plan. Since Sunday, we have been working on their mental strength,” said the tactician. He added: “If we play our game against All Stars, I’m confident we shall win the encounter and return to the Kenya Premier League. It is sad that we are chasing the game and playing away from home. It makes things tough for us but in football, anything can happen.” Kisumu All Stars coach Andrew Aroka warned his side against overconfidence ahead of the match, saying the tie is not yet over. “We can’t afford to be complacent despite having a two away goal advantage,” said the youthful coach. Kisumu All Stars finished 16th on the KPL log when the Football Kenya Federation (FKF ) President Nick Mwendwa announced the end of the season due to the Covid-19 pandemic while Vihiga United were third on the NSL log. Nairobi City Stars and Bidco United gained automatic qualification to the Kenya Premier League next season.
