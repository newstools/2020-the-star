Nominated MP Godfrey Osotsi has told Deputy President William Ruto to 'stop unrealistic' amendment demands and openly oppose the BBI report. The legislator said on Thursday that Ruto's demands are dishonest and meant to scuttle the BBI process. His sentiment comes after Ruto said the report does not belong to President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga. The DP said the BBI process is about the country and therefore it is wrong to reduce the Constitution amendment process to Uhuru-Raila affair. He said the BBI is about the country, and should be an all-inclusive affair. “It is ours collectively. We are either all in or all cornered. We must build bridges to the church, pastoralists, devolved units and others to achieve consensus,” Ruto said on Wednesday. But Osotsi said though there is a genuine need to relook into the BBI report, the process should not be turned into a push and pull game. “They are only looking for a chance to make a political entry into the BBI process to control it after realising that the two principals – Uhuru and Raila – were indeed very serious with constitutional amendments,” Osotsi said. The MP said Kenyans should not be denied a constitutional moment because of selfish interests of non-visionary leaders. On Tuesday, Raila said there is little chance of incorporating new ideas being brought into the BBI document ahead of a referendum.
