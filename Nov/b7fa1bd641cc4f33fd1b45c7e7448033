The Coast Parliamentary Group will meet later this week to deliberate on the BBI report. Group secretary and Ganze MP Teddy Mwambire said they will meet to brainstorm the document so all the issues they have been advocating are included. Speaking in Ganze on Sunday, Mwambire said a fraction of their proposals to the Building Bridges Initiative task force were included but some left out. The MPs are drawn from the Kieleweke and Tangatanga camps, which have differed on the report. “There are people who are insincere. They have been going round claiming not even a single of the proposals from the Coast was included. One of the issues we proposed was the maintaining of the current constituencies and the report has included that. We wanted an increment on the funds going to counties and that was also included,” Mwambire said. He said the main aim of the meeting is to go through the document so that they can make proposals and come up with a joint way forward. “Some MPs are attending a meeting in Naivasha and the rest will go to Naivasha in the second lot. After that, we will meet to agree on the date of the meeting,” Mwambire said. He said the meeting will not be about who is supporting who. “This is not about Kieleweke or Tangatanga. It is not about Raila, Uhuru or Ruto but about the interests of the people whom we represent,” he added. He advised residents to read the report and make recommendations. Kaloleni MP Paul Katana and his Kilifi South counterpart Ken Chonga said they are aware of the meeting. “I am currently in a meeting in Naivasha but I am aware of that,” Chonga said. But Kilifi North MP Owen Baya, who has been critiquing the document, said he is not aware of the planned meeting. CPG chairman Said Hirabae, who is also the Galole MP,  could not be reached on  the phone. Edited by EKibii
