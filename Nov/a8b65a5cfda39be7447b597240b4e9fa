A businessman on Wednesday failed to have the DCI compelled to return his firearm. Milimani senior resident magistrate David Ndungi ruled that Kevin Obia's petition did not comply with the requirement that all applications be filed electronically. "The application before me is wrongfully filed in court as Obia has not followed proper procedure despite having been represented by a lawyer," Ndungi said. He advised the businessman to file another application using the proper procedure. The magistrate concurred with the prosecution that the application was filed manually, not electronically against the directive of the Chief Justice. The Director of Public Prosecutions had asked the court to reject the businessman's request, saying the application dated October 23 was not procedurally brought to court. He said the court has no jurisdiction to hear Obia's application to release the firearm since his criminal case subject to the matter was withdrawn and the file closed when he was discharged under section 87(a) of Criminal Procedure Code. The firearm was taken from Obia after he was charged with threatening to killÂ  security guard Yohanna Imbwaka at Vue Claire Place apartment in Kileleshwa on March 16. Police said they confiscated the gun to verify the authenticity of Obia's firearm licence. The magistrate said Obia could file a formal application on or before November 10 when the matter will be mentioned for further direction. Police claimed that Obia was caught on CCTV brandishing his gun at the guard. He was charged with threatening to kill the guard and behaving disorderly.  - mwaniki fm
