Public healthcare workers have pledged to continue their strike until their demands for promotion and redesignation are met. More than 2,000 healthcare workers have been on strike since October 29. “So far the Health ministry is yet to respond. They say they are waiting for the Public Service approval,” Kenya Union of Clinical Officers chairperson Peterson Wachira said. The strike has affected all public health facilities under the Ministry of Health. They include airports, border points and all points of entry, the National Spinal Injury Hospital, Mathari Hospital, Othaya Hospital, the National Blood Bank, national public health laboratories and all other facilities. They want the government to ensure all officers who have stagnated in one job group for years are promoted based on qualifications and promotions are based on years of stagnation. For instance, some officers in four job groups have stagnated for more than 12 years. Those in three job groups have stagnated for nine to 11 years. Those in two job groups have stagnated for six to eight years and those in one job group have stagnated for three to six years. "The situation has become so bad that most of the discriminated  against professional heads of department are several job groups below their juniors whom they are supposed to lead," KNUN branch secretary at the national government Maureen Nzioka said. The unions issued their first strike notice on May 4 over the same issues. But it was suspended after the ministry initiated conciliatory meetings with representatives of all unions. Discussions have not borne fruit. Also participating in the strike are the Kenya Health Professionals Society, the Kenya National Union of Laboratory Officers, Kenya National Union of Pharmaceutical Technologists and the Kenya Union of Nutritionists and Dieticians.
