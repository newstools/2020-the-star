The Deaf Athletics Association of Kenya remains hopeful that the Deaf Half Marathon slated for December 6 will go on despite Covid-19 and the logistical challenges they are currently encountering. Tom Okiki, the Public Relations Officer at DAAK, said that the association is monitoring Covid-19 infection trends in the country and will soon decide on whether to continue or postpone the event once again. “The event will be held on December 6 depending on the Covid-19 situation in the country. We are yet to identify a venue and we are still working on the logistics,” Okiki said. Another headache facing DAAK is the lack of enough funds to finance Covid-19 tests for participants. “All athletes will be required to undergo a Covid-19 test beforehand but the problem is that not all of them have the money to pay for the test,” Okiki said. To this end, the association is seeking corporates to plug in the financial shortfalls and provide logistical support. “Safaricom is the main sponsor and we are still approaching others to come on board. However, not many might come on board due to the effects of Covid-19,” he said. Okiki is also worried that the long period of inactivity due to the Covid-19 restrictions might negatively affect athletes’ fitness levels. Furthermore, he added, many athletes have been economically ravaged during this period which has contributed to psychological stress. “We have elite athletes such as Daniel Kiptum, Peter Toroitich and Lucas Wanjiru, who are expected to grace the event. The registration will be open until the last minute,” Okiki said. The marathon was originally planned for April 26 in Nakuru but was postponed due to Covid-19. In addition, the National Deaf Track and Field Championships scheduled for May 29-30 was cancelled due to the pandemic.
