At least one person has been confirmed killed by suspected Pokot bandits in Kapedo while three people are still missing. While confirming the incident, Turkana Police Commander Samuel Ndanyi said the Form One student was shot after suspected armed Pokot bandits attacked a group of men who were fetching firewood in Kapedo on Thursday at around 6 am. He said security personnel retrieved the body and are still searching for three people who were in the company of the deceased. "The security personnel are currently in the bush where the incident happened and so far one body has been found and they are looking for three missing people," he said. He said the security personnel are beefing up security in the region. Area Assistant Chief of Kapedo Mercy Asmit said a group of men who were fetching firewood were ambushed by armed suspected bandits from West Pokot. She said due to insecurity issues in Kapedo, men are considered to fetch firewood in the bush and that's how they were attacked. Ali Lokiru Turkana East MP has urged the government to beef up security in the region. "People who attacked Lomelo on Wednesday and people who attacked Kapedo come from Silale in Pokot East. It's high time the government to stop the talks and act as we can't continue losing lives," he said. He claimed that suspected Pokot bandits were not looking for animals and instead their intention was to kill and they have succeeded in killing innocent people.
