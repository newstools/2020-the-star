The Kirinyaga government has upgraded four major towns in the county with an aim of creating an environment conducive to business. The facelift given to Kagio, Kutus, Kianyaga and Keruguya mainly involve cabro-paving, installations, improved car park and drainage, modern markets and eco toilets. Before the projects were initiated, residents used to do business under very unfavourable conditions. "We are thankful that we now have walkways. Before, we used to struggle walking on mud and it was difficult to ferry and sell our farm produce, especially on rainy season," John Bosco, a resident of Kerugoya, said. Governor Anne Waiguru said some of the projects have been made possible through partnerships. She revealed her administration’s plan to tarmac Kerugoya and Kutus towns, a programme she says will be extended to other towns. Waiguru said her administration has partnered with the national government in the upgrade of Wang'uru Stadium and tarmacking of Ngurubani town. The county has also established 10 modern markets and more have been factored in this year's budget. The markets will be installed with electricity and adequate water points for enhanced supply with a view to turning them into 24-hour economies. Environment chief officer Jared Migwi, for his part, urged residents to be more responsible by dumping garbage at designated sites. On the ongoing construction of Kerugoya medical complex, Waiguru said the project, which is 80 per cent complete, is expected to be commissioned by the end of next year. The multimillion-shilling complex will increase Kerugoya bed capacity to 500. Recently during an inspection visit to the project, the governor said the hospital is furnished with the ICU, HDU, cancer centre, paediatrics ward and a maternity wing, among units. One of its wings has been spared to serve as a Covid centre.  Edited by F'Orieny
