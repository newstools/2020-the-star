Digital cab drivers from the Coast will on Tuesday deactivate Uber and Bolt apps in protest against alleged mistreatment by the owners. The drivers said they were already shopping for locally made apps whose owners are ready to give them fair hearing and terms of engagement. The drivers through the Coast Digital Cabs Association said they resorted to deactivating the foreign apps after their pleas for a review of terms of engagement were ignored. The association’s chairperson Wilberforce Marley said members had been frustrated for long and it was time they took action. Marley said the managements of the two apps have been making decisions on the welfare of the drivers without involving or consulting them. He claimed the managers had put the welfare of owners and customers on the front and sidelined drivers. "They have sometimes effected punitive measures such as permanently deactivating the drivers without giving them notice or even valid reasons for the deactivation," Marley said. He said the apps were also introducing oppressive rates, some even lower than boda boda charges to hurt drivers. “Going to the streets and burning tyres or protesting is a thing of the past and that is why we will all permanently deactivate the apps,” Marley said. He said drivers were hurting, with some car owners who took loans to purchase the vehicles almost losing them to the banks for failure to service the loans. He said the income from the cabs is so limited that most of the investors cannot afford to repay their loans. “As from Wednesday, we will be on local apps such as Little and others who have agreed to negotiate terms of engagement, “he said. Calls to the management of both companies to respond to the allegations went unanswered.
