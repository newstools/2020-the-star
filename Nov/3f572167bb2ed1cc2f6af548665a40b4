The UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has deeply raised concern over the unfolding situation in the Tigray region of Ethiopia and its surrounding area. This comes amid reports of a potential military offensive into the regional capital of Mekelle. In a statement released by the UN secretary-general spokesperson Stephane Dujarric, Guterres has urged leaders of Ethiopia to do everything possible to protect civilians, uphold human rights, and ensure humanitarian access for the provision of much-needed assistance. Guterres has also called for the free and safe movement of people searching for safety and assistance, regardless of their ethnic identity, across both national and international borders. The Ethiopian government had asked the International Community not to interfere with the ongoing law enforcement operations in the Northern region of Tigray. The government said that that it is capable of resolving its internal affair. Part of the statement from the Ethiopian government said that: “Maintaining integrity of our political and constitutional order compels us to take robust law enforcement measures against the clique of renegades within the TPLF” Continued: As a sovereign state, Ethiopia has every right to uphold and enforce its laws within its own territory. And that is exactly what we are doing." Guterres reiterated full support of the UN to the initiative of the Chairperson of the African Union, President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa, to facilitate peaceful solutions. He urges all parties to seize this opportunity to de-escalate tensions.
