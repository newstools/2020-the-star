Match-fixing still has deeper roots in Africa, and the latest to be on spot is the Tanzania local club Young Africans Club (Yanga). The club’s consultant from South Africa Senzo Mbatha was arrested by the Tanzanian police in its capital Dar es Salaam for alleged match-fixing and taking part in corruption. His arrest came after his WhatsApp messages leaked, where he had been pocketing for influencing the results. Senzo had previously worked with Simba FC, the rivals to his current Yanga club. Among the allegations facing him includes the recent two defeats since this new season began. Senzo was later released after interrogation regarding the allegations. After the release, Senzo who had also worked with South African clubs including Orlando Pirates, and Platinum Stars said the allegations are being prompted by his enemies from the former club. “It has never dawned on me that moving from #Redteam to Yanga FC will cause me so much antagonism,” Senzo said. He wrote through his Instagram account that; “It is now evident that I have caused hurt and hatred in the Tanzanian football fraternity to the extent that people will risk it all to tarnish my name in pursuit of revenge.” On August 9, 2020, Senzo was on the spot for controversial signings to his club.
