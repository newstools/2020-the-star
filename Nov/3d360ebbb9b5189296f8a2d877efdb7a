Inspector General of Police Hillary Mutyambai has aordered all police officers across the country to enforce President Uhuru Kenyatta’s directives to contain the coronavirus. In a memo on Thursday, the IG said that the National Police Service will work closely with National Government Administrative officers and county governments to ensure total compliance with the Ministry of Health’s guidelines. “All police officers across the country have been instructed to enforce the Covid-19 protocols and regulations in strict compliance with the rule of law,” Mutyambai said. This comes a day after the president said that MoH guidelines meant to curb further spread of the virus will be strictly followed, as more cases of the virus continue to be reported. Mutyambai further directed police officers to ensure that the 10pm-4am curfew is implemented without any fear or favour. The IG has appealed to Kenyans to wear face masks, keep social distance while in public places, and to avoid unnecessary travel. He told owners of bars and restaurants to ensure that they closed by 9pm, as directed by the president. Mutyambai added that his officers will help counties to close down restaurants or shops which will not follow the guidelines. Earlier this week, the IG had said that any member of the public found in public places without a face mask will be fined Sh20,000. “Being in public without a mask attracts a fine of Sh20,000,” Mutyambai said. He however said that police officers are to enforce this within the law and no one is allowed to use excessive force while implementing this directive.
