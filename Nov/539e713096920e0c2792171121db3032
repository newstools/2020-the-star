Nyeri Governor Mutahi Kahiga has disclosed that he was suffering from Covid-19, and he has fully recovered from the disease. He said he was diagnosed with the disease 18 days ago. The governor said Covid-19 is not a respecter of one's position in society. “I'm a survivor of Covid-19. I was diagnosed with Covid-19 some 18 days ago but I thank God I am well again after a lot of attention from the medics. I have recovered fully,” he said. It was the first public appearance by the governor after staying away for close to three weeks. Kahiga was speaking at the Nyeri County Referral Hospital on Wednesday when the Equity Bank team, led by group chief commercial officer Polycarp Igathe, gave out Sh5 million worth of personal protective equipment for use by medical staff. The governor cautioned residents to follow prevention protocols by the ministry of Health to stay safe from the virus. “It is key that all of us take personal responsibility to keep the virus at bay. Let us wear masks, sanitise, stay away from crowds and generally be careful,” he said. Kahiga, however, told residents that Covid-19 is not a death sentence and it is possible to recover. Another high-profile person from the county who has been diagnosed with Covid-19 is Nyeri Catholic Archbishop Anthony Muheria. In a statement earlier this week, Muheria said he had been admitted to Mater Hospital where he was being treated for Covid-19. Kahiga said, “At this time and point, we remember Archbishop Muheria who is undergoing treatment at Mater Hospital in Nairobi. We pray to God that he will continue to heal him.” Nyeri assembly speaker John Kaguchia also wished Muheria a quick recovery. Igathe urged Kenyans, especially those living in rural areas, not to take preventative measures casually as they believe the disease is only affecting people in urban areas. He said the recovery of Governor Kahiga is an example of the good work being done by doctors and nurses in the country.
