Siaya Governor Cornel Rasanga wants funerals to be made short ceremonies without food and drink to deter large gatherings that can hasten the spread of Covid-19. Rasanga has asked public health officers to ban eating in funerals to contain the new wave of Covid-19 infection in the county. The county chief said motivations like food and seats in funerals that make residents break the maximum 200-people capacity should be done away with. He asked county police boss Francis Kooli to arrest all persons with no masks in public spaces and subject them to manual work. The governor spoke on Monday when he opened an Isolation Unit at Siaya County Referral Hospital. The 200-bed facility was constructed for Sh105 million. “From March 2020, the county government of Siaya instituted various measures to mitigate the negative effects of the virus, including the constitution of the County Emergency Response team,” Rasanga said. Rasanga said that despite making available handwashing and sanitation equipment to major public places, some of the residents are not using them. He said it is through such efforts that the county has registered low numbers of infected persons and even much lower numbers of deaths. The governor said that a glimpse of the trend in the last couple of days reveals that the county is now recording a double-digit number of infections in a single day. “The overriding reason for the surge is the lapse by our people in observing the prevention protocols,” Rasanga noted.
