Social activist Adelle Onyango hosted a preview brunch for an upcoming book. The book documents the voices of survivors of rape, observers, family members, activists, nurses, lawyers and many others, who offer a glimpse into the different perceptions of violence. The event was at Kileleshwa Gardens, where they previewed the book to people who have contributed to the journey of making the book. Speaking about the book, Adelle said, "When the book comes out in 2021, we implore Africans to get it, read it, listen to the survivorsâ€™ voices and then introspect on if you are helping end or aggravate sexual violence." Adelle noted Janet Mbugua has also been vocal on issues affecting vulnerable communities. "Her work on ending period poverty is exemplary. We picked her because of her genuine fight to make spaces safer for women and, as you know, all these issues facing women are interlinked." Janet said through the book, it will be easier for them to confront this issue of sexual violence. "It may also help other survivors start their healing journey," she said. Co-author Lanji JJ Ouko said, "We are sure the book will not just amplify the stories but show the work needed to support survivors, ensure justice and ultimately end sexual violence."
