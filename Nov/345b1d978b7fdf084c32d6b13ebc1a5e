The West Pokot county government is distributing free two-month-old kienyeji chicks to women's groups to improve nutrition and income. Women are not allowed to own livestock - only men can own them. The county distributed more than 12,420 chicks last month. The aim is to distribute more than 20,000 chicks to 20 women's groups in six wards. The programme is implemented by the county and the Agriculture ministry in the Climate Smart Agriculture project. Speaking at Lomut during the distribution, Governor John Lonyangapuo said the programme will stimulate the economy at the grassroots. It will also improve nutrition. “Cases of malnutrition are very high and the programme aims to reduce malnutrition and stunting," he said. The governor said that in this financial year they began with six wards but the programme will be extended to cover the whole county.  Lonyangapuo said demand for chicken was high in the country, that’s why his government has decided to invest in the project. “Demand for kienyeji chicken from this county is high and we want to produce more for buyers outside West Pokot," he said. Buyers come from as far as Nairobi every day, he said. He said his government will set up hatcheries to supply chicks to poultry farmers at subsidised prices. Mary Cheptoo said the community only allows women to own chickens and she was happy she will be able to earn income. “I thank the government since women are the main beneficiaries. At least we can own something," she said. “Livestock are not owned by women in our community and we are happy the county government is empowering us." Cheptoo said women have suffered from poverty but in the next two years "our chickens will have multiplied and we will be able to meet the demands of our customers." (Edited by V. Graham)
