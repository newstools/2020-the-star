Residents of Sikawa area of Transmara West have protested against deplorable roads. They said their farm produce and cane can't be delivered on impassable roads. Led by Olasenua village elder David ole Lesere, they cited the five kilometre Sikawa-Ogwedhi road which connects Migori county, saying it is unusable. “This region leads in cane  farming and better roads will uplift lifting standards," Lesere said. He said because of the poor road network, the farmers have been incurring huge losses as they can't transport to Nyanza companies. “The roads should be improved as a matter of priority as the only way to market the produce,” he said. The elder said the roads have been neglected for 10 years by the authorities and blamed the Narok county government. “It is shameful to see motorists being forced to sleep on roads because their vehicles are stuck in mud while others incurring high maintenance costs due to frequent vehicle breakdowns,” he said. Bishop Dalmas Momboshi criticised leaders for failing to fix the road network. “It is sad  leaders have been wasting time in early campaigns for 2022 polls while other people who voted for them are suffering,” he said. Retired senior chief Andrew Oriche appealed the county to upgrade the roads to spare the workers further agony. "Our people have suffered for long and it is time for the government to act,” Oriche said. Efforts to get comments from county officials were unsuccessful as one official said they had to wait for a formal complaint from the affected people. (Edited by V. Graham)
