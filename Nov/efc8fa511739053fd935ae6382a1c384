President Uhuru Kenyatta has sent a message of comfort to the family of Professor James Kagia who passed away today. Kagia is the husband of State House Deputy Chief of Staff in charge of Policy and Strategy Ruth Kagia. In his message of comfort, Uhuru eulogised Kagia as a distinguished Kenyan medical doctor, scholar and university lecturer whose service to the nation shall be sorely missed. The Head of State regretted the untimely death of Professor Kagia, a highly experienced public health expert, at a time when the country needed his expertise in the ongoing fight against Covid-19. "It is unfortunate that we've lost Professor Kagia at a time when the country needs his expertise the most especially in the response to the Covid-19 health crisis which is sweeping across the world," he eulogised. Professor Kagia taught community health at the University of Nairobi for many years and previously worked as a medical doctor at John Hopkins and Georgetown University hospitals in the US. The President wished Kagia and the family of the departed academic God's comfort as they mourn their beloved patriarch. Ruth was elevated to her position placing her at the centre of formulating and driving the government’s political and socio-economic development programmes. Kagia worked at the World Bank for 22 years, where she rose to the position of Country Director for Southern Africa, managing the bank’s portfolio in South Africa, Botswana, Namibia, Lesotho, Swaziland, Mauritius and Madagascar.
