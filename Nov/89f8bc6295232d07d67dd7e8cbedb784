The BBI report debate dominated the burial of Nyaribari Chache MP Richard Tong’i’s father on Monday as leaders differed on the document. Some said all Kenyans should be involved in rectifying contentious issues, while others said the report is okay as it is. Present during Mzee Willingstone Tongi's final send-off in Amariba village were Senate Speaker Kenneth Lusaka, MPs Ezekiel Machogu (Nyaribari Masaba), Sylvanus Osoro (South Mugirango), Alfah Miruka (Bomachoge Chache) and a number of MCAs. Osoro and Miruka termed it wrong for Kenyans to be forced to blindly support the report, yet they have not read and understood it. “There is need for consensus over this report because some elements in it raise more questions than answers,” Osoro said. Miruka said citizens cannot be forced to support a document they have no idea how it will affect their lives. “It will be unfortunate for leaders with selfish interests to force citizens to support a report without allowing them to go through it and make decisions,” he said. However, Machogu told the two leaders to tell people the truth, adding that the report is good for all Kenyans. “I do not see anything wrong with the BBI report. Most of the proposals are aimed at bringing a number of changes which will be beneficial to all Kenyans,” he said. Machogu said the proposal that Cabinet secretaries be appointed from Parliament is good because they understand the problems of the common mwananchi. Speaker Lusaka urged politicians to engage in politics that will not divide Kenyans but bring peace. “We need not engage in divisive politics. As leaders, we should be at the forefront of preaching peace because it is paramount for the development of any nation,” he said. Edited by A.N
