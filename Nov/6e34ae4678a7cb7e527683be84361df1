Clinical officers want all personal protective equipment lying idle at the Kenya Medical Supplies Authority stores to be distributed to healthcare workers. The appeal comes after several healthcare workers died due to the coronavirus â€“ the latest cases were of four medics who succumbed to the virus on Saturday. The four doctors who died are said to have contracted the virus in the line of duty. They are Emarah Ashraf, Hudson Alumera, Jackline Njoroge, and Faith Mburu. Speaking on Sunday, clinicians said they want all healthcare workers who are pregnant, those aged above 55 years, and those with pre-existing medical conditions exempted from duty until the virus is contained. "It is worth noting that almost all health workers who succumbed to Covid-19 belong to the vulnerable group," Kenya Union of Clinical Officers secretary general George Gibore said. "These deaths could have been avoided had the government heeded our advisories to excuse this category from active duty as it is with other countries like Ethiopia, Ghana, and Rwanda." The union officials said the surging numbers of medics dying of the virus raises serious questions on the safety of healthcare workers, especially those on the frontline in the fight against Covid-19.
