Athletics Kenya have been nominated for the 2020 Member Federation Award for their exceptional organisation of October's Kip Keino Classic in Nairobi. AK is among six federations that were nominated by their respective area associations for the award whose winner will be announced via a virtual ceremony on December 5. "Despite nationwide lockdowns and other disruptions, the federation succeeded in organising and staging the Kip Keino Classic, the first World Athletics Continental Tour Gold meeting in Africa. Kenyan athletes also competed well internationally, sweeping the team titles at the World Athletics Half Marathon Championships Gdynia 2020," World Athletics said. In recognising AK, the world governing body acknowledged the strenuous circumstances under which they performed their activities due to Covid-19 restrictions. "The Member Federation Award is a special honour this year to recognise a Member Federation that has managed to deliver an uplifting athletics event. We all know the difficulties that sport has faced during the pandemic," WA president Sebastian Coe said. Other nominees for the inaugural award include Athletics New Zealand, Nicaraguan Athletics Federation, Polish Athletics Association, Peruvian Athletics Federation and Palestine Athletics Federation. "While high level athletes were not able to compete overseas, the federation organised several competitions, one of which was capped by an area record in the women's hammer throw. The Rotorua Marathon in September was one of the first mass participation events to take place in the world since March," WA says of Athletics New Zealand. The virtual event will be held on the same night as the World Athletics Awards for the male and female athlete of the year.Â  It will be streamed live via WA's YouTube channel, Twitter and Facebook page.
