The death toll from Wednesdayâ€™s protests against the arrest of Ugandan presidential candidate Robert Kyagulanyi, known as Bobi Wine, has risen to seven, police say. A spokesperson has told the BBC that more than 40 people had also been injured in the protests. Police have still not explained the cause of the deaths or the nature of the injuries. Graphic videos and photos shared on social media showed several people lying in the streets covered in blood, allegedly shot dead. An Uganda Red Cross statement said that their frontline workers had assisted 11 people with gunshot wounds. Meanwhile, opposition presidential candidates have suspended their campaigns, calling for fellow contestants to be released. Retired army generals Mugisha Muntu and Henry Tumukunde also demanded that police stop violence against candidates and the public. Campaign events for several opposition candidates have been broken up or blocked by the police. Bobi Wine was arrested at a campaign rally in the east of the country on Wednesday. The police bundled him into a van, claiming that he had drawn a crowd larger than the 200 people recommended by the Electoral Commission, as a Coronavirus prevention measure. His lawyers say he has yet to be charged.
