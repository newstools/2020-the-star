Lawyer Donald Kipkorir has narrated his chilling experience with Covid-19 as he urged friends to only text and not call. In a Facebook post on Monday, Kipkorir said he assumed that whatever chill he was feeling it would go away with time. "In the afternoon of November 2, I experienced cold chill in my body. It is as though I was atop the Swiss Alps in December. I took a very hot shower, wore two t-shirts, a sweater and two track-bottoms & two duvets. I broke no sweat," he said. "But It didn’t. On Friday, I decided to visit my Doctors at Aga Khan University Hospital. They did all tests on my blood and urine and found I was as fit as a fiddle." Kipkorir said after the tests, the doctors decided to test for Covid-19 which came back positive. "I tested positive. I have no fever. I don’t cough. I don’t sneeze. By the time I tested positive, my lungs had been compromised," he said. "The doctors had to work to help my lungs recover, my oxygen levels increased and to have my body fight the viral attack." He said that the doctors gave him cocktails of medicine and oxygen since then. "...but now well to be discharged to recuperate at home. Whilst admitted here, I got to learn about the virus, not much but a little," he said. Kipkorir said the people he had interacted with all tested negative. "I don’t know where and how I was infected. But I didn’t infect anyone I know that I came in contact with," he said. He noted that no government can shoulder the expenses of the virus. "Responsibility therefore for containing the spread and treatment is a personal responsibility. To blame GoK for its spread or treatment is falsehood and hypocrisy," he said. "For now, as I leave for home to recuperate, I plead with my friends to chat with me by text and Whatsapp only to allow my lungs to heal." Kipkorir said he wants to limit his speaking. "And thanks to all my family’s and friends locally and abroad for all prayers and well wishes. I will get back to all," he added.
