Kenyan lawyer Paul Gicheru made his first appearance at the International Criminal Court at The Hague, Netherlands on Friday evening. Gicheru is facing several accounts of charges in interfering with the ICC case against humanity in Kenya. Among the charges read to him include bribing the witness with Sh2.5 million and a job offer in exchange to drop the witness against the suspect. The Eldoret based lawyer presented himself to the international court after being pursued. He said that his step was a voluntary move and was not bribed to present himself to ICC. During the first appearance, the Pre-Trial Chamber confirms the identity of the suspect, ensures that the suspect understands the charges, confirms that language in which the proceedings should be conducted, and sets a date to begin the confirmation of charges hearing. Gicheru on Monday surrendered to the authorities of The Netherlands pursuant to an arrest warrant issued by Pre-Trial Chamber II of the International Criminal Court. Gicheru is suspected of offenses against the administration of justice consisting of corruptly influencing witnesses of the court. The arrest warrant against Gicheru and Philip Kipkoech Bett was issued under seal on 10 March 2015 and unsealed on 10 September 2015. Philip Kipkoech Bett is not in ICC custody. The case remains in the Pre-Trial stage, pending the suspects' arrest or voluntary appearance before the Court. The ICC does not try individuals in their absence. The court had issued a warrant of arrest warrants for three Kenyans — Walter Barasa, Gicheru and Phillip Bett — on charges of obstructing the course of justice.
