 Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp said “good performances never give me a headache” as Diogo Jota pressed his claims for a starting place with a Champions League hat-trick at Atalanta. Jota, 23, was selected ahead of Roberto Firmino and took his tally to seven goals in 10 games as the Reds won 5-0. Klopp said: “It is important we have more than 11 [to choose from] and tonight Diogo played a super game.” Champions Liverpool face Manchester City in the Premier League on Sunday. The Reds are top of the Premier League, while Pep Guardiola’s side are in 10th place, five points adrift of their rivals but having played a game fewer. Klopp added: “For tonight, that was the decision — it was clear it made sense for tonight, first of all, to use the good shape Diogo is in. “And because of the way Atalanta play and defend, it made sense that the skillset of Diogo helps.” Jota joined for £41m from Wolves and said he was “playing in the best team of my career so far”. He told BT Sport: “I don’t know if it’s the best moment of my career but obviously scoring goals is my way of playing football. I’m happy with this, a great win away in Champions League, a good moment and a good night.” Asked what they can take into Sunday’s game against City, Jota said: “Well five goals, that doesn’t happen so often to score five in one game. The clean sheet as well - if we can keep a clean sheet against City, we will win the game.”
