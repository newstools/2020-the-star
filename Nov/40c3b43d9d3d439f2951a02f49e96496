Gospel singer Rose Muhando is back in a new collaboration with Size 8. The two gifted artistes have released a thanksgiving song titled, 'Vice Versa'. Speaking to Word Is, Size 8 said the song is straight from their hearts to appreciate the gift of life after fighting different battles in life. "I've longed to do a collabo with the legendary artiste since I got saved seven years ago," she said. The mother of two added that they bonded quickly. "We did it so fast. The shortest time I've ever worked on any song with anyone, God's grace was too sufficient. She is so experienced." Rose Muhando has been working on several collaborations since 2018. She also released a ‘Kenya Ulindwe’ to thank Kenyan people and President Uhuru Kenyatta for supporting her.
