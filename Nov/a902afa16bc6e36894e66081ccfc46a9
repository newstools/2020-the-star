Senate Speaker Kenneth Lusaka has ruled that senators are allowed to wear traditional attire to the chambers. Standing orders recognise a suit and tie as official dress for male members. However, Muslims sometimes attend sessions in kanzus. Lusaka's ruling came after Narok Senator Ledama Ole Kina on Tuesday attended a plenary sitting wearing Maasai regalia. The attire attracted the attention of senators, who sought Lusaka's direction on whether the lawmaker was properly dressed. "Mr Speaker, Senator Ledama is wearing what looks like Maasai regalia. Is he in order because we can also come with all kinds of attire," Wajir Senator Abdulallahi Ibrahim said. Lusaka said the Senate represents counties and each has its own traditional attire. He cited speaker's rules and the Constitution that recognises culture. " We all know that we represent our counties and every county has their own cultural dressing. Narok and Kajiado have their cultural dressing which is recognised world over. So, it will be unfortunate for me to order him out of the house," he said.
