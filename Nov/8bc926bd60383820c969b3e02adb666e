Boys' U-17 teams from Busia, Bungoma, Kakamega and Vihiga counties have converged at the Mumias Sports Complex for a special tournament to select players for the national team that will take part in the Cecafa/Afcon qualifiers in Rwanda between December 13-18, 2020. The National U-17 head coach Oliver Page, FKF technical director Michael Amenga and NEC Member in charge of Youth Chris Amino will oversee the selection process. Amimo said they have already conducted trials in Nairobi, Rift Valley, Nyanza and Central regions and will conclude the selection with a similar exercise in Eastern, Coast and North Eastern on November 21. He said selected players will converge in Nairobi on November 24 before proceeding for the assignment in Rwanda.  Kenya will be featuring for the second time in the Afcon qualifiers as they seek to secure a slot for the continental youth bonanza. “We want to emulate former Kenya technical director, Reinhardt Fabisch, whose mode of selecting players saw small clubs like Two Fishes  produce players who stamped a mark with the national team, Harambee Stars." St. Anthony, Kitale High School’s Bairon Idoyo and Kelvin Ochakaka Mwari Primary Standard 7 pupil Paul Okiru are among those expected to undergo trials.
