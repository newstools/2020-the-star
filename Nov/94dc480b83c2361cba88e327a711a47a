Dancehall singer Redsan almost joined national football team Harambee Stars. Speaking to Churchill on the 'Journey Series' edition, Redsan relived how he came close to joining. "I was supposed to be selected for the team's under-17 back in 2001. We were playing Coca-Cola Cup. We were 12 teams and the winning team was to be selected to join Harambee Stars but I did not advance, I had an injury." "The other boys moved to the next stage. Some still play until now. I was a striker playing number nine. Right now I would have been a footballer and a musician. The likes of Dennis Oliech, Mariga know me." He also explained where he got his unique stage name ‘Redsan’ from. "Redsan was our football team in Parkview Academy. I was the captain but when the team parted ways, I decided to hold the name. My first time to hold a mic at F2, DJ Mdosi asked for my stage name, I said Redsan and the name stuck." During the interview, Redsan spoke candidly about his family, saying he decided to keep them private to protect them from trolls. "I have four children. There is one who rhymes. I tell him soma kwanza, sitaki noma. Kwanza the way the industry is hard, I tell him school first," he said. "The firstborn is turning nine, then there is a six-year-old and then a four-year-old, and the lastborn is two years. The lastborn is a boy, he pelekas me mbio. He is into TV and music, but mazee, I tell him to hold on. "There is so much disadvantage, especially kwanza huku East Africa, sijui ni nini mbaya. You might decide to expose your family then people compare and criticise them." He went on to say that most people diss you more than they will praise you. "Things like your outfit can be a topic. She [wife] always tells me to keep my family life away from social media, to post my work and nothing else. She says the family and my work should be two very different entities."
