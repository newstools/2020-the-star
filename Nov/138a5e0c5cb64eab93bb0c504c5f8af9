The BBI will help improve the relationship between governors and MCAs, Vihiga Governor Wilber Ottichilo has said. He said with the document in place, governors who have been facing impeachment threats from ward reps will get a reprieve. "With this BBI, governors are now going to have peace of mind in office," Ottichilo said. The governor addressed residents at the county headquarters after launching the signature collection drive. He said they expect to deliver over 100,000 signatures from Vihiga county. Ottichilo said county assemblies will be receiving their own money to run their activities without necessarily depending on the executive. "We have been receiving cash and disbursing to the assemblies countrywide. If that cash delays, MCAs are usually on our necks," he said. The county chief said the Ward Fund will help MCAs undertake development projects in their areas of jurisdiction without waiting for allocations from governors. "Having these MCAs as part of the CECMs will also help a lot as they will understand what the executive is going through," he said. Ottichilo urged all politicians to support the BBI. "If we walk on the same path in this county, we will win largely for our people," he said. He praised ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi for supporting BBI.
