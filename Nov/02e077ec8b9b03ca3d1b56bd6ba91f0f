Acting Director-General in the Ministry of Health Patrick Amoth has said the majority of new infections being reported are from community transmission. In his weekly interaction with Kenyans through his Twitter account, #AskTheDG, Amoth said that the country is currently experiencing a surge in the number of cases with a well-established community transmission. He, however, said that health experts need a bit more time and keener study of the graphs and models in order to be able to project a peak of this wave. “The surge in infections and deaths is attributable to a well-established community transmission. This has put at risk most people with comorbidity issues like diabetes, heart issues, hypertension,” Amoth said. The DG added that Covid-19 transmission is currently at the community level. “Many people may be Covid-19 positive already and continue transmitting the virus at the community level unknowingly. That’s why we strictly urge that you wear masks, wash hands regularly, and keep a physical distance.” Amoth reiterated that up to date, the virus has no known cure. “However, most people who contract Covid-19 are asymptomatic. Meaning that they may not present with symptoms. As such many may contract the virus and revert to normalcy without detection or management.” People with Covid-19 symptoms, which are flu-like symptoms such as coughing, fever, running nose, chest pains, loss of senses of taste and smell have been asked to go to a healthcare facility for test and management. On Tuesday, the government reported the highest number of deaths in 24 hours. Twenty-four deaths were reported, bringing the fatality to 1,154. The new positive cases were 1,344, bringing the total to 64,588 cases. Health CS Mutahi Kagwe also announced that 436 people had recovered, 297 from home-based care, while 139 were discharged from hospitals. The total recoveries now stand at 43,095.
