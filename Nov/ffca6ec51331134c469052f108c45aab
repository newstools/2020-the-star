Jude Bellingham says the chance to play regularly for Borussia Dortmund was one he simply could not turn down. Bellingham, 17, joined Dortmund from Birmingham City in the summer in a deal that could eventually be worth £30m. The England Under-21 midfielder has scored once in nine games for Dortmund, becoming the club’s youngest goalscorer and the youngest English player to appear in the Champions League. Bellingham believes all this justifies his decision to turn his back on offers from England, including Manchester United, and move to Germany. “The only thing I was bothered about in making this decision was playing football,” he said. “It’s as clear as day if you come here and do the right things, you will get your opportunity. “There are plenty of young players out there who, if given the chance, would shine at first-team level but they don’t quite get the chance for whatever reason. “I’m almost an example, as well as many others in our first team, for just giving people a chance. Throw them in the deep end and see what they can do. There are a lot more in the Championship who can handle it. These players are often better than you would think.”
