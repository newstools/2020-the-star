The number of new HIV infections among adults declined from 56,000 in 2010 to 35,000 in 2019, the latest report shows. This represents a 38 per cent decline, meaning Kenya missed the 2020 target of a 68 per cent reduction from 2010 to 2019. The 2020 target is a 75 per cent reduction in new infections. The latest global progress report was issued by UNAIDS and the UN Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA) on Tuesday About 1.2 million Kenyans are living with HIV and an estimated 180,000 die every year. At least 1.5 million people have died of Aids-related ailments since 1984. The report says new infections among young women aged 15 to 24 years declined by 44 per cent in the same period. “The annual number of people acquiring HIV must decline steeply in the next few years," the report reads. Reduction will require sharp focus on key populations, on adolescent girls and young women (and their male partners) in sub-Saharan Africa,  it reads. Between 2017 and 2019, prevention coverage expanded well for gay men and other men who have sex with men, people who inject drugs and female sex workers. The report said Kenya has about 207,000 sex workers. HIV prevalence in all ages in 2019 was 29 per cent. Condom use with the most recent client was 92 per cent and 73 per cent were receiving anti-retroviral therapy. The number of gay men is estimated at 51,000. HIV prevalence among all ages was about 18 per cent in 2018. Condom use in the last case of anal sex was 79 per cent; those receiving antiretroviral therapy was also about 79 per cent. In the third quarter of 2020, 54,498 people were actively receiving pre-exposure prophylaxis, an increase from 19,000 in 2018 and 30,000 in 2019. “This shows that scaling up PrEP programmes is feasible in low and middle-income countries," the report reads. Expanded access to PrEP is too recent and coverage and uptake too limited to significantly affect HIV incidence at this stage, the report said. HIV prevalence among intravenous drug users of all ages was 18 per cent. About 68 per cent were receiving antiretroviral therapy. About 88 per cent used safe injecting practices and 22 per cent were receiving methadone therapy. The report estimates the number of intravenous drug users at 20,000. Access to tailored prevention programmes has remained patchy. India and Kenya were the only focus countries to earn a 'good' or 'very good' rating for prevention among sex workers in 2019, the report says. It adds: “Kenya and Lesotho provided a full array of prevention services for adolescent girls and young women and their male partners in all districts with high HIV incidence - proof that rapid improvements are possible.” Kenya is also among countries that has recorded high condom use, a measure that reduces HIV transmission. Kenya was among three East African countries that surpassed their annual target of voluntary medical male circumcision in 2019. It aimed to achieve 90 per cent but achieved 100 per cent after more than 4,000 men were circumcised. “Voluntary medical circumcision is a one-time, preventive measure that reduces the risk of heterosexual transmission of HIV from women to men by 60 per cent," the report reads. VMC programmes were suspended in several countries during the first half of 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Curfews and other restrictions disrupted prevention services for sex workers and gay men and other men who have sex with men. "Many sex workers have lost their sources of income and are excluded from social protection programmes. They are struggling to afford housing and food. This adds to the pressures to accept unsafe sexual encounters and risk arrest under new Covid-19 laws.” The report praises Kenya’s effort in preventing disruptions to HIV treatment, which could substantially increase those dying from AIDS-related causes and acquiring HIV. Kenya has been dispensing at least three months of antiretroviral medicine to most people receiving HIV treatment. Community groups delivered antiretroviral and tuberculosis medicine to homes or to local drop-in centres. They also delivered condoms, lubricants and HIV self-testing kits to community distribution points. (Edited by V. Graham)
