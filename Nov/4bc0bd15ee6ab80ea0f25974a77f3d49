@robertomollo3 Two Homa Bay MCAs are mobilising residents to sign up for the BBI signature collection drive in their wards. Juma Awuor (Homa Bay East) and his Homa Bay Central counterpart Julius Nyambok said they want the collection of signatures done in speed to pave way for a referendum. They said they were seeking to have as many people as possible sign up. The mobilization started on Saturday and will end on Monday. Awuor said the mobilisation will enable residents from remote areas to also participate in the constitutional amendment push. He said he was supporting the BBI for establishing the Ward Development Fund which he hailed as a great idea. “We’re mobilising residents to append their signatures in the books very fast so we can beat the Tuesday deadline. The books are available at polling stations, chief camps and other public offices,” Awuor said. He was speaking at Imbo market in Homa Bay Town constituency on Saturday where he led the drive. Awuor called on the residents to demonstrate the support for the report by signing up the books. “We have assigned some boda boda riders to help us reach out to people who are unable to access the books,” he added. Nyambok said residents will realise more development due to increased funding to the counties. “Counties expect to get more funds which will translate to the construction of more roads, markets, health facilities among others and improve the living standards of our people,” Nyambok said.
