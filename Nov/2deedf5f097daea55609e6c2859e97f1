The Kenya Civil Aviation Authority has asked two government officials to report cases of drones they say are hovering around their houses. Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana and Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen said drones had been hovering around their homes causing surveillance fears. In a tweet on Wednesday, Kibwana said, “Drones hover over my official residence. Electronic gadgets in the house are compromised. As it was during Moi and NCEC, so it is now." He added: "I have repeatedly made this public and reported to authorities. I will not be intimidated.” Murkomen on the other hand tweeted, "To the person who has been sending drones to hover over my house I have two requests..." "Please share the beautiful aerial photos and come home through the main gate for a cup of tea but make sure you carry your mask. Thank you and God bless." But KCAA director general Gilbert Kibe told the Star it has not permitted anybody to use drones in those areas. "We will Investigate and see who owns the drones. If it's true that the drones have been seen there, then they should report to the police," he said. "It is from there that we will really know who owns the drones." Drones have to be registered with KCAA and a certificate is issued. According to the law, drones should be identifiable, which means the registration data should be attached visibly. In Kenya, only citizens, residents, businesses and governments are eligible to own a drone. This excludes foreign tourists and the only option left is to rent a drone locally. However, the law also provides for a 30-day temporary permit that may be suitable for travelers.
