Harambee Stars were treated to a sumptuous send-off dinner by Odibets on Thursday as the team prepared to leave for Comoros on Saturday for their Africa Cup of Nations qualifier return match. Earlier in the week, Odibets was unveiled as the official motivational partner in a deal that will see the gaming firm give the team a token of appreciation ahead of the crucial qualifier. “Odibets has come in to boost the national team. As a company, we are committed to standing with the Harambee Stars as they represent our country and make us proud,” said Odibets’ general manager, Dedan Mungai. The team is set to leave for Moroni on Saturday morning for their second leg encounter against Les Coelacantes on Sunday. Stars will be seeking to attain a positive result in the second leg in order to maintain their place in the race to qualify for the 2022 Africa Cup Of Nations.
