ODM party leader Raila Odinga was on Wednesday presented a self-portrait drawn by a young talented Kenyan artist Sheila Sheldone. The painting had Raila in a blue suit, red tie and a white shirt with his hand shaking a cloud. While handing over the painting to Raila, Sheldone said the cloudsÂ on the hand represent the handshake between him and President Uhuru Kenyatta. The painting also had footprints which Sheldone said reflect Raila's leadership. "The footsteps show that you are an inspiring leader of vision, integrity and stron character," Sheldone said. The chains in the painting, the artist said, depict the struggle the party leader had to go through as he fought for democracy. They represent the jail terms Raila had to endure. On his part, Raila thanked Sheldone for the visions she captured on the painting. "I was gifted this amazing painting by Sheila Sheldone, an amazing young girl with an amazing story of rising. She has inspiring explanations for every detail in the painting. Sheila is certainly a leader. May God continue supporting the work of her hands and inspiring her vision," Raila said via Twitter.
