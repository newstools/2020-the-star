Chewoyet Boys’ student Felix Korir is among the 26 junior athletes who made the cut for the World U-20 national trials set for Friday and Saturday at the Nyayo Stadium. He won the 5,000m during the North Rift pre-trials held on Saturday at the Ndura Sports Complex in Kitale, Trans Nzoia County. Competing in his maiden race since participating at the national cross country championships in February, Korir clocked 15:23 minutes to beat Felix Kibet (15:24) and Gilbert Kosgei (15:25) to second and third positions respectively. In an interview, he said he is currently enjoying top form and hopes to run a better during this week’s trials. “My focus is to run well all the way and make the team for the World Under-20 Championships. What I need is to improve my time during the trials,” said Korir. As Korir dominated in men’s race, Feliciana Kanda took the honours in the women’s 5,000m race. The Elgeyo Marakwet-based runner won the race in 16:43 minutes ahead of Jarrio Jeptoo (17:12) and Linah Cherotich (17:45), who completed the podium. Another upstart Allan Kibet dominated 10,000m, winning in 30:08 minutes ahead of Asbel Kiprop (30:11) and another Chewoyet High School student Shadrack Kipng’etich who clocked 31:18 minutes. In women’s 1,500m, Elgeyo Marakwet’s Winny Chemutai carried the day in 4:35 minutes with Faith Kimutai (4:36) and Sharon Kipchumba (4:37) trailing in second and third positions respectively. AK have been forced to go back to the drawing board after the World U-20 Championships earlier scheduled for last July was postponed to August 17-22 next year due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
