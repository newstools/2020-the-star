Consumers always want to get their hands on the latest and most innovative smartphones. Nevertheless, as flagships have improved with time, rising costs have put these modern smartphones out of most people’s reach. Following its success on the African continent, the Chinese headquartered TECNO keeps providing consumers with cutting-edge features at a cost-effective price. With its latest smartphone, Spark 5 Pro, TECNO has once again designed a product that delivers a premium experience. Equipped with a 16-megapixel rear AI Quad camera and an 8-megapixel front camera, the device brings quality in image and video creation. The device also comes with slow motion to bring consumers a brand-new photography experience. The Spark 5 Pro packs a punch with a powerful 5,000 mAh battery so that consumers can run powerful applications and multiple tabs without the need to constantly recharge. SPARK 5 Pro comes in four color options of Seabed Blue, Ice Jadeite, Spark Orange, and Cloud white. The finishing, the material, and the device’s sparkly look make it unique and beautiful. The backing of the TECNO Spark 5 Pro is also made of polycarbonate (glassy material) giving it a premium and elegant look and feel. The device is now available in Kenya retailing at KES 13,999.
