The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission has invited Uasin Gishu county director of Education Gitonga Mbaka to record a statement following alleged 'unethical conduct' by CS George Magoha. In a statement on Monday, EACC said, "The commission has reason to believe you have information that may assist in investigation." This is after the CS  was last week captured on camera insulting Mbaka at Langas Primary School over the alleged poor state of the school. In a statement last Friday, PSC Communications Director Browne Kutswa said all human resource functions had been moved to  Education PS Richard Belio Kipsang. "PSC Chairman Stephen Kirogo in a circular addressed to chairpersons of Public Universities Councils and copied to the Head of Public Service Joseph Kinyua, said all human resource matters requiring the attention of the Public Service Commission shall henceforth be handled by Dr Kipsang as Authorized Officer of the Ministry until further notice," PSC Chairman Stephen Kirogo said. "Kirogo noted that the move was in exercise of the Commission’s powers and commitment to protect public servants against undignified and unwarranted attacks, reiterating that the execution of delegated authority is designed to foster public confidence and maintain the integrity and dignity of the public service." However, Magoha said he would continue to discharge his duties, adding his appointing authority is the President.
