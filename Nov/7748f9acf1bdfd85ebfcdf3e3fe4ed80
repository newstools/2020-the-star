Garissa Township MP Aden Duale has expressed optimism that the 'irreducible minimums' by the pastoralist communities on the BBI report will be addressed. The former National Assembly Majority Leader on Monday said the olive branch extended by opposition chief Raila Odinga to build consensus on their demands for a revision of the report was welcome. “As the leadership of the Pastoralist Parliamentary Group, we are happy at the steps taken by the former Prime Minister to appreciate our concerns and his willingness to allow revision of the report is welcome,” Duale said. The politician said, in line with the meeting held between Raila and the leadership of the pastoralist communities on Monday, they hope bold steps will be made to meet their expectations. “This morning during a meeting with our leadership and members, the right honourable Raila Odinga unequivocally supported our issues and said they will be taken into consideration when the final report will be drafted,” Duale said. Duale said the leadership will soon appoint experts to work alongside the BBI team to make sure their issues are addressed. Some of the issues raised by the pastoralist communities include strengthening of devolution through making the Senate the upper House, establishment of the Livestock Authority and the revision of the revenue sharing formula proposed by the BBI report. “As leaders from the affected counties, these are some of our irreducible minimums in the BBI process and we are elated that Raila has promised that our concerns will feature prominently in the final document,” he said. On Monday, Raila held a meeting with leaders from the marginalised areas at Serena Hotel and backed their proposals, which he said would go a long way in exploiting the potential of the counties in economic development. Last week, the leaders held a meeting at a Nairobi Hotel and crafted their demands which they said must be addressed before they accept the BBI report.
