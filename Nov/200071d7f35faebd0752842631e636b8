Singer Stephen Okinyi, alias Mang'ana, says he was chased away from home by his father at the age of 13 years. Speaking to Word Is, Okinyi, who is also a police officer at Kabete subcounty, said he's tried to make peace with his father but he has pushed him away. "After he separated with my mum, I had to look for help from my sisters, who were in Nairobi, so I could make ends meet," he said. Being the third born in a family of five, he says that after working in his sister's house, he joined the army. "Today, I am a gospel singer. I am trying to make things work with my dad, but he has been pushing me away," he said. His songs include 'Amani Kenya' and 'Love Letter'.
