Education CS George Magoha has asked schools’ management to ramp up preparations ahead of reopening early next year. Magoha said the government is working on a new timetable to reduce lost time in the academic calendar. The national examinations’ timetables will soon be made public, he said. Magoha said by next Friday, jua kali artisans who are making desks will have submitted them and quality assurance done. “A thorough inspection will be conducted by authorised officers and the artisans paid,” the CS said at Maragua Ridge Secondary School in Murang’a county on Thursday said. He was inspecting the school’s preparedness. The government is buying 632,357 lockers and chairs for public primary and secondary schools. The primary schools will get desks worth Sh900 million while the secondary schools will receive lockers and chairs worth Sh1 billion. Selected primary school will get 70 desks each while secondary schools will receive 50 lockers and chairs. Magoha said it is paramount for stakeholders to continue enforcing the Covid-19 guidelines in schools to prevent infections and the spread of the disease. “I want to commend teachers as they have done their best to ensure there is social distancing, handwashing points and sufficient hand sanitisers in schools,” he said. Covid-19 cases have risen in schools since partial reopening in October. Two schools in Mombasa county, Tononoka and Star of the Sea secondary schools, were closed after recording 15 positive cases last month. In Nakuru county, 68 students and five teachers tested positive for the virus on Thursday with one student receiving treatment at Nakuru Covid-19 isolation centre.  Another 115 are on quarantine.
