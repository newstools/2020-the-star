Amnesty International Kenya has raised concern over the possibility of the Kenyan government to return a Tanzanian opposition politician to his country. Godbless Lema was arrested over the weekend in Kajiado County as he ran from his country fearing for his life. Lema is a Chadema politician who lost his bid to retain his seat for Arusha City Constituency for a third term. Lema was arrested together with his wife and three children while on their way to the UNHCR offices. In the statement on Monday, the lobby group executive director Irungu Houghton said that Lema’s life is in danger and handing him over to Tanzania might leader to ‘political persecution and imprisonment'. “Kenya must not violate the internationally recognised principle of non-refoulment. The international principle is upheld by our own laws. It prohibits Kenya from turning away people at the border or returning them to their country where they would be at risk of danger,” Irungu said. Irungu added that Kenya’s international law obligations allow anyone seeking asylum to make entry to the country whether legally or illegally. “Lema has the right to have his application heard and considered for refugee status.” He added that “Transferring Godbless Lema back to Tanzania, a country where he risks facing serious human rights violations, would itself amount to a human rights violation. The Government of Kenya is obligated to protect and provide sanctuary to Lema and his family.”
