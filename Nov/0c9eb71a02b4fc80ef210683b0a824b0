A photo shared on Facebook claiming to show ODM leader Raila Odinga being chased away by an angry mob on October 30, 2020, is a HOAX. The caption says the mob demanded that Raila should champion inclusivity in the Building Bridges Initiative. It, however, doesn’t mention the location of the incident. The BBI report was launched at the Bomas of Kenya on October 26. The initiative — the brainchild of President Uhuru Kenyatta and Raila was conceived in March 2018 in the famous “Handshake” agreement that ended months of post-election demonstrations and confrontations. Dozens were killed by the police. A reverse image search shows that the photo was published on November 17, 2017, when Raila returned to Kenya after boycotting the rerun of the presidential elections held that year. The photo is credited to Jeff Angote of the Nation Media Group. The photo in the post doesn’t show Raila being chased away from a rally by an angry mob on October 30. PesaCheck has looked into a photo shared on Facebook claiming to show ODM leader Raila Odinga being chased away by an angry mob on October 30, 2020, and finds it to be a HOAX.
