President Uhuru Kenyatta made his seventh State of The Nation Address to Parliament on Thursday. Among the subjects covered were the Covid-19 pandemic, education, state of the economy, peace and security. Uhuru said changes to the Constitution proposed through BBI are meant to secure the country's future. Speaking during the State of the Nation address on Thursday, Uhuru said every journey starts with a single step, taken in faith, at times against all odds. "Like Moses in the Bible who sat at the top of Mt Nebo and saw the future that the people of Israel were about to cross into the promised land, I too have seen our future," he said. "That journey has commenced with the release of the Building Bridges Initiative report. More importantly, let us engage in positive discourse (on BBI) with a view to effecting far-reaching changes." "Major changes are needed to our Constitution and other laws so as to lay the foundation for the prosperous future that we seek." Uhuru said this moment in time is Kenya's meeting with destiny.
