The government has applauded a legislator from Kiambu county for building a chief's office. Chief Samuel Kahoro of Gitithia location in Lari constituency has been serving residents from a water control room belonging to Limuru Water and Sewerage Company. The room has control machines for piped water supplied to Gitithia village. Citizens seeking services sometimes got rained on while queueing outside the one-room office with a water tank on the roof. Lari MP Jonah Mburu said he visited the facility after holding a public participation forum where residents asked for an office for the chief. "I was so touched since he operates on public land which has a police post, the water tank and the office," the MP said. "We moved very fast to approve funds to build him an office since he has an assistant chief." Interior and National Coordination PS Karanja Kibicho on Thursday praised Mburu for building the office. The PS asked other leaders to emulate the legislator through projects that impact on the community. Kibicho asked members of the public to continue supporting chiefs and assistant chiefs. He was with MPs Mburu (Lari), Gabriel Kago (Githunguri) and Wanjiku Kibe (Gatundu North) when he opened the office. Kiambu county commissioner Wilson Wanyanga, Lari deputy county commissioner Agnes Karoki, Kijabe assistant county commissioner Geraldine Barasa and subcounty traders chairman Paul Ngugi attended the event. Kibicho later opened offices in Gituamba, Mbau-ini and Kinale in the same constituency. Mburu asked locals to read the Building Bridges Initiative report once copies are distributed, so that they can make informed choices. Kibicho cautioned politicians against misleading locals while campaigning for the document, saying some might take advantage to popularise themselves. Edited by Henry Makori
