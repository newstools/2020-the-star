The DPP has dropped one fraud charge against former KPA boss Daniel Manduku in the Sh1.4 billion fraud case. The prosecution on Wednesday told chief magistrate Lawrence Mugambi that they were amending the charge sheet to drop the charge of conspiracy to commit an economic crime Manduku was charged with in August. However, Manduku, who was charged alongside the accounting officer Juma Fadhili, still has three more counts that he pleaded to afresh. Manduku and Fadhili pleaded afresh to the new charge sheet that did not have the conspiracy charge. They denied engaging in a project without prior planning contrary to the law. It is alleged that on March 29, 2019, and August 22, 2019, at the KPA headquarters they procured manufacture of concrete barriers valued at Sh1.4 billion. It is alleged that Manduku made an overpayment of Sh244 million to contractors for works that were never completed. Manduku and Fadhili have each been charged with one count of abuse of office and jointly with one count of conspiracy to commit corruption. The court heard that the prosecution and the defense agreed that they were not ready to proceed with the pretrial. The prosecution said that they had already supplied witness statements to the defense as had been directed.Â Manduku is out on Sh12 million cash bail that he had been granted when they were first charged and the same terms still apply. The case will be mentioned on December 1 for pretrial.
