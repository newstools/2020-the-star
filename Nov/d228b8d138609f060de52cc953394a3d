Several Kisumu county offices at Prosperity House headquarters have been closed to the public to protect staff from the coronavirus. Governor Anyang' Nyong'o said the offices will be closed to residents for the time being so the county can work on a plan to serve residents safely. Workers still report to duty as usual. “We ask our stakeholders, friends and the business community to bear with us as we find the best way to deliver our services at this time of the crisis,” Nyong'o said in a statement. Kisumu had registered 1,159 confirmed Covid-19 cases out of a sample of 12,910 tested as of November 4. Some 30 patients have died — a number the governor said they consider too high. “We have stepped up the surveillance and contract tracing and urge our people to seek medical attention as soon as they experience any signs of Covid-19, which includes fever, persistent cough and difficulty in breathing,” he said. Following the sixth summit meeting between President Uhuru Kenyatta and the Council of Governors on November 4, Nyong'o said they decided on far-reaching measures against the spread of the virus. “I would like to appeal to the people of Kisumu county to fully cooperate with the national and county governments in implementing fully, these measures to avoid a brush with the law-enforcing officers who are under firm instructions to enforce them,” he said. “Let it be the responsibility of every one of us to wear masks, keep social distance, avoid crowds, leave funerals as family affairs and observe curfew hours.” Nyong'o further said they will not tolerate the opening of bars beyond the stipulated time nor other entertainment joints. “We are asking our police force and county enforcement officers to work together to ensure that all these safety measures are implemented fully. I am pleading with you to help fight this disease. Kindly don’t take part in crowded functions, including funerals and parties.”
