The Communications Authority has won a global award for its innovative spectrum policies. The award by the Dynamic Spectrum Alliance (DSA) recognizes one policy maker or regulator who has demonstrated outstanding leadership in adopting and implementing policies, making more spectrum available on an opportunistic basis. Announcing its achievement in a statement on Friday, the authority said it was honoured to be recognised in its conviction to improve the well-being of Kenyans. According to the statement, the CA has improved standards of living by implementing rural internet connectivity initiatives using shared spectrum. The award which was announced virtually on Thursday, was received by the Director Frequency Spectrum Management Tom Olwero on behalf of CA director general Mercy Wanjau. In his acceptance speech, Olwero said the authority is committed to improving broadband internet access by incorporating innovative spectrum access techniques in the spectrum management approach. "The first spectrum covers the use of TV white spaces while the second framework will cover spectrum use by community Networks. A third framework is planned to cover a neutral host approach for mobile networks and dynamic spectrum access to improve mobile broadband internet access in Kenya," he said. This is part of the CA's 2018-2023 strategic plan to develop dynamic spectrum access framework targeting underutilised resources in both unserved and underserved areas.
