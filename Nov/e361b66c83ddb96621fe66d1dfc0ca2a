A preference for white-collar jobs and a disdain for plumbing, masonry and other artisanal courses is the cause of high unemployment among Igembe youths, Mining PS Peter Kaberia has said. Kaberia said there is a huge skills gap due to the youths' obsession with office jobs. He said at the Meru National Polytechnic there are fewer than 2,000 students when it has capacity for 13,000 youths. “Let’s rise up and support education. We were earlier described as illiterates. Well-paying courses like engineering, plumbing, masonry, electrical courses have few people who are undertaking them especially from Maua,” Kaberia said. He spoke during the  distribution of more than 2,000 tree seedlings to Igembe South farmers. Kaberia said climate change must be fought and every individual should plant trees and nurture them. He said he had secured government jobs for 164 youths, including in the disciplined forces, during his time as PS. Igembe South MP John Paul Mwirigi accused the national government of sidelining his constituents on appointments to senior positions. Mwirigi said the only person holding a senior post was Kaberia, saying this was a drop in the ocean considering the huge population in the constituency. “We are marginalised and this is why we are advocating for more appointments and resources from the national government,” Mwirigi said. Mwirigi took issue with the slow response by the county and national governments in handling healthcare crises. “If health workers are remunerated, have good allowances and salaries as well as empowered, they have the morale to save more lives at this disheartening time the world is fighting Covid-19,” he said.
