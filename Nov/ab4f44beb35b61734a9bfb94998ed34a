A family in Kimose, Mogotio subcounty, wants justice for their daughter killed in a bathroom at her matrimonial home on Thursday. Ann Keitany, 27, lived in Marigat, Baringo South subcounty, with her husband and two children. “She had gone that evening to bathe in an outdoor bathroom,” her sister Fancy Jeruto said on Friday. Jeruto grew concerned when Keitany took too long to come back and went out to look for her. In the bathroom she found blood-soaked clothes and a bloody kitchen knife but Keitany was nowhere to be seen. Jeruto screamed and neighbours responded. They looked for Keitany but did not find her in the compound. She was still missing when her husband, who hosts an evening show at a local radio station in Marigat town, came home at midnight. A search party set out on Friday morning and eventually found Keitany's body dumped on the bank of the seasonal River Perkerra two kilometres away. The body had a deep cut in the neck. Jeruto said her sister had been complaining of family problems, which had driven her into depression. Keitany wanted to go to her rural home for prayers but her husband would not let her, the sister said. She leaves behind two children aged three months and four years old. Keitany's mother Susan Kiprop described her daughter as humble, caring and hardworking. She called for justice. Marigat police boss Benjolive Munuve said officers have started investigating. Keitany's family say they feel unsafe as they suspect she may have been killed by somebody well known to her. Edited by Josephine M. Mayuya
