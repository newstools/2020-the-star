Nandi County Senator Samson Cherargei has urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to form another secretariat that will collect the emerging recommendations to the Building Bridges Initiative. Speaking to journalists in Parliament Building on Tuesday, the senator said that presenting issues to ODM leader Raila Odinga is not a guarantee that they will be featured in the final report. His comments come as both Uhuru and Raila seem to have relaxed their initial hardline stances on altering the report further. “These groups, that have made their proposals to amend the BBI report, where do they take it?” Cheraragei asked. “In our opinion, we want to ask the President to move with speed and form a BBI secretariat team. We do not want to be like an elitist forum. Presenting to the ODM leader does not meet the capacity in terms of handling these recommendations.” Cherargei said a structured BBI secretariat is needed to handle emerging issues from all sectors and classes of people in terms of their work. The senator said that the amendment to the Constitution should involve all the people, and should not be politicised. “I am happy that it has been reopened. Some of the leaders even in Parliament had dared us that even a comma or a full stop will not be edited…now let us now have a structured secretariate and experts and also structured engagements.” On Monday, Raila met with a section of pastoralists representatives led by Treasury CS Ukur Yatani who expressed their support for the report. After the engagement, Raila said that their proposals will be considered.
