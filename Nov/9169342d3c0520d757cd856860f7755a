Sauti Sol's Bien Aime is in quarantine after he tested positive for coronavirus last week. Speaking to Word Is yesterday, Bien said he had a fever, joint aches and eye problems. "For the last couple of days, I have been indoors. I started feeling weak and so I decided since I was travelling to Uganda, I needed the tests done before, only for me to test positive." Bien says his wife tested negative. "I will be home for a while since I do not want to spread it. Corona will get anyone so long as we do not adhere to the said measures," he said. He urged people to be cautious as the disease is intense. "We had a show in Uganda last week on Thursday. I had to cancel my attendance, but my boys, Bensoul and Nviiri, represented us," he said. "To be honest, I have not been sick for a long time. I feel the treatment itself is very expensive, even for me. I have used Sh8,000 on medicines alone. "Our healthcare system has not cushioned us, so once it gets you, you may end up spending too much from your pockets. It could be worse since it could even kill you." On whether artistes should be allowed to hold shows, Bien said most of them are suffering since there is no income for them. "Put certain standards in cleanliness before and even during the shows. Put all the measures in place since corona might be with us for a long time," he said.
