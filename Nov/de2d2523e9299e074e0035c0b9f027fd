Kisii County's Kiamokama MCA Kennedy Mainya is dead. The ward representative passed away on Sunday morning as he was being transferred in an ambulance to Nairobi. County Assembly Majority leader Timothy Ogugu said Mainya died in Narok as they were en route to a city hospital for specialized treatment. "Hon Mainya has been well but was taken ill on Thursday and was rushed to Oasis Hospital in Kisii. He was put on oxygen support and his situation deteriorated on Sunday when the family requested that he be taken to another health facility for advanced treatment. We are sad to learn that he died on the way there, "said Ogugu. County Speaker David Kombo was unavailable to answer calls as his phone was switched off. Kisii Deputy Governor Joash Maangi, in his condolence message, described the deceased as a formidable politician. " I remember him as a soft-spoken, modest and formidable politician who served his people with dedication," said Maangi in a statement to journalists. Other Ward Reps also sent their condolences to the family. Oasis administrator Maxwell Raballa was not available to give information on how long the MCA had been hospitalized at the facility.
