Harambee Stars left back Eric 'Marcelo' Ouma  believes the team will carry the day when they face Comoros on Sunday in their fourth 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier away in Moroni. Stars, who are winless in Pool G of the qualifiers, will be seeking to upset the group leaders and breath life back into their qualification hopes which were partially put off after playing the islanders to a 1-1 draw in the first leg played on Wednesday at Moi Stadium, Kasarani. Ouma, who plays for Swedish outfit AIK, said the team is capable of gathering maximum points away and asked fans to rally behind the team which is currently under intense pressure to deliver. Stars begun their campaign with a rare one- all draw against Egypt but were held to a similar result in the second match by Togo in Nairobi. "The team has a chance to win away and the fans should believe in us and give us the necessary support.  Our mental strength will play a massive role if we are to get all the three points in Moroni," said the former Gor Mahia player. The team, which is expected to leave today (Saturday) is once again expected to miss the services of Michael Olunga who did not travel after his teammates at Kashiwa Reysol tested positive for Covid-19 but Ouma is optimistic his replacements will deliver. Coach Jacob 'Ghost' Mulee is expected to stick with Masoud Juma as the lone striker with John Makwata offering options. "We missed Olunga in the first leg but we have good strikers who are able to get us goals," he added.
