The boda boda sector is becoming one of the major drivers of the economy, with operators raking in at least Sh350 billion every year, Information and Communications Technology PS Jerome Ochieng has said. He said the sector impacts 5.2 million Kenyans, about 10 per cent of the population, directly or indirectly. “With over 1.4 million boda bodas, completing over 22 million rides per day, the industry has continued to play a significant role in every sector of our economy,” Ochieng said on Wednesday. He was speaking during the Boda Boda Safety Association of Kenya officials’ meeting in Busia town. The PS said it is remarkable to see players in the sector recognise the need to economically empower those engaged in the business. “By pulling together to save and invest in your futures collectively, you will secure your welfare and safety,” Ochieng said. He said the association has the ability to not only secure insurance facilities for all members but also the potential to save over Sh20 billion annually. "Through strategic partnerships such as that with Rubis Energy, which gives rebates of up to Sh3 for every litre of fuel purchased, there is a potential to save an additional Sh4 billion annually.” The PS urged riders to join investment schemes to ease access to credit. He said a meeting held on October 29 between ICT Cabinet Secretary Joe Mucheru and the National Youth Service chairperson, resolved that the government will train all boda boda riders on requisite road skills, first aid, and safety at a fee of Sh750. “There are endless possibilities to what this group can achieve, which can only become a reality if you all collectively come together to make this work,” he said. Industry experts say the success of the boda boda sector lies in being a creative solution for the transportation needs of urban and rural communities by providing convenient and affordable mobility for people and goods.
