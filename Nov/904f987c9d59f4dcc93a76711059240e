The body of a a 13-year-old boy who drowned on Wednesday in Kianjuri Dam, Buuri subcounty, Meru, was yet to be retrieved by Thursday evening as leaders and family appealed for divers. The 13-year-old Standard 7 pupil identified only as Mwenda, son of Moses Gikunda, risked his life to rescue one of the cows he was herding but fell and drowned at around 1pm. Ntirimiti assistant chief Moses Kirimi said the boy was herding on the edge of Mt Kenya Forest when he took great courage to swim in the dam to retrieve the cow. Area senior chief Daniel Muriuki said the body sank, making it hard for volunteer divers to trace it. "My condolences. I appeal to Kenya Wildlife Service to employ a ranger to guard the dam because as it is, it can't be fenced as wild animals depend on it for water. We also ask parents to take responsibility of safeguarding their children,” the chief said. Buuri MP Mugambi Rindikiri, while sending his condolences  to the boy's family at Ntirimiti near the dam, said he was saddened by the news. He toured the area to plant trees under a project by his wife Doris. Rindikiri said the dam was three kilometres away from the first homestead and blamed parents for negligence. “I ask parents to take great care of their children by keeping them busy at home. We are doing whatever possible to ensure the boy is retrieved,” Rindikiri said. Kisima MCA Joy Karambu appealed to Red Cross and the national government to provide professional divers to end the agony of the family. He urged the Kenya Wildlife Service and the Kenya Forest Service to fence the dam and leave entry and exit points to avoid such incidents.
