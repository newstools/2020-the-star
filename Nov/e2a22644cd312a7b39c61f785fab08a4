The Milimani Anti-Corruption Court will start hearing the case filed against Interior CS Fred Matiang’i by former State House digital director Dennis Itumbi. Itumbi had moved to court seeking its direction over the Ruaraka land scandal. Itumi claims that he has four corruption counts against Matiang'i relating to the Ruaraka land. He said he decided to move to after what he termed ‘laxity’ by EACC and the DPP to act against the CS, despite a High Court decision that confirmed the land was public and was illegally acquired. Itumbi is also seeking to have the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and EACC charged. Itumbi accuses Matiang'i, who was at the time the Education CS, of wilful failure to comply with the law on management of public funds during the compulsory acquisition of the Ruaraka land on which two schools sit. Milimani Anti-Corruption Court judge Douglas Ogoti on Monday issued a directive that the case be heard under a  certificate of urgency. The judge has also directed that the Covid-19 rules and guidelines be adhered to during the hearing. Itumbi said that the CS abused his office, contrary to section 45 as read with section 48(1) of the Anti-Corruption and Economics Act. The blogger said that on March 17, 2017, while serving as the CS in the Ministry of Education, Matiang’i used his office to improperly confer a benefit of Sh1.5 billion together with other individuals. He added that the benefit was the compensation for the two government learning institutions: Ruaraka High School and Drive Inn Primary School. He also wants the CS to be charged with conspiracy to defraud, which is contrary to section 317 of the Penal Code CAP 63 of the laws of Kenya.
