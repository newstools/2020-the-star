The Senate has dropped 44 bills currently in various stages of legislation in the House to allow for concurrence with the National Assembly. Speaker Kenneth Lusaka on Tuesday ordered that the proposed legislations be dropped and published afresh in line with Article 110 (3) of the Constitution. Lusaka said the move is in accordance with a recent High Court ruling that there must be concurrence between the speakers of the bicameral Parliament before any bill is processed. Three weeks ago, the court nullified 24 Acts of Parliament that were processed without the involvement of the Senate.  Senators had challenged the legality of the laws after the National Assembly bypassed them in their approval. The bills set to be dropped are 41 that originated in the Senate and three from the National Assembly. “Accordingly, I’m asking you to step down any of your bills for which there was no concurrence to facilitate republication,” the Speaker ruled. The 41 bills include are the County Licensing (Uniform Procedures) Bill, Senate Bill No. 17 of 2019, the Fisheries and Development (Amendment) Bill, Senate Bill No. 21 of 2019; and the Lifestyle Audit (no. 2), Bill, Senate Bill No. 22 of 2019. Others are the Reproductive Health Care Bill, 2019, Senate Bills, No. 23 of 2019, the Wildlife Conservation and Management (Amendment) Bill, Senate Bill No. 24 of 2019, the Law of Succession (Amendment)Bill, Senate Bill No. 1 of 2020 and Prompt Payment Bill, Senate Bill No. 3 of 2020. The County Resources Development Bill, Parliamentary Powers and Privileges, Senate Bill No. 4 of 2020, Community Health Services Bill, Senate Bill No. 5 of 2020, Investment Promotion Bill, Senate Bill No. 8 of 2020, Basic Education (Amendment) Bill, Senate Bills No. 10 of 2020 and Kenya Citizen and Immigration Bill and Senate Bill No. 12 of 2020 will be republished. “The Senate Business Committee has directed the office of the clerk to process the said bills for republication,” Lusaka said. The three Bills from the National Assembly are the National Youth Council (Amendment) Bill, National Assembly Bill No. 8 of 2019, The Public Service (Values and Principles) (Amendment) Bill, National Assembly Bills No. 17 of 2019 and The Cancer Prevention and Control (Amendment) Bill (National Assembly Bill No. 65 of 2019). Lusaka said the Senate Business Committee has approved a mediation mechanism to be invoked where there will be a joint mediation committee to advise the two Speakers.
