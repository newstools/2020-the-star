Acakoro Starlets' head coach Jackline Juma is convinced the side will be featuring in the Football Kenya Federation Division One League in the new season even as officials converge at Kandanda House this morning to plan for the promotion/relegation playoffs. Juma, who doubles up as the national team Harambee Starlets' assistant coach, has been guiding the Nairobi-based side in the regional league since 2013 and believes they are currently better placed to challenge for promotion to the next level. "We want to gain promotion to the higher division and if possible expose more players to the national team," he said.  Acakoro is literally a young side, comprising teenagers mostly drawn from the sprawling Nairobi's Korogocho slums with the oldest player aged only 18 years and the youngest 13. They boast an impressive track record in competitions, having been the Safaricom-sponsored Chapa Dimba season I Nairobi runners-up, season 2 champions and national runners-up and season 3 Nairobi runners-up. Two of their players were selected to travel with the Chapa Dimba national select team to Spain. In fact, two of their players, Sylvia Makungu and Diana Hashina are already transacting business for the national team. Alongside her assistant Pauline Awuor, she says didn't consider it necessary to acquire new players for the new season because they already have sufficient pool of talent to propel the side to greater heights.
