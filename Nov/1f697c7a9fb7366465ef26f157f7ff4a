Meru health workers say the only county hospital ICU is overwhelmed with Covid-19 patients. The Meru Level Five Hospital Deputy CEO Gacheri Kathiri told journalists that flouting the health guidelines had led to the high number of patients. Kathiri, who spoke at the facility on Saturday when receiving Covid-19 protective gears from Equity Bank Group Foundation chief commercial officer Polycarp Igathe, said attending to one coronavirus patient is not only risky to frontline workers but also costly. She urged politicians to desist from holding gatherings where people meet without observing social distancing or wearing masks. Igathe urged Kenyans to persistently pray for the frontline workers. On Friday, Meru had 63 positive patients. “Covid is real. People are dying and recently we are worried because we are receiving patients at critical stage. Don’t trust your friends or workmates because some may be asymptomatic. Everyone is a suspect in regard to coronavirus. I want to appeal to politicians, as they are heartbreaking us when they gather crowds who don’t bother protecting themselves. Avoid those meetings, they are not safe at all,” she said. Igathe said the foundation has identified at least 68 hospitals in the country that will get surgical masks, medical equipment, gloves, gowns and boots. “We have come to respond to this pandemic as we do to hunger, education and poverty. This is the third time and we are ready to come again when called upon,” Igathe said.
