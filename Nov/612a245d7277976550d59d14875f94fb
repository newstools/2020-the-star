Former socialite Risper Faith underwent a Sh500,000 liposuction to cut weight. Liposuction is a surgical process to remove fat from specific areas of the body, such as the abdomen, hips, thighs, buttocks, arms or neck. Risper said she was unhappy with her alarming weight gain after giving birth to her first baby, a son. She was forced to try different ways, including hitting the gym and going on a strict diet, but nothing worked. "I am even scared of going out because I feel I am not beautiful with my extreme weight gain," she said. "It has been stressing me and marriage, and that is why I decided to find a permanent solution." The mother of one recently shared a photo of herself just moments after the liposuction and captioned it, "Hi guys. The liposuction surgery successfully!"
