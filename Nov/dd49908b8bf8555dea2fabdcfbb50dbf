Small-scale farmers from Kericho and Bomet counties on Saturday backed the Agriculture CS Peter Munya-led tea reforms. At a meeting held in Kericho, the 200 farmers – 100 each from Bomet and Kericho counties – were taken through the reforms document and understood its content. Julius Kones said the reforms would benefit farmers who for decades had been earning peanuts. “Those who have been reaping where they did not sow have been asking farmers to reject the reforms,” he said. Kones recalled how he was pelted with stones at Mogogosiek factory as he tried to educate farmers on the reforms. “It's good that those who are here today have gone through the document and understood its contents,” he said. Kones urged farmers representatives Cheruiyot Baliach from Bomet, his Kericho counterpart Simon Sigei to educate farmers from their respective counties who did not attend the meeting. He also urged professionals in Bomet and Kericho counties to read the document and educate farmers who cannot read or write about the importance of the proposed changes in the tea sector.
