A businessman has been fined Sh100,000 or a year's jail term for smuggling 10 foreigners. Eliya Maharub Haji pleaded guilty before Kibera senior principal magistrate Phillip Mutua. The charge sheet says he smuggled the foreigners in a Toyota Lexus KBT 306B from Marsabit with others not before the court on May 15 last year. Prosecutor Jane Gitahi said special crime prevention unit officers were alerted about vehicles ferrying foreigners from Marsabit county. The officers were told the vehicles were on the Thika Superhighway. They intercepted one vehicle whose driver informed them that there was another car transporting foreigners. The officers then intercepted the other vehicle and arrested Haji and the foreigners whom they found without documents. Haji said he was remorseful and asked the court for a lenient sentence.
