Two professional golfers have embarked on a campaign to popularise the sport among communities living in the lower Eastern region. Kennedy Ngumbao, who is the Mumias Sugar Golf Club chairman and Mombasa Golf Club secretary Paul Munyao, said there is potential to produce top professional golfers from the region but there is hesitation that bogs them down. “Golf is increasingly gaining popularity countrywide but the popularity is not resonating in the lower Eastern region. We don’t know why but we believe we can change that,” said Ngumbao. The two sponsored the Mombasa leg of the Kambasome Golf Tournament at the Mombasa Golf Club following similar tourney series in Machakos, Makueni and Kitui counties. Ngumbao said the Kambasome golf tournament is their way of wooing the members of the Kamba community into the sport. “For the past 10 years, we have put a program in place to hold Kambasome golf tournament in three counties,” he said. The Mombasa series of the Kambasome golf tournament, played last Saturday, attracted 130 professional and amateur golfers, with members of the Mombasa Golf Club dominating. Elijah Ibua was crowned the overall winner after collecting 38 points. There was no awarding ceremony but the results were posted on the club website to abide by the government ban on public gatherings following the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. Playing on improved 18 handicap, Ibua managed to post 19 points on the first nine holes and similar number on the second nine holes before being crowned overall winner under the hot weather.
