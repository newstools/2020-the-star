Ford Kenya has ejected its Kisii party chairman Job Nyakenyanya and picked Timothy Arege as acting chair. Nyakenyanya was shown the door following his support for Kanduyi MP Wafula Wamunyinyi, who is leading a faction that wants to overthrow Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang'ula. Arege, who unsuccessfully contested the Kitutu Chache parliamentary election, will serve in an acting capacity until the party conducts polls, Wetang'ula said on Sunday. Wetang'ula, who was in Kisii to meet party members and officials, also rooted for the BBI. He said the document seeks to break the vicious circle of electoral violence. Wetang'ula said it will help bring equity, where the effort of each Kenyan counts. “Equity is the underpinning that informs the discussions on the BBI. As Kenyans, we want elections to bring us together, not divide us. We also want people’s hard work to be respected and for women to play their rightful role in the political process,” he said. MPs Richard Onyonka (Kitutu Chache) and Vincent Kemosi (West Mugirango) attended the function. Onyonka urged Kenyans to append their signatures on the document.
