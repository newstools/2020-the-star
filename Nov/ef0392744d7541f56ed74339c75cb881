The sleuths from DCI in collaboration with other multi-agency players have recovered drugs worth millions of shillings. The drugs were stashed in an additional compartment created inside a lorry, making it unnoticeable from the police during transportation. This was confirmed on Sunday by Deputy Director Anti-Narcotics Unit Janet Shako. She said that investigations have revealed that the proceeds of the sale of such drugs have a direct link with the funding of terror activities within the region. Shako said that organised criminal groups are finding new ways to transport drugs and that the detectives are on the lookout. “Over the last one month, drugs worth millions of shillings while being transported to various destination. Individuals found transporting the same drugs have been arraigned,” Shako said. Isiolo-Moyale route has been found to be a major road transporting the drugs. She also said that criminals behind drug transportation have been using various methods of concealment ranging from water boozers, fuel tankers, and creating additional compartments in lories and vehicles.
