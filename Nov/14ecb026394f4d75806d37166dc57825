America has been leading in democracy and human rights. This is why our eyes were fixed on the US during last Tuesday’s presidential election and vote counting. While there are many things to learn from the just-concluded election, let’s identify a few lessons. Throughout the campaign period, President Donald Trump had been calling Joe Biden “sleepy”. Biden and his party ignored the name-calling. Instead, the Democrats converted the “sleepy” description into a strategy that gave their opponent a false confidence of winning. Maybe this is why Trump is living in denial by not conceding. The strategy worked. He underrated his opponent. Unfortunately, Trump, an egocentric man, still believes he can overturn the election outcome even after his Republican party counterparts, and former presidential candidate Mitt Romney in particular, congratulated Biden. His supporters came out to protest carrying weapons. This portrays him badly. On the other hand, Biden’s patience, resilience and humility gave hope to the American people and to believers of democracy. He called for calm and faith. He gives hope to the world through his foreign policy. Finally, we learnt that politics and politicians in America, like in any other country, have the potential to either stabilise or destabilise their country through their utterances.
