Kenya has thanked FBI, United Kingdom and Israeli law enforcement authorities for their assistance that led to the convictions of two terror suspects. The two men were sentenced to 18 and 33 years in jail after they were convicted of helping Islamist militants attack Westgate shopping mall in 2013. In a statement on Sunday evening, IG Hillary Mutyambai said the three played a key role in building a watertight case against the accused persons. “The conviction and sentence of the aforementioned accused persons demonstrates our commitment to hold accountable not only persons who commit terrorists acts, but also those who support, aid, abet and facilitate commission of terrorist activities,” reads a joint statement by the IG and DPP. “We will not rest in our efforts to investigate, and bring to justice those who commit acts of terrorism and provide support to terrorist organisations or activities.” The two, IG Mutyambai and DPP Haji, said justice for the victims guided how they approached and executed the case that saw 47 witnesses testify before the court. “This case therefore, is a demonstration that effective and efficient coordination and collaboration between law enforcement agencies and the intelligence community is critical in the fight against organised crime such terrorism,” they said. The two further thanked members of the public for their role in the fight against terrorism. “We urge wananchi to be vigilant and report any suspicious persons or activities within their localities to the authorities,” they said. At least 67 people died in the assault by alShabaab. Mohammed Ahmed Abdi, who received the 33-year prison sentence, and Hussein Hassan Mustafa, who was jailed for 18 years, were charged with planning and committing acts of terror, as well as supporting and helping a terrorist group.
