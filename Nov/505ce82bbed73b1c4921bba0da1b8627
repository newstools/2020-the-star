If you don't wear a mask in Kisii, or anywhere else, you'll be fined Sh20,000 on the spot. That's what police IG Hillary Mutambayi has said. Premises such as bars that violate Covid-19 protocols, like preventing overcrowding, will be shut down. Other violators will face fines and other sanctions. Kisii county commissioner Abdirisack Jaldesa on Friday warned residents that drastic measures will be taken if they are caught breaching Ministry of Health protocols. He expressed alarm about the number of people who have been breaking protocols, leading to surging cases. Wear masks properly, keep social distance, avoid crowds, wash and sanitise hands, he said. He said residents had ignored the directives after President Uhuru Kenyatta opened the economy in October. Jaldesa, who co-chairs the County Response Emergency team with Governor James Ongwae, said officers patrolling the county will arrest anyone without a mask and violating other rules. “I am urging traders, shopkeepers and hoteliers to provide water and sanitiser to their customers to reduce infections,” he said. The government, Jaldesa warned,  will close business premises whose owners fail to comply with the Covid-19 protocols. He said consumption of illicit brew and drug abuse was contributing to the spread of the pandemic, adding security officers and Nacada are fighting the problem.  “We want to reenergise the campaign sgainst illicit brew and drugs. That is the only coronavirus will be reduced,” Jaldesa said. He urged residents to remind their neighbors to wear masks in public places to prevent the spread of the disease, which is spreading rapidly, killing people and causing suffering. (Edited by V.
