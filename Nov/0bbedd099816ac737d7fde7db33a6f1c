Kenya Sevens talisman Collins Injera has revealed that the SFX10's late entry into the World-10-aside tournament in Bermuda has left them even more hungry for the title. The SFX10 started their campaign a week late after one of their team members tested positive for Covid 19 but still dominated all their three matches on Tuesday beating Rhinos 24-5, Phoenix 30-0 and Miami Sun 42-5. “Safety was key but we are glad to play now and make our mark in this tournament. We have a good crop of players with lots of experience and we can go all the way,” added Injera. However, Injera reckoned that the tournament will get tougher as they enter the knockout stage. “I believe the boys have just scratched the surface. Once we enter the quarterfinals, it's going to get tougher because the quality of teams is good, but we are relishing the challenge,” said Injera. The SFX10 franchise also features Springbok Sevens star Cecil Afrika and Welshman Luke Treharne. Kenya Sevens skipper Andrew Amonde observed that playing at the tournament will be a big boost for next year's Tokyo Olympics especially after the cancellation of four World Sevens Series due to the Covid-19 pandemic. "We haven't played for almost seven months and it gives us an opportunity to test ourselves against some of the best players in the world,” noted Amonde.
