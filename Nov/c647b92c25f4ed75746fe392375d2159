A Nairobi court has ruled that deputy director of Medical Services at NMS Musa Mohammed and two social workers at the Mama Lucy Hospital be charged with child trafficking offences. The two social workers are Makallah Fred and Selina Awour. However, the hospital's CEO Emma Mutio has been discharged by the court. Also freed are Juliana Mbete a hospital administrator, Beatrice Njambi who is in charge of the newborn unit at the facility and Administrative officer Regina Musembi. The prosecution said that they had completed their investigations and were ready to charge the three accused persons. Musa will not be charged on Monday as the court has been told that he is sick and admitted at Kenyatta National Hospital. The six suspects appeared on Monday before senior principal magistrate Benard Ochoi. Makallah was allegedly exposed by the BBC negotiating with an undercover journalist in a well-planned plot to sell a child who had been abandoned at the Mama Lucy Hospital. The suspects were arrested last week after police unearthed a child trafficking syndicate in Nairobi. “During an operation by police to unearth the organised crime, police officers noted with a lot of concern that local public hospitals and children homes within Nairobi are involved," read a statement by police IG Hillary Mutyambai. "In the course of the investigations and operations, it is unfortunate that it was realised senior medical officers in collision with the child smugglers are highly involved.”
