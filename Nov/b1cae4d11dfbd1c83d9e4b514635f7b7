It means Kenyans, felled 92-54 by Senegal in their opening fixture and 83-66 by Angola a day later made a good stride towards next year's championship. It was Mozambique who opened the scoring by Udise before Eric Mutoro replied with a three-pointer for an early 3-2 cushion as the game swung from one end to the other. Kenya were in early trouble foul halfway through the stanza but did well as Victor Bosire three-point bomb from the wing locked the duel 10-10. Mozambique rolled a 5 point advantage at 15-10 but again never say die Kenyans rallied to tie it 19-19 as the quarter ended. A Mozambique score was answered by a Valentine Nyakinda three as Kenya take their first lead at 22-21. Then two quickfire baskets by Ronny Gundo made it 26-23. Da Silva tied it 31-31and Magaliso Junior broke away for an easy layup as Mozambique went up 35-31. They hanged on 36-33 at the breather. After intermission Gundo scored first and Mutoro break had it 37-36 as Kenya regained the edge. A long-range trey by Mutoro ended the quarter at 56-48. An easy basket by Ligare gave Kenya a double-digit lead at 58-48 immediately after the last quarter got off. A breakaway slum by Ongwae 60-50. Kenya were all over Mozambique raking away points on breaks for a comfortable 71-50 cruise on a three-pointer by on fire Ongwae. Knowing that they needed to get a positive result from the fixture, Kenya went for the kill giving it their all. The next qualifying window is in February. Ligare, playing his only game of the four-team event provided the leadership from the backcourt that has been badly missing. Ongwae led the Kenyan tally with 21 points, Nyakinda 16 and Mutoro shot 15. For the losers, Carnivete Junior led all scorers with 22 while Udise 15.
