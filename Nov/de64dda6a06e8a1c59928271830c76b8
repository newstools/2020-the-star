Completion of the stalled Sh1.5 billion Trans Nzoia Teaching and Referral Hospital is on course and works have been stepped up. The project - stalled several times over six years - will have an additional 300 isolation beds for Covid-19 patients. Trans Nzoia Governor Patrick Khaemba said on Friday in Kitale his administration is committed to swift completion of the project and that works are moving faster. The completion date was not given. The hospital project had stalled due to controversies over graft allegations and lack of funding. Khaemba said that with the surge in Covid-19 cases, the public should take all precautions to prevent spread of the disease. He said most new cases were in prisons but said several county staff had also tested positive. “I reassure staff members and families my government will invest all resources possible to ensure they receive the best treatment and support," the governor said. He said the county has trained 800 health workers and 1,232 Community Health Volunteers. It has renovated and set up a 32-bed isolation unit at Mt Elgon Hospital. The county has purchased 10 ICU beds and 102 general beds for the referral hospital's isolation unit. “Augmentation of the isolation bed capacity to 300 is currently underway," Khaemba said. The county is also renovating the former Doctors Plaza in Kitale town to set up an isolation unit for health workers. It has already purchased five ICU beds, five ventilators and more PPEs for health workers. Khaemba said the county has disinfected and fumigated health facilities, Kitale town and other urban areas. He said those violating control measures were undermining the gains made in fighting the pandemic. “The gains have been negated by a few individuals who are not ready to abide by guidelines and protocols," Khaemba said. All necessary enforcement measures will be used, he said. (Edited by V. Graham)
