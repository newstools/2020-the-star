The government is tarmacking a 31km road in Mt Elgon subcounty for Sh2.5 billion to ease transportation of goods to the market and enhance security in the region. The road starts from Namwela market to Kapsokwony market. Mt Elgon subcounty is known for having poor road networks, insecurity and lack of clean water for human consumption. Bungoma county commissioner Samuel Kimiti cautioned motorists against using the newly constructed road recklessly. He spoke when he inspected the project. “Please let us observe the rules and regulations given by the road contractors because if we neglect their advice, we may end up registering a high number of accidents," Kimiti said. Kimiti called on Mt Elgon residents to invest more in agriculture as a way of improving living standards and the economy. He said the road will ease transportation of produce to the market. “Mt Elgon area is known for having productive soils, therefore I encourage you to fully engage in food production as it will earn you more money,” he said. Presidential Delivery Unit director in Western region Eliud Lererai praised President Uhuru Kenyatta for his resolve to fulfil his Big Four agenda in the country He said the road is expected to be completed by April next year. “Today we have inspected several presidential projects in Bumula subcounty, and they are progressing well," he said. Residents, led by Bernard Juma from Namwela ward, urged the county to help them access clean water for domestic use after watering points were destroyed during road construction. “The kind of water that we are consuming is very dirty. I plead with our county  Water, Environment, Tourism and Natural Resources executive to intervene and help us access clean water," he said.
