MPs have been asked to raise Sh10,000 each towards the funeral of the late Matungu MP Justus Murunga. The funds will be deducted from the MPs' November pay. The Ad-Hoc Committee in line with the Parliamentary Service Commissionâ€™s bereavement policy made the announcement on Thursday through a letter to speaker Justin Muturi. "Honourable Speaker, the Committee held its first meeting yesterday and commenced arrangements on how best to assist the family of the late Hon. Murunga to ensure that he gets a befitting sendoff. Part of the Committee has already visited the family, and we shall soon be briefing Members on funeral and other arrangements in due course," the chairperson said of the committee said. "... I wish to remind Members that in line with our established tradition as well as the Parliamentary practice regarding bereaved colleagues, the Leader of the Majority Party and the Leader of the Minority Party have authorized the Clerk of the National Assembly to deduct Sh10,000 from every Member for onward transmission to the family of our departed colleague." The 60-year-old lawmaker died on Saturday evening while being rushed to a hospital in Mumias. Covid-19 is the suspected cause of death as reports indicate he had breathing difficulties before collapsing in his Kakamega home. Before he collapsed, the MP was in a jovial mood having hosted guests at his rural home in Makunda village throughout Saturday. He was on his way upstairs for dinner at around 7.30pm when he suddenly felt very weak. He was with his bodyguard and a domestic worker.
