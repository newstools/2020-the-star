The Engineers Board of Kenya in partnership with the National Bank of Kenya on Friday unveiled smart ID cards for engineers. The need for the identification cards arose from the realisation that there was no mechanism for engineers to identify themselves to the public or relevant authorities. Engineers’ board chief executive Eng Nicholas Musuni said the IDs would be customised to include a visa card feature for additional conveniences. NBK director of retail banking Cromwell Kedemi said in addition to demonstrating accreditation, the card will facilitate payments, as well as preferential offers and discounts suited to an engineer's needs and lifestyle. “It is intended to enforce updated membership guidelines by identifying genuine engineers and can be pre-loaded and used to make payments online and offline anywhere in the world,” he said. The two spoke during the final day of the Institution of Engineers of Kenya (IEK) 27th Annual Conference in Mombasa county. This years’ theme was engineering a post-Covid-19 future - implementing sustainable regional and local development agendas taking into account global best practices. “The whole point of the international interaction is to learn from each other. Engineers should see the necessity of being a member of the Institution of Engineers of Kenya,” Eng Mustafa Shehu said. Shehu is the Fellow Nigerian Society of Engineers - World Federation of Engineering Organizations executive vice president. Out of the 16,000 graduate engineers in the country, only 9,000 are registered members of the IEK.
