The Public Service Commission (PSC) on Friday withdrew all human resource powers delegated to Education CS George Magoha. This is after the CS over was caught on camera insulting another officer in Nandi County. Magoha had toured the county to inspect  the construction of 100million Eluid Kipchoge library project in Kapsisiywa Secondary school. In a statement on Friday, PSC Communications Director Browne Kutswa said PSC Chairman Stephen Kirogo has passed on all human resource functions to  Education PS Richard Belio Kipsang. "PSC Chairman Stephen Kirogo in a circular addressed to chairpersons of Public Universities Councils and copied to the Head of Public Service Joseph Kinyua, said all human resource matters requiring the attention of the Public Service Commission shall henceforth be handled by Dr Kipsang as Authorized Officer of the Ministry until further notice," Kutswa said. "Kirogo noted that the move was in exercise of the Commission’s powers and commitment to protect public servants against undignified and unwarranted attacks, reiterating that the execution of delegated authority is designed to foster public confidence and maintain the integrity and dignity of the public service." The Commission has called upon all Authorized Officers to act in a manner that is consistent with provisions of the Constitution, applicable statutory requirements, regulations, policies, guidelines and manuals for effective management of the public service.
