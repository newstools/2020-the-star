Everton boss Carlo Ancelotti may have created a goalkeeping headache for himself in Sunday’s 2-1 Premier League defeat by Newcastle as Swedish back-up Robin Olsen put in an excellent debut performance between the posts in place of Jordan Pickford. Having arrived on loan from Roma on October 5, the vastly-experienced Olsen got his first chance to show what he could do and pulled off some superb reflex saves as Everton slumped to their second straight defeat. With Ancelotti saying before kickoff that he would reinstate Pickford for next week’s visit of Manchester United, he may well have inadvertently put pressure on the England international, who has made some costly errors so far this season. “I wanted to give an opportunity to Robin, to be part of this group and team. After this, Jordan will be back. Robin will play again but not against United,” Ancelotti told the BBC following the final whistle. “Robin did well, he did his job. He deserves to play. Jordan will be back, we have two really good keepers and this is what we need. Robin will play again. I don’t know when but next game, Jordan will be back.” Olsen, who has 40 caps for Sweden, had little to do for the opening half-hour before being suddenly called upon to deny Allan Saint-Maximin with a superb save after a Newcastle counter-attack. “I thought Robin did really well. He did everything that was asked of him and made a good save. It’s good to have that competition for places as it brings the best out of people,” Everton defender Michael Keane told Sky Sports. Olsen, still the first choice for his country, may have to return to the bench for now but any further errors by Pickford might see him back in Ancelotti’s team sooner rather than later.
