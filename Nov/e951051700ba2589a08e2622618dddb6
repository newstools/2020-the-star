Singer Size 8 and DJ Mo son's Muraya Jr turned a year old yesterday. Recounting on the pregnancy and delivery of their son, Size 8 said it was not easy as she had numerous health complications. "I almost died and was having multiple acute strokes due to extreme pre-eclampsia," she wrote. This is a pregnancy complication characterised by high blood pressure and signs of damage to another organ system, most often the liver and kidneys. It usually begins after 20 weeks of pregnancy in women whose blood pressure had been normal. "[I was] being put on oxygen and magnesium to save both my life and my son's." She said her son was born through a CS at 34 weeks and was put straight to the ICU, and that she almost lost him the second day after birth. DJ Mo also recalled the experience. Referring to his son as a fighter, he shared throwback photos of him on oxygen and thanked God for protecting their son. "You are a fighter and so may the Lord give you favour, true happiness, surround you with peace and prosperity," he wrote. "May Almighty protect you from the eyes and plans of evildoers. Itâ€™s been a journey and you have all blessings from us as the parents. You will be great and you will be the best and you will have a huge impact on your generation. You are a blessing to us and we will be here for you no matter what. Happy birthday, my son." Size 8 also encouraged her fans to never give up on God. "You are a symbol of God's mighty power." In an interview with Word Is, Size 8 said she values life so much. "It doesn't matter if you have billions of shillings. If you don't have good health, you can't enjoy it. Both my children are a miracle to us and I being alive is a huge miracle"
