West Brom vs Sheffield Saturday 11 pm Following an unlucky 1-0 loss to Manchester United, West Bromwich Albion will be looking to return to winning ways in the Premier League when they welcome Sheffield United at the Hawthorns on Matchday 10. Having also lost 1-0 to Tottenham the previous week, the Baggies have now failed to win any of their opening nine league matches for the first time since 1985-86. Little has gone right for West Brom since they looked on course for a stunning result by taking a 3-0 half-time lead at home to Chelsea in September. They eventually had to settle for a 3-3 draw and have only managed one goal in six subsequent games, which was Karlan Grant’s late equaliser in a 1-1 draw at Brighton. Sheffield, on the other hand, have scored only once after half time away from home, losing four, although the majority of their conceded goals also came beyond the interval. Chris Wilder’s men are not enjoying a successful season, meaning that WBA will not have a better chance than this to record their first win of the season. Sheffield will have to work hard as a team to breach West Brom’s lineup defence who will most likely get a goal themselves and run out victorious.

Dortmund have responded well to their Der Klassiker defeat against Bayern Munich, securing two wins by a three-goal margin since, and have subsequently won 70 per cent of their competitive matches this season despite a -2 handicap. However, with just two of Dortmund’s six Bundesliga wins seeing them lead at the break, this has clearly helped them up their game and net a spectacular 85 per cent of their league goals during the second half. FC Koln on the other hand, do not seem to be competitive at this level in the 2020/21 season, with the team still targeting their first win of the season. Considering that Koln are not regarded as good travellers, Dortmund has the odds-on favourite for this match.

The Catalan giants have already dropped too many points in the 2020/21 season, meaning that this has to go down as a must-win situation for them. Lionel Messi and Frenkie De Jong were rested in the Champions League clash against Dynamo Kyiv, meaning that the duo is likely to start against Osasuna. Osasuna pulled off one of the biggest shocks of 2019/20, winning 2-1 here in July, and could complete a run of successive league wins at Barcelona for the first time since 1989. However, Osasuna lamented a shocking average losing margin of 6.25 goals across their four league visits to Camp Nou prior to that victory. Barcelona are very determined to avoid letting the top group in the rankings go too far. With Osasuna, they are also very determined to rise to the top half of the rankings. The confrontations between Barcelona and Osasuna often have a lot of goals where the last five meetings ended in Over.
