Nigerian singer Olakira, real name Adelusola Adefemi, was in the country over the weekend for the Afro-Beats Rave event that went down at Diamond Plaza. Olakira is well known for his hit 'Maserati'. Talking to Word Is during his visit, he said, "I'd like to work with the likes of Sauti Sol, Otile Brown and Fena Gitu." The singer marvelled at the success of his song at a time when the world was and is still experiencing a pandemic. "It was unbelievable that the song has become a hit when there is a pandemic. This is pure Grace," he said. He said he was excited after singer Davido slid into his DM, asking him to do a remix of the song. "Yes, he inboxed me and we got into studio and the song is actually out."
