Police in Homa Bay are investigating the circumstances in which an ex-officer allegedly committed suicide at his home in Suba South constituency. Ong’ayo villagers said former policeman Samuel Obote hanged himself on a curtain he tied to a window grill in his bedroom on Wednesday. Suba South subcounty police boss Antony Njeru told journalists on Friday they were informed about the death after Obote’s daughter discovered the body. “One of the deceased's brothers had visited him and they planned to meet again. But when the brother sent the daughter to call the father he was found dead,” Njeru said. The officer said Obote had separated with his wife due to constant domestic wrangles. “Obote’s death came after they had separated with his wife. The wife had run away three months ago,” he said. The police boss said they have begun investigations to establish what actually caused the death of their former colleague. “We urged residents not to resort to committing suicide as a solution whenever they experience problems. However, we’re investigating the cause of death,” Njeru said. The body was moved to Sindo Subcounty Hospital mortuary. Obote had been living with his children in the home since he separated with the wife. Villagers said he was last stationed in Mombasa. At the time of his death, Obote was operating a Toyota Probox matatu on the Homa Bay-Sindo route.
