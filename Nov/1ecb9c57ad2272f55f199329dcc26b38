Bomet and Kericho used to be magnets for sex workers when annual tea bonuses were paid. No longer. The continuing fall in tea bonuses for small farmers in Bomet and Kericho counties for the second consecutive year means there are fewer sex workers trooping to the area. While the prostitutes who throng the towns have for several years raked in a lot of cash from the willing buyers, this year the situation for farmers and sex workers is bleak. Bar owners too are complaining. A spot check by the Star has shown minimal activities across the major towns and trading centers in the two counties where the sex workers usually camped in wait for their targets. The women who come from as far as Nairobi and Nakuru usually hang around the entrances to clubs, backstreet pubs and lodgings in wait for customers. These days they are nowhere to be seen. The drop in pay coupled with the impact of Covid-19 has left tea farmer with no option but to save their little pay and support their families' needs instead of having fun. Bar owners are not reaping the usual benefits of tea bonus payments. “Unlike previous seasons when we had many customers trooping to our joints to enjoy themselves, things are different this year. We only have a few," a bar owner on famous Kipchamba Street in Bomet town, said. There are no reported cases of men who have been conned out of their money as they withdrew bonuses from their banks since pay was released two weeks ago. The bonus released by Kenya Tea Development Agency for the year ending in June showed tea farmers countrywide took home Sh27.2 billion. Tea factories in Bomet paid their farmers Sh6.42 billion, compared with last year’s Sh6.15 and Sh3.82 for Bomet and Kericho, respectively. Bomet county police commander Naomi Ichami told the press the county has not witnessed any influx of sex workers preying on tea farmers and called contrary reports misleading. (Edited by V. Graham)
