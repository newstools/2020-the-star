President Uhuru Kenyatta has asked leaders and Kenyans in general to promote good politics to ensureÂ  security. "We must always remember that the wages of bad politics is the people suffering and ruin," he said. "Many neighbouring countries need a handshake, they need a politics in which competition is not turned into enmity. They need political leaders focused on including the young and desperate not inciting them to revolt against their country and their elders. " The President made the remarks during his seventh State of The Nation Address on Thursday. Uhuru said that Kenya has learned that elections alone cannot bring peace and unity to a divided people. "For that, leaders must reach out to each other and build bridges over turbulent waters to allow the people to cross into safety and prosperity," he said. "Our state of national security will remain strong as long as we practice inclusive and sober politics." Two days ago, the President urged leaders to stop politics and focus on development. "There is no need of going around making noise instead of bringing development to Kenyans," he said. Speaking while opening the cargo transit shed linking the Embakasi Inland Container Depot to other counties on Tuesday, Uhuru said politicians should stop incitement. "The people I am talking about know themselves. Let us facilitate our people and make their lives easier not complicated," he said. "This was not a big issue. It is just a matter of taking up a problem and finding out a way. We must reform the way we provide services to our people."
