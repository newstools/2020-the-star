Glovo, the on-demand delivery company, has announced extension of  its operations to Eldoret and Kisumu this month. This move is part of Glovo's strategic expansion in Kenya, with the company intending to have a presence in all major towns in the country. Residents in Kisumu and Eldoret will now be able to enjoy free delivery for top partners KFC, Java and Naivas as part of Glovo’s launch campaign in these markets. "We are very excited about this launches in Eldoret and Kisumu, which represents a key part of plan, to bring our world-class delivery service to as many potential users as possible,” said Priscilla Muhiu, the General Manager for Glovo Kenya. The expansion in Eldoret and Kisumu shows Glovo's intent to link its customers to an ever-expanding portfolio of outlets. The expansion in Kenya follows Glovo’s launch in Uganda in October. Following operations in Kampala, the delivery platform has now expanded its footprint across Africa, with Uganda the second country in East Africa and the fifth country in Africa for the firm. Glovo has partnered with Carrefour Supermarkets in a month-long campaign dubbed Black Friday to offer their customers heavily discounted offers over the weekends in November, in a move targeted at extending its services to Carrefour customers and also new clientele.
