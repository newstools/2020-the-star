Chama Cha Mashinani leader Isaac Rutto has accused BBI task force member Maj John Seii of insincerity on his claims that the final report was ‘doctored’. The former governor asked Seii to own the report and accept a "collective responsibility" since he was part of the task force. Seii, a member of the 14-member BBI task force, claimed on Thursday that some of the proposals were totally alien because they never featured in their initial deliberations. But speaking in Chebilat, Konoin, Rutto said he fully supports the final product. He said even if the report was to be opened up for more amendments or to be rewritten, there would still be stalemates from some quarters. “People differ in opinions but when you are part of a team tasked with coming up with a solution to a problem, you cannot come out and speak contrary to what you agreed with other members. You have to accept and own the recommendations that you have produced as a team,” Rutto said. He said the report should be adopted as it is so the country can move forward. Amendments, he said, should come later.
