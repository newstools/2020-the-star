Machakos governor Alfred Mutua has postponed his countrywide campaigns after the surge in Covid-19 cases. Mutua announced his 2022 presidential run with a pledge on a fresh start and job creation. "Due to the rising cases, which appear more serious than before, I am postponing my nationwide listening tours until the situation improves," Mutua said. Via Twitter on Monday, Mutua urged other leaders to also be responsible and halt their public meetings. "Let's lead by example by wearing masks, keeping distance. Wananchi mimic how we carry ourselves because they believe we are privy to more information," he said. Mutua said that if leaders look like there is nothing to worry about, Kenyans behave accordingly, placing themselves in danger. "My fellow leaders, greed for power should be tempered. Life and health first." President Uhuru Kenyatta, Deputy William Ruto and ODM leader Raila Odinga have been on the front line in leading political gatherings that have violated all the Covid-19 protocols. This is despite top officials from the Ministry of Health standing before the cameras and singing the same song, saying Kenya is not out of the woods as every citizen should follow directives to curb the spread of Covid-19. The maskless leaders have been captured with mammoth gathering around them as they traverse across the country.
