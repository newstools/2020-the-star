Deputy President William Ruto has postponed tours to three counties in Eastern citing concerns of a second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. "For this reason, I have decided to significantly scale down my public engagements until further notice," Ruto said n Twitter on Tuesday. He was to tour Kitui, Machakos and Makueni this weekend. The DP has been crisscrossing the country, amplifying his 'hustler' movement and saying the Building Bridges Initiative report should be all-inclusive. Ruto had earlier said that the country should find a mechanism to bring together all divergent views BBI. The DP said that it is possible to agree on the contentious issues to move the country forward. His remarks come as Covid-19 caseload stands at 57,093 and 1,039 deaths have been reported. Last week during the official unveiling of the BBI report, President Uhuru Kenyatta told Ruto to slow down his campaigns and focus on what he was put in office to do first. It also comes when Kenyans are waiting to hear what the president will say regarding restrictions. Health CS Mutahi Kagwe had raised concern over the ongoing political rallies in the country when the country is going through a second wave of the virus. Kagwe had asked politicians to lead by example in curbing the virus by calling off their rallies and calling upon Kenyans to avoid such meetings. The Kenya Medical Association (KMA) had also pleaded with the president to suspend all the political rallies as well as other gatherings in the country for a period not less than one month. KMA had also asked the government to enforces adherence to the Ministry of Health guidelines for bars, restaurants, and clubs especially for those operating in total disregard of the guidelines.
