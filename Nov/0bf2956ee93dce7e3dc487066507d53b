YouTube is this week holding its first virtual YouTube Black Africa Creator Week dedicated to engaging, educating and inspiring African creators to grow on the platform. It will celebrate creators through the presentation of Play Button awards to celebrities whose channels have crossed the 100,000 subscriber milestone. In a statement, Emerging Markets MD Alex Okosi said they have built and nurtured strong relationships with Africa’s storytellers by providing them with a platform to share their stories with the world. "Top African creators and channels like Mark Angel Comedy, DJ Arch Jnr, Churchill Show and many others have grown from a handful of followers to having millions of fans globally." The programme also includes a creator spotlight talk with Mark Angel, Africa’s most subscribed endemic creator. This will conclude with a two-hour live stream event featuring music performances by stars including Sauti Sol.
