Government spokesman Cyrus Oguna has dismissed the image being circulated in social media of a Huduma Namba card. On Wednesday, the images of a fake Huduma Card flooded social media at the same time the ICT and Interior ministries were launching the issuing of the document. Through a tweet, Oguna asked members of the public to ignore the image, adding that the genuine card does not have an expiry date. "Kenyans have been made to believe that this is how the #HudumaCard looks like. We wish to clarify that this is fake and that Huduma Card has no expiry date," Oguna said. While launching the cards in Machakos, ICT CS Joe Mucheru said that Huduma Namba Cards will be rolled out across the country from December. Mucheru said that the current national ID will cease being in operation by December 12 next year. Mucheru said there will be no use of IDs and only Huduma Namba cards will be used to get government services from Jamhuri Day next year. The CS said no one will be able to access government services without the Huduma Card. "After Jamhuri Day 2021 only the Huduma card will help you get the services you want from the government and nothing else," he said. " You have one year to get the card and within the year the private businesses, the government will be ready to ensure that we receive your Huduma cards and give you the services." At the same time, the Ministry of Interior said through a statement on Wednesday that there will be a mass registration for Huduma Namba in April 2021, giving another opportunity to those who failed to be captured. "In order to attain full inclusion of all persons in Kenya in the system, there will be another opportunity for mass registration in April 2021, while routine registration will continue thereafter," Matiang'i said. Interior CS added that Huduma Namba is a fully Kenyan-funded and developed solution, will operate as the primary source of data on every citizen and foreigner.
