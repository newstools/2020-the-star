A shoe factory this week opened its doors in Mvindeni, Kwale county. The factory has been opened by Josef Seibel Group, a German shoe-making giant. The company is making shoes under the brand name ‘Romika’. Company proprietor Carl-August Seibel, who flew in from Germany on Sunday, paid a courtesy call to Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya in his office. He was accompanied by Josef Seibel CEO Stefan Wentzel and director Elijah Musili. Seibel said Romika produces shoes that reflect the spirit of the times in both style and colour using the best textiles and finest leathers. “For the time being, only leather shoes for schoolchildren will be produced under the brand Romika,” he said during a media briefing. Seibel said the comfort shoes are to be sold exclusively in Kenya and will match their respective school uniforms. “The planned production is 1,000 pairs of shoes per day until mid-2021.” Seibel said the factory has employed 200 youths besides acting as a training centre for local shoemakers. Governor Mvurya said the factory comes at a time when investment, especially in the manufacturing sector, is needed to stimulate economic growth during the Covid-19 pandemic. “I'm glad they have already trained five Kwale natives in Germany in shoe production," he said. Mvurya pledged that his administration would continue supporting investors to bring development to the area. He said Kwale is attracting numerous investors due to improved infrastructural development. “Further, we have the construction of our fruit processing plant ongoing in Shimba Hills, ongoing construction of steel industry in Samburu, and a fish processing plant in Shimoni,” he said.
