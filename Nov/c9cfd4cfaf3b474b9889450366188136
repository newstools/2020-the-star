Macadamia farmers in Kiambu are feeling the heat of the Covid-19 pandemic that has disrupted the global market for the nuts. Most nut processors have stopped buying the crop, leaving farmers with tonnes of the produce in their stores. Farmers from Thika, Gatundu North, Githunguri and Gatundu South said disruption of the market has given middlemen a field day. They spoke in Thika at a meeting organised by Jungle Nuts Ltd, a macadamia nuts processor based in the town. Brokers are buying the produce from desperate farmers for as low as Sh30 per kilo. But the farmers vowed to hold their produce until the market stabilises. “Most of us have harvested our macadamia and we have declined to sell to brokers because they are taking advantage of the current situation in the market occasioned by the pandemic to buy our produce at throwaway prices,” Joyce Njeri from Kiganjo, Gatundu South, said. Lawrence Ndarwa from Gituamba in Gatundu North said despite the current market crisis, he will stay with his produce until prices rise. “I know the benefits of macadamia farming. It pays handsomely and at no time will I sell the produce to brokers. I’m optimistic that the market will resume once the pandemic eases. I’d urge my fellow farmers to be patient,” Ndarwa said. Jungle Nuts CEO Patrick Wainaina said the global economic disruption caused by Covid-19 has hit the macadamia trade hard. He said the pandemic has caused nuts prices to drastically decline from Sh200 per kilo recorded last year to Sh60 as at last month. “Processors are struggling with the product because the market has been very difficult due to the virus. I know that things have not been very easy for the macadamia nuts farmers in the country since the onset of the pandemic but I urge them to stay put and be patient. The market will soon stabilise,” Wainaina said. He said macadamia nut farming, especially in the Mt Kenya region, is overtaking tea and coffee farming as the top income earner. Edited by Henry Makori
