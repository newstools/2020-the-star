A robbery with violence suspect was gunned down by police officers whilee trying to break into a shop in Oyugis town. The suspect was in the company of four people, who escaped after they engaged police in a scuffle. The incident occurred around 2am on Sunday morning in Kasipul. Police officers were in a patrol within the town when they heard voices and sounds of people breaking into a shop situated on Oyugis –Kendu Bay road. The suspects were armed with metallic weapons. Rachuonyo South sub county police Commander Lilies Wachira said a suspect had already climbed to roof top of the shop and started cutting down the iron-sheets roof. “The fracas began when some two suspects started throwing their weapons to police as others were looking for ways of gaining entry into the shop,” Wachira said. The suspect who was killed was armed with a panga and a metallic object. He was shot before he tried to slash and hit a police officer. “He refused to surrender and said he would use any weapon to deal with police,” she added. The police boss said the incident occurred after a number of residents raised complaints that there is a group of people operating as gangsters who rob and beat residents up in Oyugis town. She urged residents to work closely with police to improve security in the town. They are currently pursuing the other four suspects, warning that they will not go uncaught. “Operations continue and we’ll not let criminals make innocent residents live in fear. Anybody with information about the whereabouts of the four escapists should report to us,” she said. The body was moved to Rachuonyo South  sub county hospital mortuary.
