The Registrar of Political Parties has approved the decision taken by the Thirdway Alliance Party to expel Ekuru Aukot as party leader. In a letter dated November 18, addressed to the party Secretary General Fredrick Okango, the Registrar of Political Parties Ann Nderitu said that her office is satisfied by the disciplinary process that led to Aukot’s dismissal. “This office is satisfied that the disciplinary process followed the provisions of the PPA and procedure provided under articles 14 and 25 of the Thirdway Alliance Party constitution,” Ann Nderitu said. She added that “The party is guided to ratify this decision of NEC as provided under article of 14(k) of the party constitution.” However, Nderitu said that Aukot’s expulsion as party member did not satisfy the set requirements including Article 6.3 of the party constitution, hence she declined the move. Aukot was expelled by the party on September over financial impropriety and lack of transparency to party members. Okango had said that the decision was made "without any malice, bias or hatred" despite the former party leader hopping from one media house to the other to disparage the party's NEC decisions. NEC decided to expel Aukot following his snub to appear before the party's discipline committee. "The disciplinary committee convened on September 4 and all witnesses and complaints appeared and testified, however, Aukot did not appear nor did he send an apology," Okango said. Ealier on, Aukot had been suspended by the NEC over financial impropriety, lack of transparency to party members, self-enrichment and non-accountability.
