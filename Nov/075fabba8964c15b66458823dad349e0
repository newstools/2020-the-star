Kuppet has asked the government to allow teachers above the age of 55 to seek voluntary early retirement to protect them from Covid-19. Secretary-general Akello Misori warned of a possible teacher crisis when schools reopen in January. The union's analysis shows that some 25,000 teachers aged 58 and above will be working from home upon reopening of schools in January. TSC in November instructed that teachers above the age of 58 and those with underlying conditions should work from home in January for their safety as they are more susceptible to the virus. “We urge the commission to open a window for teachers above 55 years who wish to retire from service. In this regard, the Treasury must immediately release pension funds for all teachers who have left service in recent months,” Misori said. As a preparation for such early retirement, the TSC should institute a robust succession management plan for head teachers, their deputies and other senior teachers aged 55 years and above who opt to retire early. The union asked the employer to issue guidelines on working from home. Overall, some 50,000 teachers will retire within the next three years. Such a scenario, Misori says, needs urgent plans to increase the number of teachers and take other measures to maintain education services at the current levels. The union recommends hiring of at least 50,000 teachers over the next year and at least 15,000 per year between 2021 and 2026.
