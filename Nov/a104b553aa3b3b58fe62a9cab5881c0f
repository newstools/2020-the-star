A Kenyan-based non-governmental organisation has embarked on a noble cause to transform the lives of youths in Kirinyaga County through sports. The Kenya Network for Dissemination of Agricultural Technologies (KENDAT) says it will partner with the National Authority for the Campaign Against Alcohol and Drug Abuse (NACADA) to organise a soccer tournament in Kirinyaga. The event will be used to educate the youth on the detrimental effects of abusing drugs. “In this world, there are two activities that can transform society, sports and music. Actually sports have a way of promoting social cohesion and positive thinking and behaviour among young people. It promotes healthy lifestyle and well-being,” KENDAT CEO Eston Murithi explains. “If we are to continue supporting and promoting youth participation in sports, it will go a long way in ensuring that young are prevented in engaging in social ills like drugs and substance abuse,” Murithi says. The network has been implementing a behaviour change project in Kirinyaga through the football tournament. One of the main objectives of the tournament is to fight drug and alcohol abuse among young donkey owners in Kirinyaga and to improve donkey welfare such as reduction in whipping of donkeys brought about by the young donkey users using drugs. “We have been implementing this project in partnership with NACADA who have supported in offering training on Alcohol and Drug abuse and positive parenting,” Murithi said during an interview with the Star.
