Loss of income has left many migrant workers unable to support themselves and their families, a new United Nations study has shown. Currently, 75 per cent of migrant women and 70 per cent of men work in the informal sector which according to the UN has been worst hit by the pandemic. In the study named "Implications of Covid-19 for Hunger, Migration and Displacement", the UN has cautioned of a hunger and population displacement surge as people seek work to support their families. Measures and restrictions put in place in many countries to contain the spread of the disease have limited movement and opportunities to work and earn an income. According to the report, these restrictions have strained the ability of migrants to afford food and other basic needs. “As a result, hunger rates are skyrocketing around the world,” David Beasley, World Food Programme director said. According to the State Department of Labour, there is an increasing number of Kenyan professionals migrating to Canada and Australia. Many others work in Asia, the Middle East, Latin America, the Caribbean and Oceania. Without sustained income, the report warns, many migrants will be pushed to return home. A temporary drop in remittances which provide a lifeline for one in every nine people will be experienced. “Kenyan migrant workers contribute significantly to the socio-economic development of the country in terms of skills, expertise and transfer of knowledge upon return. For instance, monthly remittances inflows in 2019 averaged Sh23 billion shillings,” Labour PS Peter Tum said. Between March 2019 and January 2020 some 29,448 Kenyan migrant workers were cleared to work in Saudi Arabia as domestic workers. Clearance of persons migrating to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for work was halted for eight months by the National Employment Authority due to the Covid-19 pandemic.  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
