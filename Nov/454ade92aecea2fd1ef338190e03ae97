Vihiga Woman Representative Beatrice Adagala wants the state to take legal action against parents whose kids were involved in a drinking party over the weekend. Speaking to the Star on Wednesday morning via phone, Adagala said parents should be the first to fight immorality in the society by ensuring their children adhere to moral standards. “These parents have failed to take responsibility and they should serve as an example to the rest,” she said. The lawmaker said arresting the suspects over the weekend saga will not help but parents should take moral responsibilities for their children. She said parents and the society at large should take the blame over the mess the teenagers are engaging in. “There is a quick need to raise children on a society level as it was once back in the days, that will help us reduce the mess we are seeing,” Adagala said. Her sentiments come days after the Directorate of Criminal Investigations said there are third parties benefiting from pornographic images of the 44 teenagers nabbed at Mountain View Estate in Nairobi over the weekend. In Bungoma, 21 teenagers were nabbed partying, drinking alcohol and smoking. “It’s quite weird your child spends the entire weekend out, and as a parent, you are not aware and you don’t know what your kid is doing in that particular place,” Adagala said. She said with the premarital sex the kids are engaging in, there is bound to be many more cases of unwanted pregnancies, STI, AIDS and other transmitted diseases. The MP asked the Ministry of Education to reintroduce caning in schools to help restore respect and moral valueS.  Edited by Kiilu Damaris.
