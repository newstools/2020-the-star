WHO Director-General Tedros Ghebreyesus has gone into quarantine after he was identified as a contact of someone who tested positive for the virus. In a Twitter post on Monday morning, Ghebreyesus said he was well and was following all the WHO protocol. "I have been identified as a contact of someone who has tested positive ...I am well and without symptoms but will self-quarantine over the coming days, in line with protocols, and work from home," he said. He added:" It is critically important that we all comply with health guidance. This is how we will break chains of virus transmission, suppress the virus, and protect health systems." Ghebreyesus said World Health Organisation will continue to engage with partners in solidarity to save lives and protect the vulnerable. Covid-19 has claimed nearly 1.2 million lives and infected more than 46 million people worldwide since it was first detected in China late last year. Tedros has been the face of WHO's response to the pandemic since the beginning of the year and has been working with government leaders and scientists to control the virus and work on creating a vaccine. He has received criticism from President Donald Trump, who accused the WHO of not being tough enough on China following its late response to the virus.
