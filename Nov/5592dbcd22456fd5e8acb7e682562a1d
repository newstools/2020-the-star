National Under 20 football team Rising Stars completed a double over Sudan after securing a 2-1 win at the Nyayo Stadium yesterday. Stars had two days earlier beaten their opponents 3-1 in the two-legged Cecafa Championship build-up contest. And for the second time running, Stars were forced to rally from a goal down to see off the visitors, whom they will face in Group ‘C’ of the regional championship set for November 22 to December 6 in Tanzania. After seeing his charges struggle in the opening stages of both matches, coach Stanley Okumbi is looking forward to bring in at least six players to seal the loopholes in the defence. "We had a slow start into the match and made a mistake similar to the one in the first match. The team has potential but we have to work on our defence before leaving for Tanzania. I have invited six more players to boost the team before the championship," he said. Stars fell behind hardly three minutes into the game after Yousif Abdelkarim tapped in from close range. The home side mounted a spirited search for an equaliser with Selassie Otieno and Enock Wanyama missing golden chances. Stars continued to camp at Sudan’s area and would have scored in the 27th minute but Otieno, who was through on goal, was denied by the advancing Yousif Khamis. After making several unsuccessful attempts, Stars finally leveled matters in the 35th minute through Wanyama, whose low shot sailed past a hapless Khamis. Okumbi rested Kariobangi Sharks forward Ronald Reagan for Keith Imbali after the break as he sort to add more power in attack which fluffed clear-cut chances in the first half. Okumbi’s charges, who picked from where they left after the break doubled their advantage in the 65th minute through Mathew Mwendwa, who curled a loose ball poorly cleared by the defence to the top corner. Mwendwa, who was on target on Tuesday would prove the difference between the two sides.
