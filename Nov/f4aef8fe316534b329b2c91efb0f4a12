Domestic violence perpetrated by women is on the rise in Kiambu, a lobby group has said. Voice of Men and Children chairman James Njenga said the trend is worrying since men tend to remain silent about what happens in their marriages. He said only a few report to chiefs. However, when men turn on their wives, they are reported at police stations and the men are arrested and charged. "It is so sad that men do not disclose because they might feel inferior, cowards, people who have no control over their families," Njenga said. The chairman, also a bishop of Compassion Revival Church, advised couples to disclose their differences to a close friend who can help them, a pastor or look for marriage counsellors. "There are people who deal with married life so well. They help people who were fighting to love one each again," Njenga said. He spoke on Monday in his Limuru office, where he revealed that many men have been looking to them for help. "Some men report to us and we discover that since they were married, they have been having a rough time in the hands of their wives," he said. "One of them reported to us that he has been married for 11 years and trouble started after two years. It started when his wife fell ill after they were blessed with a child." Vomec secretary Njagi Mbugua urged couples to protect and guard each other's interests in marriage. Edited by Henry Makori
