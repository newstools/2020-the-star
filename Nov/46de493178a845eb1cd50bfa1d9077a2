Vihiga county has received 35,000 free masks to combat Covid -19 from High Level Summit. The county so far it registered six cases since the virus was reported early March. HLS national coordinator Joseph Amunga said Covid-19 can be controlled if the citizens will fully comply with state orders. “Let people put on masks, sanitise and observe social distance be it in church, marketplaces or in any social gathering. That’s the only way out,” Amunga said. He said the donated masks are not for sale but should be distributed to county residents for free to help fight coronavirus. He spoke at the county headquarters when he paid a visit to Governor Wilber Ottichillo to brief him on upcoming HSL meetings in the counties. Amunga said no development would take place countrywide if the Covid-19 pandemic continued to hit the public. “That is why when the BBI came we said counties must be allocated more funds to foster development in these devolved units,” he said. "I am grateful to HLS for this donation and as a county we are always willing to work with them. Covid-19 is at our doorstep and we should take it as a great enemy. Always adhere to the government's directive on fighting and prevention of the disease," Governor Ottichilo said.
