Uasin Gishu Education officer Gitonga Mbaka has recorded a statement with the EACC about the incident in which he was publicly insulted and called 'stupid' by Education CS George Magoha. The EACC is investigating Magoha for alleged unethical conduct. His comments caught on camera have caused an uproar. He has been stripped of all human resources responsibilities but is unapologetic and says he will carry on. Mbaka recorded a three-hour statement at the EACC office in Eldoret on Wednesday. He declined to talk to reporters afterward. On November 6, Magoha toured Langas Primary School in Eldoret to examine Covid-19 safety measures and delivery of desks. He complained publicly about the hygiene and untidy state of the premises. He blamed Mbaka. EACC Regional coordinator Japheth Baithalu said they had invited Mbaka to shed light on the incident. “We just invited him to tell us what transpired after the matter attracted public interest and we have just started the [investigation] process. We can't say much at the moment," Baithalu said. He did not say when CS Magoha would record a statement. Other Education officials who were present are expected to record statements. Magoha accused Mbaka of sleeping on his job even when the officer tried to explain the measures he had taken, including writing a report on the situation at the school. “Nikisema wewe ni mjinga ni uongo?” (If I say you are stupid will I be lying?) the CS is heard saying in the video clip. Magoha chased away Mbaka from the function. Magoha's behavour caused an outcry from stakeholders in the education sector. Some demanded the CS resign for disrespecting education officers. Some demanded an apology. The 30-seconds video clip led the Public Service Commission to withdraw all HR functions from Magoha and hand them to PS Belio Kipsang. Magoha said he would continue to perform his full functions, unless directed otherwise by the appointing authority, President Uhuru Kenyatta. (Edited by V. Graham)
