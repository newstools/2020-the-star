West Pokot Governor John Lonyangapuo has urged farmers to market their livestock on digital platforms to fetch good returns. He said marketing on social media platforms eliminates middlemen as the farmers sell directly to consumers. Lonyangapuo was speaking at Chepareria saleyard on Wednesday after distributing 80 Sahiwal bulls. The cattle were purchased through a people-driven initiative in conjunction with the county government. Groups were drawn from Cheptiangwa, Pserum, Sook and Riwo. The county government, through the Livestock department, distributes Sahiwal bulls annually across the 20 wards in a programme aimed at enhancing the quality and marketability of cattle. “I am very impressed that mwananchi has seen the fruits of changing local breeds and is now at the forefront in supplementing the government initiative,” he said. The governor asked farmers to avoid being exploited by middlemen. “Livestock farmers are being exploited by middlemen who buy their animals at a throwaway price and later sell in various markets making supernormal profits,” Lonyangapuo said. “The world is going digital. We need to make use of various digital platforms and sell our livestock at good prices. Farmers should not be exploited any more during this digital era." He said farmers should embrace value addition for more profits. “My government has invested heavily in disease control and improving local breeds. I want to urge farmers to use online markets to sell their animals to buyers from other counties,” he said. Edited by P.O
