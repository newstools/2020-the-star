A Kisii MCA died in an ambulance on Sunday morning as he was being taken to a hospital in Nairobi. Kiamokama MCA Kennedy Mainya was taken ill on Thursday and was rushed to a hospital in Kisii. It is not clear what he was ailing from. His health deteriorated on Sunday and his family requested to transfer him to Nairobi for specialised treatment. Assembly Majority leader Timothy Ogugu said Mainya died in Narok en route to an unnamed city hospital. "Mainya was taken ill Thursday and was rushed to a hospital in Kisii. He was put on oxygen but his condition deteriorated Sunday," he said. Deputy Governor Joash Maangi eulogised the MCA saying, "I remember him as a soft-spoken, modest and formidable politician who served his people with dedication." Other ward reps also sent their condolences to the family.
