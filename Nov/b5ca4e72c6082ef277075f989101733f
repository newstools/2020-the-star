The BBI is a political scheme for 2022 and should be amended to cater to the needs of ordinary Kenyans, Emuhaya MP Omboko Milemba has said. Milemba said his ANC party will support the report with amendments. He said he will provide copies to his constituents so they can read the recommendations and make informed decisions. “Constitutional amendments should be done with the interest of the people who elected us to serve them,” Milemba said. He spoke after Vihiga Governor Wilber Ottichilo said he will engage all county residents to ensure they make the right decisions about the Building Bridges Initiative. The MP was speaking at his constituency headquarters at the weekend when he issued cheques worth Sh6.3 million to university and middle-level college students. He said he was concerned with the high number of jobless youth who are committing suicide. "Drug abuse and alcohol is the major contributor to this and it's high time we need to come out and condemn it," he said. "Illicit brewers and drug peddlers are the major contributors and we need to stop them," he added.  Edited by P.O
