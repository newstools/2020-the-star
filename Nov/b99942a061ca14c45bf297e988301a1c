Deaths from road accidents have been predicted to be the fifth-biggest killer by 2030. National Transport and Safety Authority deputy director Duncan Kibogong said an estimated 3,000 deaths from road crashes occur annually in Kenya. "About 40 per cent are pedestrians," Kibogong said. He is also head of road safety. "The annual economic cost of road crashes is about three to five per cent of GDP or Sh350 billion," he said. Speaking during a virtual event to remember victims of road crashes, Kibogong said they are the highest contributors to disabilities, health burden and poverty through loss of breadwinners. The World Health Organization says between 5,000 and 15,000 lives are lost on the roads every year. Kenyan authorities, however, peg the figure at about 3,000. Kibogong said there were 3,337 fatalities in 2018-19, compared with 3,567 in 2019-20, a difference of 230. In 2018-19, 5,687 were seriously injured as compared to 7,158 in 2019-20, a difference of 1,471." Those slightly injured in 2018-19 were 4,923 and a further 4,955 in 2019-20. In 2018-19,  1,250 pedestrians died as compared with 1,376 in 2019-020, a difference of 126. Some 786 passengers perished in 2018-19 compared with 565 in 2019-20. Some 633 motorcyclists perished in 2018-19 compared with 875 in 2019-20, a difference of 242. About 280 pillion passengers perished in 2018-19 as compared with 373 in 2019-2020, a difference of 93. Kibogong said 68.5 per cent of fatalities occur from 5pm to 8pm while 31.5 per cent of fatalities occur from 8am to about 5pm. Many fatalities occur on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays. Nairobi, Kiambu, Nakuru, Machakos and Makueni are among the deadliest places to drive. Statistics show that 83.2 per cent of fatalities are male and 16.8 per cent are female. Globally, road traffic crashes cause more than 1.24 million deaths a year – but by 2030 they are estimated to kill an estimated 2.4 million people per year. Between 20 million and 50 million are injured or disabled. Road crashes are among the top 10 causes of death. About 3,500 people die every day globally from road accidents. More than 90 per cent of fatalities occur in developing countries despite low numbers of motor vehicles. Accidents are the leading cause of death for people aged 15 to 29 years. Africa has the highest estimated road fatality rate of 26.6 per 100,000 population. About 650 deaths occur every day in Africa with 46.6 vehicles per 1,000 people. Europe has 510.3 vehicles per 1,000 people. WHO said half of the deaths in Africa occur among vulnerable road users, with 39 per cent among pedestrians. Road traffic fatality data are greatly under-reported in Africa. Some estimates place totals at almost four times the official figures. (Edited by V. Graham)
