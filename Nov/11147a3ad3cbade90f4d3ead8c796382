Three bars in Kwale have been closed indefinitely and over 200 people arrested for flouting Covid-19 rules. County commissioner Karuku Ngumo said six public service vehicles were impounded in a Thursday morning crackdown. Ngumo said the people were found breaking public health rules meant to curb the spread of the virus. “About 168 persons were wearing face masks below the chin and 55 were found the previous night violating the curfew hours,” he said. The PSVs had carried excess passengers and no hand sanitiser while the bars had failed to observe the operating hours and social distancing among other rules. Ngumo spoke on Thursday at Kwale headquarters in Matuga. The public health and county operating licenses of the bars were revoked. The move by the county officials and security agencies follows the surge in the number of cases in Kenya.p On Thursday the virus caseload hit 66, 723 after 919 people tested positive and 23 succumbed to the disease, bringing the total number of deaths 1, 203. Ngumo said they will keep cracking down on those  who risk other people’s lives. He said enforcement will be applied in Kwale in a 24-hour operation. “We won’t relent on this fight and more officers will be deployed to the grassroots to impose the directives as ordered by the resident and the Ministry of Health,” he said. He said irresponsible locals won’t be tolerated, saying stern action will be taken against anyone found violating the directives. The administrator warned PSVs flouting the Covid-19 rules that they would be grounded and have their licenses terminated. At the same time, he urged the Msambweni candidates campaigning ahead of the December 15 by-election to strictly stick to town hall meetings. Edited by Henry Makori
