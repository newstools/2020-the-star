Complaints from members of the public about robbers who have been terrorising Kenyans along Uhuru-Highway in Nairobi have yielded fruit. Detectives from the DCI carried out an operation on Tuesday, and arrested two suspects. A pistol with five rounds of ammunition, military knife, mobile phone, several sim cards and cash in different currencies were recovered. The two tried to escape and hastily boarded a public service vehicle when they noticed that they were being pursued. The vehicle was however intercepted and the suspects who had been reported to be attacking motorists and other road users were arrested. The two who are believed to be 16 and 17 years remain in custody awaiting arraignment. One motorist had complained that some street families are armed, attacking drivers in broad daylight as they rake advantage of traffic jams. The motorist had also pleaded with Nairobi Metropolitan Service General Mohammed Badi to intervene. Last month, police arrested a 34-year-old man in connection with an armed robbery incident that occurred atÂ Lavington West Estate Phase II. The suspect, who was alleged to be armed with pistols in the company of his colleagues, accosted the victim as she parked her car at her residence. Acting on forensic leads, detectives ambushed the suspect at his hideout early in the morning, recovering a number of mobile phones.
