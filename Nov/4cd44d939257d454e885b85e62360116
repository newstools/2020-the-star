@robertomollo3 A family in Kachien-Kaluoch village in Karachuonyo constituency, Homa Bay county, is living in fear after two sons went missing three weeks ago. The family of John Okoth is looking for the two boys: Felix Ochieng’, 14, and his brother Evans Otieno, 12. They are learners at Kaluoch Primary School. Ochieng is a KCPE candidate while Otieno is a Standard 5 learner. Okoth on Friday said his sons went missing on October 16. They had remained behind at home to study as the rest of the family went to church. “We haven’t seen them to date ,” Okoth said. It is reported that the children were seen talking to a man who had a bottle with ash in his hands before they began following him. “A resident told me the man who talked to the children identified himself with one name as Petro and hails from Kabondo Kasipul. I have tried to trace Petro but in vain,” Okoth said. He reported the matter to Oyugis police station under OB number 13/22/10/2020. He appealed to security officials to help him trace his children. “The family is troubled due to the incident. Everybody is in under pain.” Kachien North chief Jacob Adienge said the family had reported the matter to him. “I advised the family to report to police,” Adienge said. The administrator urged anybody who sees the children to report to authorities or the nearest police station.
