World half marathon champion Peres Jepchirchir has made the final shortlist for 2020 World Athletics female athlete of the year. Jepchirchir will be seeking to become the first Kenyan female athlete to win the coveted award since its inception. She had a stellar season this year, winning the world half marathon title and breaking the women's-only world half marathon record twice (1:05:34 and 1:05:16). Jepchirchir lines up against an equally successful quartet including Letesenbet Gidey of Ethiopia, double world champion Hassan Sifan of the Netherlands, Jamaican sprint queen Elaine Thompson and Venezuela's Yulimar Rojas. Gidey set a world record of 14:06.62 over 5,000m and was placed second in the 5,000m at the Wanda Diamond League meeting in Monaco. Hassan set a world record of 18,930m in the one hour run and set a European record of 29:36.67 over 10,000m, the fourth-fastest performance in history. Thompson makes the cut after going undefeated in seven 100m races and running a world-leading time of 10.85 over the distance. Rojas is the final name on the shortlist after going undefeated in four triple jump competitions indoors and outdoors and broke the world indoor triple jump record with a 15.43m hop. The male and female World Athletes of the Year will be announced virtually at the World Athletics Awards 2020 on December 5 live on the World Athletics YouTube channel, Facebook page and via Twitter.
