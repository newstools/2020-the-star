Accountants body, ICPAK, Nyanza region officials want more efforts put to help address the plight of the girl in the face of Covid-19. Regional chairperson Maureen Achai said little is being done to alleviate the suffering of teenage girls. “Many of these girls, especially in the villages and orphanages, are deprived of basic necessities like sanitary towels making them susceptible to early pregnancies,” Achai said. She spoke of a worrying spike in defilement cases in the country and urged security agencies to deal firmly with the perpetrators to stem the vice. "We believe there should be no compromise on this. As society, we must rise up to defend them from the vulnerabilities that would make them drop from schools," she said. She, however, noted that additional efforts should also be put in helping the boy as well. " If we leave them behind, then the chances of ending these vices among our adolescents will be slim," she said. She spoke at Hope Kindness Christian School at Kosele in Homa Bay on Friday where she led the group members in donating to the less fortunate. Food worth Sh100,000 was handed to the institution. The school is one of the orphanages in the region affected in funding due to Covid-19 pandemic. School head teacher Josephine Achiwa thanked the accountants for the selfless gesture.
