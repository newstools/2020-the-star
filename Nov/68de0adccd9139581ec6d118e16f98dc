Kwale residents have been urged to engage in agricultural activities to reduce overreliance on food aid. Ahadi Kenya CEO Stanley Kamau said relying on frequent assistance contributes to laziness, poverty and hunger. “Depending on relief food from donors and government won’t help you but developing your survival mechanisms like farming can boost food security,” he said. He spoke on Saturday in Mbuguni, Matuga, while distributing food to 300 needy families. The first batch of 500 families from Golini and Tsimba were given food at Kwale Baraza park on Friday. The food programme was sponsored by First Lady Margaret Kenyatta, Ahadi Kenya and Lotto Foundation. Kamau said coming up with sustainable agricultural programmes will help end hunger and improve the livelihoods of the community through agribusiness. “Rather than being given money and small food that does not last a week, why can’t you seek guidance on how to make your farms productive?"  Kamau asked. He said counties should provide a conducive environment for farming and come up with good policies to boost agriculture. Kamau discouraged people against using Covid-19 as an excuse not to work hard in war on poverty. Agriculture PS Hamadi Boga last week challenged residents to engage in active farming to enhance food security and prosperity. Boga said agriculture is the only way to make counties resilient to food shortages and achieve massive development.
