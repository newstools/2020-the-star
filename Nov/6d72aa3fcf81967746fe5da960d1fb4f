Tanasha Donna and her former manager Castro have been making headlines after fans realised they are no longer working together. Jamal Gaddafi took over. Tanasha then introduced another man, Ciza Obare, as her new manager, and fans were curious to know what was happening. In an Instagram Live session, Tanasha said the rumors going around weren’t true. Talking about Castro, who’s been managing her, she said the management relationship between them wasn't working. "We concluded and it was a mutual understanding between us two. He was not really fit to manage me, something he acknowledged himself," she said. "He said he’s more into business development." Tanasha added there were some communication problems between them here and there, but neither of them was bad and it ended amicably.
