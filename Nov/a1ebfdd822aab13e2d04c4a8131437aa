Actress Patricia Kihoro says she misses being fearless and the unapologetic girl she was years ago. Sharing a throwback photo on Instagram of old days when she was a singer, Patricia said so much has changed 11 years later. "This picture was taken back in 2009 by the genius @jimchuchu for a campaign. I think about this Patricia a lot. I was so fearless and unapologetic and so sure of my place in this world," she wrote. "So many hurts, disappointments, failures, hard truths, traumas and painful statements and actions have changed how I see myself. There have been lots of wins, too, no doubt, but there’s a heaviness that settled inside me that seems almost like an organ. Permanent." In as much as there were downs, Patricia said she does not regret anything. "I don’t regret for a minute everything it’s taken me to get here, but I do think about this chick often. She was just so... fire!" In the 11 years, Patricia also left the music scene, where she made her name. A few weeks ago, she said she quit music after a producer sexually assaulted her.
