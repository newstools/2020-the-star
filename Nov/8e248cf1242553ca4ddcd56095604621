The ongoing work by the Nairobi Metropolitan Services in the city is commendable. It epitomises the hallmark of good service delivery to taxpayers. However, as the NMS continues to implement the various projects, there is a dire need to address the water shortage nightmare in Lang’ata. Sadly, it is alleged that the acute water shortage in the area is “man-made” and is designed to benefit certain cartels. Just to paint a picture of the situation on the ground, if you visit most residential estates in Lang’ata, you will be forgiven to mistake them for yards belonging to manufacturers of plastic water storage tanks because of the many tanks dotting the compounds. The water shortage pain has forced every household to buy a tank and a water pump to help in storing water. And the water tanks are not to primarily store water from the Nairobi Water company. That supply hardly comes by. Ninety per cent of the water that finds its way into these tanks is from the countless vendors who supply the precious commodity in bowsers. Arguably, due to the perennial water shortage in the estate, it is highly likely water bowsers that roam in the estates are more than the matatus that ply the route. While there is some level of guarantee that the water supplied by Nairobi Water is treated hence safe for household use, the same cannot be said of thousands of litres of water supplied by water vendors to thousands of desperate Lang’ata residents. Chances of a looming health crisis can, therefore, not be overruled. Major General Mohamed Badi, going by the diligence and commitment you have demonstrated in your work, you are the only thread of hope Lang’ata residents are clinging on. Please come to our rescue and dismantle the cartel responsible for this cosmetic water shortage in Lang'ata and other estates within NMS. Kimani Wairimu, Lang’ata
