A Kibera court has allowed detectives to hold a man suspected to have sexually assaulted his three-day-old daughter and his three-year-old stepson. The incident is said to have occurred at the man’s home at Makina in Kibera within Nairobi county. The order was granted by Kibera chief magistrate Joyce Gandani after an application by a detective from Kilimani police station who is investigating the matter. The officer told court that he wanted five days to conclude investigations, including a post-rape report and visiting the scene. The officer told court that the suspect was arrested on Tuesday after a nurse raised the issue. “The suspect was arrested at the Nairobi Women’s Hospital on Tuesday after a nurse raised the alarm immediately one of the children identified him as the perpetrator,” the detective said. The officer told court that the suspect is said to have accompanied his wife as she took the children for treatment after he denied committing the acts inside their home as the mother of the children was washing outside. "The victims’ mother noticed that her son had swollen mouth and difficulties sitting down while the baby had bruises on her private parts," the officer said. Gandani directed that the suspect be detained at Kilimani police station. Edited by Henry Makori
