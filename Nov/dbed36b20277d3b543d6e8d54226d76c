Kisumu Governor Anyang' Nyong'o on Monday unveiled Ahero town in a move aimed at unlocking its economic potential. The town will now be in a position to compete for various urban financing for towns, municipalities and cities. Ahero town sits on a major highway to Nairobi, Isebania, Nyamira, Kisii and Homa Bay. It also has all that a town needs – a subcounty hospital, a court, a police station, schools, a market and other social amenities. It has seen tremendous economic growth, especially in housing. Nyong'o said Ahero is a landmark town with interesting features and a booming economy. It is a farming town surrounded by lush green rice fields and the great Nyando agricultural belt teeming with sugar cane plantations. “Ahero becomes the second town we are unveiling after Maseno. We had earmarked five urban centres to be upgraded to towns. Others in the queue are Muhoroni, Katito and Kombewa,” he said. Nyong'o said Ahero alongside other towns, will have to receive a dedicated budget to address infrastructural issues, among them roads, drainage, street lighting and solid waste management systems. “To bring this closer home, my government in this year’s budget has earmarked about 400 metres of road network within Ahero town for upgrading to paving blocks standard alongside drainage improvement works. Street lights will also be installed stretching over a kilometre.” Nyong'o said the new town will have a dedicated governance system made up of a management committee and an administrator who will look into the day-to-day activities of the town. He said the growth of satellite towns will not only bring services closer to the people, but also create economic nodes that will create opportunities for thousands of people. This will also serve to reduce pressure on the City of Kisumu.
