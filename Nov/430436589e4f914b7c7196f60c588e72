Tanzanian singer Ben Pol has been called out by fans after he polished his nails. He posted a photo of himself working on a laptop with his fingernails painted blue, black, green, yellow and orange, captioning it, "Working from home." This comes a few weeks after Ben Pol reportedly faked conversion to Islam. He shared a photo of himself in a kanzu, accompanied by a certificate to prove his conversion. However, it emerged it was a publicity stunt to promote new music. He has not said whether he indeed converted. One of his followers wrote, "The Islam religion says it is sinful for a man to act like a woman." Another follower Jorin wrote, "Since you left you have gone mad, or is it a curse?"
