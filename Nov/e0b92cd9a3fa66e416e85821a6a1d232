Kenya top ranked junior player Angela Okutoyi has earned a scholarship to the ITF high-performance tennis centre in Casablanca, Morocco. Okutoyi is expected to leave the country later this month for North Africa country. The high-performance centre will give her an opportunity to play in some of the prestigious junior tournaments on the continent as well as the junior grand slam tourneys like the Wimbledon, French Open , US Open and Australian open. An elated Okutoyi said move was a big opportunity for her to take her career to the next level. " It's a massive opportunity for me to train and play with some of the best players on the continent and the opportunities which will come are good for my career growth and my exposure,” noted Okutoyi. Okutoyi has been on a steady rise in the past two seasons and according to her coach Francis Rogoi, the best is yet to come. "She is headed in the right direction and I believe with all the coach and exposure she is getting,sky is the limit for her,"added Rogoi. Okutoyi said her target next year is to move up the rankings and be in the top 100. Okutoyi returned to action a fortnight ago during an exhibition doubles match alongside Ibrahim Kibet but lost to Ismael Changawa and Rosehilda Asumwa 7-5, 6-3.  In 2018, she became the youngest player to win the Kenya Open then aged 14 after upsetting experienced three-time former champion Shufaa Changawa 6-1, 7-6 at Nairobi Club. In the same year, she won the Africa Junior Championship on Clay Court (AJCCC) Under 14 singles in Algeria before following it up with singles and doubles triumph at the ITF East African Under 18 Junior Circuit, ITF Nairobi Junior Open and Eastern Africa Zonal Championships Under-16 last year.
