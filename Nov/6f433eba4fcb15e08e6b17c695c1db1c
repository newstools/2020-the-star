WCB's signee Rayvanny is set to open his record label. This was confirmed by his boss Diamond Platinumz in an interview with Wasafi TV. Diamond said Rayvanny will soon be launching his record label, which according to him will be the biggest in Tanzania. "I was looking at his studios and told him, 'Rayvanny, this studio is big.' The day he will post it, as we speak it will be the number one best studio in the country," he said. Asked whether his signees have the privilege to start their side projects, Diamond was permissive. "Anyone under the Wasafi record label is allowed to start their projects if they want to," he said. He advised artistes to try and come up with long-term investments that will secure their future, even after they are done doing music.
