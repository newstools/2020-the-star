Vihiga Governor Wilber Ottichilo has pledged to engage the entire county leadership to sensitise residents on the BBI document. He said he would work with all leaders, including MPs and senators. The county chief said there is a need to ensure residents understand the issues in the document before collecting their signatures. Governor Ottichilo said on Friday his team expects to collect 100,000 signatures. “We have been given five days to coordinate signature collection at the county level,” he said. “Vihiga county has various political parties and I will be engaging them one-on-one to ensure we achieve this as a county and not a party,” Ottichilo said. President Uhuru Kenyatta and his handshake partner Raila Odinga launched the signature collection on Wednesday. The one million signatures are a prerequisite to the amendment of the Constitution. The BBI secretariat is racing against time to have the signatures by Wednesday next week. According to the action plan, the secretariat is expected to submit the signatures and the Constitution (Amendment) Bill 2020 to the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission on December 9 for verification.
