A magistrates court has issued orders stopping the two wives of the late Matungu MP Justus Murunga from conducting the burial. Milimani Magistrate Agnes Makau on Thursday issued the order and directed the alleged lover Agnes Wangui, to serve the two wives and Lee Funeral home with her papers ahead of the hearing date on 26 November. Wangui through lawyer Danstan Omari, wanted the two widows of Murunga - Christabel and Grace and Lee Funeral Home stopped from conducting the burial. Also sought is an order for the collection of DNA samples from the deceased and Wangui's children to ascertain their paternity. She also wants the remains of the deceased at Lee to be preserved until DNA samples have been collected in the presence of licensed pathologists appointed by both parties. Wangui, in an affidavit, says her two children are biological children of the deceased. Wangui said she was apprehensive that there may be concerted efforts by the two wives to lock her and her children out of the burial arrangements and the actual burial. "I have known Murunga for seven years. Our first encounter was in 2013 when he was a supervisor at Embakasi ranching, while I was a businesswoman engaged in vendition of beverages and snacks within Sewerage area, Ruai," she said. Agnes says shortly after they began a romantic relationship and out of the said union they were blessed with their first child and Murunga rented a house for her in Ruai. The relationship according to the court documents started hitting rock bottom in 2017 when Murunga won the Matungu Parliamentary seat.
