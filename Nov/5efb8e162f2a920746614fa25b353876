Gospel singer Ruth Matete says she would have lost her child or even died. In a long post on Facebook, Ruth, who welcomed her daughter Toluwa in October, said she was diagnosed with preeclampsia, which is characterised by high blood pressure. Ruth says after some check-ups with her doctors, they said the condition was risky enough to kill the mother plus the child if not taken care of. "Preeclampsia is a potentially dangerous pregnancy complication characterised by high blood pressure," she wrote. "Preeclampsia usually begins after 20 weeks of pregnancy in a woman whose blood pressure had been normal. It can lead to serious, even fatal, complications for both mother and baby." Following these results, she had to be admitted for a day so that monitoring could be done. One day after she left the hospital, the pressure went up again but unlike the previous time, this time was painful. Her belly had started being hard and she couldn't feel her baby moving. "My friend rushed me to the hospital and on reaching there, the doctor said we had to go in for an emergency CS, otherwise I risked losing my child and my life," she said. "But the pain I was having that day was really bad. Don't even talk about the swelling." She finally held her baby in her hands three weeks before the expected time. "I went in for the emergency CS and on October 19 at 1.2 pm, my child was here. Oh, Lord! The feeling is indescribable. My baby came at 35 weeks. "Amazingly, she didn't go to NICU or even the incubator. I just heard the doctors saying she's good. Scored 10/10." She thanked all the women who have been walking with her through the tough journey. "Those who came to my inbox asking how I was doing and if I needed anything," she wrote. "I mean, social media is not all bad. I decided to focus on the good that comes with it."
