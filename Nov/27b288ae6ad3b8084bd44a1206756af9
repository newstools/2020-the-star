South African singer Lebo M says he is excited about his reality show 'Coming Home'. Lebo is the distinctive voice behind The Lion King's 'Nants’ Ingonyama' and the first voice you hear when the animated classic opens. Speaking to Word Is, Lebo said, 'Coming Home' is a 10-part show that will give fans a front-row seat to his career as he creates new music. It will also turn the spotlight onto his biggest dream: bringing his family together. "It's all about inspiring families to recuperate from the trauma of the coronavirus pandemic," he said. "I look forward to having a conversation of the whole journey about family and society, but I am much more excited about the journey and the issues unfolding and look forward to reacting to them." Adding, "I’m re-entering a phase in my life as a family man. Family has always been the basis under which I function better." The trailer starts, like The Lion King, with Lebo M’s distinctive voice singing, 'Nants’ Ingonyama', from The Circle Of Life, off Hans Zimmer’s Oscar-winning soundtrack to the animated classic. Showmax has just released the first trailer for 'Coming Home'. The next Showmax Original reality series will be launching on December 2.
