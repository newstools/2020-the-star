Sossion said that its check-off system was withdrawn by the commission during the months of July, August, and December 2019 and for the rest of the months. He said that the commission has been offloading Knut members massively, contrary to the provision of Section 48 of the Labour Relations Act. Sossion said that the intention of offloading members is to create wrangles in the union, stopping its operations including meetings, and training. “…messaging from TSC urging Knut leaders to change its leadership in the office of the secretary-general for the checkoff to be reinstated.” According to the union, 153,159 members have been dropped in less than 18 months. Currently, the union has 34,312. Sossion has also complained that: Sossion has asked the Labour CS to intervene and address the matters which are affecting its operations. Chelugui has seven days to act from the day when the letter was addressed to him, failure to which, the union will communicate the next action.
