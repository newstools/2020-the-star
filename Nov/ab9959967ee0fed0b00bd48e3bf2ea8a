National Super League side, Shabana FC are shopping for an alternative home ground following ongoing works at Gusii Stadium. A contractor has started laying tartan track on the running track and the works will be completed by mid-February next year, according to a source at the Kisii County Government. Yesterday, Shabana vice-chairman Nyandoro Kambi said the management has not settled on any particular alternative home ground. “We are thinking of temporarily moving our home matches to Awendo Stadium, Kericho Green Stadium or Narok Stadium. We shall make a final decision when the management committee meets,” Kambi added. He added: “It is a big blow to us as a club but we welcome the improvement of the facility. We are looking forward to returning home after the contractor completes the tartan works.” Kambi added that they are determined to return to the top tier league next season. “We have young and exciting players. I’m confident that this is our turn to qualify to the Kenya Premier League,” added the Nairobi-based advocate. At the same time, the club has parted ways with captain Wycliffe Nyangechi and midfielder Peter Ogechi. They signed a two-year contract with Sony which is currently being handled by veteran coach John Kamau. Nyangechi and Ogechi are among 13 players who left the former giants ahead of next season. The club has also signed 16 players, according to team manager Jared Sani. “I’m happy with the new players we have recruited. Most of them are young but we also have gone for some experienced players,” Sani added. Shabana are expected to unveil a head coach and goal keeping coach next week. The team is currently training at Cardinal Otunga High School, Mosocho under interim coach Vincent Nyaberi. Shabana are expected to open their campaign against Chemelil Sugar at Chemelil Sports Complex on November 28. However, the tie is in doubt after Chemelil was disbanded by the management. Ends
