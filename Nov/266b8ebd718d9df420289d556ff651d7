A magistrate's court has issued a warrant of arrest against one of the persons charged in a Sh500 million National Hospital Insurance Fund case. Senior principal magistrate Victor Wakumile said the warrant against David Muli will be effected by an officer from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations. The case was to proceed on Wednesday with one witness present in court but the magistrate adjourned it owing to the absence of Muli. The matter has never proceeded since 2018 when the accused persons were first arraigned. The Director of Public Prosecutions dropped charges against Danson Muchemi and Robert Muna of Webtribe Limited. Muchemi said they were willing to cooperate with the DPP as witnesses. The defense led by Okweh Achiando and Katwa Kigen told the court that since the charges against Muchemi and Muna were dropped, the prosecution should supply them with their witness statements and amend the charge sheet. Achiando also took issue with the setup of the court. The case was proceeding in the open but with an iron roof.  Achiando urged the court to consider adding chairs since the number of accused persons in the case is over ten and they have their lawyers. “We need to observe health protocols at all times. We are not immune to this disease ravaging the whole world. Let’s consider social distancing of this place and adding more chairs,” he said Magistrate Wakumile adjourned the matter to November 30 when the case is expected to commence. He also directed the state to supply the defense with the witness statements. Edited by Henry Makori
