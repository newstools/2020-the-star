BBI joint Secretary Paul Mwangi has dismissed reports by Major John Seii that he was duped into signing the BBI report. Major John Seii, a member of the 14-member BBI task force, claimed on Thursday that some of the sweeping proposals were totally alien because they never featured in their initial deliberations. Seii said the addition of 70 more constituencies was inserted without their knowledge, in addition to other major changes - hardly 'tweaks'. But Mwangi through a series of tweets on Friday disputed the claims. "Of concern though is why Major Seii, a respected elder, is lying. Ever since 2018, he has said he is under pressure," he said. "Severally, he asked the secretariat for security. Even when we were signing he told everyone he is under pressure. Is Major Seii okay ?" Mwangi said during the BBI retreats , the retired general kept on taking pictures of the proposal. "More than two times during BBI retreats, Major Seii was caught secretly photographing presentations on the projector screen," Mwangi claimed. "When asked he claimed he had bad eye sight and wanted to take a closer look. Members beseeched him to stop. Not surprised how its eventually playing out." He said that all the issues Major Seii is trying to disown were in the first report. "Prime Minister is in first report. Saving 290 constituencies and instead adding the seats was in too. He doesn't deny signing both reports. But says he, a senior military man, signed without reading. Like , really?" he posed. Seii's claims lifted the lid on the intrigues that marred the writing of the report. President Uhuru Kenyatta has publicly stated that he allowed Deputy President William Ruto to nominate three members of the Yusuf Haji-led panel. On Monday, Uhuru told pro-BBI troops in Naivasha that Ruto was dishonest in his objections to the report because he was part of the process from its inception. Seii is said to be among the three elders Ruto picked.
