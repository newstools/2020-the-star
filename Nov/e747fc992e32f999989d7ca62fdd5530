Article 225 of the Constitution states that at least 20 per cent of the registered voters in each of at least half of the counties vote in the referendum. This is where I foresee a challenge because of voter apathy. For the first time in our history, we have a political process with no campaigns before the vote. Campaigns for or against the proposed referendum would rally people to turn out in large numbers. Town hall meetings may not be that attractive with the fear of contracting Covid-19 engulfing the nation. Close to three million Kenyans have lost their jobs or businesses due to the Covid-19 pandemic and it will take a miracle to get them to go to polling stations. Kenyans are struggling to put food on the table and if they see nothing beneficial to them in the issues presented in the referendum, they will certainly opt to go about their daily hustles. The Kenyan we have now is not the Kenyan of yesteryears who could be dictated to. The proposals contained in the Constitution (Amendment) Bill, 2020, have far-reaching implications on our lives and we must take time to read it before voting. The Bill is proposing expansion of Parliament, which will definitely have an impact on the wage bill. In fact, the National Treasury and Parliament should do a cost analysis of what the new changes will mean to taxpayers so Kenyans make an informed decision. Some of the proposals are good, and the drafters have factored the reservations some of us had. However, we should not have rushed this process; we should have allowed Kenyans to make suggestions. That way, we would have ended up with an almost perfect bill that addresses most of Kenya's concerns. Some of the clauses in the Bill are just but a hanging rope that if passed as they are, will come back to haunt us someday. The Mumias East MP spoke to the Star
