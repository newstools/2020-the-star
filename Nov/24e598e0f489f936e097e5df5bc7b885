Narc-Kenya party leader Martha Karua has sent auctioneers to recover Sh6.5 million from Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria as ordered by the court in 2017. Kuria had been ordered to pay Karua Sh6.5 million for defamation. The High Court made the ruling in a matter where Kuria claimed the Narc-K leader procured witnesses to fix Deputy President William Ruto during his ICC case. In a letter seen by the Star on Thursday, Karua sent auctioneers to go after sofa sets, a home theatre, microwave among other items. Other items to be auctioned from Kuria are a coffee table, television stand, two motor vehicles - a Honda and Land Cruiser - refrigerator and carpet. "This is to command you to sell by auction after giving 15 days prior notice by afixing the same in the court house," the court documents read. In 2017, Karua demanded Sh20 million from the MP in damages for defamation. She told the court in September that despite demanding an unconditional apology from Kuria, he went ahead and repeated the same claims at Parliament Buildings. "The claims are scandalous, malicious, unwarranted and lowered my dignity among right thinking members of the society,‚Äù she said. The MP did not defend the suit.
