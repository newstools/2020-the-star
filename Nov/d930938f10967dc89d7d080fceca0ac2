The Busia County Interfaith Council has called for shelving of BBI and a referendum and instead focus be shifted to fighting the Covid-19 pandemic. Council chairman Bishop John Okuke said a section of leaders have come out to paralyse government efforts to combat the coronavirus and instead are giving BBI top priority. He is bishop of the Katakwa ACK diocese. Okuke spoke to reporters after consultations last Thursday at St Nicholas Catholic Church in Port Victoria, Bunyala, Budalang'i constituency. "I appeal to President Uhuru Kenyatta to put aside the Building Bridges Initiative and deal with the coronavirus pandemic that has claimed more than a thousand lives," he said. He also urged the President not to be misled by leaders who, he said, want to distract him from dealing with the pandemic. He later donated relief food to flood victims camping at Mundere Primary School in Bunyala North. Fr Chris Barasa, secretary of the Interfaith Council, urged residents of Busia and Kenya at large to bury their dead swiftly. He represents St Cajetan's Sirimba Catholic parish. "This outdated culture of keeping the dead for several days before burial should be discarded, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic," he said. Major Robert Okeka of the Salvation Army church urged the government to ensure there are no crowds at market places and at burial ceremonies to prevent spread of the virus. (Edited by V. Graham)
