Division One side Solasa Queens and newly promoted Division Two side University of Eldoret have stepped up their preparations ahead of the 2020/2021 season. The two teams have recruited heavily as they seek to ensure they deliver at the end of the season and secure a promotion to Kenya Women Premier League (KWPL) and Division One respectively. Solasa, who came from a goal down to beat UOE, to win the 2020 edition of Solasa annual football tournament, failed to secure the promotion to KWPL last season and they are hoping to do it this time round. Queens head coach Godfrey Ochieng said the club has signed good players in a bid to gain promotion to KWPL next season. “We are prepared for the fixtures and the girls are ready for the league. The win against UOE was good motivation ahead of the league," said Ochieng. He said he intends to recruit players  who are already tested and ready to deliver. “We have to strengthen our defence as well as midfield and we need about 20 players,” said Ochieng. UOE coach Joseph Pilishi said his target is to play at KWPL after two seasons. Pilishi has had experience in KWPL after serving as coach for Eldoret Falcons. “Our target is to play in the KWPL because my  players are ripe for the top league. As a club, we have been preparing for the new season and we can't wait to know our opponents when fixtures are released,” said Pilishi.
