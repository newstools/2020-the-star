Vihiga job hunters have been warned against giving bribes to get employment in the county government. Vihiga public service board chairman Frankline Esipila said those who get themselves into that trap should not go complaining to his team. "We won’t be part of your problem. Anyone who will land into that trap within or outside the county will carry his/her own cross," he warned. Esipila said the board does not collect money to recruit county workers. He was speaking to the press at Roddy's hotel in Emuhaya subcounty. His warning comes after some board members raised concerns that some individuals are impersonating CPSB officials to defraud jobseekers. “We only recruit people based on their professionalism, experience and their ability to deliver,” Esipila said. “I don’t understand why people keep on falling into these useless traps of conmanship when they are well-informed.” The CPSB chair said the county public service board advertisements clearly state that no one should pay money to get a job.
