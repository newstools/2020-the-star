Ford Kenya will not hold a National Delegates Conference on November 21 at the Bomas of Kenya in Nairobi, party leader Moses Wetang'ula has said. However, a faction led by Kanduyi MP Wafula Wamunyinyi, secretary general Eseli Simiyu and Bungoma Governor Wycliffe Wangamati has said the meeting will continue as planned. The Wamunyinyi group has been meeting party delegates from across the country, urging them to attend the event. But speaking at Nyange village in Mbakalo ward, Tongaren constituency, on Saturday, Wetang'ula claimed that the meeting was illegal and invalid. "The purported planned Ford Kenya NDC meeting at Bomas of Kenya won't take place, and those who have been invited will be shocked," the Bungoma senator said. "The other faction has been sent to attack me. They are being used by outside forces to create cracks in the party, but they won't succeed. The law recognises me as the genuine party leader". On Monday, the management of the Bomas of Kenya said it had declined to host the meeting, citing Covid-19 protocols. However, Eseli said he had not received communication from Bomas declining to host the event. In Bungoma, Wetang'ula said he has survived many battles and it will be hard to kick him out of Ford Kenya. "When the late Vice President Kijana Wamalwa was in FK, he was despised and belittled by many people, but with determination, he rose to be the VP. Was it not his death, he would be the head of state," he said. Wetang'ula said other regions in the country rally behind their leaders, but in Western, the leaders fight each other. "Don't listen to a few disgruntled leaders. Ford Kenya is a national party, not a Bungoma party. The problem is in Bungoma not other regions," he said. On Building Bridges Initiative report, Wetang'ula called for a sober discussion, saying the views of all Kenyans should be listened to. "Let's amend the document before we pass it, all voices must be included in the report and some clauses changed," he said.
