A 43-year-old primary school teacher accused of sexually harassing pupils was on Friday arrested in Mwea, Kirinyaga county. He is set to be arraigned on Monday. Mwea West police boss Adan Alio Wario said the suspect was arrested after angry Standard 8 pupils from the school stormed a police station on Friday evening and demanded his arrest. They said he has been indecently touching their private parts. “They staged a demonstration within the police station complaining that the accused had formed a habit of caressing their private parts while in the staffroom and wanted to sleep with them,” Wario said. He said one of the victims screamed, arousing anger from the pupils who then headed straight to the police station and demanded his arrest. Wario said four girls and one boy recorded statements. He said police have launched investigations. Efforts to contact the head teacher for a comment were unsuccessful as he was not within the school premises. According to the pupils, the head teacher was last seen in the school two weeks ago. Parents who were called to pick their children up from the station at around 8pm demanded justice for their children. They said the accused teacher must be punished.
