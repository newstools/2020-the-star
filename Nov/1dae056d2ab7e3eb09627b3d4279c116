Police in Narok South Sub County are holding 10 women subjected to Female Genital Mutilation, for allegedly participating in the crime. The women, between 18 -25 years, were arrested at Chepnyaliliet village in Melelo ward of Narok County on Saturday. Area Deputy County Commissioner Felix Kisalu said that acting on tip-off, they received information that the women were being hidden a house and undergoing FGM. “We assembled a special team headed led by OCS of Melelo police station who surrounded them and arrest them all,” said Kisalu, who spoke the journalists at the hospital. Among those arrested is the owner of the house and the circumciser. He was accompanied by Anti-FGM board chairperson Agnes Pareiyo and Narok children officer Pilot Khaemba. The DCC said the victims were taken to Narok County Referral Hospital on Saturday for assessment and confirmed to have undergone the cut. They had fresh genital wounds. “Some of them are young, others are married with children and we are currently contacting age assessment to ascertain the real age,” said Kisalu. The administrator warned those abetting the FGM and hide perpetrators in the region that they face dire consequences. “We will not relent on the fight against the vice because this is a presidential directive to end the FGM and ensure that Kenya should be FGM-free by 2022,” he said. While praising the police for making the arrests, Pareiyo said that Kenyans should know that the vice have been outlawed by the constitution. “Ending FGM can only be achieved, if all the people agree to shun the vice and make every effort to end it,’ said Pareiyo.
