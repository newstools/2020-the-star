Kitui county's annual revenue allocation will nearly quadruple to Sh30 billion if the Building Bridges Initiative proposals are adopted, Governor Charity Ngilu has said. Ngilu on Sunday launched the collection of signatures for the BBI referendum at Mosa Trading Centre in Kitui South constituency. “If we support the BBI Bill and it sails through, here in Kitui as your governor I will get an annual allocation of Sh30 billion as opposed to the measly annual Sh8 billion we are currently receiving,” Ngilu said. The county chief said counties are the biggest beneficiaries of the initiative, which is spearheaded by President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga. Ngilu said Kitui has been able to initiate many life-saving projects with the  Sh8 billion and a boost to Sh30 billion would change the socio-economic landscape of the county for the better. “We are talking big money that will completely change the way we do things. There will be development projects in all corners of the county. Other economic empowerment opportunities will open up for the benefit of the locals,” she said. She urged Kitui residents to come out in their numbers to endorse the BBI process by appending of signatures to the Constitution Amendment Bill. While addressing Kitui professionals on Saturday, Ngilu wished that the county would be given more MPs through the BBI arrangement as residents had requested. The governor said it was not too late to have green grams included among Kenya's cash crops so farmers can earn more from it. She said the proposal should have been captured in the BBI Bill.
