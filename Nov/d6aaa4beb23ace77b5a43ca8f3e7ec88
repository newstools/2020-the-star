Cases of enforced human disappearances are on the rise at the Coast, a human rights group has said. Muhuri officials said at least eight cases have been reported between August and October. Rapid response officer Francis Auma said Mombasa and Kilifi have three cases each. Kwale has two. He said the Covid-19 pandemic had slightly reduced the cases, but the trend re-emerged after the relaxation of public health measures to curb the spread of the virus. “When corona started, the enforced and extrajudicial killings went down, but they have increased again,” he said. The most recent case in Kwale involves a 36-year-old man who on Thursday disappeared after allegedly being arrested by police officers in Msambweni. Kwale police have denied the allegations. A Probox drove by at 11am, and four armed men got out and bundled Haruni Kondo, a father of one, into the car and drove off. Kondo is a boda boda operator and repairs local shipping boats. Mother Mwanajuma Hassan Maneno said her son called his father informing the family of his arrest and half an hour later he couldn’t be traced. “He contacted us saying he was arrested for unknown reasons, but he was okay but some hours afterwards we couldn’t communicate, his phone kept on ringing and eventually switched off,” she said. Another case in Mombasa involved an 18-year-old man in Majengo who disappeared in September after saying he was going to see his wife's relatives in Mariakani. He never returned. His mother Rukia Abdul Ali said all she wants is her son back home.
