A total of 60 teams from Dagoretti South Constituency will participate in the JamboBet tournament starting on November 15 with the finals to be held on December 13. This was announced during the unveiling of the partnership between JamboBet and the Riruta Stadium Management Board in organising and running of the tournament within the constituency. The tournament’s main objective will be to socially empower the grassroots communities within constituency through sports, clean-ups and recycling programs, youth counselling on responsible gaming, substance abuse as well as feeding programs for the less fortunate. “Our aim is to replicate this initiative within Nairobi County by involving all the constituencies from the ward levels and in future run it in all the 47 counties,” said Victoria Ombogo, a representative from the brand. Winners of the tournament will walk away with Sh150,000, trickling to the second and third-placed teams who will receive ShSh100,000 and Ksh 75,000 respectively.
