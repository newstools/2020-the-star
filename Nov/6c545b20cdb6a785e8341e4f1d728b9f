The detectives from DCI carried out an operation on Tuesday evening in drug dens within the Kosovo bridge in Starehe, Nairobi. The police arrested the two suspects who were from the operation which saw the destruction of eight drug dens. Bloodstained knives, Cannabis Sativa, rounds of ammunition, pangas among other crude weapons were confiscated. The two are in lawful custody and will be arraigned on Wednesday. Also, the police are searching for other suspects who managed to escape. Last week, KRA intercepted concealed heroin and bhang that were being smuggled through an international courier service provider at JKIA. The heroin originated from Juba, South Sudan, and was destined to Cambodia whereas the bhang had originated from Kasese in Uganda and was destined to France. Both consignments were separately intercepted after they were detected while passing through the non-intrusive scanners. The heroin was concealed in the buttons of dresses in the consignment while the bhang was wrapped in a black polythene paper concealed in an inner pocket of a Kitenge cloth.
