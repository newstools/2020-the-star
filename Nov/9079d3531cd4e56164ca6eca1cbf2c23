A human rights group wanted two state bodies to give them the list of applicants with integrity issues before the August 2017 General Election. The High Court, however, on Tuesday dismissed an application by the group seeking to compel two state organs to provide the list of aspirants with integrity queries prior to the general election. Judge Weldon Korir said the case by the International Centre for Policy and Conflict lacked merit as the information it was seeking was already in the public domain by the time they filed the case. ICPC sought a list of aspirants with integrity queries forwarded by the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission to the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission. They wanted the particulars of each aspirant's integrity queries and why the aspirants were cleared. The judge said the documents produced in court by IEBC carried the information sought by the ICPC “The duty of a state organ or agency to publish and publicise information is owed to the Kenyan nation and not an individual. Once a state organ has publicised information, as was done by IEBC, its obligation is discharged,” Korir ruled. “In light of evidence placed before court, it’s clear that ICPC had no valid claim against EACC and IEBC,” he said.
