President Uhuru Kenyatta has raised concerns as the country has witnessed a surge in the number of coronavirus cases in the last 38 days since Covid-19 measures were eased. In his 13th address to the nation about the virus on Wednesday, the president said that the country's positivity rate has risen. He directed that all the bars and the restaurants be closed by 9pm, an hour before the new curfew starts. "All bars, restaurants, and other establishments open to the public must now close by 9pm." At the same time, the president said the curfew hours have been revised to start from 10pm to 4am, and will be observed up to January 3, 2021. Previously, the curfew was between 11pm and 4am. Reviewing restrictions in the hospitality sector, the president urged all operators of hotels, bars and restaurants to do all that is necessary to ensure that the set protocols have been adhered to. "Those who fail will have their establishments immediately shut down." Uhuru said the directives governing religious gatherings in the country at this time of the pandemic remain unchanged, but said those who fail to follow the set measures will be stopped from further gatherings. Uhuru noted that the occupancy of Covid-19 beds in the country has gone up by 140 per cent and that is just in the last 38 days of easing restrictions. "We had flattened the curve to below a five per cent positivity rate that is recommended by the WHO."  More to follow...
