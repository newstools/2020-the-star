The information circulating on social media that former Nairobi county secretary and Health CEC Dr Robert Ayisi is dead are false. Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko had on his Twitter announced that Ayisi had succumbed to the current Covid-19 disease. “It is with great sorrow and sadness that I announce the death of Dr. Robert Ayisi……. He will be remembered for his role in streamlining the health sector in Nairobi county. My deepest condolences to his family, relatives and friends,” read part of Sonko’s tweet. The tweet was however deleted. The same information was also announced by Lukoye Atwoli who said Ayisi’s death should now spark anger. But the Star’s fact-check desk established that Ayisi was not dead as claimed. A senior doctor at Mater hospital confirmed that Ayisi was admitted at the facility’s HDU. We also reached out to the governor through his communication team who confirmed that they had been given the wrong information. According to the communication team, the two staff members who had sent out the tweet had been sent on compulsory leave. The governor in retraction deleted the tweet and promised to issue an apology to the family effectively.
