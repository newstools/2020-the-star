DP William Ruto has continued to send mixed signals over his stand on Building Bridges Initiative. Ruto now says more consensus is needed to avoid contested vote. He earlier expressed satisfaction with the changes on amendment Bill. Pro-BBI MPs say there is no room for more changes. "Rush not to conclusions or pretense to prophecy.I've received overwhelming feedback from Kenyans. The fury of political merchants desperate to encash (Like they did Covid)," he said. He added:"A divisive referendum is shockingly evident.Possibility of consensus is their nightmare." Via twitter on Saturday, Ruto said he has a constitutional duty to assist his boss, the President. "We've made improvements to BBI post Bomas. Now working on Consensus for Kenyans to have real choices to decide/vote while avoiding yes/no, all/nothing division," he said. "We avoided lose-lose we can overcome win-lose to achieve Win-Win." Ruto will openly announce his stand on the proposed constitutional changes in the coming days. The Star can authoritatively report that Ruto has vowed not to give his political opponents a chance to push through a political contest in the referendum. This is the clearest indication yet on his plan for the BBI process whose main proponents are President Uhuru Kenyatta andÂ  ODM leader Raila Odinga. A non-contested referendum would not be good for those who would want to measure the depth of Ruto's support ahead of the 2022 presidential poll where he is seen as a frontrunner. Of key for Ruto is to "socialise the hustler nation" that there are things in the Bill that can be positive and progressive in the event his side takes a position to vote in favour during the referendum.
