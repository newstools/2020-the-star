President Uhuru Kenyatta has said Education CS Georege Magoha will announce new academic calendar in the next 14 days after a meeting with stakeholders. The President made the statement during his seventh State of The Nation Address on Thursday. He said the classes conducting in-person learning are closely being monitored to ensure safety of the learners and teachers amid rising cases of Covid-19. "My government is committed to its mandate to ensure that no child is left behind. This will ensure all children across the country access basic education," he said. "As a result, for the past two years, we have achieved our 100 per cent transition from primary to secondary schools." Uhuru said going forward, he has directed the Ministry of Education and Transport to ensure by January some 12,500 new classrooms and other school related infrastructure are established across the country to mitigate congestion. "Public day and boarding school infrastructure is currently over stretched. These challenges however real must not stop us from doing what is necessary but act as a motivation for us to work harder," Uhuru said.
