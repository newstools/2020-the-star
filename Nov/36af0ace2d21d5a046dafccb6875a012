Gospel singer Ali Mukwano has released the music video to his latest single 'Watakusema' off his new album known by the same name. "This song is meant to give hope and encouragement to my listeners. That one should never stop doing good even if they do not get a thank you, appreciation or enough recognition, " he said in a statement. "The theme was carefully chosen because of the season in which the whole world is in. The coronavirus pandemic has caused a lot of pain and loss; death, loss of livelihoods and families breaking up." Ali was born into a Muslim family and raised as such, but he changed religion at a gospel crusade. He resolved not to change his Muslim name as part of his  testimony. He rose to fame after winning the 'Exodus to Stardom' singing competition.
