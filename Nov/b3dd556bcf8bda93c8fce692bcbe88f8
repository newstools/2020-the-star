More than 50 celebrities will perform over the weekend at the Jenga Jirani festival, a virtual charity event raising funds to help communities hurt by the Covid -19 pandemic. Organisers Jonathan Jackson Foundation and Kubamba Krew have lined up top artistes, including Nyashiski, Khaligraph, Samidoh, Eric Wainaina, Mercy Masika, Juliani and Eric Omondi. Speaking during the launch on Tuesday, the Jenga Jirani Festival chairman Jonathan Jackson said the effect of the pandemic is still being felt by many. "We are looking to support families both short and long-term, and we are calling on Kenyans to come together and help 'jenga a jirani'," he said. The non-profit organisation has in the last six months provided over 2 million meals (240 tons) since Covid-19 started to support the sick, elderly and vulnerable around Nairobi. The Initiative has reached out to the vulnerable in the society by distributing food, sanitary products and sharing care. Speaking about being part of this charity event, Nyashisnki said he is excited to take part in an initiative that is not just using you. "Someone will benefit somewhere. Most of our initiatives, we've lost trust in them and after a while, they disappear," he said. "We need the money as Kenyans. Even we the artistes have been affected during this pandemic because we make money through people congregating. I'm glad to be a part of this festival."
