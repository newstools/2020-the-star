The board of Equity Bank Kenya has appointed Timothy Waema as a non-executive director. The lender intends to ride on the digital wave and go branchless by 2022. The professor of Information Systems in the School of Computing and Informatics at the University of Nairobi brings on board his extensive ICT experience that spans more than 30 years. In a media statement, Equity Bank Group chairman Erastus Mwencha said he was delighted to have a highly accomplished executive join the bank as businesses grapple with the socioeconomic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. “Now more than ever, the bank needs to consider all risks associated with the pandemic, opportunities around digitisation and decisions on how to steer the financial institution,” Mwencha said. Speaking after his appointment, Waema said in the wake of the pandemic, ICT continues to be at the fore in facilitating new ways of doing business. “I am excited to be joining the bank at this time; and look forward to propelling the bank to even greater heights,” he said. Waema has consulted for numerous government ministries, private sector and NGOs in Kenya and other African countries on ICT and related issues. He has expertise in strategy development and execution, at both corporate and IT function levels, and has worked for many years at the intersection of information technology, strategy, policy and innovation. He sits in the Council of Strathmore University and is a member of the Advisory Board of the Carnegie Mellon University – Africa in Rwanda. Equity Bank holds the lion's share of the group’s business, contributing to more than 80 per cent of its profitability. Edited by Josephine M. Mayuya
