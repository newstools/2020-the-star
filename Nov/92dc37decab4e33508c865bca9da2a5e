The XYZ Show, an award-wining puppet satire series featuring Kenyan politicians and business leaders, has announced a comeback. Taking to social media, The XYZ Show announced that they are launching a new season in less than a week. "The drama is endless, from the BBI to Hustlers vs Dynasties, throw in a global pandemic and add the regular seasonings like corruption, and you have a recipe for political stew that is almost too hot to handle," they said in a statement. The XYZ Show is known to tackle current affairs in a way that makes us laugh but leaves us thinking, and opens our eyes to the truth behind the news. New episodes are expected to start airing on NTV this coming Sunday, November 8, at 7.30pm.
