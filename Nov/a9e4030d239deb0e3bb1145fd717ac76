The Institute of Certified Public Accountants of Kenya-Western branch wants funds allocated to the Judiciary in the Building Bridges Initiative. The call was made by group chairman Antony Opondo at Nangina Special School in Funyula constituency in Busia county on Sunday. He was addressing parents, students and various leaders. He said there was an urgent need to allocate at least two to three per cent of the national revenue to the Judiciary to ensure independence. Opondo said the government should utilise every opportunity at its disposal to seal all the loopholes being used unscrupulously before implementing the BBI proposals. Nangina Special School head teacher Hyorn Otieno said the institution does not have adequate classrooms or boarding facilities. "It is indeed a great challenge to curb the spread of Covid-19, considering that there is a shortage of classrooms and boarding facilities." Otieno appealed to well-wishers to emulate the gesture by the Institute of Certified Public Accountants and help children with special needs.
