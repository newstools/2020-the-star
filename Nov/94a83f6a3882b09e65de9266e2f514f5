Residents of Kiine in Ndia, Kirinyaga county, spent the better part of Wednesday rehabilitating the dilapidated Kuito-Mugumo road. They said the road had been a source of misery and they could no longer continue suffering. The young and old, mothers and fathers trooped to the site early morning armed with spades, hoes and machetes and ready for the daunting task. They did all they could but said that was just a stopgap measure and demanded the county government act swiftly to provide a lasting solution. They hope their action will provoke leaders to come to their rescue. Their complaints came several weeks after the county assembly passed a Sh6.7 billion supplementary budget. Under the proposals, infrastructure and roads were among the gainers having been allocated Sh323 million. "This road becomes impassable, especially during the rainy seasons. It becomes very difficult not only to walk on but also to transport our farm produce,” Lucy Njeri said. Nicholas Maina added, "Vehicles cannot access this area because of the poor state of this road, hence making life very unbearable, more so to the sick who can’t walk all the way to the main road." “We have suffered negligence for long and it has come a time when our local leaders need to be responsible. We elected them to serve us...especially now that unity exists between the county executive and the assembly,” John Muriuki said. They appealed to the county government to hasten the process of repairing the three-kilometre road, which stretches off the busy Sagana-Karatina road. “The work we got down to do is not a lasting solution but at least it will give us a temporary relief during this rainy season. All in all, we would like to urge the county government to move with speed in constructing this road,” Stephen Chomba said. Edited by F'Orieny
