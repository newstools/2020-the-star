A pastor on Sunday ordered scores of congregants out of the Seed of Abraham Christian Centre in Budalang'i constituency. The church's deputy director Bishop William Musumba said Covid-19 is real, hence every congregant must strictly adhere to health directives to combat the disease. The Ministry of Health has recommended face masks, social distancing and regular handwashing to stem the spread of the coronavirus. “We should not take [the] corona pandemic for granted. It is real and you are aware of how this deadly disease has claimed the lives of people globally, Kenya included. So you should stop gambling with your lives by ensuring that you wear face masks to protect you from the Covid-19," he said. Musumba ordered the ushers to be extra vigilant and ensure every congregant has a face mask before being allowed into the church every Sunday. Anybody who fails to comply should be denied entry. But the congregants were soon back in church after Nairobi-based doctor Kenneth Namunje and a local National Hospital Insurance Fund official bought face masks for them. Namunje told the congregants to obey the health guidelines to keep the virus at bay. He said that the number of people who have been infected is going up at an alarming level with each passing day. The doctor urged the congregants and the people of Bunyala subcounty and to eat balanced diets to improve immunity.
