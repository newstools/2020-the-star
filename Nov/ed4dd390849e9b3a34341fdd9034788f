@robertomollo3 Kanu Party leaders in Homa Bay have cautioned their supporters against people masquerading as officials to con them by demanding registration fees. They said some conmen were printing papers with the party’s logo with the aim of collecting cash money from those who want to register as members. They produce fake cards with the Kanu logo in local cybercafes. They charge from Sh100 and issue fake membership cards. Homa Bay Kanu party chairman Ken Okul, women leader Lillian Achieng’ and youth congress secretary Fred Omollo said they have received complaints from a number of the party supporters. Okul said the party had stopped the collection of cash for registration. Party registration is done online through a mobile phone. Speaking when they opened a new party office in Kendu Bay town, Karachuonyo constituency on Monday, Okul said the cartels were fake officials. “We have noted with concern cartels who extort money for registering people as members. Let all Kanu supporters in Homa Bay know that the party does not collect cash for membership registration,” Okul said. “The registration is done online and anybody who demands cash from supporters is a conman.” He asked authorities to pursue the conmen and prosecute them. He said aspirants eying various political seats have been asked to pay some cash to increase their chances of bagging the party ticket for the 2022 General Election. “Some aspirants have been told to raise a certain amount to influence their chances of securing the party ticket ahead of the next general election. Let the aspirants be careful,” Omollo said.  Edited by P.O
