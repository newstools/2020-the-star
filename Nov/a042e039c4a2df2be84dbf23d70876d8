Qatar Airways has announced plans to rebuild its network to cover 126 destinations across Africa, America, Asia-Pacific, Europe and Middle East by end of March 2021 as part of its COVID-19 recovery plan. The airline is currently operating 700 weekly flights to about 100 destinations worldwide. Qatar Airways is one of the few global airlines that never stopped operations at the height of the pandemic, with its operations not going below 30 destinations and 150 weekly flights. The announcement came as the airline marked 15 years of operation on the Nairobi-Doha route where it is currently operating two daily flights. “We are delighted to be celebrating this milestone. Over the past 15 years, Nairobi has demonstrated its importance as a business and leisure market becoming one of our most popular destinations with global travelers," Hendrik Du Preez, Vice President Commercial Africa, Qatar Airways said. The VP added that Qatar Airways is proud to have provided over a decade of quality international service for our valued travelers in Kenya, and are looking forward to serving this important gateway for many years to come. In October, the airline expanded its interline agreement with Kenya Airways to cover 43 destinations across the continent. “We will serve many cities with a strong schedule with daily or more frequencies,” Du Preez said. As part of the 15 years celebration, the airline will fit more than 100 of its aircrafts with super Wi-Fi to offer passengers free on-board Wi-Fi connectivity.
