Labourers in Mandera must study the market rates and only demand fair pay from contractors, Governor Ali Roba has said. Roba blamed the labourers for the high cost of construction work in the county. “Our labour rates in the construction industry are untenable. There is no way that this situation can be allowed to continue,” Roba said in Mandera on Saturday. He wondered why it cost so much to pay workers in Mandera when in Nairobi and Mombasa sites pay Sh1,000 and Sh600 for skilled and unskilled labourers respectively. “Mandera should not accept to pay more than Nairobi and Mombasa or other counties,” Roba said. The governor said he does not want to control the natural market forces of supply and demand but he has to protect the public against exploitation. “This habit of paying exorbitant rates is only working against us. If the situation is not corrected, it will be difficult to even put up a simple structure,” he said. Roba said that as long as there was peace and security in the region, many more construction workers will troop to Mandera. In his Mashujaa Day speech, Roba urged residents to start making bricks to bridge the building materials gap created by the decision to close quarries in the county. The government closed the quarries on May 4, 2018, following the killing of non-Somali miners by al Shabaab militants. Roba said residents need to think outside the box and look for a better and sustainable way of making building materials. “In order for us to resolve these repetitive challenges of quarry closures, the people of this county must adopt alternative building materials. I urge the public to resort to brick-making as an alternative to quarry stones,” Roba said in Mandera town. Roba further said that bricks are also environment-friendly. “This approach will also help save our hills from getting degraded. We now plead with the national government to continue enforcing the permanent closure of quarries in Mandera county,” he said.
