Four men who allegedly robbed a man of Sh80,000 in Eastleigh at gunpoint were charged with robbery with violence. Duncan Henry, Joseph Maina, Moses Ombale and Lawrance Okhungu were arraigned before Makadara chief magistrate Heston Nyagah. The court heard that on October 22 at Ushirika estate, while armed with a pistol the men robbed Habib Yusuf of Sh80,000 and wounded him. According to the prosecution, Yusuf was driving  his car in the company of his nephew Maliha Begum from Ladnan hospital within Eastleigh where he had gone for treatment. He received a call from his uncle Ahed Shamsudddin who instructed him to proceed to Chai Road to collect cash for him from a friend. Ahmed Darwesh gave them Sh80,000 and they drove towards Ushirika estate where they reside. On the way, a boda boda rider hit the right side of their car in what appeared to be an accident. And as Yusuf alighted to access the extent of damage, several boda boda riders surrounded him and they ordered him back into the car while one pointed a gun at him. They ordered him  to surrender the cash and his mobile phone. The accused denied the charges and were each freed on a bond of Sh500,000 each.
