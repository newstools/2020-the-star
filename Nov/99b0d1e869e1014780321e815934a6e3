Kenya Forest Service officers have caught three thieves transporting illegal timber concealed as cabbages. KFS county commander Rodgers Ruriga applauded the Limuru magistrates court for punishing the three. "We thank the court for helping us teach timber dealers a lesson. We will not stop, theÂ  ruling has given morale" he said. Ruriga said the KFS officers were busy conserving the forests for the sake of environment, while some individuals were busy trying all tactics to cheat the law enforcers. The owner of the lorry transporting the red cider posts was ordered to appear in the Limuru court to show cause why the vehicle should not be forfeited to the state. Limuru resident magistrate Fred Koome ruled so after punishing three men caught transporting 300 posts of cider worth Sh300,000. Driver Sirere Koma, Joseph Lanaiyon and Eliud Kamata were each ordered to pay Sh80,000 or serve six month in prison for transporting the logs without permit from KFS on November 18 at Ndiuni area along Nairobi Maai Mahiu road. They were also asked to pay an additional fine of Sh30,000 or serve six months in prison for transporting forest produce beyond the recommended time. State counsel Paula Rono told the magistrate that KFS rangers sergeant Daniel Saitabao and rangers Joseph Kahoto and Johnson Kitonga were patrolling Nairobi - Maai Mahiu road at 10pm, when they stopped stopped the Isuzu NPR lorry and discovered the posts concealed with cabbages. Koome said since the prosecution and the accused failed to reveal the owner of the lorry, the owner has 14 days to appear in court and show cause why it should not be forfeited. The magistrate ordered the posts and cabbages be forfeited, saying that the case will be mentioned on December 3, when the lorry owner should come, adding that if he or she fails, the lorry will be forfeited.
