Former Tahidi High actress Angel Waruinge, alias Miss Morgan, has advised young upcoming actors and actresses to follow passion rather than fame while joining the industry. Miss Morgan is known for her role as a no-nonsense deputy principal, which she played for 10 years. Speaking on a YouTube interview on 'Jikoni Times with Obayi', she said what most millennials want is fame. "I have been in the industry for over 20 years and when we started, we tarmacked so much," she said. "It was more of passion unlike today, people want to be famous. In terms of going digital, there are more opportunities than before as mainstream media did not give us what we deserved. My advice to young people is they be disciplined and also pursue education. Give it your all and do not allow fame to drive you but let passion do." She said although most people know her from her role in Tahidi High, she explored other opportunities, adding that due to her association with the show, many producers shied away from offering her other acting jobs. "Seven years after shooting the show and playing this no-nonsense character, I got a contract to do a show on M-Net called Jane and Abel, so I felt I needed a change," she said. Tahidi High producers allowed her to leave the show for two years before coming back and worked on the show for two years. When she went back to Tahidi High, her character, Miss Morgan, had been promoted to the school principal. "The producer had left. I felt I am not growing anymore and the story arc for Miss Morgan was not developing, and also I was cutting out my opportunities outside. So I chose to resign and leave the show for good." She and other thespians from the show are still good friends. "They were my family. For my baby shower, they supported me with items for the baby. It was a real party."
