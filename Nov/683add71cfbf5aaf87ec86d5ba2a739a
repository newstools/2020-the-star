Football Kenya Federation (FKF) president Nick Mwendwa has challenged the government to give them green-light to resume football activities after a nine-month freeze due Covid-19. Speaking during dinner hosted for the national football team ahead of their departure to Comoros, Mwendwa said they have what it takes to conduct their activities under the strict Covid-19 protocols set by government. He cited other businesses such as churches and burials as testament that with guidelines and protocols, football can go on. “Football is being played at the grass-roots and other businesses are going on with protocols like we have shown in the Stars’ matches in the recent past,” he said. The federation supremo revealed that the league sponsors Betking plan to disburse funds to clubs next week and they need assurance that everything will go on as planned. “Clubs will be receiving Sh2 million next week and the sponsors need to know if their investment is secure. If we do not start the league on November 28, it’s unlikely we will complete it in time and will be forced to zone it, which is something we are not comfortable with,” he revealed. Mwendwa confirmed that the board to manage the top flight league will be inaugurated on Tuesday next week and that the trophy (golden) is on its way from Dubai.
