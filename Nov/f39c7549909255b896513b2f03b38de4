Centum Real Estate Limited has broken ground for a new development at the Two Rivers Development, Loft Residences. The project follows the completion and hand over of two residential projects in Vipingo and Uganda. With an expected completion date of October 2022, Loft Residences is expected to be ready in under two years. It features 4-bedroomed plus detached servant quarter duplexes. The development also offers a clubhouse with a heated pool and several jogging tracks. This is the third residential development at the Two Rivers Residential District, joining the Riverbank and Cascadia Apartments which are  at an advanced stage. “Having commenced construction in July of 2019, we are at the homestretch of construction for Riverbank Apartments and buyers can expect to move in before the end of Q3 in 2021,” said Samuel Kariuki, Managing Director of Centum Real Estate. Centum Real Estate’s developments in Nairobi also include the recently unveiled 365 Pavilion Place Apartments in Ruaraka and 265 Elmer One in Kasarani.
