A judge has nullified a grant giving a woman sole power to distribute the estate of her dead husband after three of her sons opposed it. “All in all, I am persuaded that the filing of the petition and the summons for confirmation was irregular. I hereby cancel/annul certificate of confirmation dated 13/12/2016,” Justice Joel Ngugi said. Normally, when one gets a certificate of confirmation there is a schedule of how the estate of the deceased will be distributed. It shows all the properties, beneficiaries and what each beneficiary will get. Ngugi directed that a new grant be issued, which will have the name of the widow and one of the three children who will be entrusted with the duty of distributing the estate of Samuel Mbatia. He gave his judgment on November 12. “It is more pragmatic to appoint a co-administrator from among the applicants [the three sons]. The co-administrator will cater for the interests of the applicants and ensure that the rest of the administration of the estate proceeds in a procedural fashion,” he ruled. Mbatia died intestate on May 11, 2008. He was survived by his widow Ludia Watetu Mbatia and nine children, including the three who filed the case. In their case the three sons - James Mbatia, Joseph Mbatia and David Mbatia - told court their mother secretly filed for letters of administration without their consent. They also claimed she proceeded to have the grant confirmed and mode of distribution ordered by the court without their consent or information. Ludia had moved to court on July 13, 2015 asking to be given letters of administration. She denied claims that she concealed any material facts from the court.  Edited by Henry Makori
