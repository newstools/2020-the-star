Former Kenya international and Scarlet goalkeeper Washington Muhanji has lauded the recent launch of Ulinzi Sports Complex and Defence Forces Wellness Centre. Muhanji, who was one of  the most successful players at Scarlet, currently Ulinzi Stars, termed the facility as long overdue. He said complex, which was launched by President Uhuru Kenyatta last week, will inspire many talents within the forces. Muhanji said recruitment in the forces is mainly based on talent and the facility  will help them realise their full potential in various disciplines. The complex will accommodate 7,500 people and will play a vital role in the production of various talented players. “It’s a milestone not only for Ulinzi but also for the entire Kenyan sporting industry. The move will give many stars opportunities in different disciplines and also make Ulinzi Stars stable going forward," he said. Former Harambee Stars shot-stopper urged the Ulinzi players to reciprocate the government's good gesture by returning good results. Muhanji also urged the players not to shy away from joining the forces teams as they stand to offer them a perfect platform to showcase their talent. The Ultra-modern facility, which is being established on 35-hectares under Chinese construction company, will also see an indoor Arena, basketball court, rugby pitch and lawn tennis court among others.
