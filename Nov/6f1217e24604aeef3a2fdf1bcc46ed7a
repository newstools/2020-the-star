The host of a party which 44 teenagers attended has been detained for seven days to allow time for investigations. This is after DCI detectives on Saturday night arrested 44 school children and the host - Millicent Kithinji - in a house at Nairobi’s Mountain View Estate. During the operation, the sleuths seized various brands of alcohol and bhang. The children – 26 boys and 18 girls - were aged between 14 and 17 years. All are in primary and high schools. Kithinji, aged 41, was picked up for questioning by detectives based at Dagoretti. According to the DCI, officers seized different brands of whisky and vodka and bhang. Preliminary investigations revealed the children were from Nairobi, Kiambu Machakos counties. Kithinji and two other suspects appeared by the Milimani law courts on Monday, when police asked the court to grant them seven days to conclude investigations. However, the defence told senior principal magistrate Kennedy Cheruiyot that seven days was a lot. They claimed Kithinji has a pre-existing medical condition. However, the prosecution urged the court to give it seven days, asking the magistrate to consider the minors who were lured by Kithinji. Cheruiyot allowed police to detain all suspects for seven days. He has further directed police to escort Kithinji back to the house which is a crime scene to pick her medicine.
