Fresh from competing at the World Half Marathon in Gdynia, Poland, former Africa cross country silver medallist Leonard Barsoton is now eyeing honours in New Delhi Half Marathon on December 9. Barsoton finished sixth at the World Half Marathon in a race won by Uganda’s Jacob Kiplimo in Gdynia. In an interview, Barsoton said his mission in New Delhi will not only be to win the title but also to improve on his 59:09 personal best. “I am working towards this and I am sure come the New Delhi event, I will be ready,” said Barsoton. The New Delhi race will be his third this year after finishing sixth at the Ras Al Khaimah (RAK) Half Marathon and winning Kolkata 25km road race, where he lowered Ethiopia’s Kenenisa Bekele’s record from 63:45 to 63:05. “This will be my first race after World Half Marathon and I know I am capable of pulling it off,” he noted. Barsoton, who is also the Africa Games 10,000m silver medallist, bragged that he is an all weather runner hence he is not worried of the harsh climatic conditions in New Delhi. Barsoton will enjoy the company of fellow Kenyans  Josphat Boit (59:19) and Edwin Kiptoo (59:26). Others in the race are Abraham Cheroben (Bahrain) and Ethiopia’s Guye Adola, Amdework Walelegn, Andamlak Belihu and Solomon Berihu.
