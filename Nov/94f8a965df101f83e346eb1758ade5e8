A Nairobi court has ordered for the arrest of Kimilili MP Didmus Barasa and serves a subsequent civil jail term of six months. Magistrate DM Kivuti of the Milimani court on Tuesday directed that the order to arrest Barasa be served upon Officer Commanding Station Nairobi Central to execute the action. Barasa had up to Tuesday to pay city-based lawyer Alfred Ndambiri Sh1.8 million or face six months in jail. The MP, however, did not turn up for the court proceedings on Tuesday. "The issue of the respondent having a debt is not in contention and this was his last chance," Kivuti said. Barasa owes Ndambiri the money for legal fees after the lawyer represented him in an election petition filed against him by former Kimilili MP Suleiman Murunga in 2017. The lawyer has had to battle with the legislator since then before filling the case before magistrate D.M Kivuti. In seven different appearances before the court, Barasa had pleaded leniency and promising to pay which has not been forthcoming. On the October 9, Magistrate Kivuti had however directed that Barasa be given the last chance to appear before him on November 24. Kivuti ruled that if he would not have paid he will be committed to a six-month jail term. During the last adjournment, Barasa had pleaded with the court for the last adjournment saying he was Covid-19 positive and was in self-isolation and demanded to be exempted for 90 days. The magistrate, however, gave him only 45 days which has elapsed.
