Kenyans accustomed to enjoying Christmas and New Year celebrations outdoors until the wee hours of the night will have to think of a Plan B. This is after President Uhuru Kenyatta extended the curfew to contain the spread of Covid-19 to January 3, 2021. The hours were also extended from 11pm to 4am to 10pm to 4am. Usually, Kenyans troop to churches , bars and restaurants to commemorate the birth of Jesus Christ and cross over to the new year. Over the years Christmas has been marked with feasting and mass movements as families travel upcountry to celebrate with their loved ones this important event in the Christian calendar. This will limit revelers who prefer to celebrate their Christmas in a bars or organise late night parties with friends and families. Kenyans will not be able to assemble at KICC to cross over to the new year as they watch fireworks displays. Similarly, this year's Easter celebration was unique due to strict measures imposed by the government, including a ban on gatherings and movement of people in and out of Nairobi, Mombasa, Kilifi and Kwale.
