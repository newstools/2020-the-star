Health workers the world over are the vanguards in the war against Covid-19. They are the frontline soldiers battling the invisible and sometimes deadly virus on behalf of their countries. Many have paid the ultimate price. However, over the last two weeks, health care workers in Kenya have painfully narrated their horrendous ordeals in the line of duty. MPs have shed tears listening to these horrifying accounts of alleged government neglect. On Monday, for instance, officials of the nurses' union said they are forced to recycle personal protective equipment. This is not just a danger to the nurses and their colleagues, but the patients and the general public as well. Doctors have also alleged hospitals are forcing their asymptomatic colleagues to continue working. These claims should not be taken lightly. Kenya has already lost an unacceptable number of health professionals. It’s a fact that health workers are facing an extraordinary workload, fighting a novel virus that is little understood. Health facilities are also stretched to the limit. The government must do all it can to address the plight of these valiant soldiers. They need to be motivated. Exposing them to the virus reeks of recklessness. We must always remember that the country’s success in the war on Covid-19 will be determined by the health workers.
