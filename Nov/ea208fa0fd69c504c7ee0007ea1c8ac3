Gem MP Elisha Odhiambo has launched online registration of ODM members to revitalise the party. Odhiambo said there was a need to strengthen the party at the national and grassroots levels. He spoke at Gem ODM offices on Tuesday after renewing his membership in the company of Gem ODM chairman Douglas Otiato. Odhiambo said party leader Raila Odinga was positioning himself to take over the country’s top office. “This is the first time our party leader Raila Odinga is enjoying the support of the whole country, hence the need to revitalise the party,” he said. Odhiambo said competition will not deter Raila from ascending to power come 2022. “Some of the ODM party members should stop confusing residents by visiting Ruto at night and dining with ODM officials during the day,” Odhiambo said. The lawmaker said the BBI document will bring more resources to the grassroots.
