Winger Ayub Timbe reckons that Harambee Stars still have a fighting chance of reaching next year’s African Cup of Nations in Cameroon. Stars have picked three points from four matches but Sunday’s defeat to Comoros left them with an uphill task in qualifying for back to back Continental showpiece. “We are disappointed with the results and performance. We fought but it wasn’t enough. We didn’t take our chances but it ain’t over yet. We live to fight another day. With two games to go, anything is still possible,” said Timbe. Lack of killer instinct in front of goal has been a frustrating part of Harambee Stars in their dual battle with Comoros particularly in the first leg. That is something that coach Jacob Ghost Mulee will hope to resolve by the return of star striker Michael Olunga to the squad. The Japan-based Stars ostensibly missed the double header due to coronavirus restrictions at his club Kashiwa Reysol. Olunga is the top scorer in the J-League.
