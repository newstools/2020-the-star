Seventeen passengers have been arrested at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) after being found in possession of fake Covid-19 clearance certificates. The arrests come after the United Arab Emirates listed Kenya among 13 countries slapped with a visa ban due to coronavirus. Four more passengers are still at large. UAE is said to have taken the action after speculations that some of the passengers from Kenya are presenting fake clearance letters upon arrival in Dubai. The other countries that its visas were banned include; Pakistan, Iran, Yemen, Syria, Somalia, Iraq, Turkey, Afghanistan, Syria, and Libya. However, only Pakistan appeared to confirm the news through reports in its media quoting government officials. The Pakistan Foreign Affairs Ministry said the suspension will not affect those with already issued visas. It was not immediately clear what categories of Visa were also affected by this directive from the UAE. Kenya broke its daily record of cases, recording almost 1,500 infections in one day with deaths soaring sharply. By Thursday, Kenya had recorded a total of 80,102 confirmed positive cases and 1,427 deaths related to the virus. The cumulative tests are now 861,561, while total recoveries stand at 53,526.
