Kenyan Premier League side AFC Leopards have threatened to pursue legal action against Zambian Super League side, Lusaka Dynamos whom they accuse of snatching one of their players without following the laid down procedures. According to a statement issued by the club late on Tuesday, midfielder Duncan Otieno breached his contract after jumping ship a fortnight ago. "With a view to reinforcing our team, we procedurally contracted Duncan Otieno to once again play for us upon expiry of his contract with Nkana FC of Zambia that ended on  October 31, 2020," the statement read in part. Leopards insist they complied with all the necessary steps to bring the player to their fold. "Correspondingly, all processes required and documentation was done in the TMS to firm up this agreement. However, the player was unsettled by the agent who notified him of another offer and opted to pursue it despite having already entered into contract with the club," the statement said. AFC said that they later came to learn through the media that the player and his agent had in fact inked a deal with Lusaka Dynamos. "The move is unprocedural as we have no contact with the Zambian club concerning their desire to sign the player." The club said  the National Executive Committee had sat and deliberated to have appropriate lawful action initiated to settle "this situation by moving to report the matter to world football governing body,  Fifa for player tapping and double signing.
