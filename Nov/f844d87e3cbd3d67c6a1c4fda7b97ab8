Two boda boda riders in Homa Bay were arrested on Monday for allegedly defiling primary schoolgirls in their one-room rental house. Evans Ouma and John Otieno were accused of having sex with the two teenagers at Simenya trading centre for three days. Residents tipped off a local administrator after it emerged that the suspects eloped with the girls and hid them in the house. The two riders share the house. One girl is in Standard 7, while the other is a KCPE candidate at a local school. Area assistant chief Tom Ondiek on Monday said the four engaged in unprotected sex. “I was informed that two girls stay with boda boda riders in the same room. We went, checked, found the girls and arrested them together with the riders,” Ondiek told journalists. He said the girls were taken into the house on Friday. They busted the four at around 4am. The administrator said the suspects could leave the girls in the room for their boda boda operations and return anytime they wanted. "One girl was sleeping on a mattress laid down on the floor and the other one on a bed. The girls could go to the toilet and bathe at night,” he said. The suspects were detained at Homa Bay police station for more interrogations. Area police commander Sammy Kosgey said they had launched investigations before the riders are arraigned. “We’ll also interrogate the parents of the girls before we take suspects to court,” he said. Homa Bay children’s officer Joseph Otieno said they took the girls to Homa Bay County Teaching and Referral Hospital for medical examination. “Pregnancy and sexually transmitted disease tests are being undertaken against the girls at the hospital,” Otieno said.
