The Ministry of Sports has okayed the resumption of football, hockey and basketball activities behind closed doors in the country but the rugby fraternity will have to wait a little longer. In a press statement on Friday afternoon, the low-risk contact sporting activities will have to adhere to strict Covid-19 regulations. "All contact sports (low-risk) may resume their Premier (Tier 1) League and Team Kenya activities. All the other activities related to lower-level leagues remain suspended," the Ministry said. Other disciplines that have been allowed to resume under stringent hygienic conditions include netball, volleyball, ice hockey, handball, softball, rollball, floorball, floor hockey, modern pentathlon and billiard. The resumption signifies the end of a nine-month wait after the government suspended all sporting activities in March following the coronavirus outbreak in the country in March. The Kenyan Premier League is set to begin this weekend with round one of the matches for the 2020/21 season. However, it will be a long wait for stakeholders in rugby, karate, taekwondo, kickboxing, chess and scrabble. The Ministry has categorised them as high-risk contact sports with regards to the virus contagion and hence remain suspended. Nonetheless, training for national teams for the above disciplines will continue under stringent conditions in preparation for international events. "The Ministry will continue monitoring compliance to the guidelines and revise the measures accordingly," the statement said.
