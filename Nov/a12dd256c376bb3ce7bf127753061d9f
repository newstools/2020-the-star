The Nakuru government has formed a seven-member fisheries task force to look into challenges in the sector and recommend solutions. The move is part of the county's plan to increase revenue from fish production to Sh1 billion every year. The task force will be headed by Professor Francis Lelo of Egerton University. The county's fish production is mainly conducted in lakes Naivasha, Nakuru and Solai. Lake Naivasha has borne the brunt of challenges due to an increase in the number of illegal fishermen. Agriculture and Livestock chief officer Enos Amuyunzu said one of the assignments for the task force is to find ways of increasing fish production. “The county has the capability of earning Sh1 billion from the fisheries sector based on catch from the lakes and fish-farming and we shall address this,” Amuyunzu said. The county is keen on tripling its fish production with funds already set aside to supply fingerlings to farmers and construct more fishing ponds. “The main objective of the task force is to meet other stakeholders, identify the current challenges and seek a way of resolving them,” Amuyunzu said. He added that they were working with the Kenya Maritime Authority to address issues of safety and rising cases of boat accidents where several people have been killed. Lake Naivasha Boat Owners Association chairman David Kilo welcomed the arrival of KMA officers and the Coast Guards, saying it was long overdue. He admitted there were challenges facing the lake, including the rise in illegal fishing and the use of undersize nets. “The current challenges include safety and security and we are confident that the Kenya Coast Guards and KMA officers will fully address this,” Kilo said.
