Former Agriculture CS Mwangi Kiunjuri  has called for consensus building to address contentious issues arising from the BBI report. “We cannot build bridges in an environment of blackmail and intimidation. Every voice matters,” The Service Party leader said on Saturday. He was speaking at Maanzoni Lodge in Athi River, Machakos county. Kiunjuri said among issues that the BBI report has not addressed is agriculture, yet it is the lifeline of the country’s economy. “A country that is food deficient cannot industrialise and is unhealthy. Agriculture must start paying in Kenya,” he said. The party welcomed the increased allocation to the devolved governments, but insisted that there must be a robust national discussion on how these resources will be generated. “We must shift our discussion from consumption to production. We must be careful not to over-burden the wananchi with more taxes and be clear on accountability and prudence on the part of those entrusted with those resources.” The party also welcomed the proposal to use multiple member representation to enhance the equality of the vote. Kiunjuri said this would address gender parity, increased resources to beneficiary constituencies and inclusion of PWD and special interest groups. He said the TSP’s position on the Judiciary, the police and the IEBC is that they should be independent and have zero political interference. “The current BBI proposals on these organs fundamentally compromises their independence and introduces executive and political interference. We demand that they be reworked and streamlined to guarantee independence,” Kiunjuri.
