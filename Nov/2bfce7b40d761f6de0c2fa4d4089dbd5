Olympic 1,500m champion Faith Chepngetich Kipyegon is considering a new challenge after the 2021 Olympic Games in Tokyo, Japan. Speaking at her Global Sports Communication training camp in Kaptagat, Kipyegon said she will be upgrading to the 5,000m event  after a successful career in the three-lap race. “My focus has now shifted and I want to compete in 5,000m after the Tokyo Olympic Games. This is my dream as I seek new challenges in my career,” said Kipyegon. However, the reigning world 1,500m champion added she is not keen on doubling like her mentor, Vivian Cheruiyot — who dominated both the 5,000m and 10,000m races before heading for the roads. “When I was young, I used to watch Vivian (Cheruiyot) running across the world and I admired her, hence started taking the sport seriously. Now that I have the opportunity to showcase my talent, I hope to make it to the top, like her, when I transit to the next level,” said Kipyegon, who was with former world 3,000m steeplechase champion Hyvin Kiyeng. Kipyegon has had a stellar career over 1,500m, which, in addition to the Olympic and world titles, saw her win numerous Diamond League Series legs, 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow as well as cross country. Elsewhere, the Diamond League on Tuesday released its provisional calendar for the 2021 season, which will consist of 14 athletics meetings beginning in Rabat in May and ending in Zurich in September. Doha will stage a meeting on May 28 after which Rome will host the first European event of the season on June 4, with Oslo hosting a week later. Meetings in Stockholm, Monaco and London are scheduled for the first two weeks of July. After a one-month break for the rearranged Tokyo Olympics, action will resume in Shanghai on Aug. 14. Eugene will host its first Diamond League meeting on Aug. 21, with China to hold its second event of the season the following day. The final leg will take place in Europe with meetings in Lausanne, Paris and Brussels before the season finale in Zurich from Sept. 8-9. The calendar remains provisional and is subject to changes depending on the global health situation, the Diamond League said. The 2020 calendar was hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic, with several events cancelled and others rescheduled.  2021 calendar: Rabat - May 23 Doha - May 28  Rome - June 4 Oslo - June 10 Stockholm - July 4 Monaco - July 9 London - July 13 Shanghai - Aug. 14 Eugene - Aug. 21 China - Aug. 22 Lausanne - Aug. 26 Paris - Aug. 28 Brussels - Sept. 3 Zurich - Sept. 8-9
