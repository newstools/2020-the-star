A Machakos landlord facing defilement charges is dead. Julius Bogonko, 52, died of kidney failure at Kenyatta National Hospital on Tuesday, relatives said. He had been in the hospital for four days, a relative told the Star on Thursday. Bogonko was in August arrested and charged with defiling and impregnating a 16-year-old girl. He pleaded not guilty and was granted Sh500,000 bond or Sh300,000 bail on August 31 at the Mavoko law courts. He posted bail. Bogonko was rushed to court after a public outcry following his release under unclear circumstances a day after his arrest. Police defended themselves, saying they released him on health grounds. Bogonko had apparently told them he was diabetic and had suffered a stroke, hence, could not survive in police custody. The five-month pregnant girl said she was defiled in March by Bogonko, while her two-month pregnant sister blamed her pregnancy on Bogonkoâ€™s younger brother, Wycliffe Mayieka. A warrant of arrest is out for Mayieka, 30, who is on the run. Bogonko's victim is expected to give birth at the end of November or early December according to her parents. According to medical reports dated August 26, 2020, both girls were found to be pregnant. They tested negative for HIV and STIs. Bogonko is survived by two wives and five children. The body is lying at the KNH mortuary in Nairobi. He will be buried in Kitutu Chache North, Kisii county. Edited by Josephine M. Mayuya
