Please donâ€™t run away this time, face them head on. This was just one of the advices given to former IEBC commissioner Roselyn Akombe who was overseeing elections in the US. Akombe resigned and fled to the US ahead of the repeat presidential polls on October 26, 2017. Upon her exit, she claimed that there was massive corruption at the commission that led to her fleeing the country. But in a tweet on Friday night, Akombe posted a picture of her with a badge written 'union county board of elections..board worker'. Akombe wrote 'It is always an honor and pleasure to serve' in the caption that drew mixed reactions from her followers. @Paperboyrocks said "I am so sure your referee was your best friend Chebukati and Chiloba, and last successful heist was at IEBC. It will end in premium tears for that country." "Oooh, I have now seen where the problem is. Kumbe Trump is right,"@MartinKimuyu said. Other posts are; Since she flee Kenya, Akombe has appeared to have remained the lone voice openly agitating for justice for the death of IEBC official Chris Msando. At the time of his death, Nasa leaders claimed Msando was silenced to pave way for the rigging of the 2017 polls. In her end of assignment report after fleeing Kenya in 2017, Akombe said she had been suspicious of the commission's results transmission system. Her confidence in the system nosedived after the torture-murder of Msando, she said. She recalled that when the display of results stopped at the Bomas of Kenya at about 8.30pm on August 8, neither their staff nor Safran officials could explain what had happened. However, when the display resumed after three hours, the margin of difference between President Kenyatta and Nasa candidate Raila Odinga became a constant throughout the transmission process.
