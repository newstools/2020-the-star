Politicians opposed to the Building Bridges Initiative report should write to the task force and present their proposals, governance consultant Kithinji Kiragu has said. Kiragu said there is room for the improvement of the report through public participation and in Parliament before the referendum bill is brought to the ballot. He said empty rhetoric without alternative proposals for the benefit of Kenyans and future generations will not improve the situation. The consultant hoped that President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga will allow for the improvement of the report to prevent fierce contestations during the referendum. He decried the hard-line positions politicians for and against the document have taken. Kiragu said most of the BBI report’s proposals are good and can be used to fill the political, social and economic gaps in the current Constitution. The consultant said the report’s proposals to expand the Executive and the legislature can serve Kenya well. He said the set up is working well in Tanzania, Uganda, Ethiopia and Rwanda. He said the creation of the post of the prime minister and two deputies will entrench inclusivity and solve the gender requirement in public service. Kiragau said the proposals can consolidate devolution and help the country’s leadership to work in coordination with the people on the issues of youth unemployment and poverty. “The BBI report is progressive because it will close some of the gaps in the 2010 Constitution and more importantly, it’s the objectives it’s aimed to achieve. However, I'm not suggesting that it’s a perfect document but it can be improved in some parts,” Kiragu said.
