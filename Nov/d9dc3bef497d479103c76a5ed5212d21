DJ Pierra Makena has hinted that she is ready for baby number two. In an Instagram post, the mother of one said maybe it is time she bore more children. "A proud mother! I think I need to get another of these humans. Iâ€™m not soo badly off," she wrote. Pierra has been raising her firstborn daughter, Ricca, who is four years old, after her baby daddy left as soon as he heard she was pregnant. In various posts, Pierra has talked about how she has managed to raise her daughter alone. During Ricca's fourth birthday in June, Pierra threw shade at her baby daddy. She took a moment to celebrate the strides and efforts she has taken towards ensuring her daughter has a good life.
