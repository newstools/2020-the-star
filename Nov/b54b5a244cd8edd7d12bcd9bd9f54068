Kesses MP Dr Swarrup Mishra nearly died of Covid-19 and says he is alive because of the grace of God and the skill and dedication of medical workers. Speaking at the Catholic Church in Eldoret on Sunday, Mishra thanked Kenyans for praying for him. Dr Mishra is the proprietor of the Mediheal Group of Hospitals and said that during his suffering he learnt all human beings are equal, regardless of riches or status. He called his illness and recovery a turning point. “I am a true testament because a few weeks ago I was almost somewhere terrible but God saved my life. I am a sinner but God loves me," he said. The MP said doctors and nurses struggled to help him and he survived without a ventilator through God's grace. “At one time my respiration was 46 times per minute beyond the normal rate of 18 to 20. At the rate of 36, one needs intubation but God saved me without it. God is the best doctor and we always need to thank him," Mishra said. His condition worsened while he was in Eldoret and he was flown to Nairobi for treatment. Everything that happened was because of God, he said. 'We need to thank God always when we wake up and when we go to sleep," he said. Dr Mishra, a wealthy man, said he learned a lot during his illness, including that riches don't matter. "No should be looked down upon because of their poor or humble background," he said. “I learnt that being rich is not materialistic. We are all rich because of God. Being rich is just having happiness, truth, love and peace. Let's not have differences among us because we are all the same before God". No one should have enemies, he said. “Whenever you have anger, just turn to the one relative we all have and that is God," the MP said. He described Kenya as a great country that God loves very much. He said Kenyans need to live in peace and love one another. (Edited by V. Graham)
