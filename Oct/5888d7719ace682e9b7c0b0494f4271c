Sanchez asked for parliament to approve its extension up to May 9. A growing number of regions had been calling on the government to implement the measure. Catalonia was one of the first regions on Sunday to use the new legislation to impose a curfew, which will take effect at 10 p.m. on Sunday. Establishments open to the public will have to close at 9 p.m. The Madrid region had already limited the number of people who could meet inside homes to six, as well as banning the mixing of different households overnight. The decree will serve as a legal framework to implement a new warning system of levels, similar to the ones already applied in countries such as Germany and France.
