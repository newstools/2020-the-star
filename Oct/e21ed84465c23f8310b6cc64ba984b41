Fast-rising artiste Dennis Manja, alias B Classic 006, has released 'Call me, baby', a love song that portrays day-to-day relations between couples. Speaking about the song, which features Nadia Mukami, B Classic said most of his songs are inspired by love. "To love and to be loved is the greatest thing. When you meet the right person, you risk it all for them and lose yourself in their company," he said. Two months ago, the singer released his first single, 'Yakikukataa', which has 480,000 views on YouTube. B Classic was raised by a guardian, a Somali woman who took him in after being neglected by his mother at a tender age.
