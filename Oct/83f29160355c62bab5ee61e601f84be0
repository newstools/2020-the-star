Increased road accidents have been attributed to fake speed-governors. Road Safety Association of Kenya’s chairman David Kiarie lamented that some of the approved 46 speed governors’ sellers have been selling and fitting fake gadgets  in motor vehicles without the owners’ knowledge. He said such governors have caused public vehicles to be involved in grisly road accidents which have claimed thousands of lives annually. Kiarie said they have caught several of the speed governors’ sellers red-handed after fitting motor-vehicles with fake gadgets. He said they have already handed the matter to the National Transport Safety Authority (NTSA). Kiarie was speaking in Embu over weekend when he made an impromptu visit to the area inspectorate center after receiving allegations that the officers were fraudulently approving defective vehicles. The road safety association boss said they have discovered that some inspectors in the 14 vehicles inspectorate centers countywide have been approving vehicles which are defective to carry on with work after being compromised and thus risking peoples’ lives.
