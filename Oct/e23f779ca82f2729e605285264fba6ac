More than 300 Turkana families will receive supplementary goat feed due to lack of feed and the desert locust infestation that destroyed vegetation. The feed is being distributed by the county Livestock department and the Frontier Children Development Organisation. Agriculture and Pastoral Economy executive Philip Aemun said at least 312 dairy goat farmers in Turkana South, Loima and Turkana Central subounties will benefit. He spoke while flagging off the feed. He told residents not to sell their Toggenburg goats, especially in urban areas, because of their high nutritious milk yield. Aemun said the feed would be prepositioned in subcounty reserve stores and distributed to dairy goat breeders in Angarabat and Lokapel areas of Turkana South and Kanamkemer ward in Turkana Central. The extra feed will prevent livestock deaths from starvation due to limited feed and infestation of locusts that destroyed grazing areas. The executive said other places benefiting from the first phase of supplementary feeds distribution include Kalemnyang in Lobei/Kotaruk ward and Kekorongole in Turkwel ward of Loima subcounty. “The feed will improve breeding and young stock since they are high feeders. It will reduce food insecurity and improve families' purchasing power through improved incomes from sales of surplus milk and healthy animals,” he said. Aemun said more feed will be supplied by other partners in the desert locust control programme. Chief Officer for Livestock Abdullahi Yussuf said the county plans to increase pasture area, rehabilitate rangelands and manage them better. He said the county will encourage poultry raising and bee keeping to diversify  income sources. Frontier Children Development Organisation official John Esibitar said the organisation has facilitated livestock production staff who will distribute feed from stores to the targeted beneficiaries.
