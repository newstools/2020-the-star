A man was early Tuesday morning killed by a mob at Mwingi town in Kitui county after he was allegedly found in a sexual act with a cow. The man is said to have been found in the act at around 4am by a passerby at Mavoko area in Mwingi town, who raised alarm and neighbors came. However, the man is said to have turned violent once he was cornered, hence mayhem erupted leading to his death. The police were alerted and later came and moved the body of the deceased to Mwingi level IV hospital as investigations over the matter commenced. Speaking at the scene, Kavuvwani Location chief Nicholas Muvengei cautioned Mwingi residents against taking the law on their hands. He urged them to instead alert the police whenever they find somebody committing a crime so that the necessary legal actions are taken.
