Logistics and warehouse park, Nairobi Gate, has signed two landmark lease agreements with Kentainers Limited, a Joint Venture Company between Aquasantec International and Ramco Group. The first transaction is for a two-acre lease including a 3,000 square meter purpose-built factory with a warehousing component. The second transaction will see Kentainers acquiring another two-acre tract of land that will house office buildings and a client collections centre. “We believe that operating from Nairobi Gate will ultimately benefit our customers through quicker deliveries and combining our manufacturing, warehousing, and administrative functions in one precinct,” said Nikhil Shah, Managing Director of Kentainers. Built on 100 acres of land, phase one of the Sh500million industrial park will comprise in excess of 200,000 square meters under roof once completed. “The location and amenities offered by Nairobi Gate made it an obvious choice for us to reach our growth objectives, not only in Kenya but the rest of the region as well,” said Amit Patel, CEO Ramco. Developed by the Improvon Group, Nairobi Gate forms part of the larger Northlands Mixed Use Scheme, is situated on the Eastern Bypass of Nairobi, providing easy access to key arterial roads. A modern trend in logistics and warehouse parks is the integration of corporate office space with distribution facilities. This allows companies to increase their efficiency by consolidating operations. Nairobi Gate expects to announce further lease transactions in the near future.
