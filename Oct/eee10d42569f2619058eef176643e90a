The Inspector-General of Police, Hillary Mutyambai was on Wednesday ordered to immediately reinstate Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi's security detail.

The magistrate said the decision taken by the IG to effect their withdrawal was an unfair administrative action. "It is a cardinal principle of justice that no person should be condemned unheard," said Orenge. On Tuesday, Sudi filed and application against the IG and sought orders for his security reinstatement. Through lawyer Bernard Ng'etich, the legislator claimed that his life was in danger. "The accused person is entitled to a body guard and find that the action by the IG to withdraw the security of the accused person illegal," said the court. Sudi security was withdrawn on September 14 a day after he presented himself at Langas Police Station in Eldoret. The hate speech and offensive conduct case against him will be heard on October 30.
