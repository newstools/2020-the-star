Deputy President William Ruto has called on Handshake partners President Uhuru Kenyatta and Raila Odinga to include all Kenyans in the 'BBI reggae' Speaking at the Mashujaa Day Celebrations in Kisii on Wednesday, Ruto said there was a need to bring everyone on board to ensure the country realises the much-needed unity. The DP called for dialogue to accommodate divergent views in the Building Bridges process. "Former Prime Minister has talked about reggae. That is fine. But I guess we will have a robust national conversation that will bring everybody on board," the DP said. Ruto spoke moments after Raila addressed the gathering, insisting that nobody can stop the "BBI reggae". The DP has been a fierce critic of the initiative, terming it an agenda aimed at creating positions for a few people at the expense of the poor Kenyans. Ruto on Wednesday chose to hail the 'hustlers' as the real mashujaas of today as the country marks its Mashujaa Day. The DP who is rooting for the Hustlers' Movement in his 2022 Presidential campaigns said the ordinary Kenyans toiling and moiling to spur the economy should be celebrated. “Millions of Kenyans in towns and cities who wake up early and sleep late, in offices in factories, in farms and in all other places, working hard for our nation diligently, with commitment, determination, with passion and with integrity to make meaning of our independence and to continue with the journey of making our nation free. To them too, we celebrate them as our mashujaas because of what they do on a daily basis,” Ruto said. Ruto steered clear of highlighting known heroes and heroines and instead decided to laud ordinary Kenyans hustling in daily life.
