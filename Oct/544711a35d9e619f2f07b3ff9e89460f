A personal assistant of Agriculture CS PEeter Munya has denied claims that 90,000 tea, coffee, macadamia, avocado and Miraa seedlings have been stolen. Speaking at Meru University of Science and Technology during the launch of the seedlings distribution to farmers, Kofia Kaulani said said this 'propaganda' was being spread by Munya’s opponents. Kaulani said the CS is committed to transforming the Agriculture ministry through diversification of sector value chain. He was accompanied by Munya’s technical advisor Mbaya Kimathi, University’s acting VC Prof Simon Thuranira, and all Tigania East and West MCAs. “We appeal to farmers to make good use of the trees that could bring more money into their pockets in the next few years. We have select committees in every ward involving chiefs and deputy county commissioners and area leadership. We will also start issuance of cotton seedling for the Meru’s dry areas. This is a national wide program and we encourage farmers to plant them before onset of rains,” Kaulani said. He said the seedlings will be distributed in phases to every region depending on people's needs, type of seedling and climate. Kimathi said farmers will have a ready market for their produce adding that the five bills the CS has presented to Parliament are aimed at addressing challenges of value addition to catch foreign markets. MCA Kithinji Ethaiba said retrogressive politics had delayed developments that have a positive impact to mwananchi. Mbeu MCA David Mbae and his Muthara counterpart Kinyua Turibu said they are behind Munya’s reforms in the Agriculture sector as it will change fortunes of Kenyans. “I have asked the experts on income one tree can bring to a farmer and found out that one can earn Sh200,000 annually. They grow faster within two to three years. If you get few or not get, let’s be contented because they cannot be enough for every farmer. CS has done commendable job to remember Meru with the program,” he said.
