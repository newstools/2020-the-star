Former Rangwe MP Martin Ogindo has announced that he has joined the 'Hustler team' led by Deputy President William Ruto. The former MP joined the DP for a meeting on Wednesday with grassroots leaders drawn from Homa Bay and Migori Counties. This comes after Ruto embarked on making political forays into the Nyanza backyard of Opposition chief Raila Odinga. In August, Ruto's close ally Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi hosted a delegation of more than 1,000 youths and elders from the Luo community. Ruto has had many political activities in all parts of the country except in the Luo Nyanza region, which is Railaâ€™s home and political stronghold. However, Ruto has declared that he will tour all parts of Kenya as he advances his empowerment agenda.
