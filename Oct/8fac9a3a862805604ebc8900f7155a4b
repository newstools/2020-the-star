Kenya will play host to a 2021 African Cup of Nations qualifier second leg tie between Uganda Cranes and South Sudan which has tentatively been scheduled for November 17 at the Nyayo National Stadium. The teams will first face off on November 9 in Kampala before settling scores in Nairobi two weeks later. South Sudan cannot host an international match at the moment given that Juba National Stadium is still under construction hence the need for a neutral venue. Construction of the facility officially began on April 5, 2019 and is expected to end this year. The project estimated to be worth US$ 5 million  is being funded by world football body, Fifa and should serve a capacity of 7,000 spectators on completion. The Cranes top Group 'B' with four points from two games ahead of Burkina Faso and Malawi who are second and third respectively with South Sudan trailing the pack. South Sudan are in the precarious position following a string of poor performances which saw them lose away to Malawi by a solitary goal before crumbling 2-1 at home in Khartoum at the hands of Burkina Faso. As the nations lock horns, all focus will be on the newly acquired Gor Mahia forward Tito Okello who recently confessed it took him three years to decide whether to play for Uganda or South Sudan. Okello featured for BUL, African Lyon, Benfica De Macau, KCCA and Uganda Premier League champions Vipers SC prior to penning a deal with the reigning Kenyan Premier League champions. Okello said he chose to play for South Sudan because they had shown they believed in his ability as a player right from the start by extending an invitation. "South Sudan believes in me and that's why they made that official move to invite  me to play for them," Okello told the Gor Mahia website.
