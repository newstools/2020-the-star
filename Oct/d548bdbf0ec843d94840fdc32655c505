World marathon bronze medallist Amos Kipruto hopes to improve his time when he parades for this year's Valencia Marathon on December 6 in Spain. Kipruto, who has a personal best of 2:05.43 set in Amsterdam Marathon in 2018, said he is keen to improve his time irrespective of the position . " Winning the race is not really a priority considering the calibre of athletes I will be competing against. But If it happens in the process of chasing time, I will be happy," he said. The 2 Running Club runner, competed last Tokyo Marathon in March just before  the coronavirus pandemic hit the world. “I want to compete with my time. I want to beat my time. This means improving  it will come with good position,” said Kipruto. Kipruto, who finished in disappointing 18th position in Tokyo, said he developed some problems with the muscles during the race in the Japanese capital city. Kipruto had finished third in 2019 in Tokyo in 2:06.33. “I have healed from the challenge and I am taking my training seriously,” said Kipruto. He added: “As I prepare for Valencia Marathon, I am sure I will get the best time, which can help me claim top position. Marathon is not a one-day affair, one needs endurance and speed among other things." Kipruto rose to fame in 2018 when he finished second behind Eliud Kipchoge in Berlin Marathon, where the latter also broke the world record. He will be making his debut in Valencia. He was part of the team that was to compete in Adidas new shoes but he latter withdrew from the team to focus his training for Valencia. Kipruto was in the initial team for Olympic Games marathon team before the Tokyo show was postponed due to the Covid-19. He was also part of the Kenta team to the 2019 World athletics Championships, where he won bronze medal in  Doha, Qatar.
