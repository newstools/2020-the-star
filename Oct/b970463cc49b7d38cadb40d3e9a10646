Kakamega Senator Cleophas Malala cannot hold any political position in the ANC party as he is no longer a member, the party's Kakamega branch chairman Julius Arunga has said. Arunga said Malala was expelled from the party over gross misconduct and violation of the party constitution. "We had even written to the Registrar of Political Parties to remove the senator's name from our register," Arunga said. "But we were not able to do that after he had petitioned the court to bar the party from dropping his name from the register." Speaking in Kakamega, the senator said his apology to ANC party leader Musdalia Mudavadi was genuine. “I will do my apology in writing to the party officials so that we solve the stalemate at hand and clear the air once and for all,” Malala said on the phone. Malala's sentiments come after Arunga said the senator was incapable of holding any ANC post over his past record. Arunga told the Star on the phone that politicians need to remain loyal to their parties to save their political careers. He said Malala's political career was at a risk unless he seeks an apology from the party in writing. Arunga said asking party boss Mudavadi for forgiveness in church was not enough. "Malala's move was to trap Mudavadi in public over his apology. It will not help him. The party still demands the apology in writing in line with the constitution,” Arunga said. "The ODM party cannot trust him after rattling the party that sponsored him to the Senate".  Edited by Henry Makori
