Citizen TV's Yvonne Okwara says she still feels the pain and misses her late brother Albert Okwara, who died two years ago. In an Instagram post, the news anchor said she had had a tough weekend. She went on to question if grief ever comes to an end. Yvonne Okwara said she still loves the brother who could not see, speak or hear for the 50 years of his life. "Tough weekend. When does grieving end? Does it ever end? Two years on and I still feel the pain. Albert, you saw no evil, spoke no evil, heard no evil. I love you, always," she wrote. While announcing his death in 2018, Yvonne said her brother left peacefully. "I’ve lost my beloved brother! A few years ago, I gained the courage to speak about his disability and our family’s long journey with him," she wrote. "So many of you reached out to me and were kind and empathetic! I thank you. My journey with Albert Okwara is now over, at least in this realm. "He left us as peacefully and as quietly as he lived his entire life. My heart is broken, but my memories are full. Goodbye, my beloved Albert! Fly with the angels."
