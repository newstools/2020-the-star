Coca-Cola has launched a new home delivery service that will provide consumers with access to its range of beverages from the comfort of whatever location they are. Dubbed 'DialACoke.com’ the online platform will give consumers a convenient, quick and safe home delivery service for products ordered. As part of its launch offer, customers can order all products at a 20 per cent discount on the platform as soon as it goes live while stocks last. “We have developed the this platform to ensure our consumers continue to access and enjoy their favorite Coca-Cola drinks from the convenience of their homes,” said Theuri Chege, Commercial Manager, East and Central Africa. To place an order, consumers will need to go to www.DialACoke.com and select the Coca-Cola products they want and place them into the shopping cart. They will be required to validate the order as part of the check-out process, confirm their delivery address and the date it’s required. Orders will be paid for via MPESA. An order confirmation message will be sent to the consumer as they check out from the site. The delivery will be dispatched to the customer after payment is received. “The home delivery service, coupled with our wide national reach through our distributors, will ensure delivery of orders across the country”, said Theuri. He added that the team handling the service has undergone training and certification to safely handle all deliveries from distributors to the consumer. The platform will be available as an addition to other Coca-Cola services to its consumers going forward.
