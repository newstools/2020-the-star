The US ambassador to Tanzania Donald J. Wright has expressed concern over "increased tension" ahead of the general election. He is the latest envoy to urge for free and fair elections in the East African country. Mr Wright urged all political parties to commit to a peaceful election, saying he had received reports of "politically motivated violence". The ambassador tweeted: Tanzanians will head to the polls on 28 October. The opposition has accused President John Magufuli of planning to rig the election. In September, 10 foreign missions in Tanzania called for a free and fair election amid concerns by rights group about increased repression of opposition parties and non-governmental organisations.
