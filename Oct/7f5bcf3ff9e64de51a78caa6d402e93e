The National Transport and Safety Authority director-general George Njao has summoned officials of two bus companies to appear before them following the chaos witnessed on Sunday in Kenol, Murang'a. The officials of Neo Kenya Mpya Commuters Limited and Joy Kenya Services Limited are to answer allegations that their busses were hired to ferry goons who caused chaos in Murang'a. The NTSA boss said that the summon is per the implementation of the PSV Regulations, 2014 and in consultation with the Inspector General of Police. The Inspector-General of Police Hilary Mutyambai had directed the authority to immediately follow the matter following the clashes that led to the loss of two people. MPs Ndindi Nyoro (Kiharu) and Alice Wahome (Kandara) have also been summoned regarding the matter. DCI via Twitter on Monday said the two should appear on Monday morning at the Regional Criminal Investigations offices in Nyeri to assist Police with investigations. This was after the IG Hillary Mutyambai gave the directive. In the directive, IG said the two should be tracked and arrested immediately for mobilising goons who caused mayhem at Kenol.
