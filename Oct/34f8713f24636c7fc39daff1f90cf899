The Senate has asked Cabinet Secretaries to be more accountable and responsible while discharging their duties and responding to queries from members. Speaking after meeting the Senate Liaison Committee on Monday, Interior CS Fred Matiang'i revealed that legislators had raised concerns over the frosty relationship between CSs and House members. Matiang’i, who chairs the National Development Implementation and Communication Cabinet Committee, promised to improve the relationship between CSs and Senate committees. “Committee chairs have implored us to cultivate a better working relationship with House members. We will do our best to meet their demands,” Matiang’i told a press conference after a meeting with the legislators at a Nairobi hotel. Present were CSs James Macharia (Transport), Peter Munya (Agriculture), Mutahi Kagwe (Health), Faridah Karoney (Land), Cecily Kariuki (Water), Eugene Wamalwa (Devolution) and Attorney General Paul Kihara. The Senate was represented by Speaker Kenneth Lusaka, Abdullahi Ali (Wajir), Johnson Sakaja (Nairobi), Ephraim Maina (Nyeri), Kimani Wamatangi (Kiambu) and Sam Ongeri (Kisii). Lusaka said the meeting agreed that CSs would work hand in hand with senators to fast track legislation and safeguard devolution. “We have agreed on various issues among them cultivating a good working relationship,” he said.
