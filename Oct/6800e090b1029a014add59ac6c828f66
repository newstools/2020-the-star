Vihiga Governor Wilber Ottichilo has called for the establishment of an independent agency to handle counties' cash  instead of the National Treasury. He said the proposal should be provided for in the BBI report to enable counties to easily access funds. “We have been frustrated by the Treasury, and we are unable to pay workers on time. We are also unable to pay contractors and suppliers on time,” Ottichilo said. He said the BBI report, which was handed over to President Uhuru Kenyatta and his handshake partner Raila Odinga on Wednesday, should also propose increased funding to counties. “Devolution cannot work without money. We want money to be devoted to these devolved units for better service delivery to the people at the grassroots,” Ottichilo said. “I will lead the BBI team to all wards in the county to ensure people understand the document and find out if they accept it or not.” Ottichilo further urged politicians to ensure Kenya remains united as they deliberate on how to amend the Constitution. He said this is the right time to amend the supreme law to fit the needs of the public and rectify what the 2010 document might have got wrong. “The gender rule that the lawmakers failed to achieve must be worked out properly through constitutional amendment,” the governor said. The governor said when a constitution fails to work according to the needs of the people, then amendments have to be made. “The 2010 Constitution had some areas that needed amendments, but due to the 2007-08 situation we had to pass it that way,” Ottichilo said.
