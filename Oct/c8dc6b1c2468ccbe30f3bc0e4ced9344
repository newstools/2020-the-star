Residents living along Turkwel dam are living in fear after an alert warned them to relocate because of a possible spill over. Residents living downstream of River Turkwel were asked to move to safer places over impending floods in case the dam spills over. More than 300,000 residents are at risk. Water level in mid-October was at 1147.72 meters, which is 8.48 meters higher than any previous level.  Only 2.28 metres remain before the dam spills over, the report also sent to the media said. The region has been receiving heavy rainfall since last year October. Residents are calling on the government to move them to safer places. Residents of Kalemnyang, Loyapat, Nakwomoru, Lodwar and settlements along shores of lake Turkana will be displaced, the alert warned. The report also stated that roads and irrigation schemes in the region might be affected. The locals said they  have faced many challenges in the past and are now asking the county and national governments to ensure nobody is affected in the impending calamity. “For the past two years, we have been living in peace with our neighbours. We had begun to rebuild our lives. The  government should help us since this is beyond us,” Samuel Komor said. He added that most of the youths from the region had moved near the dam for alternative sources of income after they abandoned cattle rustling. “Many youths were engaged in farming and fishing,” he said. He said some of the  crops they had planted were submerged and farmers along the dam are counting losses. “We can’t move since we don’t know where are moving to. Our leaders should help us before this calamity strikes. They should not wait until last minute then they start rushing here. We need their help now,” he said.
