A casual worker who assaulted his competitor over a woman has been convicted to three months in jail or pay a fine of Sh10,000. Edwin Andole was convicted on Monday before Kibera chief magistrate Joyce Gandani after he pleaded guilty. Andole is accused of assaulting and injuring Hillary Owino on July 4 at Kibera Soweto area in Langata Sub County within Nairobi county. The prosecution told the court that Andole assaulted Owino at a restaurant where the woman works as a waiter. The prosecution said that the accused person wanted to be left alone with the woman at the said hotel but the complainant who was also a client at the hotel, ordered him to leave. Owino told Andole that he was waiting for water to clean his hands before the waitress could serve him drinking water. The accused person said he would do it instead and Owino told him he should be served by the waitress, and ignored him. Andole started raining blows on Owino as he pushed him out of the restaurant. Owino was assaulted on the mouth and lower abdomen and was rushed to a clinic by the police who visited the scene on time before he was transferred to KNH. Gandani gave Andole 14 days to appeal the sentence.
