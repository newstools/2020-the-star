Weeks after rumours surfaced that DJ Mo is cheating on his wife, Size 8, his alleged side chick has come out with fresh details, which the DJ has dismissed. Margaret Wanyama has shared her alleged intimate chats and moments with DJ Mo with blogger Edgar Obare, including photos of DJ Mo while naked. She claims to have been having unprotected sex with DJ Mo, and that he told her Size 8 is slow in bed and does not satisfy him. The screenshots she sent indicate she had been in contact with DJ Mo up to a few hours after she went public with the exposé. Margaret said she is no longer afraid and exposing her identity is no issue. When Word Is reached out to DJ Mo for comment, he declined to talk. On his Facebook page, DJ Mo shared a photo of himself, which he captioned, "Watu wangu, everything is possible." Fans flocked to the comment section, asking him to comment on the allegations. He responded, saying, "Don't believe what you see yet, soon..." It is also alleged that Size 8 and her two children have been spending at a city hotel without her husband. In one of her photos on Instagram, she wrote, "A time to reflect, rejuvenate, refresh, relax and unwind with my kids at Pride inn Lantana Nairobi." The couple have a reality show, 'Dine with The Murayas', where they advise young couples on challenges in marriage. It did not run on NTV on Monday but was uploaded on their YouTube page.
