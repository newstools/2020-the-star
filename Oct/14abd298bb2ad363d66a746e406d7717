High Court Judge Martin Muya has finally appealed to the Supreme Court over a decision by the tribunal that recommended his removal from office. The parties were directed to appear in court for mention on October 15 for further directions before the file is forwarded to Chief Justice David Maraga. On March 20, the tribunal said in a unanimous decision that allegations against the judge had been proved. It presented its report to President Uhuru Kenyatta. The complaint against him was filed by NIC Bank, a party that was the defendant in a matter before the High Court in Bomet, and Alfred Kipkorir Mutai and Kipsigis stores. While recommending a probe, the Judicial Service Commission chaired by CJ Maraga said after numerous adjournments, the judge granted an injunction and reserved his reasons for five months. This, he said, was despite pleas by the bank that vehicles, which were part of security, were being sold, causing the lender loss. According to the JSC, the petition had disclosed bias, abuse of office, incompetence and gross misconduct in the manner in which the judge handled the matter. Attempts by the judge to stop the probe, arguing that he had not been served with the complaint, were rejected by the court. (Edited by V. Graham)
