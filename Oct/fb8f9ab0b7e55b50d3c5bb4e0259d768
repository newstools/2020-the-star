A Makueni based laywerÂ whose hand was chopped by a female policewoman is dead. Onesmus Masaku died on Sunday morning at the Kenyatta National Hospital where he was receiving treatment following the brutal attack at his house in Wote town by the policewoman constable Nancy Njeri. The Law Society of Kenya South Eastern Branch chairman Justus Mutisya Mutia told journalists that Masaku succumbed around noon as a result of the injuries he suffered. Masaku was admitted immediately at Wote referral hospital in Makueni then transferred to KNH as his health deteriorated. He had suffered hand injuries after his hands were chopped. Mutia has described Masaku as a hard working legal mind and said his death is a shock to many who knew him. Mutia has promised that the law society of Kenya will take over the case. Nancy Njeri of Makueni Police Station is yet to be charged in court, police saying investigations are underway. The case is before Honorable Caroline Ocharo at Machakos where Njeri was charged with attempted murder. The matter will be mentioned on 23rd October after police asked for 14 more days to complete the probe LSK president Nelson Havi said the Society will ask DPP to include OCS and other police officers who recorded statements saying the policewoman was trying to defend herself when she attacked the lawyer. "That wasn't the correct position...they had attempted to cover up the incident," he told the Star on phone on Sunday.
