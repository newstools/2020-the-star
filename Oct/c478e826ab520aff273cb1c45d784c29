President Uhuru Kenyatta has revealed that DP William Ruto was working behind the scenes to ensure the Handshake became a reality. Speaking at Bomas of Kenya on Monday, Uhuru said Ruto was aware of all the happenings. "I also want to thank my deputy. Along that path, I kept him abreast of what was going on he was part and parcel of it all.  Ask him," he said. "..It is the truth... he helped me identify some of the elders I mentioned here. The purpose as I had told him was never to talk about what shall happen tomorrow in terms of elective posts." Uhuru further thanked ODM leader Raila Odinga, saying that he appreciates his sacrifice. "As many of you know. we were competitors in 2017. Things got to a difficult level.. but when we sat down to speak, we agreed that we are not here to share positions.. " he said. "...and we agreed that we were coming together with one agenda to ensure peace. We did not talk about sharing government." Uhuru said Raila never made any demands to be part of the government or to have a share in it. Earlier, Raila urged all leaders to come together during the launch of the BBI report. Raila, while quoting the Bible from the book of Isaiah, said the referendum process should be a unifying factor where everyone is brought on board. While referencing to the Quran, Raila said those who listen to all statements and follow the best of it are the ones whom Allah has chosen. "Let us talk to each other and not at each other. The BBI is not about Uhuru becoming Prime Minister and Raila the President, it is about what is the best for the country," Raila said. Outgoing Christ is the Answer Ministries (Citam) Bishop David Oginde called upon  politicians in the country to be at the forefront in uniting Kenyans. "In this nation, we have a developed a very dangerous tendency of politicising everything even a very important matter as Constitution-making gets shrouded in political intrigues," Oginde said.
