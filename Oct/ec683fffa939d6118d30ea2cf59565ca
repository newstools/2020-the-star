The government has now turned to home-based care as a first option to deal with asymptomatic cases, Health CS Mutahi Kagwe has said. Kagwe on Thursday urged Kenyans to take care of their health, saying those who contract Covid-19 and are asymptomatic will be required to receive care from their own homes, rather than at hospitals. "This will inconvenience your families and therefore it is your responsibility to take care of yourself," he said. "There is no reason for us t hospitalise persons who show no signs of any sickness except that they are positive cases." Kagwe said the focus on home-based care was as a result of limited hospital beds. The CS's announcement came as 14more people have died from the virus in the last 24 hours, bring the total number of deaths to 964. Mutahi said entertainment joints and eateries have become breeding zones for tje virus. He noted the government is battling trying to balance fully reopening of economy andÂ  containing the spread of the virus. "We will have a way forward next week when we meet with the President," Kagwe said. Chairperson of the county health caucus Andrew Mulwa said none of the devolved units that are yet to meet the targeted bed capacity is struggling with high numbers of patients. He said most of the counties had surpassed the required capacity. "People should not be alarmed as we have enough capacity to accommodate every patient," he said.
