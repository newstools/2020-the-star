The government has donated 39 laptop computers to three Youth Empowerment Centres in Busia. The donation is part of the government’s initiative to support youth in their bid to do online jobs. Information Communications Technology Principal Secretary Jerome Ochieng’ said more ICT equipment will be issued to more Centres in the county as the government races to scale down youth unemployment. “We have issued 39 laptop computers to three Youth Empowerment Centres. The idea here is we want to have young people developing their digital skills using these devices to do online jobs,” Ochieng said in Busia. “This is a programme that the ministry is running, that is called the Ajira Programme. These centres will be called Ajira Youth Empowerment Centres. As government we are focusing on the issues of digital inclusiveness and here we mean we are not leaving anyone behind in this digital space.” Ochieng’ said other counties will benefit from the programme that also seeks to improve on internet connectivity. He said the government is presently implementing programmes that aim at improving digital connectivity across the country. About 80 percent of unemployed Kenyans are below the age of 35. The 39 laptop computers will be given to the Youth Empowerment Centres in Matayos sub-county. The PS said there are efforts to distribute more computers to other sub-counties of Teso North, Teso South, Nambala, Butula, Samia and Bunyala.
