The gold trading community in Osiri-Matada mines in Nyatike is counting losses after Saturday afternoon fire razed the mines. Property of unknown value was reduced to ashes, including more than 50 mabati structures used as houses and business premises. Osiri-Matanda goldmine chairman Kephas Ojuka said the fire started in the afternoon at the informal centre, which is home to about 2,000 people when the trade is booming. "Nobody was hurt during the incident and we have yet to establish the cause of the fire. It happened abruptly,” he said. Residents and a Migori county fire engine helped put out the fire and prevent further spread. “Attempts to control the fire was hampered by poor access roads in the camp,” Ojuka said. Residents and miners rescued some of their personal belongings. The miners' secretary Peter Onyango appealed to the government to help those affected by the inferno to get back on their feet. Onyango has also urged the county government to improve on its disaster response.
