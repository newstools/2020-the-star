A Kibera court has allowed the police to hold a director of a digital company for five days in relation to a Sh17 million case. Senior resident magistrate Charles Mwaniki on Monday ordered that Martin Nyagweso be detained after Constable Geoffrey Mwangi sought more time to obtain certified copies of bank records and M-Pesa statements. Mwangi told the court he was investigating a case of obtaining money by false pretences. He said the respondent was linked to the case because his company oversaw transactions. The officer said the complainant intended to get a contract from an NGO that helps widows in Lodwar and was introduced to a person named Martin Kelly who was allegedly the head of the organisation. He told the court that Kelly urged the complainant to fund the organisation so the money could be used to pay taxes. Mwangi said Kelly also promised the complainant that she would be the Kenyan representative of the organisation. He said the amount was then transferred to Kelly, who later switched off his phone. “It was established through the Registrar of Companies that the respondent was a director of Digital Tech Enterprises and a holder of the beneficiary account that received Sh8 million transferred from the complainant's account,” he said. He said the respondent was arrested on September 30, 2020, and was placed in custody at Capitol Hill police station. Mwaniki granted the order and directed the case be mentioned on Thursday.
