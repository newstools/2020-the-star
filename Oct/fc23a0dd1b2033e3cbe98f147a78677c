The Inspector-General of Police Hilary Mutyambai has ordered the arrest of Murang'a Woman Rep Sabina Chege, Kiharu MP Ndindi Nyoro, and Alice Wahome of Kandara. This follows ta chaotic incident witnessed on Sunday at Kenol, Murang'a when two groups attacked each other. Two people lost their lives and several were injured. The IG said the three legislatures mobilised goons who caused mayhem at Kenol this morning. Mutyambai has also directed that the motor vehicles which were hired to ferry goons be tracked and detained to assist in the investigation. The incident occurred on Sunday before the arrival of Deputy President William Ruto and his allies. The DP was scheduled to attend church service atÂ AIPCA church in Kenol. It is alleged that two buses ferrying youths landed in the area early in the morning and proceeded to the AIPCA church before starting to throw stones into its compound. Tangatanga MPs have blamed the Kieleweke group for ferrying the goons from other areas to attack them. Mutyambai had earlier instructed the Director of Internal Affairs Unit (IAU) and two senior DCI officers to investigate the incident. The IG also urged the politicians to desist from engaging in inciteful utterances and acts that might lead to the fracas. "Stern action will be taken against any person engaging in planning and executing unlawful acts, " Mutyambai said. Ruto has accused people within Jubilee of being behind the chaos witnessed at Kenol, Murang'a, on Sunday. "Watu waliotuma watu kutuma teagas ni watu wanaofanya kazi chini yetu. (Those who sent these goons to unleash teargas on us were sent by leaders working under us.)," he said.
