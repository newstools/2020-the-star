The Kericho county assembly has suspended operations for 15 days after one staffer tested positive for the coronavirus. In a memo from clerk Martin Epus to all county assembly staff, he said staff should proceed on a leave from Friday, October 23. He did not give details on the case, but instead said the information has been circulating in the media. The clerk said that only a few staff offering essential services such as security, finance, and committee services will be allowed in the assembly. Epus added that arrangements have been made to test all staff members. "The doctors are on call from today (Friday) to the end of next week. You are asked to volunteer to undertake the test," he said. At the same time, the clerk urged all staff to fully adhere to the guidelines issued by the Ministry of Health to prevent further spread of the virus. Kericho assembly joins Homa Bay County Assembly, which was closed for two weeks after one of the members tested positive for the virus. Nandi County also temporarily suspended services being offered from its headquarters in Kapsabet town after eight senior officers tested positive for Covid-19. County Secretary Francis Sang on Monday said the eight officers were from the health department, finance, and economic planning as well as the education department. He said the affected departments along with offices of the governor and his deputy will remain shut for 14 days.
