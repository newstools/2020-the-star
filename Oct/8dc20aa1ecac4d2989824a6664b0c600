Gospel singer Eko Dydda is set to perform at the 'Made In Kenya' concert this coming Sunday. The show will be streaming live on Facebook and YouTube from 9.30pm EAT. The 'Niko Na Reason' hitmaker says he aims to urge more Kenyans to consume and support Kenyan brands. The 'Ajab' hitmaker is a father of two boys, whom he has been homeschooling. Speaking on Mpasho LIve with Mpasho, the singer said, "You are forced to learn something you will never use. I have never used French to communicate. "The reason I'm pushing for homeschooling is that I am intentional about it. I don't want my kids to struggle. "They spend more time doing talent and sports swimming, football and spend less time in class. What are they doing with the book for the whole day? "Our kids can be anything they want to be." He went on to say he let them choose what they wanted to do for themselves. "As we speak, I did not know they would be interested in athletics. After watching Kipchoge, they developed an interest in doing athletics."
