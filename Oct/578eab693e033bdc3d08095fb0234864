The growing number of Covid-19 infections over the last two months should alarm every Kenyan. When the first case was reported in March, the government moved quickly and put in place a formidable public awareness campaign and a nationwide curfew. When the number of infections dropped, Kenyans pressed government to relax the rules on the reasonable ground that livelihoods were under threat on account of the lockdowns. An area of urgent concern is public transport rules. Matatu touts no longer wear masks. The requirement that matatus carry half the passengers has been jettisoned. A complacent public convinced Covid is a disease of the past has ignorantly played along. Politicians, who are supposed to lead by example, have thrown caution to the wind and hold political rallies that attract huge crowds a majority of whom have no masks and observe no social distance. The reckless disregard of the very protocols on which our survival is based must stop. We are hurtling towards a disaster. Our economy is on its knees and we cannot afford to play Russian roulette with the pandemic. Ministry of Health chiefs must get back to the robust public campaign of the first half of the year to stave off an economic and public health disaster.
