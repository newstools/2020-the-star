The Council of Governors has urged the court to allow them to participate in a case challenging the proposed tea reforms. CoG in an urgent application says the regulations have negatively affected them as they fail to take into account the functions assigned to county governments. The regulations initiated in January are aimed at addressing corruption and exploitation of farmers as well as conflict of interest in the management of the tea value chain. Agriculture CS Peter Munya's regulations also recommended a 10 per cent performance bond of the estimated value of expected tea purchases at the auction. They are also intended to reform the value chain in order to increase farmers’ revenue by doing away with middlemen and brokers. Kenya Tea Development Agency Holdings Limited and KTDA Management services limited has sued CS Agriculture, Agriculture and Food Authority, the Attorney General and Council of Governors. But the Kenya Tea Development Authority has since challenged the 2020 regulations. The case is scheduled in court on October 13. CoG now wants to be enjoined in the case as an interested party. “We have an identifiable stake in the matter and stand to suffer prejudice if the matter is heard and determined in our absence. In order to effectively and conclusively determine the real issues in dispute in the case, and settle all questions involved it is necessary that we are enjoined as an interested party,” it says. CoG says the regulations have been developed and gazetted by the CS and later introduced and passed in parliament without meaningful stakeholder engagement, qualitative public participation and involvement of the county governments.
