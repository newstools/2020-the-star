Webuye West MP Dan Wanyama has asked the government to supply desks to schools to enable students to maintain social distance. Speaking during Mashujaa Day celebrations at Matulo Friends Secondary School, the MP further said schools should stop asking for fees from parents as most do not have cash. "Let the government take Kemsa money and disburse it to schools because the money allocated to learning institutions is not enough to run the programmes amid Covid-19," he said. Wanyama urged Education CS George Magoha to ensure that desks are brought into schools to ease learning. "Pupils [Grade 4 and Standard 8] have started their exams. The ministry should stop joking and do what is necessary for our students," he said. Pricilla Nakhosi, the principal of Matulo Friends Secondary School urged Bungoma Governor Wycliffe Wangamati to help the school put up two classrooms to comply with the Covid-19 guidelines on social distancing. "Due to compliance with guidelines and protocols for reopening, the school's infrastructure has been overstretched. I urge our able governor and the entire Webuye West leadership to intervene and help us build two classrooms before other students reopen," she said. She said the school stadium should be developed so county and national events can be hosted there. Edited by A.N
