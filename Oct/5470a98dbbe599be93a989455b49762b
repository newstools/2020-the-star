 A report on the cause of flooding in Rift Valley lakes is expected to be released in a month, with preliminary findings showing encroachment on riparian land among factors contributing to the menace. A technical committee formed to study the new phenomena was in the process of visiting the five affected lakes. Wildlife Principal Secretary Fred Segor on Tuesday said the committee had embarked on its studies. He said the team will make its recommendations to the government once it completes its investigations. “There will be far-reaching consequences on those who have encroached on the boundaries of the lakes leading to flooding and an increase in cases of human-wildlife conflict,” Segor said. The PS said heavy rains had also caused flooding in Turkwel Dam and Lake Turkana, displacing thousands of families and destroying property. He spoke at the Kenya Wildlife Training College in Naivasha where 332 students graduated in a virtual ceremony graced by their lectures and few invited guests. Segor said the government had formed a Wildlife Research and Training Institute, the first of its kind in the region after seven years of waiting. “The biggest challenge the country has faced in terms of conservation is lack of clear data but this will be addressed by the newly formed research institute in Naivasha,” he said. Segor promised the management of the new institution that his department will lobby for funding to finance its operations. WRTI acting director Patrick Omondi said Covid-19 had affected their operations causing a drop in revenue from Sh94 million to Sh39 million due to lack of student intake. He said they were discussing with the Higher Education Loans Board to support deserving cases from the institute with fee payment. “The transition rate in this college stands at 50 per cent mainly due to a drop in the number of students for lack of fees, low-grade levels and family-related issues and we need to address this,” Omondi said.
