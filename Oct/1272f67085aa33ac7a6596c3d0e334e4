The National Super League side, Migori Youth want Migori County Government to complete renovations at the the local stadium to enable them prepare effectively for the forthcoming season. The team has been forced to train at Pau Nyuka grounds, which is 7km away from Migori town, a move which they have described as expensive. Head coach Robert Ojienda said they are already preparing for next season and  have already promoted three youngsters from academy after successful trials. He, however, revealed that they have lost over half of their squad to other teams. “We started as an academy and our main aim was to nurture and release talent to other better teams and that is how we lost players.  However, we have also promoted three from academy,” he said. Ojienda said they have been forced to do trials at Pau Nyuka grounds as the county stadium is in deplorable state and the 7km distance has been hard on us financially. “We have lost several key players to other team and for the past two weeks, we have been running trials in a bid to plug in the gaps,” Ojienda said. He said they have contacted the county office in charge of sports over the stadium issue and they hope something will be done before the season starts. “We really want to use our county stadium but the way things are going, we may end up at Sony Green Stadium, which is the home of Sony FC,” he added. Last season, Muhoroni Youth finished fifth in the National Super League and they are keen to fight for a slot in the top tier next season. Migori governor Okoth Obado recently said the completion of the stadium is among his key priorities and as a temporary measure, a barricade around the field has already been done.
