Suna East MP Junet Mohamed wants the government to kick out Deputy President William Ruto from his official residence in Karen. Junet said Ruto has been hosting political delegations for his presidential campaign at the official residence, yet the government has been spending taxpayers’ money to maintain it. “You can't use the same place that the government has been paying for antagonise it,” Junet said. He said Ruto has for eight years refused to help President Uhuru Kenyatta implement the Jubilee Party's manifesto. “It is sad that a Deputy President has ended up dishing out wheelbarrows while in the same government promised to create jobs for the youth,” Junet said. He was speaking on Friday at Ombasa village in Awendo constituenc,y during the burial of Peter Sirawa, the father of MP Walter Owino.
