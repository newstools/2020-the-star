Muhoroni MP Onyango Koyoo has launched a drive to desilt rivers and streams in the constituency to control flooding. Koyoo said the exercise targets Obiayo, Oduwo, Simbi, Wang’aya I and Wang’aya II, which are flood-prone areas. Speaking on Friday at Kasese in Ombeyi ward, Koyoo said the drive will take 30 days. The legislator urged prudent use of the three excavators, which will be used during the exercise. He commended Water PS Joseph Irungu for heeding the plight of Muhoroni subcounty residents, who have been affected by floods. “This is part of the fruits of the handshake between President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga,” Koyoo said. He said residents in flood-prone areas have in the past suffered and incurred heavy losses due to perennial floods. “We have seen our people lose crops, livestock and even lives. Some have had their houses damaged,” Koyoo said. The desiltation and drainage clearing is aimed at paving the way for the construction of the 13km Lielang’o-Ombeyi road at a cost of Sh3.2 million. “It is important to do proper drainages along the roads before construction. That is why we have started the process of disiltation,” Koyoo said. Koyoo said the building of Lielang’o-Ombeyi road will be undertaken by the Kenya Rural Roads Authority. Another road set for construction is the Achuodho-Yao. The works will include the installation of a box culvert which links Achuodho, Yao dispensary, Yao primary, Keyo primary and Orenge primary. It will also link the proposed Orenge Secondary School. Koyoo, however, clarified that Kasese-Onyalo Biro-Kasongo is classified under the county government roads. He appealed to Governor Anyang' Nyong’o to expedite the construction of the road, which is in a deplorable state. Koyoo also reassured residents on the construction of Mamboleo-Muhoroni road which he said the funds had been allocated.
