Former Kiambu Governor William Kabogo has said plans for the formation of a political movement that will lead the Central region ahead of the 2022 elections are at an advanced stage. In an interview with the Star, Kabogo said the movement once formed will sensitise residents on good leadership and governance to prepare them for the General Election. Kabogo said it was unfortunate that some leaders have continued to engage in early campaigns, despite calls by President Uhuru Kenyatta that the country should focus on development. He said those engaging in early politics are denying Uhuru ample time to deliver to Kenyans. “We will start a movement ahead of 2022 that will fight for the interest of people of the Mount Kenya region. It’s high time that politicians should stop using us while advancing their interests", he said. Kabogo urged leaders to shun early campaigns and concentrate on serving Kenyans. “We will educate Wanjiku to elect leaders based on their merit and not money. Values such as integrity are crucial in leadership," Kabogo said. Since he failed to defend his seat in the 2017 General Election, Kabogo has branded himself as an ambassador for good leadership and peace. In a recent TV interview, he urged President Kenyatta to continue fighting corrupt leaders in his government. “My appeal to the President is very simple: Continue with the fight against corruption. Kenyans are behind you," he said. Edited by EKibii
