Migori Governor Okoth Obado has appealed to ODM leader Raila Odinga to stop his lieutenants from attacking him. Though an impeachment motion against Obado has been withdrawn, he has been alienated from Raila’s inner circle for "siding" with Deputy President William Ruto. “I want to give you [Raila] total assurance of my full support. People have been talking and coming to you and I know they have been peddling rumours,” the governor said. Obado said everyone has their own opinion, but they should not spread rumours about him, adding that Migori has been agitating for ODM agenda. He was speaking on Friday at Ombasa village during the burial of Peter Sirawa, the father of Awendo MP Walter Owino. Raila was present. When he rose to speak, Raila gave Obado's plea a wide berth but noted that Migori is deeply divided, which should not be the case ahead of the 2022 polls. “We don’t need to go like this towards 2022.  I will unite leaders in Migori soon,” he said. Earlier, several leaders said they would not allow anyone to divide Nyanza residents. “Who are you in Luoland to try and divide people and take them back to Ruto?” Siaya Senator James Orengo posed. Suba South MP and ODM chairman John Mbadi said the party would not tolerate any leader in Nyanza who wants to take them back to Ruto. Suna East MP Junet Mohamed said Migori was solidly behind ODM and Raila “and the few dissenting voices will be dealt with before the 2022 General Election.” Uriri MP Mark Nyamita, Gem MP Elisha Odhiambo, Rangwe MP Lillian Gogo and Ruaraka MP TJ Kajwang’ were also present. “We have seen a weakness in Migori as an ODM party, we will straighten it out before next polls,” Kajwang’ said. On Friday and Saturday, Raila hosted Luo and Kikuyu elders in Bondo. Obado attended both functions. Speaking to the Star on the phone on Sunday, Migori ODM chairman Philip Makabong’o said the party has shelved Obado's impeachment plans.
