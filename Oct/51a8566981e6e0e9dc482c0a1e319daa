The construction of the Kitui-Kibwezi road has eased business and improved the lives of residents. The government began building the road on December 6, 2016 after local leaders had asked for it for years. The road estimated to cost Sh18 billion connects Kitui with Makueni county and Mwingi, all the way to the Northern Corridor. It has already started bearing fruit for the locals in terms of ease of transport and businesses as well as growth of towns along the highway. Benedict Musenge, a matatu driver who plies the Kitui-Mutomo route, said it was hard to reach the two towns before the road was tarmacked. But now the time taken between the two towns has drastically reduced. “Before the construction of this road, we used to take more than five hours from Kitui to Mutomo due to the bad state of the road. Now, we take approximately 45 minutes. We can do as many trips as possible,” Musenge said. Karanja Kaburia, a businessman from Nanyuki who sells cabbages in Mutomo, said many businessmen avoided the Mutomo route due to the bad state of the road. But today, business is booming due to construction of the Kitui-Kibwezi road. Mary Mulatya, a resident of Mutomo, lauded the national government for building the road, which has completely transformed the lives of residents. Jerald Mwongela, a businessman at Mutomo, said the Kitui-Kibwezi road has eased business as they can get stock from anywhere. Edited by Henry Makori
