Lawyer Tom Ojienda has filed a statutory demand notice against Asal Areas CAS Hussein Dado for Sh2 million failure to which he will file a bankruptcy order against him. In an application filed at the High Court under the Insolvency Act addressed to Dado, Professor Tom Ojienda & Associates wants him to pay the amount together with accrued interest since August 23, 2018. “Take notice that within 21 days after service of this notice to you, you must pay Prof Ojienda & Associates the sum of Sh2 million together with accrued interests,” the notice reads. He says the amount is  for the 2017 election petition at the High Court in Garsen, in which Dado was ordered to pay for the costs in the case. Ojienda wants Dado to satisfy the court that he has a counter claim set off or cross demand against the law firm which equals or exceeds the amount claimed. “Further take notice that failure to pay the aforesaid amount shall result in the law firm filing a bankruptcy order," he states. Dado lost his position as a governor to Dhadho Godhana.
