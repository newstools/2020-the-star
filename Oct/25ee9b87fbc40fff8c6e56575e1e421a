At least 25 million Kenyans need to gain immunity to stop Covid-19 spreading (see P11). Some immunity could be arrived at naturally but we would need mass vaccination to achieve 'herd immunity'. The good news is that multiple vaccines are in the final stages of testing. The bad news is that Christmas is the earliest they might be available and even then only health workers who are more at risk would be vaccinated. The world will need at least three billion doses of Covid vaccines. That will take a long time to manufacture. So we will be lucky if we ourselves can be vaccinated against Covid before mid-2021. So we will continue to be at risk at least until then. Many Kenyans have had Covid but remained asymptomatic. Nevertheless over 700 Kenyans have died of Covid since March. There is no room for complacency. The relaxation of Covid restrictions and re-opening of bars increases the risk of a 'second wave'. Faced with the continuing risk of infection and the long wait for vaccines, we must double down on protecting ourselves and our loved ones. Always remember to wear a mask, wash your hands, and socially distance. Quote of the day: "Ambition breaks the ties of blood, and forgets the obligations of gratitude."
