Kenyan champions Gor Mahia have acquired the services of Brazilian Roberto Oliveira as their new head coach taking over from Steven Polack. Club Chairman Ambrose Rachier confirmed the arrival of the tactician just less than 24 hours after announcing the departure of Finnish Polack who exited the club on mutual agreement. “We are excited to announce the arrival of our new coach Roberto Oliveira from Brazil. He has had long coaching experience in Africa thus making him more conversant with African football. We think he will be a great asset in our quest to achieve better results on the field,” noted  Rachier on the club's official online portal Roberto, who previously managed Rayon Sports of Rwanda, boasts of 25 years of coaching experience and has been to a number of African countries as head coach, the Middle East as well as his native country Brazil. The new coach who faced Gor  in a CAF competition three years ago while managing Rayon said he was  looking forward to achieve the best in top-level competition. “After leaving Rayon Sports, I got three offers to come back to Africa but I turned them down…. When Gor Mahia came knocking, I couldn’t turn it down because I like the club…. I like their style because I have seen Gor Mahia play many times and even had a tie against them in CAF competition. I am happy to be offered the chance to coach the team,” he said Roberto says to achieve the best in Africa, collective effort is important: “Gor Mahia have won everything in local competition and it is about time to make a mark in CAF continental competitions. It will take the collective efforts of players, technical staff, and management to achieve what we want. I believe it can be done.”
