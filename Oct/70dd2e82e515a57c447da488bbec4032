Morgan Heritage has signed Nigerian singer Fay Ross. The Grammy Award-winners set out to find talent across Africa after sensing potential. It is then they discovered 1A1V Music’s FayRoss, a talented singer, songwriter and producer. On his new single Race, FayRoss tells a relatable story that echoes across the continent of Africa, whereby a boy meets a girl and they fall for each other but he doesn’t have much to offer financially. So the boy eventually loses the girl to a guy that has more to offer. The group's label CTBC Nation is distributed by Sony Music South Africa. Through their partnership with 1A1V Music, they look to solidify FayRoss as one of Africa’s brightest stars. The label intends to sign more African artistes, including some good acts in Kenya. FayRoss is set to release another song early next month.
