Despite the rising cases of Coronavirus in the capital, only 4,093 Nairobi residents turned up for the mass testing over the weekend. Phase two of the free mass testing of Covid -19 was spearheaded by the Nairobi Metropolitan Services. Records from the Major General Mohammed Badi headed office reveal that 2,146 people were tested on Saturday while on Sunday the numbers dropped to 1,947. NMS Health Director Dr Josephine Kibaru-Mbae had noted that random testing of a large population will give an indication of how widespread the virus infection is in Nairobi. This will be done by calculating the positivity rate especially after easing the containment measures. “The results will assist to track the state of the pandemic and the information will guide decision-making."A higher positivity rate suggests higher community transmission. It will show that there are likely more people with coronavirus in the community who haven’t been tested,” she explained. All the samples will be processed at the Mama Lucy Kibaki Hospital laboratory where the results will be expected to be out today ( Tuesday). By testing many people, the NMS said will ensure the positive cases are isolated to reduce transmission to family and the community at large. Embakasi North Sub-county recorded the highest turn-up with 464 people who tested for the virus in the two-day exercise. Dagoretti North had 168 , Dagoretti South 315 , Embakasi 197 , Embakasi East 225 , Embakasi South 187 , Embakasi West 202, and Kamkunji 273, Kasarani 223, Kibra364 , Langata 217,Makadara 387, Mathare 118, Roysambu 132, Ruaraka 186, Starehe 162 and Westlands 273.

Speaking on Saturday at Kibra, NMS Health Chief Officer Ouma Oluga said that the home-based care model was working well and the public isolation centre has the capacity to accommodate and treat those infected with the virus. " With all these as NMS we are fully prepared to respond to the outcome of the mass testing," he said. Since the first case was reported on March 13, 2020, Nairobi has been the country’s epicentre of the virus, with more than 22,000 reported positive cases and over 400 deaths. On April 6, 2020, President Uhuru Kenyatta declared the cessation of movement in and out of Nairobi, Kilifi, Kwale and Mombasa counties for 21 days to curb the spread the virus, which was later uplifted in July. In May 2020, 3,000 samples were collected for analysis when NMS conducted the first free round of mass testing which took place over a period of 11 days. The Eastleigh business hub underwent a ‘lockdown’ to curb the spread of Covid-19. In September, the number of positive cases had dropped after the Government relaxed containment measures. Among the revised measures announced by President Uhuru Kenyatta saw the re-opening of bars, schools, increase number in weddings, funerals, places of worship and a shorter nationwide curfew from 11 pm to 4 a.m. As of October 17, 2020, Nairobi accounted for more than 50 per cent of the 44,196 cases and 825 deaths. The NMS said Nairobi, with a population of nearly five million, accounts for almost 10 per cent of the country’s population, hence the need for continuous testing.
