Deputy President William Ruto should shelve his ambition to become president so members of other Kenyan communities can lead, ANC Nominated MP Godfrey Ososti has said. Osotsi said the Ruto's Kalenjin community has been in the country's top leadership for over 40 years and it is time they gave way for others. “The late President Daniel Moi was a vice-president for 12 years and president for 24 years. DP Ruto is there for another 10 years,” Osotsi said. Osotsi said the 2022 presidential election should be a contest reserved for those communities that have never given the country a president. He said the Building Bridges Initiative report should mandate that any community that has been represented in the Presidency for two terms should not field a candidate for some time. “That will help a lot in not concentrating leaders in one area when the country has 47 counties,” Osotsi said. The lawmaker said the country needs a leader who will reform the country's economy. “[We want a leader] who will make Kenya corruption, racism and tribalism free and improve the economy," Osotsi said. Osotsi said DP Ruto is not a 'hustler' as he claims and should stop blackmailing Kenyans for a sympathy vote in the 2022 General Election. “If the DP is hustling for the top seat, other communities are also doing the same,” the lawmaker said. The lawmaker said in Sabatia that those marketing DP Ruto in Western should know the Luhya community also has the capacity to fight for that top seat. Osotsi accused DP Ruto of promising heaven and giving Kenyans hell. "We were promised 47 modern stadiums, universal healthcare and 1,000 jobs to our youths but none has been delivered," the lawmaker said.
