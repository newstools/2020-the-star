The government may not achieve the Sustainable Development Goals if it does not address the socioeconomic challenges facing the youth, a CAS has said. ICT, Innovation and Youth Affairs Chief Administrative Secretary Nadia Abdullah said the youth should be empowered for self-sustainability. She was speaking in Mwatate during a meeting with Taita Taveta Youth, Gender and Sports Laban Mwashighadi on Thursday. Abdullah said the government is keen on helping the youth establish income-generating projects. “The youth must be economically empowered to start sustainable businesses. We are highly encouraging self-employment as opposed to formal employment,” she said. The meeting was aimed at synergising efforts that will ensure efficient sensitisation of youth and women on the available affirmative funds. They include Youth Enterprise Development Fund, Women Enterprise Fund and Uwezo Fund. Youth and women's groups will be sensitised on entrepreneurship and how to access to the various government programmes and opportunities. "Through Kenya ni Mimi, an initiative that aims to empower the youth, I have dedicated myself in ensuring equal opportunity and education especially for the girl child as well as addressing mental health, a pertinent issue that needs to be resolved," Abdullah said Mwashighadi outlined efforts made towards achieving youth empowerment by the county government, noting that more funds have been allocated to empower youth groups. "We have gender mainstreaming and women's empowerment funding for small businesses through the Youth Fund," the executive said. He said the government has equipped Vocational Training Centres  to ensure 100 percent transition in the Education sector. “The role played by VTCs cannot be underestimated. It is a sure way of empowering the youth with skills that will help in creation of more jobs,” Mwashighadi added. Edited by Josephine M. Mayuya
