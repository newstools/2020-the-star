Lecturers at the University of Nairobi College of Health Sciences have disputed the legality of the ongoing final year medical student examination set to graduate in November. Their strike has complicated administration of the exams following a decision by university vice chancellor Stephen Kiama to withhold allowances of some of its lecturers. The dons argue that the VC’s decision is illegal and violates labour laws. The strike has also threatened this year's graduation of medical students, pharmacists and nurses undertaking their studies at the university. “Since the withdrawal of the allowances, no learning has been taking place but we are informed that the VC has looked for quacks to administer and set exams for the students,” said Samuel Oroko of the Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentist Union, yesterday. The union was addressing the media in Nairobi. They said the VC is treading on a dangerous path that would result in underqualified doctors. The union also wants the Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Council —medical regulator — to inspect the programmes that are ongoing at the university to look if there has been training in line with regulations. The union demanded the immediate and unconditional reinstatement of the allowances whose payment it claimed was stopped unilaterally by the university in breach of employment and labour laws. However, VC Kiama countered that he withheld part of the allowances as some medical lectures had abandoned their work at the Kenyatta National Hospital for their private clinics. The union dismissed the claim, saying the VC's list is erroneous and contains the names of some persons who are either deceased or retired, while excluding those who are currently in active service. Oroko also warned that the strike would have far-reaching effects because the country is in the middle of a pandemic. It will also derail the implementation of the Universal Health Coverage Agenda, he said.
