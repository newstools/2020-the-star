National Super League side Migori Youth will resume training today ahead of the upcoming season. Coach Robert Ojienda yesterday said the training sessions will be conducted in line with Covid-19 containment guidelines. “We want to avoid overcrowding by splitting the players into small groups for easy monitoring and management. Training equipment will also be sanitised before and after every training session,” said Ojienda. The club, which is sponsored by Bansi Wholesalers, is also seeking to beef up the team. The training sessions will be conducted at Migori County Stadium. “Some players will definitely leave and so we must bring in new faces. I’m keen on adding new strikers because since the departure of Clinton Okoth to Gor Mahia, we have not had a good finisher,” Ojienda added. “Due to Covid-19, we are not going to do an open trial. What we have done is to identify about 15 players who will join us for training as from Monday,” said Ojienda. The coach refused to comment on the team’s targets for next season. “We don’t even know when the season will start. As at now, I want to focus on the task at hand which is to improve the fitness levels of the players,” noted Ojienda. However, Ojienda added that their ultimate aim is to qualify to the Kenya Premier League. “Migori County doesn’t have a team in the Kenya Premier League. We want to replace the defunct Sony Sugar in the top tier league,” Ojienda revealed. He appealed to the Sport Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohammed to lift the suspension of contact sports.  Migori Youth finished 8th on the log with 38 points from 25 games by the time the league was suspended due to the coronavirus pandemic.
