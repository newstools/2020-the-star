Football Kenya Federation has completed a three-day Physical Endurance Test (PET) training for 240 referees ahead of the upcoming season. Referees drawn from the Kenyan Premier League, National Super League, National Division One Leagues and Women's Premier League attended the training at Afraha Stadium in Nakuru. The referees were tested on their physical preparedness to handle matches next season. However, it remains unclear when the season will start since football is among contact games which are yet to resume following suspension due to the Covid-19 pandemic. FKF referees manager, Sylvester Kirwa exuded optimism in the referees during the three day course. “I believe this three day PET training has properly equipped the participants to effectively run their league matches with utmost diligence,” said Kirwa. The course was led by Kirwa, Steven Oduor, Edward Lumbugu, Caleb Amwayi and Margaret Omondi. They were taken through theory sessions, that were capped off with a written exam which tested their knowledge on the laws of the game. “Our target was to not only ascertain the referees’ physical shape but also keep them abreast with the laws of the game,” said Kirwa.
