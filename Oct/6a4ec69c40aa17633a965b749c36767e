Lawyer Philip Nzamba Kitonga is dead after a short illness,  according to his family. The lawyer who chaired the Committee of Experts on the 2010 Constitutional Review died on Sunday evening while on his way to Nairobi from Makueni. Nzamba was born in 1956 in Kitui County and has died at the age of 64. He was also active in political matters and vied for the Kitui gubernatorial seat in 2013, but lost the former governor Julius Malombe. Nzamba held positions such as the president of the East Africa Law Society and COMESA Court of Justice He was among the shortlisted candidates for the position of Chief Justice of Kenya to replace Willy Mutunga. Recently, the lawyer criticised President Uhuru Kenyatta for delaying to appoint the 41 judges. He said that due to the delay, the backlog of cases has now crippled operations at our courts beyond imagination. "The courts are now very desperate. Even lawyers and litigants are increasingly becoming desperate." The Chief Justice pointed out that a land case filed this year might be heard in 2022, but even other cases, like those to do with the war against corruption have also been severely affected. Several leaders have eulogised Nzomba. Deputy President William Ruto termed Nzamba Aas a man of gregarious personality, modest yet a gifted and far-sighted leader who was genuinely committed to public service and social justice. Chief Justice David Maraga said the lawyer was one of Kenya's most distinguished legal practitioners and a key pillar in the country’s constitutional journey. Makueni Senator Mutula Kilonzo Junior has described Nzamba as 'a gentleman and one of the top legal minds in Kenya. Rest In Peace our dear friend and senior.' Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko said Nzamba "beat all odds to not only become an icon in Kenya's legal fraternity, but to serve as the President of the East African Law Society, and a member of the Committee of Experts that delivered the Constitution of Kenya in 2010."
