The Independent Policing Oversight Authority chairperson Anne Makori has welcomed the proposals contained in the Building Bridges Initiative report meant to transform it into a Commission. IPOA was established by an Act of Parliament to ensure that police are held accountable for their actions. The BBI report proposes statutory amendments to the Constitution and other legislations including anchoring IPOA in the Constitution. BBI has proposed the introduction to the Constitution, a new Article â€“ 246A- and establish the Independent Policing Oversight Commission with a cardinal task to monitor and report on adherence to the objects of Article 244. This is in order to hold members of the National Police Service accountable to the public in the performance of their functions and perform any other functions prescribed by national legislation. "The civilian oversight mechanism over the work of the police will move a notch higher and eventually, the NPS will achieve the highest professional standards possible, and the public will have a higher degree of confidence in their law enforcement Services," Makori said. The BBI report was unveiled by President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM boss Raila Odinga at Kisii State Lodge on Wednesday.
