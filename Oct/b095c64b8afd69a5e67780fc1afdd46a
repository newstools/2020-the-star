Socialite Corazon Kwamboka says she struggled with postnatal distress. Corazon welcomed her son with Frankie JustGymIt, Maureen Waititu's ex-husband, in August. In an Instagram post, Corazon said she was not told how hard it was going to be. "It was the best moment in my life but it was also the toughest moment for me," she wrote. She found herself crying for no reason, banging doors and throwing herself to the floor. "Every small thing would trigger me to go nuts. Like if the food did not have enough salt. I had such a hard time. Frankie tried, I mean, he really tried to make it easier, but I was just pushing him away," she said. She recounted a day she started driving in the middle of the night with her baby strapped on the seat. That’s when she realised she was endangering herself and her baby. "I had been embarrassed to ask for help, embarrassed to admit that I was having a hard time, it took a huge toll on me, trying to deal with it alone," she wrote. She advised that it is always good to surround yourself with people who love and support you. "Don’t push them away, and when you feel you can’t take it anymore, it’s okay to seek help. We are just humans, too."
