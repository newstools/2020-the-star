President Uhuru Kenyatta was at PCEA Tumutumu Church in Nyeri county on Sunday to attend the centennial celebration of First Kirk-Session and the Ordination of Elders. The celebration worship service was hosted by Rt. Rev. Dr. Julius Guantai Mwamba, the Moderator of the 22nd General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church of East Africa. Uhuru was received by several Central leaders, including Nyeri Town MP Ngunjiri Wambugu, Ndaragwa's Jeremiah Kioni among others. Uhuru praised PCEA for its work in spreading the gospel. "They treated the soul, they treated the mind, and they treated the body and I think within that spirit is what we call a true partnership... that partnership between state and church," he said. "You have a partner in me and you have a partner in my government." The President called for commitmentÂ to service. "Let's be remembered for what we have done and what we will do. Let's stay away from matters that bring strife," he said. He pledged Sh100 million will be set aside by the government to complete the PCEA Tumutumu Hospital project in Nyeri. Uhuru also said money will be allocated towards the university next month. "We want to continue to partner to educate our children and ensure citizens have access to health services." Uhuru steered clear of BBI talk, saying that was not what he was in the church to talk about, adding that more would be said on the report on Monday, during its unveiling at Bomas.
