Kenya Railways has said an earth tremor caused a one-and-a-half hour delay on the Madaraka Express passenger service inter-county train from Nairobi to Mombasa on Wednesday. "The train was forced to come to an unscheduled stop today in Tsavo West National Park following reports of an earth tremor in Voi," it said in a statement. Kenya Railways said the train crew received information while at Ndio station area in Voi. "The stop was necessary as officials in the area carried out investigations to ascertain if the railway line had been affected by the tremor." The stop lasted one hour before the train crew received the green light from the control centre to proceed with the journey. The train which had departed Nairobi Terminus at 8am arrived in Mombasa at 3.30pm, translating to a one and a half hours delay. According to Wikipedia, an earth tremor is caused by immense force exerted on the rock mass by explosions, movement of trains and heavy trucks exceeds its strength.
