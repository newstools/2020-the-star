There was a light moment at Bomas after the representative for the deaf community Ashura Michael proposed to President Uhuru Kenyatta. "Mheshimiwa Rais recently you went to Kisumu na nikasikia ulikuwa unatafuta mpango wa kando. Najua mama alikubali babangu Raila ako hapa tayari kuchukua mahari na ndugu yangu deputy president akikubali atakuwa bestman," Ashura said jokingly. This loosely translates to: "Mr President I heard you were looking for a second wife. I know the First Lady has agreed to that and since Raila is here, he can take my bride price and the Deputy President William Ruto can be your best man if he agrees." ..."Na mama wa taifa tutaendelea kubuild bridges pamoja. Na sasa mtoto wa BBI atazaliwa. (Me and the First Lady will continue 'Building Bridges' and the BBI baby will be born)." Her statement left the crowd roaring with laughter with Uhuru turning to Raila and clapping excitedly. She was referring to last week's remarks by the President over his search for a wife during his Kisumu tour. "Nilikuwa naambia Raila hapa jameni... Sijui kama mama nyumbani ataniruhusu... Akiniruhusu labda naweza kupata mtu ambaye atakuwa ananitengenezea mambo yangu pande hii..." he said during his speech in Kisumu last Thursday . This loosely translates to: "I was telling (ODM leader) Raila Odinga: I don't know whether my wife will allow me to get another woman to look after my interests on this side." "Ndio tuwe tukitembea ukijua kuna mahali utakuwa unakula ugali ama namna gani (So that we walk knowing there's a place we can be going to eat ugali)?"
