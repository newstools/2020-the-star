President Uhuru Kenyatta on Thursday received a grand welcome in Kisumu as residents sang and danced upon his arrival at the lakeside city. The locals carried different placards praising Uhuru and his Handshake partner Raila Odinga as they drummed up support for the newly released Building Bridges Initiative report. When he reached Kondele, the President was forced to wave atop his vehicle as the crowd cheered wildly. The crowd, some on boda bodas, followed the President's convoy to the Mamboleo Show Ground where he presided over the groundbreaking of theJomo Kenyatta International Stadium. Residents expressed their joy saying that they were happy the President did not pass without waving to them. Even though he did not address the locals the crowd expressed their satisfaction with his greetings. The President is later expected to inspect ongoing development projects financed by the national government in Kisumu. The projects to be inspected include the Sh3 billion refurbished Kisumu port, the Jomo Kenyatta International Stadium in Mamboleo ASK Grounds and the ongoing construction of Uhuru Business Park.
