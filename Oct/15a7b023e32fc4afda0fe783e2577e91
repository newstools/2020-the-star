Kenya has a chance to expose its players if they qualify for the women’s Hockey Junior World Cup next year. National Under-21 team coach Jacqueline Mwangi said the Junior Africa Cup set for Accra, Ghana in march will serve as a qualifier for the global show. The World Cup will be played in Potchefstroom, South Africa for the first time on the continent and Kenya hopes to be among the participants. The national junior team will need to go past the likes of Namibia, Ghana, Egypt, Zimbabwe and South Africa to confirm their slot on the global stage planned for later next year. South Africa have no advantage over the others despite being the host and must fight for the two available slots for Africa. “Our juniors have the opportunity to test themselves against the very best. South Africa played international friendlies before the pandemic struck and are likely to have a head start in terms of fitness,” she said. Sixteen teams will compete for the title in South Africa with Europe having six slots, Asia (3), Oceanic (2) and Pan America (3). The 2016 edition was won by Argentina(women) and India (men). Mwangi said players who played in the Youth Olympic Games in Argentina two years ago stand a better chance should they prove themselves. “We have a lot of good emerging talents who we are looking at. However, those who played in the five-a-side tournament will be in the driving seat.”
