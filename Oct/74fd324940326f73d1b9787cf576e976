Kilifi Senator Stewart Madzayo has urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to ignore Chief Justice David Maraga's calls for the dissolution of Parliament for failing to implement the two-thirds gender rule. Madzayo, who is a retired judge, said it was unfortunate that his senior colleague could issue such an advisory. ''The advice was ill-timed and uncalled for and the President should just ignore it and give Parliament a chance to relookÂ  what they are supposed to do," he said. Speaking on phone, Madzayo wondered how Law Society of Kenya president Nelson Havi could support the Chief Justice's advice. He said Havi does not want to listen to others yet in law it is clear that both parties must be heard instead of making irrational decisions. ''I think there is a need to consult more as the CJ may have given the impression that he cannot go to State House because he is not welcome. I do not think in my humble view that is the true picture," he said. He said dissolution of Parliament comes with so many things which the country is not ready for at this time. The senator also criticised Maraga's style of addressing the President through the press, saying it did not portray a good picture to the public about their relationship as they are supposed to work closely. "We know there is that 'we shall revisit' issue by the President but I don't think the President really meant it. I do not think the President has beef with Maraga,"he said. The senator said Maraga was on his way out to retirement and should not leave the country in a chaotic state.
