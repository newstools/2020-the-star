 The Kisumu dumpsite will be relocated from Kachok to Kasese next month after the county government bought a 207-acre property in Muhoroni. The relocation will be in the next 25 days, according to acting city manager Abala Wanga. The Sh34 million land has been handed over to the county government. Wanga said all waste generated in Kisumu will be directed to Kasese. He spoke after meeting Environment county executive Salmon Orimba. He said the management had set up new garbage collection points and promised the city would henceforth remain clean. Wanga appealed for cooperation from residents for ease of waste management. Kachok dumpsite has been notorious for haphazard waste management. In May, director of the Governor's Press Unit Aloice Ager said the Kasese land was ready for use, but the two roads leading to the site were in bad condition. This was prompted by public concern that heaps of garbage continued to grow at the Kachok dumpsite. Residents sought the assurance that Kachok would not revert to its previous garbage mountain despite the relocation of the dumpsite. Resident Mark Omondi said: “Even though the county government stated it had evacuated the dumpsite [Kachok], that was not the case. Dumping is being done at the site every day.” The county spent about Sh300 million to evacuate the eight-acre-mountain of solid waste that has been a thorn in the flesh of Kisumu residents for over 35 years.  - mwaniki fm
