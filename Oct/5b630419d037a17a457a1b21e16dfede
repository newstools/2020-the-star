Traders involved in the sale of repackaged food products without a Standardization Mark Permit risk seizure of their stock and prosecution, the Kenya Bureau of Standards has warned. “Various trading outlets, especially supermarkets, are illegally repackaging food products such as sugar, rice and cooking fat without meeting the requirements of product certification," Managing Director Bernard Njiraini warned. In a statement on Wednesday, Njiraini said all repackaged products are also required to comply with the labelling specifications of the respective Kenya Standards. Important information that must be incorporated on food product labels includes; the name of the product, list of ingredients, net content, name and address of the manufacturer, country of origin, date marking, and instructions for use and storage conditions. "We encourage the general public to “Wajibika Na Kebs” and be on the lookout for products suspected to be substandard and officers suspected to lack integrity," he added.
