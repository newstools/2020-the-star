Dismas Indiza was in imperious form on the Second Day of Vet Lab’s Safari Tour leg, where obliterated adversaries with his six stoke lead. The long-hitting Mumias pro fired a scintillating round of 4 under par 68 for 6 under par 138 gross. He now leads by six shots over Zimbabwe pro Robson Chinhoi, whose round of 1 under saw him go to bed yesterday with a gross total of level par 144. Greg Snow lies third after shooting 2 under par 70 yesterday. The score was a welcome relief for Snow, who managed 3 over par 75 on Sunday—not his kind of score on a good day. A happy Indiza said: “It’s unbelievable. The score has also surprised me as much as my opponents. I went onto the course with a positive mind, of course hungrier for success. I’m glad I’m now putting and shooting well. The game plan over the next two days is to keep my cool and hit the fairways more.” After two rounds of an action-packed Tour Golf, Indiza is the only golfer savouring an under par gross total. Indiza nevertheless noted that he will not be resting on his laurels. “Chinhoi has had a tendency of exploding in the latter stages of the event and I am not taking him lightly. I believe Snow will also fight back to make up for his Day One poor start,” added Indiza. Day One joint leader Nelson Simwa found the going tough with a round of 4 over par 76, which sunk him to fourth. Round 3 action resumes tomorrow morning with pros fighting for a share of Safari Tour slots. The event is being used as a yardstick to ascertain regional representatives to the European Tour Kenya Open Championship which will be held next year at Karen Country Club.  DAY 2 LEADER BOARD 1.
