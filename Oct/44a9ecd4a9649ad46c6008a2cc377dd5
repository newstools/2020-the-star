US Vice-President Mike Pence plans to maintain a busy election campaign schedule despite being exposed to a senior aide who has tested positive for Covid-19, his spokesman says. Donald Trump's running mate will not self-isolate, although he is a close contact of the VP chief of staff, Marc Short. Pence and his wife both tested negative on Sunday, his office said. Covid-19 has become a key battleground ahead of the 3 November election. About 57 million ballots have already been cast in early voting, a record figure largely spurred by the pandemic. Trump's Democratic challenger, former Vice-President Joe Biden, holds an average eight-point lead in national polls. But the race is much closer in several important swing states. What is happening with Mike Pence? Pence - who leads the White House Coronavirus Task Force - and his wife, Karen, remained "in good health", his spokesman Devin O'Malley said in a statement. "While Vice-President Pence is considered a close contact with Mr Short, in consultation with the White House Medical Unit, the vice-president will maintain his schedule in accordance with the CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] guidelines for essential personnel," he added. Those measures include regular monitoring for symptoms and mask-wearing. CDC guidelines also state that those who have had close contact with someone who has Covid-19 should self-isolate for 14 days. Speaking on CNN, White House chief of staff Mark Meadows said Mr Pence continued to perform "essential" duties as vice-president, but did not explain how his campaign activities could be classified as "essential". Mr Pence was seen wearing a mask as he returned to Washington DC following a day of campaigning in Florida on Saturday, and after the news of Mr Short's diagnosis was made public, AP news agency reports.
