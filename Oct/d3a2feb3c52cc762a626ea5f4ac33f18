Gospel singer Ben Githae on Sunday released a snippet of his song, said to centre around the Building Bridges Initiative. The short clip that surfaced on social media attracted the attention of many, who said he should not release the full track. Speaking to Word Is on Tuesday, Githae said he was requested to do a jingle for the BBI report launch ceremony that took place on Monday at Bomas of Kenya. "It was just a jingle but through the trolls, Kenyans have given me an idea to do a complete song," he said. "Even when I am asleep, Kenyans can't let me be. Who told them it is a song? But I will release one so they can feel satisfied." In the jingle titled Tuungane na BBI, Githae drums up support for the initiative, saying it will unite the country and foster patriotism. The jingle has a similar tune and beat as his latest track, Gukuagira Gukira. Githae is a staunch supporter of President Uhuru Kenyatta and is famous for Tano Tena, a song he released just before the 2017 general election. The song rallied support for President Uhuru Kenyatta as he sought a second term. It focused on the Head of State's development record, touching on various projects, among them the standard gauge railway, roads and free maternity. Githae said his affiliation to Jubilee is his democratic right and he should not be vilified. "I have a democratic right to support whoever I like and I have been doing political rallies since 2011 so it shouldn’t be an issue. I have not lost a fan. If I have then those are opposition supporters," he said. Githae said the amount of criticism the jingle received was nothing compared to the congratulatory messages.
