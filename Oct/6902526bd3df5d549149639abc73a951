Pastoralists in Northeastern have been advised to start selling their livestock to avoid losing them during the looming drought season. Kenya Livestock Marketing Council chairman Dubat Amey said on Monday that all indications are that drought is imminent in the coming weeks, hence the need to start preparing early. The October-December weather forecast for short rains indicates that counties in Eastern and Northeastern will receive below-average rainfall. The National Drought and Management Authority has already issued an alert over the deterioration in livestock body condition and milk production compared to July and August. A check by the Star at the livestock market in the region showed emaciated animals. A report prepared by the government agency further shows that the distance animals and residents have to travel in search of water is increasing by the day. Residents and livestock mostly rely on water pans, some of which have dried up. Speaking at the Garissa livestock market, Amey urged the government to truck water to areas where there is scarcity or water pans have dried up. He said the government should also move with speed and put in place measures to cushion pastoralists from losses, including starting the off-take programme. Amey further urged counties to set aside funds to tackle the drought. Already, Wajir has this financial year allocated Sh150 million to tackle drought. Amey further wants NDMA to ensure pastoralists get hay and drought pellets. In the past, over-concentration of people and livestock in certain areas have ended up causing conflicts among the pastoral communities as they compete for the limited resources. Last week, Wajir Governor Mohamed Abdi urged the national government and other partners to step in and help pastoralist communities as they brace themselves for drought. Edited by A.N
