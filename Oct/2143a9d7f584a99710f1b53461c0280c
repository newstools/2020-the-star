Kenya has backed Nigeria's Ngozi Okonji-Iweala for the WTO director general job after  Sports CS Amina Mohamed failed to get shortlisted for the final round. In a statement on Thursday, the Foreign Affairs ministry said that although Mohamed "was the most qualified candidate to steer WTO, we accept that the process has moved on without her." "Kenya expresses deep gratitude to all WTO Members for according Ambassador Amina Mohamed the utmost support throughout her campaign. The courtesies and valuable time availed to her, to meet all delegations and leaders, either in person or virtually; bilaterally or in the regional groupings, are most appreciated," it said. The Foreign Affairs ministry reminded the WTO membership that it was agreed that this would be Africa’s turn. "Kenya therefore throws its firm, unwavering support behind Ngozi Iweala of Nigeria, wishes her the best and expects the international community to abide by this important promise, as the two candidates proceed to the final round." Okonjo-Iweala is up against South Korea’s Yoo Myung-hee in the final round. Okonjo-Iweala has served as Nigeria’s finance minister and Foreign Affairs minister, while Yoo is South Korea's trade minister.
