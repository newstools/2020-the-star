Healthcare unions have threatened to oppose the BBI report on grounds that it failed to address their recommendations. Speaking in Nairobi on Thursday, the unions in a joint statement said in a quest to push for standardised management of human resources for health, they made a proposal to the task force to have a Health Service Commission formed in a move that was aimed at creating industrial harmony. They include KMPDU, KNUN, KUCO, KUND, KNPT, KHPS and KNUMLO. They have however noted that their recommendations were 'mutilated', saying what is contained in the released report is not what they wanted. The unions wanted a commission similar to TSC with the powers to hire, transfer and promote health workers but now claim the current document leaves powers with the governors. In their proposal to the task force, they had wanted human resources for health to be reverted to the national government in what they said will help address existing challenges that have existed in the health sector for long, including perennial industrial strikes. They have now threatened to move to court to stop the whole process until their recommendations are put into consideration. "I want to tell ordinary Kenyans that you have nothing in BBI. BBI comes to massage egos of politicians. Already almost 10 counties are threatening to go on strike because some of the workers have not been paid for three months," KNUN SG Seth Panyako said. "The journey has just begun. We will not sleep. If paralysing services in this country will make them listen to us then that is what we shall do." KMPDU SG Chibanzi Mwachonda said the HSC once in place will be in charge of recruitment, deployment, training, promotion and transfer of health care workers to ensure the function is not left at the mercy of governors.
