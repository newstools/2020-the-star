Reckitt Benckiser, the makers of Dettol, and Water.org hosted a Global Handwashing Day roundtable at KICC, Nairobi on Thursday. Reckitt Benckiser (RB) Group advanced Sh70 million towards providing Kenyan households with access to clean water as the first line of defence against the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. The funds, drawn from RB’s savings from its travel budget, will be provided to Water.org, which they will use to enable affordable financing for water and sanitation solutions to about 10,000 households in informal settlements and rural areas.
