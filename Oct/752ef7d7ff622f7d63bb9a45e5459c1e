One student has tested positive for coronavirus at the Friends School, KamusingaÂ  in Kimilili constituency, Bungoma County. The KCSE student is admitted at Webuye County Hospital isolation centre. Bungoma County Health CEC Antony Walela said that the results turned out positive after the samples were taken to Kenya Medical Research Institute (Kemri) laboratories for testing. "The school management reported to us that the student had depicted symptoms similar to those of a Covid-19 patient including high fever, headache, trembling, coldness and many more," said Walela. He said the school has over 400 students mainly in form four, preparing to sit their examination in March next year. "We have arranged to have all students, teachers and the subordinate staff to be tested and those found with corona will be isolated at Webuye Isolation Centre," he said. Walela said fumigation of all the buildings in the learning institution will be carried out to rid them of any virus. This comes at a time when Kenya National Union of Teachers (Knut) is calling on the government to be keen with reopening of schools to stop infecting teachers and students with Covid-19. Bungoma County Knut executive secretary Ken Nganga says there is no need to reopen schools when the number of people getting infected is rising daily. "We are not advocating for reopening of schools when the global pandemic is spiking everyday, the government needs to control the disease first before we allow our teachers and students back to class, we don't want them to get infected," warned the unionist.
