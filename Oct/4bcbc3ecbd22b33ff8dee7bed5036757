Popular Kalenjin secular singer Amon Kipkirui, 27, popularly known as ‘Rhino Kaboom’ has died in a grisly road accident. According to police sources, the musician's motorbike collided with a Probox Reg.No.KCB378S along the Emining-Eldama-Ravine road on Sunday night. “The incident occurred on a bend at Koitepes junction, some few kilometres off Saos trading centre,” a senior police officer told the Star on Monday. He said the artist crossed the right lane and was involved in a head-on collision with the oncoming Probox and died on the spot. The body of the deceased was taken to Eldama Ravine sub-county Hospital mortuary. However, the owner of the vehicle Zachary Kiprotich with his Wife Cynthia Kokwe escaped unhurt. “The road is a black spot marred with sharp corners and potholes,” the officer said urging the road users to be careful while driving. Big loss The sudden demise of Kipkirui, a young and promising superstar is a big loss to the Kalenjin entertainment industry. The community is still coming to terms with the loss of losing another popular single artist Weldon Cheruiyot popularly known as Kenene who passed away in 2017. Kenene also died in a road accident alongside six other musicians at Kamara along the Nakuru-Eldoret Highway on December 9, 2017. “The pain hasn't even healed yet. The increasing number of accidents costing lives of Kalenjin artists is worrying,” Baringo resident Zacharia Chesang said. Kaboom’s fans have sent their condolence messages to the family, friends and relatives of the young star at this difficult moment. His latest hits included ‘Monicah’, ‘Lulu’, ‘Daisy’ and ‘Birthday.’
