Public service vehicles and boda boda operators in Kwale county have been warned against violating Covid-19 and road safety rules. County police commander Joseph Nthenge said he would lead a major crackdown on PSVs contravening the law and have them grounded. He said a majority of PSVs have gone back to their normal routine of carrying passengers to full capacity. “The 14-seater PSVs carry more than the required number of passengers,” he said. Nthenge said the situation has continuously jeopardised the lives of residents as the number of infections in the country rises. The officer said most PSVs have stopped observing social distancing, regular sanitising of the interior of the vehicle and handwashing of passengers before boarding. Matatus plying the Kombani-Kwale route were identified as the most notorious. He said they are taking advantage of the few police checkpoints to violate the traffic and Covid-19 regulations. Nthenge also faulted residents for encouraging the vice. He said they do not report lawbreakers to the police for action to be taken against them. "The main problem is with the people, they participate in risking their lives and decide to remain silent," Nthenge said. The county police boss warned locals of community infection if they don't take the necessary precautions. By Monday, Kwale recorded 19 new Covid-19 infections. Msambweni had 17 and Lunga Lunga subcounty two. Nthenge said they will ensure people's safety and traffic rules are adhered to under regardless of the circumstances. Edited by A.N
