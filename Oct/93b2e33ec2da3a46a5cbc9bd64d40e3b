Women's hockey national team coach Jacqueline Mwangi wants the government to allow teams that are preparing for international assignments back in training. Kenya is set to host the rescheduled North East Africa hockey regional qualifiers for the African Cup of Nations between January 18-24, 2021 . The country will be represented by both the men and women's teams. The qualifiers were postponed in May because of coronavirus pandemic. Mwangi, a former Kenya international, lamented that time is running out and the sooner they get the all clear from the government to return to the field the better. "The government should allow normalcy to return in sports. There's a lot that is required for a team to perform well internationally hence the need for thorough training and team bonding. I therefore call for prompt action from the authorities." She said the girls are focused and ready to return to the field but they will have to abide by the guidelines set by the Sports Ministry and the Ministry of Health once hockey is cleared. "The girls are ready and we have been monitoring them closely. For a start, we can train as a group but observe the social distancing protocols." The women team will face Egypt, Burundi, Libya, Seychelles, Sudan, Tanzania and Uganda and the winner is expected to book a ticket to the Africa Cup of Nations in  October next year. Kenya Hockey Union (KHU) secretary general, Wycliffe Ongori, said the union is in contact with the Ministry of Sports and they are optimistic of reaching an agreement soon. "We have reached out to the ministry  and we are waiting for the go ahead. The sooner the better for all our teams." Some of the Kenya Premier League sides including Gor Mahia are back in training ahead of the Caf Champions League. Kariobangi sharks have also followed  suit and  athletics season is already ongoing.
