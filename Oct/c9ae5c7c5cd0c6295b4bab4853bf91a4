Hundreds of mourners ignored Covid-19 protocols and thronged the home of Kenya Defence Forces Major Nelson Oketch during his burial on Tuesday. Oketch died in a road accident on the Eldoret-Malaba highway near Sango Market in Webuye town. He was buried in military fashion during an emotional ceremony at his home in Webuye, Bungoma county. Some of his colleagues, led by Brigadier Aremi, the Commanding Officer of ARB76 headquartered in Isiolo, attended the burial and paid tribute to the fallen soldier. Aremi said Oketch will be remembered for his dedication and commitment. President Uhuru Kenyatta in a condolence message read by Brigadier Aremi eulogised Oketch as an industrious soldier who dedicated his energy to serving the nation diligently. The President said the military had lost an all-around player who suited in every work delegated to him by his seniors. Oketch, who was in his 30s, was involved in a road accident on October 3, just a day before his leave was to end. Widow Hyacinth Chayuga said her husband was a dedicated man who could not withstand seeing his family in problems. She said Oketch did everything he could to ensure is family was comfortable. Friends led by Isaac Wanjekeche said the soldier was a true friend who never showed off his status of work. Wanjekeche said Oketch interacted freely with everyone. Oketch had been promoted to the rank of Major a few months ago in appreciation of his commitment to work. He was given a 21-gun salute.
