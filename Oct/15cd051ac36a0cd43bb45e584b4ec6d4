An elderly couple in Kanjeru village, Kabete subcounty, Kiambu, lost eight sheep on Monday night after a leopard attacked. Residents now plan to make their own traps to catch the lone wild cat, which they say has been killing their livestock. They say they have been frustrated  by Kenya Wildlife Service officers because despite numerous reports made to them, they have not visited the area. The animals were injured in the throat and their blood suckled. Their carcasses were left lying in their shed. "This is total loss. This is not the first time to hear of such an attack. KWS are aware because we reported to them but we  have never seen them visiting this area," Nathaniel Njoroge at Francis Njenga's farm. Residents came in large numbers to witness the loss. "We did not hear anything, so I cannot tell you exactly the hour the wild animal came," Njenga said. They say last week, other four sheep were attacked in the same village and their blood suckled from the neck and their carcasses left in the shed. They say they fear going very far from homes at night in fear of being attacked by the animal. "Our dogs keep barking at night, and at times they sound as if they are crying. Those night noises make us feel that the wild animal is loitering around," Salome Nyokabi added.
