The government has announced a national training programme targeting boda boda riders across the county, which will be facilitated through NYS. ICT CS Joe Mucheru made the announcement on Thursday after meeting with the boda boda leadership and partners. “I am very pleased to announce that NYS represented by Council chair Njuki Mwaniki is here in preparation for the rollout of national training of all boda boda riders who require not only safety training, but also on how to behave on the roads,” Mucheru said. The CS said that the government hopes to complete the programme in the next few months to ensure riders obtain essential skills and licences. The programme will cost Sh750 per rider. Njuki said that boda boda sector is one of the biggest industries that has transformed the country. He said that the training will be rolled out to cover all constituencies and the main objectives include enforcing discipline and obedience to traffic laws and the highway code. President Uhuru Kenyatta met with the boda boda leaders last Friday, and promised that his administration was committed to supporting them. The President had also given a commitment that the government will give the boda boda association’s investment scheme full support. Uhuru had emphasized the need for the industry to adhere to traffic and safety rules for the protection of lives and assets.
