Mwingi West MP Charles Nguna has told proponents of the Building Bridges Initiative not to push the report into a referendum as Kenyans are struggling for their daily bread. Nguna says Kenyans should be allowed to read and digest the report without intimidation. He said all the proposed changes to the Constitution could be achieved through Parliament, so that Kenyans do not incur unnecessary government expenditure. Speaking at Lutune in Bondoni Location where he launched construction of a dam in partnership with the National Irrigation Authority, the legislator said the BBI report raised pertinent issues which ought to be discussed, with devolution being the greatest beneficiary. Nguna pointed out the proposed Ward Development Fund, which he said would be of great importance to the development of marginalised areas. However, he said, a robust discussion is needed in order to amend the report and align it with the needs of Kenyans. New posts proposed in the BBI report will increase the public wage bill, he said.
