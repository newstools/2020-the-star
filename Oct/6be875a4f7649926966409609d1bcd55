Tiktok comedian Tracy Waithera has unveiled a brand coaching deal with an accomplished corporate trainer, Hannah Githuki. Tracy rose to popularity thanks to her Kikuyu Tiktok videos, leading to her appearance in various local TV shows and music videos. Speaking to Word Is, Tracy said she wants to grow her brand. "I have just launched my brand TW, so this training will help me get to the next level. "There is a big difference between being famous and building a brand that makes money." Hannah is CEO of Insideout Development and the author of 'Flaunt Your Genius', a practical brand-building workbook. Tracy will be taken through a one-on-one brand building training similar to that given to big corporate executives. "Entertainment is a career like any other we must equip our performers with the tools they require to be successful," Githuki said.
