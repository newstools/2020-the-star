Infinix, a global leader in consumer electronics market, has launched the ZERO 8 in the Kenyan market. ZERO 8 is the company’s flagship series for 2020/21. Though targeting the high-end market, Zero 8 will retail at a relatively affordable price of Kshs 28,999. The launch has been conducted in partnership with Sally Karago, a renowned international fashion designer. This partnership with a high-end designer is geared towards raising the Infinix’s brand position and perception in the market as a high end phone. This is also part of a broader push to combine tech with fashion to create products that are a fusion of design and innovation. “Infinix is taking a step to be more premium and able to compete and be the face of this new direction as a fashion-conscious brand. This direction is very much in tandem with our target customers, whose lifestyle can be described as image and fashion-conscious and trendy, with a taste for high end gadgets”, said Mike Zhang, the Kenyan Brand Manager. Using her international acclaim and experience, Sally has designed garments for the three celebrities who graced the launch, namely the gorgeous songstress Tanasha Donna, celebrated chef Ali Mandhry and Catherine Kamau, an award-winning actress. Inspired by the Turkana culture, Sally’s fashion collection has been made using local African fabrics and beads for accessories (all drawn from the Turkana culture). The design features diamond-shaped elements which are the main design concept for the Zero 8 smartphone. The accessories, including beads, also drawn from Sally’s Turkana collection experience, feature the main color of the brand, which are green, black, and white.
