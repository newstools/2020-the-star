The Directorate of Criminal Investigations detectives has launched a probe into an incident where six suspects were nabbed and hundreds of mobile phones recovered in Nairobi. According to the DCI, two of the suspects were initially arrested in connection to an increase in burglary cases reported at Karuri area in Kiambu County. Macheme Rodgers Julius and Ukwale Ben Sirira who are both foreign nationals were nabbed on Wednesday morning by a combined team of DCI sleuths and officers based at Kihara Police post. Interrogation of the duo led detectives to a phone repair shop in Eastleigh where hundreds of assorted mobile phones and laptops suspected to be stolen were recovered.
