Covid has hit the IEBC with many seriously ill and some reported deaths. Similarly, Kilifi and other county administrations have been affected. ICU beds in hospitals across the country are rapidly filling up. A 'second wave' of Covid infections is sweeping across Kenya. This may be linked to the relaxation of Covid restrictions in September but it is primarily due to the complacency of citizens who believe that coronavirus is no longer a danger. People have become too casual about protecting themselves. Covid-19 remains a serious threat to Kenyans, especially those who are older or heavier. The death rate is around three percent and it is highly infectious. Africa has been less hard-hit by Covid than Europe and America. Much of our life is in the open air and there is increasing evidence that Covid is mainly spread by 'aerosols' or droplets in the air. So if you wear a mask, you are less likely to spread Covid if you are infected. And you are less likely to catch Covid, if you wear a mask. Wearing a mask is your social responsibility. It protects you and protects others. Quote of the day: "Women work harder. And women are more honest; they have less reasons to be corrupt."
