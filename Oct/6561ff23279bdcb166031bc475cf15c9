Opposition chief Raila Odinga has told Kenyans to be ready for BBI, stating it is just a matter of days before the document is made public. Raila drumming support for the document, touted as the solution to country's problems, said together with President Uhuru Kenyatta they will soon receive the document and make it public. "The second report is ready and within few days we will make it public," Raila said. The opposition chief was speaking during a church service at United Ministries Church in Kawangware. He was accompanied by MPs Simba Arati (Dagoretti North), George Aladwa (Makadara), Denitta Agati (nominated), Elisha Odhiambo (Gem), Mpuri Aburi (EALA MP), Geterude Musuruve (nominated senator), Justus Kizito ( Shinyalu) and Maina Kamanda (nominated). While Raila attended service, there was chaos in Kenol, Murang'a, where Deputy President William Ruto attended a fundraiser. Chaos erupted at Kenol as pro-Tangatanga and pro-Kieleweke groups clashed. Two buses with youths landed in the town in the morning and proceeded to AIPCA church and started throwing stones into its compound. This in turn angered Kenol residents who came out in large numbers and repulsed the youths towards the Kenol-Thika highway where they eventually cornered and beat them up.
