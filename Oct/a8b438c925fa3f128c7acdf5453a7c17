Wiper boss Kalonzo Musyoka has warned against the framing of Msambweni by-elections to appear like a contest between Deputy President William Ruto and ODM leader Raila Odinga. Kalonzo said the duo should be ready for a political shock at the polls. Speaking when he unveiled party candidate for the Msambweni seat - Mohamud Abdulrakman, at the Wiper House, Kalonzo said the party is prepared to turn the tides in the December 15 polls. He dismissed as misleading framing that the contest will be a battle between Ruto and Raila. "We don't doubt his popularity in Msambweni. We have no doubt that we have the right candidate," Kalonzo said. "We must tell these framers, we have a serious candidate and we will defeat both of them. They are in for a shock." Wiper also unveiled candidates for Wundanyi Mbale Ward in Taita Taveta county and Kahawa Wendani in Kiambu county. Kalonzo added the Public Order Act restricting assemblies will fall when taken to court. He noted Kenyans should be treated equally and that POA should not be used to settle political scores. Kalonzo last month dismissed allegations that Msambweni is an ODM stronghold. Kalonzo said since Jubilee doesn't have a candidate they can combine forces to get victory. "We are in competition with ODM and because our colleagues have no one, I suggest to them to assist us," he said. Kalonzo said Wiper will soon conquer the Coast region and lock out ODM.
