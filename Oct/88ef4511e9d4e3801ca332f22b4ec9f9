More than 5, 000 residents of West Kasipul will begin using Nyiwir Bridge on River Awach after funds were raised towards its construction. For more than a decade, residents have been crossing the river using a bridge made of logs. This has caused some residents and livestock to lose lives. Three people and more than 10 cattle have died due to lack of a proper bridge since 2012. The persons fell from the bridge into the river. They include Michael Amolo, a Class 3 pupil at Kalanding Primary School, who drowned on his way to school. Nyiwir bridge connects a number of villages in the area to Kalanding primary, Kalanding secondary, Nyakiya secondary, Nyakiya  primary, Nandi primary and God Kwach primary schools. This made the residents make a temporary wooden bridge, which is being used. On Thursday, some residents held a fundraiser to get cash to construct a permanent bridge. Lake Basin Development Authority Chairman Odoyo Owidi, former Kasipul MP Oyugi Magwanga and former Homa Bay Trade executive Carelus Ademba presided  over the fundsdrive. The leaders and residents raised more than Sh705,000. Owidi said the construction will begin soon. He said they could not watch people continue  losing their lives. The chairman argued that they decided to intervene in the bridge construction, even though it is a county function. “The county government has been in existence for more than seven years but residents have been suffering. We cannot watch them suffering anymore,” Owidi said. The chairman criticised some political leaders who did not want the bridge constructed for unknown reasons. Magwanga said the initiative will uplift academic standards in the area. “It is very sad that pupils fail to go to school during rainy seasons because of this river. That is why we have joined hands to rescue the residents from the tribulations,” Magwanga said. Ademba said the bridge will improve economic standards by helping farmers access markets for their produce. Edited by EKibii
