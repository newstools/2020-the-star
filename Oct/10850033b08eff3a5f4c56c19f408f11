As lecturers drawn from the Department of College of Health Sciences continue with their strike, University of Nairobi vice chancellor Stephen Kiama has assured students that their graduation will not be affected. In a statement on Friday, Kiama said the varsity Senate and management will ensure students complete and graduate as scheduled on December 11, 2020. The VC met students from the College of Health Sciences and heard their grievances. “They want to complete their studies and graduate.  These students are concerned that we have teachers who do not work, yet they expect to be paid,” Kiama said. He said that the students will prepare for exams and the Senate will ensure that they do exams later in the month as scheduled. Kiama has also said that the university is committed to paying the clinical allowances as it is in the terms of service. “We have been paying and will continue to pay but we will not pay clinical allowances to those who are not reporting to the hospitals to treat patients and supervise students in the wards. These students need their consultants.” He added that, “252 members of staff from the College of Health Sciences have been cleared for payment because they are fulfilling their clinical duties.” The VC has further said that the UoN Council has approved a whistleblower policy which will be released immediately to all stakeholders. A section of UoN lecturers begun their strike On October 8 over the failure of their employer to pay clinical allowances. Striking lecturers had said that the aim of the strike is to demand the immediate reinstatement of their Clinical Allowances, and a framework that ensures that in future, the payments shall not be subject to the whims of management.
