Police in Homa Bay are investigating the Thursday night murder of a man in Kanyach Kachar Location by unknown gunmen. Walter Kwama, 32, was shot dead at their home in Maguje village by people who allegedly identified themselves as police. Family members said two armed men in police uniforms knocked on Kwama’s parents’ door and identified themselves as officers. They then asked where Kwama was. Upon opening the door, Kwama approached from his house, where he had retired after supper, as the men talked to his mother so he could eavesdrop on the conversation. But when he tried to run back to his house, another group of people blocked his path. His family said Kwama was then briefly questioned by the assailants before being shot. Kanyach Kachar chief Bernard Omuga told journalists the attackers left after the shooting. “The report I got is that the victim was asked to identify himself. He was shot and died on the spot,” Omuga said. Homa Bay subcounty deputy police boss James Mugo who led a team of officers to the scene said Kwama was shot twice in the chest. He said investigations into the incident are ongoing. “We have not established who killed the man. We ask residents to cooperate with police officers in eradicating criminal activities in society,” Mugo said. The body was picked by police officers on Friday morning and taken to Homa Bay County Teaching and Referral Hospital mortuary.
