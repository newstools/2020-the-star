Florybert, alias Redpen, is set to release his second album, 'Faithful God', at end-month. Known for his great vocals, the artiste who also doubles as a guitarist, told Word Is 70 per cent of the album is solemnly inspired by his life. "[It reflects on] the far that God has brought me and my gratitude for His presence in my life," he said. Redpen hopes the album will touch souls and inspire our generation. In a past interview with Word Is, Redpen said he was brought up by a single mother after his parents separated. In search of greener pastures, the artiste with Congolese roots found his way to Kenya in 2013. He started as a songwriter in the Kenyan music industry and has worked with several artistes, among them Vicmass Luodollar, Collo and the late Papa Dennis. The album has 14 songs, featuring different artistes.
