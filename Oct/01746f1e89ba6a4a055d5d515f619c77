Harambee Stars centre half Brian Mandela is optimistic they will reap positive results when they host Zambia this Friday at the Nyayo Stadium. The match, initially set for the Moi Stadium, Kasarani will kick off at 4pm behind closed doors. The team, which largely comprise of local-based players, held two training sessions yesterday to boost the fitness levels ahead of the match which will test the team's readiness for the November qualifier double against Comoros. Mandela, a former assistant skipper, said the morale at the residential camp in Kasarani was commendable and his teammates were raring to go having stayed out of international matches for more than six months. The towering defender, who is almost a sure bet for the starting team owing to his experience, will face stiff competition from Simba's hard man Joash Onyango, Wazito's Johnstone Omurwa and Sweden based Joseph Okumu. Similarly, coach Francis Kimanzi is confident of a win having assessed the players for the last two days. Kimanzi will be glad that all the players named in the final 23 man squad have reported to camp apart from the duo of Okumu and debutant Clarke Oduor who plies his trade for English side, Barnsley. "We are trying to capitalise on the players’ competitive side to yield a positive result in the friendly match,” observed the former Mathare United tactician.
