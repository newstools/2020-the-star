BBI joint secretary Martin Kimani has been accused of trying to intimidate MPs vetting him for the position of permanent representative to the UN in New York by listing President Uhuru Kenyatta as one of his referees. Mandera North MP Abdullah Bashir on Thursday questioned what informed the listing of the President as a reference point, knowing very well he is not only the appointing authority, but also the Head of State. “Why did you choose to list President Uhuru as your reference or are you trying to intimidate us?" Posed Bashir. However, in his response, Kimani who was part of the team which delivered the BBI report, apologised to MPs for listing the President who cannot easily be reached for comment on his character. “I thought they (referees) are people who know my character and in particular to this assignment. I commit to provide another name,” Kimani said. Kimani appeared before the National Assembly’s Defence and Foreign relations Committee chaired by Kajiado South MP Katoo Ole Metito. Kimani was among a list of people nominated by Uhuru on October 15 for diplomatic postings. Others included Consolata Nkatha, Margaret Mwachanya  and Paul Kurgat, who were nominated to be deputy mission heads for Rome, Islamabad and Moscow respectively. The three resigned from the IEBC in April 2018, saying they had no confidence in chairman Wafula Chebukati.
