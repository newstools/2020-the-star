Deputy President William Ruto has accused people within Jubilee of being behind the chaos witnessed at Kenol, Murang'a, on Sunday. "Watu waliotuma watu kutuma teagas ni watu wanaofanya kazi chini yetu. (Those who sent these goons to unleash teargas on us were sent by leaders working under us.)," he said. "The Jubilee administration is a product of kneeling and prayer before many alters in Kenya. It can not be the same administration that is now going to teargas the church and disgrace our alters in Kenya," he said. He spoke on Sunday after a church service at AIPCA church in Kenol which began in chaos as pro-Tangatanga and pro-Kieleweke groups clashed. Two buses with youths landed in the town in the morning and proceeded to AIPCA church and started throwing stones into its compound. This in turn angered Kenol residents who came out in large numbers and repulsed the youths towards the Kenol-Thika highway where they eventually cornered and beat them up. Some of the youths who had thrown stones said they had been mobilised by politicians with the promise of receiving Sh1,000 pay. Meanwhile, Ruto announced government plans to revamp Kenol town in Murang'a County into a city. "In our many plans and in collaboration with Kenol leaders, we agreed that we should transform this town into a city because it is the centre of all business in Murang'a," he said. "In order to achieve that, we have released funds hired contractors to established a sewage system in Kenol." Ruto further announced the construction of a dual carriageway from Kenol through Sagana all the way to Maroa The project, he said will cost Sh40 billion.
