Unicef has donated solar-powered lights, radios and learning materials to 1,500 vulnerable families in Garissa to enable children to continue learning. The donations will help the children catch up with others who have been learning via radio, television and online during the Covid-19 period. On Monday, the United Nations Children’s Fund-Kenya and the Garissa county government started the distribution of the items in Sankuri. The exercise is set to continue across other vulnerable households in Garissa. Since schools were ordered closed in mid-March, many students, especially from rural and vulnerable households, have been unable to access online learning materials due to lack of internet connectivity and devices. A report by Unicef on remote learning shows that one in three children has missed out on remote learning during school closures. Titled ‘Are Children Able to Continue Learning During School Closures?’ Unicef says that three-quarters of schoolchildren without access to remote learning live in rural areas. “For at least 463 million children whose schools closed due to Covid-19, there was no such a thing as remote learning,” Unicef executive director Henrietta Fore said. Even when children have the technology and tools at home, they may not be able to learn remotely through the available platforms due to competing factors at home. The factors include pressure to do chores, being forced to work, a poor environment for learning, and lack of support in using the online or broadcast curriculum. There are also fears that children in the Northeastern region could be engaging in drug abuse. Edited by A.N
