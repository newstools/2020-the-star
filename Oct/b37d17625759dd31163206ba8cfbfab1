A family of an eight-year-old girl who was allegedly sodomised by her uncle last month wants the man arrested and prosecuted. The victim's mother says her daughter had gone to visit her aunt in Nyambare village on September 24 when the incident occurred. The family lives in Limuru. The mother noted that the girl was limping and when she enquired about the problem, she narrated her ordeal at the hands of the uncle. They reported the matter at Limuru town police station and the girl was taken to Nairobi Women's Hospital where she stayed for two weeks. "Now the girl is in diapers and at times she uses potty while relieving herself during a call of nature. She was sodomised by a person known to her," she said. An officer from Limuru children's office George Ngugi says they have followed up the case, but the suspect has never been arrested. "No justice for the little girl will be realised if the suspect will not be arrested. This is a crime and police are dragging their feet to arrest the suspect, the girl is still in pain," Ngugi said. Efforts to get a comment from Limuru division police boss Joseph Ireri were futile as he was attending a seminar at Kiganjo Police Training College. However, a police officer investigating the incident said the file was forwarded to the Director of Public Prosecutions for further directions. "We are waiting for instructions from the DPP," said the officer, who requested anonymity. However, Peter Mwangi, a resident, dismissed the claim, saying the police ought to have arrested the suspect and arraigned him. Mwangi said nothing should stop the case as the girl can identify the suspect. There are also a P3 form and statements recorded by different people, he added.
