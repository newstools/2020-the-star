The case of the Westgate terror suspects has been adjourned to Friday next week for sentencing. This is after the probation officer told the court on Thursday that the pre-sentencing report is not ready as they are yet to interview some of the victims. Probation Officer Peter Macharia said they have interviewed the two suspects Mohammed Ahmed Abdi and Hussein Hassan Mustafa. He said he had also talked with the accused persons' relatives and one Westgate victim. Macharia said the report will be ready by next week to help Magistrate in the sentencing of the two suspects. The court, however, ordered the press not to cover any of the victims' impact statements that have been produced in court. Chief Magistrate Francis Andayi warned the media not to cover the statements. The statements will help the court determine the sentence of the two accused persons. The two were earlier this month found guilty of conspiracy to commit a terrorist act. One of the accused Liban Abdullahi Omar was acquitted for lack of evidence but was later abducted after being set free. Lawyers told the court that Omar who was acquitted by Andayi was abducted a day later by unknown gunmen when in the company of his sister. The prosecution said they are aware of the incident and informed the court that investigations are ongoing into the same. Omar was a brother to one of the attackers and chief Magistrate Francis Andayi had earlier ruled that the communication between him and his brother does not prove that he conspired to attack Westgate Mall.
