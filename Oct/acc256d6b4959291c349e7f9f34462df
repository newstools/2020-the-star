BBI proposals will help counties that have lagged behind in development to catch up with the rest of the country, ANC nominated MP Godfrey Osotsi has said. He said increasing the disbursement counties without pegging it on approved audited figures would more than double allocations to the counties, most which are unable to develop due to lack of funds. "Most counties are faced with budgetary constraints because some spent over 80 per cent of their revenue on recurrent [expenditure] leaving no money for development," he said. He said the establishment of the Ward Development Fund will free MCAs from manipulation by governors and ensure uniform development in the counties. He said the proposals will strengthen devolution by ensuring disbursement of more funds and ensure effective oversight of the county executives by independent MCAs. Osotsi said the proposed expansion of the Executive and reintroduction of Official Leader of Opposition will ensure participation in governance by the losers in elections. “For example, a region like Western was used to having more than five Cabinet ministers but today there is none. In the expanded Executive, we have the opportunity to go for the top seat and if we don’t make it, there is still a change to get one of the five positions,” he said. The report recommends increasing capitation for counties from the current 15 per cent to 35 per cent, creation of a ward fund that will receive five per cent of all county revenues, creation of positions of prime minister, two deputies and the office of official opposition leader. Osotsi said the proposed seven-year tax holiday for youth in business and creation of a youth commission will ensure  their empowerment in a structured manner for posterity. He said those opposed to the report were doing so for personal aggrandisement and should be ignored. He reiterated that those with genuine reservations can present their proposals during public participation by Parliament. Eliud Kibii
