A barber who used a kitchen knife to inflict deep cut injuries on his workmate's chin was on Monday charged with assault. Silus Makori was charged before Kibera senior principal magistrate Phillip Mutua where he denied the charges. According to the police investigations, Phillip Otieno arrived at his place of work where he met Makori and demanded his shaving machine but the accused person ignored him. He then sat outside the barber shop waiting for the owner of the shop. It is at this point that Makori took a kitchen knife and used it to inflict deep cut injuries on his chin. His friends came to his rescue and rushed him to a nearbyÂ  hospital where he was treated and later reported the matter to the police. Makori was released on Sh 30,000 bond with the surety of the same amount. The case will be mentioned on November 11.
