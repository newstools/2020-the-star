You are less likely to catch the coronavirus in an airplane if you take a window seat. That's what a top Kenyan respiratory physician says. Dr Jeremiah Chakaya also explains why you are more likely to contract Covid-19 at the airport than inside the plane. Chakaya, the immediate former president of the International Union against  Tuberculosis and Lung Disease, says most commercial aircraft have intrinsically clean air. He says the air inside is collected from outside, normally through the engine, and mixed with recycled air in the cabin in a ratio of 1:1 and passed through high-efficiency particulate air filters. "The flow of air, which is vertically downwards from above a passenger's head to below his/her feet, is designed to minimise the risk of infection," he says in an article he co-authored with two other scientists. However, Dr Chakaya says this flow of air can be disrupted by passengers leaving their seats to check the overhead bins or visiting the lavatory or cabin crew moving up and down the plane. He explains why it is safer to choose a window seat, even though plane windows do not roll down. The advisory was published last week by the journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, owned by the University of Oxford. "During a commercial flight, individual contacts tend to be greatest for those in aisle seats, less so in middle seats and least in window seats," the advisory says. "Additionally, there is substantially more passenger movement on long international flights compared with short-hop flights. These movements and person-to-person contacts during a flight can facilitate infectious disease transmission." The co-authors are Anthony Harries from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Leonardo Martinez of US's Stanford University. To date, there are few publications of coronavirus transmission during flight. The first person to test positive for Covid-19 in Kenya is believed to have been infected during transit on a flight from the US, through London, to Nairobi. "However, given the infection potential associated with TB, influenza and SARS, all largely spread through respiratory droplets, the risk is there and precautions need to be taken," the authors say. They advise travellers to wear well-fitting face masks throughout a flight and face shield, sanitise regularly and to take all other health precautions. Flyers should also avoid queuing for washrooms and request to change seats if a passenger in adjacent rows is coughing or symptomatic. The scientists note flying involves also queuing for check-in, immigration and security at the departure airport; and queuing for possible health checks, immigration, luggage collection and customs at the arrival airport. "All of these bring passengers into close contact with one another and with contact surfaces that may be riskier than the inside of the airplane cabin," they say.
