The Jubilee Advisory Council, a body bringing together leaders of parties that merged to form JP has backed a decision to remove DP Ruto as Deputy Party leader. In a statement on Friday, Albert Nyaundi, the chair of the council accused the DP of "suffering from acute superiority complex". "Any other member can replace him as the Deputy Party leader," he said. According to Nyaundi, who was the leader of Ford People, the DP needs to be reminded that he came into the Jubilee conglomerate with his URP which was one of twelve parties. "URP cannot ride roughshod on the other eleven member parties. If he feels that the conglomerate is not being run to his satisfaction, then all he can do is to walk out and leave the other parties in peace," he said. This follows the announcement by Jubilee Secretary General Raphael Tuju barring Ruto from accessing party headquarters a day after he stormed the Pangani offices with over 30 MPs. The decision was reached after a National Management Committee meeting on Friday. The party's NEC is expected to meet to adopt the same recommendation. Shortly after the Tuju's announcement, a section Ruto allies hit back saying they will not allow the party to be run as a private entity for selfish gains. They said they would continue meeting and engaging at the outfit’s offices in Pangani to further the party’s agenda of transforming and uniting the country Ruto's allies made their comments on Friday in Nakuru during the funeral service of Esther Toyoi Kipkuna, the mother to the National Olympic Committee of Kenya President Paul Tergat, where Ruto was present.
