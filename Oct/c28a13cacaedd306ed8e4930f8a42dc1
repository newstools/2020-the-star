Electricity has finally been restored on the Lamu mainland after several months of total blackout. Over 700 households in Heshima, Hongwe, Tewa, Sese, Bomani, Msafuni and surrounding areas in Mpeketoni have been without electricity since  May this year. According to the Lamu KPLC business manager Benard Kataka, the prolonged blackout was occasioned by the explosion of several transformers serving the areas. Speaking in Lamu on Thursday, Kataka said the transformers have since been replaced and power restored. He said transformers serving those specific lines had been blowing up from time to time. “The biggest challenge has been in sourcing for the specific transformers like those ones because they have been out of stock countrywide. We, however, received the consignment and have fixed the problem. All villages are now lit again,” Kataka said. Villagers had reported increased crime during the entire period of the prolonged blackout. The incidents have gone down since power was restored. Residents of Manda island have urged the government to conduct speedy connectivity of the island to the power grid. Manda island is made up of Manda Airport, Ras Kitau and Manda-Maweni all of which have been without electricity for ages. Last month, however, the Rural Electrification and Renewable Energy Corporation announced that they will be implementing a Sh100 million power connection to the island for the first time since Independence. About 10 transformers are to be installed in the areas. The project is expected to open up the tiny island to more trade, business and investment opportunities. The project is also expected to lower crime and insecurity as local gangs had taken advantage of the darkness to rob and maim residents and visitors. Edited by Henry Makori
