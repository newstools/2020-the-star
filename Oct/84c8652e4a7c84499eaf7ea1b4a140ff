Vihiga United captain Patrick Okullo has said he is ready to lead his side to securing a return to the top flight when normalcy returns. “I believe we are in good frame of mind and ready for the play-off this weekend. We just need to double up our efforts and sacrifice in order to realise our objective as a team,” he said. “I have the experience of playing in Kenya Premier League with this team and I believe we deserve to be there. I guess it will give us a good platform to showcase what we have as players,” he added. He urged team-mates to remain focused and not underestimate the opponent in this weekend's match. Okullo showered his teammates with praise for their exploits in the past season and further thanked club chairman Kahi Indimuli and the entire technical bench for going out of their way to ensure the team honours their matches. "I have confidence in our coach Sammy Okoth and the team management and I am sure they can take us to the next level,” he added. He said the task ahead of them requires sound preparations and a focused playing unit. Vihiga finished third behind Nairobi City Stars and Bidco United in the 2019-2020 National Super Leagues to book a place in the playoff.
