The Kenya High Commission in the United Kingdom has written to the UK authorities over a disturbing video of police officers assaulting a Kenyan in Colchester, Essex. A clip of police officers assaulting an unarmed man identified as Wycliff Cox went viral. In the clip, five police officers in uniform are seen at the scene, four surrounding the man who was lying on the ground. Another police officer is seen blocking some women who were protesting against their actions. One of the women is heard shouting that the victim was nose bleeding. "He is bleeding from the nose." “The High Commission has already communicated with the UK Government raising the Government of Kenya’s concerns on the unnecessary force on an unarmed man,” the commission said. It added that it has been in constant communication with the family and assured them of the government’s support as they seek justice. The commission added that the Kenyan government will ensure that thorough investigation and justice is done. “And also, that all involved be held to account for their actions according to UK police conduct and regulations.”
