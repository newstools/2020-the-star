Water CS Sicily Kariuki has convened a meeting of theÂ  national and county governments and the contractor to come up with a work plan to revive the stalled Sh7 billion Lower Nzoia irrigation project. Speaking on Friday after an inspection tour of the project in Siaya and Bunyala in Busia county, the CS said the meeting scheduled for Monday will be chaired by the regional commissioner. It will agree on strategy to save the project that has dragged on for 13 years. The project has encountered a lot of frustrations in terms of delays yet it is one of the government's flagship projects in the region. Sicily said the Monday meeting will be attended by an officer from the National Land Commission which has been blamed for the delays in compensating landowners. She told the contractor who had asked for an extension to 2022 to complete the project by June next year. Busia Deputy Governor Moses Mulomi said the Lower Nzoia irrigation project will enable the residents living along River Nzoia get water for irrigation. He said this will allow the county to produce adequate rice for local consumption and for export. Edited by Henry Makori
