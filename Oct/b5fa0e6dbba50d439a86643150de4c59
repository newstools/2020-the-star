Two days before the long awaited Football Kenya Federation (FKF) National elections get underway Presidential running mate Innocent Mutiso has made a last minute plea that his candidature with Boniface Osano would end the feeling of exclusion currently being felt by  several stakeholders. Mutiso noted with concern the decision for some individuals to form rival football counties against the dictates of the current FKF Constitution. “It’s a pity that counties like Makueni and Mombasa have started their own FA’s and It looks very bad on the current regime. Our regime will create a conducive environment to partner such goodwill for football instead of fighting them. "Youth programmes like Extreme Super 8 league and Chapa Dimba are great initiatives that need the blessings of the federation rather than a backlash. This will empower our branches and make grass root football vibrant and lucrative,” the former international promised. Osano will go head to head against incumbent Nick Mwendwa, Herbert Mwachiro, Lodwick Aduda and Dan Mule. Despite misgivings from several quarters most notably former federation president Sam Nyamweya and former Cecafa secretary general, Nicholas Musonye, the elections are likely to go full speed ahead. The Football Kenya Federation (FKF) elections board led by Kentice Tikolo successfully held the branch elections four weeks ago paving the way for the national polls to elect the federation president alongside members of the national executive—NEC officials and women representatives.
