Kikuyu elders have performed a ritual to allow a contractor to cut down a decades-old Mugumo tree in Ngarariga village in Limuru to pave way for the expansion of a road. The Kiama kia Ma elders pleaded with the sacred tree to accept to be cut down for development. After conducting the service under the tree, the elders said it had accepted to be cut down by the contractor. Elder Njoroge wa Kamau said the tree will be cut down for a good course, saying no one is allowed to cut it or fetch firewood until rituals are performed by seers. The service was conducted on Friday and led by Muthamaki Njathi wa Mbatia and Limuru elders subcounty chairman Mbugua wa Mbiyu. Ngarariga chief Michael Kang'ethe oversaw the exercise. Bibirioni MCA Jackie Nungari urged locals to remove fences, kiosks and other structures which have been marked for demolition to accommodate the expansion of the road. "Women do not attend those activities no matter how important they are. They are important for the development of our country," she said. On Monday, Nungari said the 4km road will be done by the State Department for Planning and Urban Development and Slum Upgrading. It will pass from Ngarariga bus stop along the Nairobi-Nakuru highway, through the trading centre and back to the highway at Gitogothi road. Nungari said that the road is aimed at opening the area and easing movement to the Level 4 hospital which is under construction.
