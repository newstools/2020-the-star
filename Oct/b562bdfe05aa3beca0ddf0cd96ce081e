Tourism CS Najib Balala has said that the ministry will now invest in the global recognition brought by Kenyan athletes. “Our athletes make a big name for us overseas whenever they win, especially marathons. That is why we shall put a team to document all athletes in Kenya since independence to honour them. We will use these athletes to promote tourism in the country.” Balala said. He spoke on Sunday when he toured training facilities and attractions in Uasin Gishu, Nandi, and Elgeyo Marakwet. The CS acknowledged that apart from the Big 5 which are Kenya's prime tourist attractions, the destination image is globally recognized for her athlete’s prowess. At the Global Sports Centre, Kaptagat, Elgeyo Marakwet County, where Eliud Kipchoge trains the CS pledged to engage with the Ministry of Environment to improve the training forest road in Kaptagat. He also committed to channeling resources for the compacting of the training field at the center so as to raise it to international standards. This comes hours after Kipchoge participated in the 40th London Marathon where he emerged position eight. The four-times London Marathon winner said he developed hearing problems after the first 25 kilometers of the race. He posted in his Twitter account that one of his ears blocked, and it could not open anymore.
