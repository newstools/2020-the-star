Kenya Premier League side, Kakamega Homeboyz have recruited five new players as part of their restructuring  process ahead of the new season. The club’s team manager, Boniface Imbenzi, revealed that the club has acquired services of Abdalla Shaberi, goalkeeper Samuel Odhiambo both from Stima;  Derrick Onyango (Sharks), midfielder Brian Munyendo and striker  Derrick Onyango (Sharks). Homeboyz have also extended the contract for Shami Mwinyi, whom they termed as one of the key players in their plans next season. “As we await directions from the Ministry of Sports and Football Kenya Federation, we saw it good to organise ourselves ahead of season. We are pleased to introduce new players as one way of strengthening the team," he noted. “It’s good to conduct this exercise early in a bid to to give the new players ample time to adapt to life here. They also need to understand the policy and system of play for them to gel with the rest of the squad in time for the new season,” said the team manager. He said he still believes they are a force to reckon with despite losing speedy winger Peter Thiong’o to AFC Leopards and defender Kennedy Onyango to City Stars. “At the moment the spirit within the playing unit is high. Players are giving their all in a bid to win positions in the first eleven and we are elated with this internal competition," he noted. Homeboyz are hoping to build on their strong second place finish before the league was suspended early this year.
