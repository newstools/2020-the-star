Triggerise Kenya in partnership with the Busia government is seeking to reduce teenage pregnancies and abortions by increasing access to reproductive health services. The organisation's programme lead Leah Wanaswa said they target the 15-24 age bracket. “Through the Tiko platform, we will work in collaboration with the county government of Busia to ensure issues of reproductive health access are attained,” she said at Hotel Itoya. The programme is being undertaken in 16 counties, including Busia, and will last 18 months. Wanaswa said it was triggered by the number of young girls reported to have become pregnant in the country during the Covid-19 period. “As a result of Covid-19, we have seen quite a number of pregnant girls and as an organisation, we had to intervene so they can finish school,” she said. Triggerise is a social enterprise with a vision to digitally engage underserved individuals to scale up health and well-being impact. County Health and Sanitation chief officer Jonathan Ino thanked Triggerise Kenya for its intervention. “We will be able to give you the support during the period that you will be here,” he said. Busia county commissioner Joseph Kanyiri said the partnership will help mitigate the challenges faced by young people. County reproductive health coordinator Alice Yaite said about 20 per cent of girls aged between 10 and 19 are accessing reproductive health services. Also present was the director of preventive and promotive services Melsa Lutomia and her medical services counterpart Janerose Ambuchi. Others were members of the county health management team and a representative from the Children’s Department. Edited by A.N
