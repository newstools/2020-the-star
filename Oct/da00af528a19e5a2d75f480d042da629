Tanzanian socialite and Diamond Platnumz' baby mama Hamisa Mobetto has revealed she suffered three miscarriages before giving birth. She also dismissed rumours Starehe MP Jaguar fathered her son, Dylan. Speaking in an interview withÂ Wasafi TV, Hamisa said, "People used to post photos of my son and that of Jaguar's comparing them, saying they were brothers. Something that I don't like. "At the start, it used to get to me because I've never met Jaguar in my entire life. Neither have I had his contact or been close with him." The mother of two said Diamond texted her, requesting a DNA test for their son. "After the controversy surrounding the paternity of our son, he texted me and told me, 'I know it's not right but I would like us to have a DNA test'," she said. "We agreed on a day and I went to the hospital with my son but he didn't show up. I tried to reach out to him in vain. That day he didn't get back to me. The following day he called to say he was busy." She added, "We planned for another day and he picked us and we went together to the hospital. We did the DNA and after two to three weeks, the results came back and it was confirmed Dylan was his kid." Hamisa went ahead to narrate how she suffered three miscarriages before giving birth to her son. "If there's someone who was 100 per cent sure that Dylan was his kid, it was Diamond. I suffered three miscarriages before I gave birth to Dylan," she said. "During the pregnancy, we were together until the day I went to give birth." Rumour has it the two on-and-off lovers have rekindled their love after the 'Baba Lao' hitmaker broke up with Tanasha Donna in March, but Hamisa rubbished the claims. "We talk a lot because we're co-parenting. My son used to visit him when Tanasha was still in Tanzania. Diamond was the first to know Tanasha and I communicate before anyone else knew."
