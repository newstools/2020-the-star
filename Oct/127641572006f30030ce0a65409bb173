A man who was embroiled in a land tussle with Deputy President William Ruto has passed away. Adrian Gilbert Muteshi, 86, died in Nairobi on Tuesday. "It is with a deep sense of gratitude to say farewell to our beloved Adrian ...who passed away in Nairobi," an obituary in one of the local dailies read. The obituary, however, did not disclose the cause of death. Muteshi's friends and relatives are expected to meet at United Kenya Club beginning Thursday from 5 pm to 7 pm. "...funeral programmes will be announced shortly," the obituary read. Muteshi was displaced from Eldoret during the 2007 post-election violence and his farm taken. He accused Ruto of unlawfully taking over his 100-acre farm in Uasin Gishu and sought court intervention. The High Court in Nairobi ruled that Muteshi had proved that the property was his and that he had been deprived of it. In turn, Ruto was ordered to pay Sh5 million to the post-election violence victim for illegally occupying his land. Ruto through his lawyers said that he was an unsuspecting buyer who heard that some land was being sold and conducted due diligence before purchasing it from people he believed were the owners of the property.
