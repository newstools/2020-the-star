Defence CS Monica Juma has lauded KDF for efforts in regional, global peace and stability in a message to Kenyan troops in Somalia as the country marked theÂ KDF Day celebrations. Every year on October 14, Kenyans celebrate KDF Day to honour men and women who selflessly take up the task to protect the nation. "I am grateful for the privilege to provide guidance and to work and be associated with patriotic men and women who guarantee our safety," Juma said. This year marks the ninth anniversary of the celebration and commemoration of the brave and gallant soldiers who paid the ultimate price in the line of duty. Via a YouTube message, Juma said since KDF entered Somalia, al Shabaab activities have reduced drastically. "Your contribution to Amisom remains a game-changer. As we recall our journey, I urge all of you not to drop your guard," she said. "A secure and safe Somalia translates to a peaceful East Africa. Your ability to work in that environment away from your family shows a lot." Noting that the theme for this year's celebration is 'humanitarian civil assistance', Juma commended the soldiers for their support. "I want to commend you for the support and we must continue to provide and ensure the well being of people. We exist to improve the wellbeing of our people," the CS said. "You are part of our effort to deliver peace. We will support you, we have your backs so go forth and protect Kenya and its citizens. Last year, former Defence CS Raychelle Omamo unveiled a monument with inscribed names of fallen soldiers. The monument with symbolic soldiers' boots and hat commemorates sacrifices and success by KDF officers who died to make sure that the Kenyan citizens live protected by law and order. Apart from honouring fallen soldiers, the event is also meant to show support to families, widows, widowers of the soldiers as well as former soldiers who are still battling injuries and trauma both physical and psychological from their operations.
