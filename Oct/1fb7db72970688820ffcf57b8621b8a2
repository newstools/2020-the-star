Safaricom has warned its customers against cons as it marks 20 years in business. The telecommunication company has advised its customers not to fall victim to cons who are trying to use the opportunity to con Kenyans. "Do not be conned! Click on http://bit.ly/safoffers to know more about our 20th anniversary offers," Safaricom tweeted. A fake website has been tricking Kenyans into sending a certain message to 12 groups in their WhatsApp contacts list under the pretext that they will receive free Sh4,100 in their M-Pesa account. Safaricom customers are set to enjoy one free call of up to 20 minutes within the next 30 days starting on Wednesday as the telco giant marks 20 years since it was launched. In a statement to the press on Tuesday, CEO Peter Ndegwa said it will send its customers notification to alert them of their free calls. "Each customer will receive a notification a day before to alert them of their free call. Customers who have been on the Safaricom network for 20 years, as well as customers turning 20 this year, will also receive a free 20GB data bundle valid for 7 days," he said. For the next 30 days, a promotion dubbed 20@20 will enable customers to purchase 20 minutes of call time and 20MBs at Sh20. For the next 90 days, customers purchasing personalized Tunukiwa voice offers will receive free 20 minutes to call across all networks. Both offers are available on USSD *444# under the ‘Buy Minutes’ option. Safaricom is this week marking 20 years since it was officially launched on October 23, 2000.
