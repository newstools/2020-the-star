Garissa Town MP Aden Duale and his family are mourning following the death of the lawmaker's elder brother. Mzee Dubow Bare, passed away in a grisly accident that occurred along Garissa - Nairobi Highway on Sunday morning.

The death of Mzee Barre, a distinguished leader, is a great loss not only to his dear family, but also to the people of Garissa County," he said. "May Mzee Barreâ€™s soul rest in eternal peace."
