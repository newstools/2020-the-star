A man who caused drama at his girlfriend’s house after she refused to buy him cigarettes on Tuesday pleaded guilty to the charges. David Nderitu Nguyo pleaded guilty before Kibera chief magistrate Abdul Lorot. He pleaded guilty to the charges of creating disturbances in a manner likely to breach peace contrary to the penal code. The charge sheet said Nguyo committed the offence on October 9 at Wanye close to Riruta within Nairobi county. The charge sheet says that he was at Wanjiru Mugwe’s house when he committed the offence and also threatened to stab her with a kitchen knife. But Nguyo told chief magistrate Abdul Lorot of Kibera Law Courts that he was inside the lady's house and he refused to be kicked out of the same house because it was the lady who took care of him. "I refused to be kicked out, I have been in living in the house after I was evicted from where I was for not paying rent and had nowhere to go," he said. The prosecution told the court the eviction drama attracted neighbours and passersby who intervened and tried to solve the matter. The magistrate freed him on a cash bail of Sh10,000 and directed the case to be mentioned on October 27.
