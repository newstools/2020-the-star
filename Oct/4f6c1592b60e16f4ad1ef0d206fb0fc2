The county government  of Garissa will continue to provide financial support to madrassas. Roads and Public Works CEC Issa Yarrow  said the government supported Quranic memorisation centres alongside children's homes. He spoke on Wednesday during the official opening of Rahma Quranic memorisation centre in Bulla Nyuki, Iftin ward. He represented Garissa Governor  Ali Korane. He said the county government created a religious directorate to support spiritual affairs, including madrassas and Quranic centres. He said strengthening Islamic centres would promote success, righteousness and high merit in the moral and educational spheres. Yarrow who was accompanied by the director of religious affairs Mohamed Dabar said parents cannot afford to neglect Islamic institutions by stopping to enrol their children, saying doing so would be catastrophic. He  urged parents and  Quranic teachers to guide learners to  have high morals and a clear purpose in life. “Our Islamic schools play a very important role in the lives of our children. They help in bringing up not only disciplined but morally upright children who will become important people in society in the future,” Yarrow said. He said the coronavirus pandemic forced children to stay at home for a long period and if it were not for the Islamic institutions many children would have gone astray because of idleness. The county donated Quranic books and Sh200, 000 from the governor. Edited by Henry Makori
