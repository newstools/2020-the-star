The Heels4Pads Foundation recently flagged off sanitary pads and girl's mentorship aimed to reach 2,000 girls in Baringo county, where they have been identified in seven villages. The function took place at Kilimani, Nairobi. Due to Covid-19, girls' challenges are being magnified, forcing them to engage in transactional sex for feminine products and needs. Heels4Pads felt obliged to reach out to vulnerable girls to mark this year's International Day of the Girl Child. In attendance were Heels4Pads founders Monicah Muhoya and Angela Waweru, co-founder Angela Wambui, Miss World Kenya Maria Wavinya and officials from Apollo Tours.
