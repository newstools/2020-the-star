President Uhuru Kenyatta will on Wednesday receive the Building Bridges Initiative report. Uhuru who is in Kisii County will receive the report by the Yusuf Haji-led team after months of waiting. Sources close to the team told the Star that the report is likely to be launched on Sunday. The BBI report is expected to change the country’s governance structure, including the creation of the Office of Prime Minister and two deputies. This, in turn, has caused mixed reactions from politicians who are supporting and opposing yet they have not seen what is in the report. During Mashujaa day on October 20, President Uhuru Kenyatta made a strong case for a referendum to approve changes to the Constitution before the 2022 General Elections. The President appeared to set the stage for the release of the Building Bridges Initiative report expected to recommend the expansion of the Executive. Uhuru said the changes would entrench political inclusion, equity in the distribution of opportunities and resources, and end violence every electoral cycle. The President said it would be disastrous to face another election without reforms and warned against “constitutional rigidity”. He asked Kenyan not to shy away from making bold decisions.
