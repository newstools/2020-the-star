The National Youth Service has sewn pants for thousands of children from poor families in Meru, Public Service CS Margaret Kobia has said. The children will also get soaps, sanitary pads, face towels, jerricans, and sanitisers to prevent Covid-19 as they report to schools. Imenti North MP Rahim Dawood and area Deputy County Commissioner Charles Monari received the consignment at the NG-CDF offices on Saturday from NYS  personnel Ephantus Gititi and Kobia’s communications officer Martin Kaumbutho. Eleven Meru MPs recently went to CS Kobia’s office and explained that poor children from the locality need these things. Dawood said he is grateful to President Uhuru Kenyatta and Kobia for deciding to protect the vulnerable. He castigated some politicians holding political rallies, thus exposing Kenyans to coronavirus because many residents do not observe social distancing or wear masks. “All of the 11 Meru MPs and Woman Rep have got at least 4,000 masks, family kits and other helpful gears towards fight against this diseases. We went to her office as a team and we are grateful and honored she has fulfilled our request. Covid-19 is on the rise in Meru. Don’t be deceived by politicians to gather at their rallies. We do not have well equipped hospitals with ICU or ventilators to accommodate huge numbers from the disease,” Dawood said. Monari said the high number of cases recently reported in Meru should alarm every person. “I request people to strictly follow the Ministry of Health protocols. The situation is not good and let’s not drop the ball. We thank CS Kobia for the helpful gesture,” he said.
