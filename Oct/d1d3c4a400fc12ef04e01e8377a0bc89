Thirteen lobby groups Thursday asked the anti-corruption agency to begin the process of recovering assets from public officials and companies that benefited from graft at Kemsa. They also asked the Ministry of Health to publish online all procurement information on Covid-19 resources bought by the Kenya Medical Supplies Agency. “The same should be made public by all other government entities where Covid-9 resources were used, including at the county level,” County Governance Watch executive director Kevin Osindo said at a press briefing in Nairobi. A special audit by the Auditor General released on September 30 showed that Kenyans lost Sh2.3 billion in the procurement of Covid-19 items. Osindo said the government and partners financing health programmes should ensure stricter accountability and public participation to boost service delivery. “This will include public disclosure requirements on budgets, the allocations, disbursements, procurement, implementation and audit reports as well as involving health stakeholders in decision-making processes,” Osindo added. The lobby groups, which represent non-governmental organisations, the private sector, professional bodies and trade unions, demanded that Parliament makes public its Health committee’s probe on Kemsa. They asked Kemsa to upload the data it released last week on the Public Procurement Information Portal so everyone can access it. “This is based on the fact that many organisations and citizens have made various requests in regard to information on how money has been spent. But unfortunately, that information has been hard to come by and our requests have been largely ignored for a long time,” Transparency International executive director Sheila Masinde said.
