A manager has been detained for a week to allow prosecution to seek a search warrant for his office. Hussein Mukter is charged with stealing $97,716 (Sh10 million) from Total Quality Halal Correct Limited at First Community Bank Limited. He is an office manager at Total Quality and the theft took place between November 27, 2017, and July 2, 2020, according to court documents. Mukter denied the charges before magistrate Sinkiyan Tobiko. The defence asked for favourable bond terms. “The motive by the prosecution to retrieve office equipment’s and the accused mobile phone is malicious and intends to sabotage his position as a manager in the office," Mukter's lawyer said. The prosecution, however, opposed his bond. It requested the court to allow police to escort the accused to his office to pick up his computer or equipment that are yet to be retrieved before he is released on bond. However, the magistrate ruled that the accused may interfere with evidence if the documents in his office are not retrieved. “Since the accused person is not a flight risk, the court cannot determine whether the prosecution’s conditions are being brought out of malice or the integrity of the evidence, I give them seven days to file a proper application for the search of phone records and computer," Tobiko ruled.
