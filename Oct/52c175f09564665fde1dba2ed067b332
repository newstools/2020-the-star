ODM will not allow Deputy President William Ruto to derail the implementation of the Building Bridges Initiative report, party national chairman John Mbadi said. Ruto 0n Friday gave the strongest signal that he'd oppose the BBI report, if the document is not opened for further amendments. DP Ruto said he wouldn't have a problem with the report if it factors in what he termed as "issues touching lives of the poor" and farmers. But on Friday, Mbadi said the room for consultations had been closed. The Suba South MP said they are not ready to give Ruto and his allies any room to disenfranchise the BBI report on grounds that he rejected the process from the beginning. “The BBI team collected views from Kenyans but DP Ruto and his supporters refused to give theirs. What new thing can he bring to the report after they had rejected the initiative?” Mbadi asked. Speaking at Nyamanga village in Ndhiwa when he met the local community, Mbadi said Ruto may be demanding the changes as a way of setting another ground to oppose the report. “Why do they want consultations when the BBI document is in the final stages?" The legislator expressed confidence that the supporters of the BBI are the majority in the country. “Let them oppose the document on condition that they are ready to meet us in the political arena during campaigns for the referendum,” he said.
