Lamu MCAs have unanimously passed a motion compelling the county and national governments to compensate residents whose land was acquired for the county headquarters in Mokowe. More than 200 people were displaced after their land was earmarked for the project in 2013 and have been awaiting compensation ever since. Also built on the land are several national government offices including that of the county commissioner and the county assembly. Efforts by the affected landowners to pursue their compensation have been futile over the years. Earlier this week, the landowners demanded their land back as they were tired of waiting for compensation that never seems to come. On Thursday, Lamu county assembly Majority leader Abdalla Baabad tabled a motion demanding the immediate compensation of the affected persons. Baabad said failure by government to compensate the affected persons was deliberate and unjust. He said it was sad that some of the affected had since died without getting justice while the majority were living in abject poverty after giving out their land for the projects. “I urge this honourable house to compel the lands department to immediately compensate all the owners of land taken to house the county and national government offices at Mokowe," Baabad said. Seconding the motion, Mkomani MCA Yahya Ahmed who is also a member of the lands committee termed the government’s silence on the matter unwarranted and outright unfair, bearing in mind the selfless sacrifice made by those affected. Nominated MCA Salim Busaidy said the landowners deserved nothing but justice after all the years of uncertainty they had endured. “Its my personal view that the delay is intentional and meant to deny our people their rightful compensation,” he said.
