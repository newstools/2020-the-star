Outpatient clinics and elective surgeries have been suspended for 14 days after some health workers tested positive for Covid-19 at Kapenguria County Referral Hospital. The county has recorded 62 coronavirus cases in the past four weeks. In a memo seen by the Star, the hospital management said it had taken urgent measures to curb the spread of the virus. “Visitors will not be allowed in the hospital for 14 days and patients requiring a caretaker will only be allowed to have one who will be accorded special clearance by the hospital,” the memo said. Speaking to the press, West Pokot health director Norbert Abuya said they decided to take the measures since most of the affected health workers are in isolation and this had disrupted services. Abuya said Covid-19 cases in the county had shot up within a month and asked residents to adhere to the World Health Organization guidelines. “From March to September the county recorded only seven cases. But the cases have shot up within a month. There will be no visits to the facility so that we can break the chain of transmission,” he said.
