Some parents in Nairobi have requested the Ministry of Education to put off till January its decision to reopen schools in phases on Monday. The parents say they were caught off guard by the directives made by Education CS George Magoha on Tuesday that schools reopen on Monday for Grade 4, Class 8 and Form 4 leaders. “We were not prepared for schools to reopen on Monday. It is too soon. My husband and I lost our jobs in April and right now we are struggling to make ends meet,” Eunice Nyawira told the Star. Nyawira, a mother of three said that she will return her two children to school in January and make them repeat their previous classes if necessary. Magoha said the schools will close on December 23, 2020, for a one week break. Meaning that they will open schools on January 4, 2021, up to March 19, 2021. Joy Katanu said he is a widower and his finances were stretched. “I have three kids in school. Food has been a challenge for us and the government wants me to take my kids to school by Monday? Only if they allow me to take them in home clothes and slippers,” he said. Ojwaka Kevin, a guardian to a Grade 4 pupil said the decision made by the ministry was not sensitive to the plight of parents. “I wonder what happened to the decision to reopen the schools in January. It is 10 weeks away and I believe all persons involved would be psychologically more ready,” he said. The High Court on Wednesday ordered Magoha to convene a meeting with the TSC and other stakeholders on the issue of reopening schools. A parent, Joseph Aura, had moved to court on claims that the indefinite closure of schools was affecting children. Aura said the government had failed to put in place measures to address the issue since the institutions were closed in March.
