In the recent past, we have witnessed cases of bikers and cyclist being involved in road accidents. The society has become non-tolerant and sharing of roads has become only a dream. Cagers have been pushing riders to the wall. On the other hand, our boda boda sector has become a major issue in the country. Cases of recklessness and insecurity have been portrayed by our boda boda riders. In the wake of all this, we need to develop a legal framework that will either allow all motor vehicle users to responsibly share the available infrastructure with bikers, cyclist and pedestrians or push the government to invest in biker, cyclist and pedestrian friendly infrastructure. The three categories are suffering out there mostly from irresponsible and drunk drivers. Being a member of Liberty Bikers, my point of concern has remained to be safety. Let all bikers be responsible too and observe all traffic rules and safety measures. Put on a helmet every time you rides have your reflector to increase visibility and always have one pillion at a time. If we collectively observe all rules, we will have minimal accidents if not none. The power is in our hands.
