Italy is shutting cinemas, swimming pools, and gyms from Monday in a further attempt to curb the rapid rise in coronavirus infections. Bars and restaurants will have to close by 18:00 but shops and the majority of businesses will remain operating. Meanwhile, Spain's cabinet on Sunday agreed to a nationwide "state of alarm", which would allow for a countrywide curfew, Spanish media report. Both countries were hit hard during the first wave of the pandemic in Europe. Italy's measures were agreed between Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte and regional leaders. The Campania region, which contains Naples, has been among those calling for tighter restrictions. Conte has said he does not want to repeat the national lockdown imposed during the first wave in March and April because of the economic damage caused. Under the new measures, the bulk of secondary school teaching will be conducted online instead of in the classroom.
