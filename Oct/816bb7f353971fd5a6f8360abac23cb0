Three men will spend four years in prison or pay Sh600,000 fine each after they were found guilty of being in possession of a live pangolin. Ruwa Mwangolo, Hamisi Hondo and Hamisi Kefa pleaded guilty to having the pangolin without a permit. The three were arrested on September 1 in Likoni, Mombasa county. They were ferrying the animal to Kwale county stuffed in two jerrycans, which they had cut in half. Mombasa chief magistrate Edna Nyaloti ruled on Wednesday that the accused chose to keep the animal for financial gain instead of ferrying it to Kenya Wildlife Service offices in Shimoni, Kwale county. They were also accused of keeping the pangolin and not reporting to the KWS, despite knowing it was a wild animal. “Such charges calls for a sentence of not less than five years or a fine of not less than Sh3 million or both. However, the court has discretion of sentencing,” the magistrate said. The accused said that after they found the pangolin, they were informed that the animal could fetch them a good amount of money and that is why they chose to keep it.  Edited by A.N
