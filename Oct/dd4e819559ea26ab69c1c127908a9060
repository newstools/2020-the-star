Nairobi Woman Representative Esther Passaris says she wishes she could cry more often. Speaking to Jalang'o on Youtube, Passaris, who turned 56 last week, said crying is a way to unburden oneself. "Crying is something that God gave us to release what is burdening us but ever since the post-election (violence) in 2017, I just couldn't cry anymore," she said. Passaris said during that period she would be seated in meditation and tears would suddenly start flowing. "I realised that there could be days where I just cry. In 2017, I dealt with about 90 plus bodies, from fathers to brothers to children and every single day I am confronted by people's pain and suffering, loss and you reach a point where you have to toughen up." Passaris said along the way, her brain just shut down. "I want to tell people to enjoy their vulnerability," she said adding that she misses being vulnerable. Passaris also talked about how insecure she was about her age until her late forties. "I started announcing my age when I was around 49 years and people were like, 'people don't say your age'."
