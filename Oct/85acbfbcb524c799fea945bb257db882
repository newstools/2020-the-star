The National Emergency Response Committee is currently holding a crisis meeting in a bid to come up with a new raft of measures in the wake of rising Covid-19 infections. The meeting comes amid fears Kenya might be headed into a second wave infection as seen in the statistics in the past few weeks. There has been an increase in the number of deaths with 12 patients succumbing to the virus on Saturday, raising the country’s fatality to 825. The committee is expected to recommend additional restrictions to President Uhuru Kenyatta. Kenyatta relaxed curfew restriction and opened bars and restaurants which many believe is behind the rising numbers. Last week, the Health CAS Rashid Aman hinted at a possible lockdown should the situation at hand warrant so. The ministry also raised an alarm over rising cases in five counties; Nakuru, Trans Nzoia, Kisumu, Mombasa and Nairobi. Aman said medical experts from the health ministry as well as those form the modeling teams are studying the behavioral patterns of how the virus is moving in the country, and will make public the findings once they are completed. The positivity rate has since moved from 4.6 per cent when the measures were relaxed to more than 10 per cent currently. These positivity rates may fluctuate over time but when we look at the seven day moving average and we begin to see that we are moving above the five per cent positivity rate it is a sign that we are moving in the wrong direction,” the CAS said. “We will have to face it if we find that the numbers are rising and unmanageable we will have to take action to restrict movements perhaps even go back. It is a possibility that we could go back to closing schools if we see that.” The Health CS Mutahi Kagwe who is also the chair of the committee is expected to address the media thereafter.
