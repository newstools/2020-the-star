A magistrate's court will Monday rule on whether one of the persons accused of defrauding Wajir county of Sh26 million will be questioned on a statement he recorded. Jeff Kithinji Mworia, through his lawyer, told the court that he wants to know how the content of the witness statement was obtained. He said if the statement was to be used it will be clearly against Article 50, which prohibits self-incriminating evidence. “We are submitting that we are not questioning the issues or questions being put to the witness if they are relevant or not but we are questioning the process that the content of the witness statement that is in issue was obtained,” Nyaberi said. But the prosecution told magistrate Teresia Murigi that Section 156 of the Evidence Act provides that a person charged with an offence and called as a witness for the defence may be asked any question in cross-examination notwithstanding that the answer may tend to incriminate him. “The law is clear and I pray that I be allowed to cross-examine the accused person on this statement since he has already owned it,” the prosecutor said. Mworia alongside Ahmed Sahal Omar Daudi Abdullahi were placed on their defence in June. The three are currently at the stage of defending themselves. They are accused of having withdrawn the money from Kenya Commercial Bank Wajir branch on October 9, 2018. Abdullahi is facing a separate count of abuse of office and failure to manage public property. It is alleged that between October 5 and October 9, 2018, within Wajir county, Abdullahi used his office to confer a benefit of Sh26.1 million to Mworia by unlawfully authorising him as a sole signatory of the county government of Wajir imprest account. The accused were arraigned in November 2018 charged with conspiring to defraud the county government of Sh26 million.
