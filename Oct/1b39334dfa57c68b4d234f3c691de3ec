Twenty health workers at Lodwar County Referral Hospital have tested positive for Covid-19, forcing the county government to suspend some services at the facility. Turkana County Executive for Health Jane Ajele said the hospital has not been closed but only some services were suspended. “We have not closed Lodwar County Referral Hospital but suspended a few service like outpatient department and mother and child health. Patients are informed to seek those services in the 11 nearly by facilities around Lodwar town,” she told the Star on Monday. Turkana County Government announced that it has reported a total of 391 cases of Covid-19 since the pandemic started. Turkana West leads with 308 cases, Turkana Central follows with 80 cases and the remaining in Turkana South and Turkana North. Peter Lotethiro, Turkana Deputy Governor, said 335 individuals have so far recovered and six fatalities reported - a child and five adults - all being refugees. “As we fight to control the outbreak, areas with high density population like refugee camps, government offices, schools, correctional facilities, banks and health facilities remain at high risk,” Lotethiro said. “On 9th of this month, 17 samples were collected from Turkana Central, five of which came back positive with four of these individuals being health workers exposed in their line of duty,” he said. “Immediately, these staff were sent to isolate at home and their contacts were traced and tested among 61 samples that were picked on the 13th of this month, 16 of whom tested positive. This brings the total number of staff in ongoing isolation care to 20 staff.” He said this highlights the occupational hazard faced by medical staff in their service. “I would like to sincerely thank the Ministry of Health for a timely response to avert the looming crisis arising from the infection of our healthcare workers and, for undertaking swift measures to mitigate the situation,” he said.
