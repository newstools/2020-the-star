Deputy President William Ruto has said police officers in the country are good people who are hustling to feed their families. Speaking in Nyamira County on Thursday, Ruto said his last meeting was canceled following the orders from a section of leaders who are against his hustle movement. "These policemen have no problem. The problem is the people who live in the ivory tower who donâ€™t know the problem that some people are going through," Ruto said. The DP added that he will not be moved in his objective targeting people in the bodaboda sector as well as other small businesses. "Those who are trying to stop my tour to Kisii are 'fools'. Such people are tribalists. Every Kenyan is allowed to visit any place as long as he is within the country." He has asked leaders to avoid politics of tribalism as ethnicity. "Stop politics of balkanising Kenyans...no Kenyan is a visitor or a guest in any part of Kenya." The DP said the discussion in the country should focus on the common people before shifting to the politics of sharing positions. Ruto said that Jubilee administration formed the government with the idea of uniting the entire country, including giving government positions to some of Kisii and Nyamira residents. The DP was accompanied by Kisii County DG Joash Maangi, Kitutu Masaba MP Shadrack Mose, Vincent Kemosi of West Mugirango, Joash Nyamoko (North Mugirango), and Silvanus Osoro (South Mugirango). Others were nominated senator Milicent Omanga, Kiharu MP Dindi Nyoro, Gichana Rigathi Gachagua (Mathira) as well as businessman Don Bosco and a number of MCAs from Kisii and Nyamira Counties. The leaders said their support to Ruto is unshaken and they will not be bowed by threats from the government. "As members of parliament and hustlers in the country we will fight in all manners to ensure you are President," said Mose.
