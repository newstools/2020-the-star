 ODM candidate for the upcoming Msambweni parliamentary by-election Omar Boga has received a boost after supporters of his rivals said they will back him. Many supporters of Bashir Kilalo have abandoned him and promised to back the ODM candidate after Kilalo bowed out of the race in favour of independent Feisal Bader. Bader is backed by Deputy President William Ruto who entered a deal with both Kilalo and businessman Peter Nzuki to withdraw from the contest in favour of his man. Bader, was previously in ODM but ditched the party when he got the DP’s support. The aspirants are getting ready for the by-election scheduled for December 15. The Msambweni seat became vacant after MP Suleiman Dori died in March. Former Kilalo’s campaign chairman Iddy Masemo said they have opted to support Boga since the marriage between Kilalo, Bader and Nzuki was formed on empty words. “It is now a month since we went to Nairobi but the agreement was done unofficially. We expected them to come to the ground and  include all other members and discuss the way forward,” Masemo said. A team of 30 people, 10 supporters of each of the three candidates, were chosen to officiate the union and took an oath to assist one another in front of Ruto in Nairobi. Masemo alleged that the agreement was in vain, saying none of the three aspirants bothered to consult them. He said Kilalo’s stepping down won’t stop them from exercising their democratic rights, and that is why they have made the choice of supporting Boga. “We have to back whoever we want to lead us, and we can’t wait for someone to decide for us,” Masemo said. Kilalo was running on the Kadu Asili ticket before he bowed out. ODM leader Raila Odinga and his deputy Ali Hassan Joho are expected to officially receive the new team at the next political rally at Sawa Sawa grounds in Kwale in November.
