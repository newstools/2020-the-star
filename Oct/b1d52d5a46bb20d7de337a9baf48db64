Fintech company–Cellulant has appointed Faith Nkatha Gitonga as its country manager for Kenya. She joins Cellulant from Oracle Corporation, where she was leading their digital transformation efforts for the public sector. Nkatha joins Cellulant to lead its Kenya operations and scale its payments ecosystem in the country. The company has described her as "a highly accomplished leader with a proven track record of driving digital transformation." “We are excited that Faith has agreed to join our leadership team and confident that she will lead Cellulant Kenya’s next chapter of growth and success,” Cellulant co-founder and CEO Ken Njoroge said. Nkatha has over 10 years experience with a strong performance history of value-adding contribution, strategic partnerships and digitalisation for some of Kenya’s premier consumer-facing banks. Before joining Oracle, she served as the director for strategy, monitoring and transformation at Sidian Bank. In this role, she was responsible for the unit’s digital transformation, including developing and executing strategies for growth and expansion, partnerships and quality performance. She also worked at SBM Bank (K) Ltd as head of department - retail and institutional banking, among other leadership roles, from 2008 to 2016. “We have all been impressed by her strong track record of digital transformation and vast experience in the Fintech space,” Njoroge said. Nkatha said she is keen to diversify Cellulant’s portfolio into other sectors as business owners and organisations undergo rapid digitisation. “It is a great privilege and honour to work with such a distinguished leader in the African fintech and payments space and one that continues to pioneer innovative solutions to meet the current and changing needs for businesses,” she said. “I am excited and confident that we can scale to greater heights in delivering high-quality services, build and develop strong relationships with our clients and partners in Kenya," she added.
