Kenya Swimming Federation (KSF ) interim chairman, Patrick Muyah thinks the government is sending mixed signals on the resumption of sport in the country. Last month, the government termed the sport high risk alongside basketball, volleyball and rugby. However, last week, the Ministry of Sport asked all federations for a calendar of events. "It's a bit puzzling because on one hand, they are saying you can't compete because of Covid-19 and on the other side, they are asking for calendar of events for the 2021. So it's a bit confusing,” he added. Muyah said swimmers are allowed to train but competitions could take longer depending on the severity of the virus in the new year. "The swimmers are training under strict guidelines and if the ministry can give us the green-light in the next one month or two, then we can at resume competitions in the new year,” he noted. Muyah said with no interactions going on between the Ministry of Sport and the federations in the past one month, it will force respective associations to formulate their own rules. "Since the last briefing, we have not been invited for other meetings so I think we will plan in our own way and see how we can resume sport,” he noted. Muyah said swimming is taking place in other countries and it was a high time the government sanctioned the resumption of sports under strict Covid-19 regulations. “Other countries are competing under strict protocols and I do believe we too can follow that trend," he noted. Muyah said Kenya's four swimmers to the Tokyo202o Olympics Emily Muteti, Issa Abdalla, Danilo Rosaflio and Maria Brunlehner are already training but only two will make the trip to the Summer Games .
