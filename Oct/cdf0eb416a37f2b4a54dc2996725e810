The body of one of two brothers who drowned in River Sondu has been found in Homa Bay county. The boys had gone swimming in the river on September 27 when strong water currents swept them away. Divers from Homa Bay retrieved the body as the search for the other body continued. The body of Peter Arani, 6, was retrieved about 22km away from the point where he drowned in Kodumo East sublocation in Kabondo Kasipul. The body of his elder brother Stephen Tinega is still missing and efforts to trace it are still ongoing. The tragedy happened a few days after a Form Two student drowned while swimming in the same river.
