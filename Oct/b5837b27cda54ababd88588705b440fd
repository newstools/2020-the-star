The county assemblies of Machakos, Kitui and Makueni have come together to support the Building Bridges Initiative. In a press statement on Monday, they said they have unanimously agreed to strongly support the BBI and urged all leaders from Ukambani to preach unity. "We believe the BBI provides the best roadmap for the development and progress of not only Ukambani but also for the whole of Kenya," they said. Led by Kitui assembly Speaker Peter Kilonzo, the MCAs said they support the BBI because it provides for the equitable allocation of national resources and inclusivity in political and socio-economic spheres. "For a long time, Ukambani has lagged behind in economic development, mainly as a result of the skewed allocation of resources that has favoured regions with high agricultural potential," they said in a press conference in Machakos on Monday. They said BBI has promised counties increased funds of at least 35 per cent of the national revenue;Â  it has drafted measures to curb theft or misuse of the funds by county executives, including the assignment of special judges and magistrates to handle corruption in the counties. "We have always yearned to witness economic prosperity in our regions, these proposals are a godsend, and we will support them vigorously even in a referendum," they said. The leaders said the BBI report should recommend that Cabinet secretaries are drawn from MPs. Similarly, the assemblies proposed the county government officials to be appointed from among MCAs. They applauded President Uhuru Kenyatta for reshuffling his Cabin, saying it has instilled pride and patriotism among Kambas. "We urge the President to continue with the spirit of boosting national cohesion through the appointment of qualified and capable people from Ukambani to government ministries, departments and parastatal."
