The intercounty Madaraka Express passenger service from Nairobi to Mombasa stopped temporarily after an earth tremor hit Taita Taveta county on Wednesday. The train made an unscheduled stop at Tsavo West National Park. The intercounty train makes stopovers at Athi River, Emali, Kibwezi, Mtito Andei, Voi, Miasenyi and Mariakani stations. In a press statement, Kenya Railways said the stop lasted one hour before the train crew received the green light from the control centre to proceed with the journey. "The train crew received information while at Ndio station area in Voi. The stop was necessary as officials in the area carried out investigations to ascertain if the railway line had been affected by the tremor," the statement said. The train, which departed Nairobi at 8am, arrived in Mombasa at 15.30pm, one-and-half hours late. This is not the first time the Coast region has been hit by earth tremors. On August 12, an earthquake of magnitude of six hit the coastal region and its effects were felt in parts of Nairobi. The Kenya Railways resumed operations on July 13 after the national government relaxed the Covid-19 measures that had restricted movement of people. Transport Cabinet Secretary James Macharia said Madaraka Express would operate at 50 per cent capacity, with an extra coach for isolation. He said Kenya Railways would provide 10 coaches to ferry about 600 passengers during the one-way trip. Edited by Henry Makori
