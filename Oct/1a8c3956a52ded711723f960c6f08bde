The Nairobi Metropolitan Services will repair 74 grounded vehicles in the next two months. The rehabilitation is a collaboration started in July between the NMS and the Kenya Defence Forces.  Already, 83 vehicles have been restored at a cost of Sh22 million and flagged off on Tuesday by President Uhuru Kenyatta at the NMS garage in Industrial Area. Some of the vehicles had been grounded for eight years and  condemned for sale as scrap metal. President Kenyatta was optimistic that the 74 vehicles will be repaired in the next two months for service to Nairobi residents. They comprise 21 tippers, 24 fire engines, six ambulances, three hydraulic platforms for the street lighting, two Scarab road sweepers, two graders, one black hoe loader, one wheel loader, one pneumatic roller, two water bowsers, one farm tractor and 19 light vehicles. The President had in March, during the establishment of the NMS, ordered the repair of grounded garbage collection trucks. Only 10 out of 60 trucks were functional. One hundred days later NMS director-general Mohammed Badi reported that 32 trucks had been repaired and ready for distribution to the sub-counties. In October 2017, President Kenyatta had flagged off 26 fire engines supplied by Somati Vehicles. They had been financed by the Belgian government under the Official Aid Funded Project. Governor Mike Sonko had at the time said each of the 17 constituencies would be allocated a fire engine.  - mwaniki fm
