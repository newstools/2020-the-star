A man was on Thursday arraigned in a Kibera court for allegedly possessing 40 pieces of tusks, which the investigating officer said were obtained from over 20 elephants. Thomas Muhoro Ngatia was arraigned before senior principal magistrate Sharon Maroro when the matter came up for hearing. The charge sheet said that on March 22, 2016 at Githurai Kimbo area, Ngatia was arrested with 40 pieces of tusks weighing 112kg with a street value of Sh11.2 million. Testifying in the case, Charles Kinoti of Kenya Wildlife Service said he received a phone call which informed him that the suspect had been arrested with the trophies. "I was at the KWS office Lang’ata when I received a call from DCI officers based at Nairobi area. The officers informed me that a suspect had been arrested with elephant tusks and I directed KWS officers to visit the scene, where they discovered that the trophies were original," he told the court. The Directorate of Criminal Investigations took over the matter and the tusks were taken to the KWS headquarters. Kinoti said that on interrogating the suspect, he informed him that the officers arrested him while he was within Githurai 45. "He told me that he was arrested with the trophies in Githurai area. He said he was given the trophies by someone whom he introduced to me as Machinery,” Kinoti said. Kinoti told court that the suspect informed him the man who gave him the trophies had promised to pay him Sh1,000 per kilo. Maroro directed the case to proceed on November 2. Edited by Henry Makori
