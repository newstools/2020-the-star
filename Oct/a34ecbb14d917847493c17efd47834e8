The differences between President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto run deep. One is undermining the other. Obviously, the DP is undermining the President with his remarks. The remarks he makes, especially in his mother-tongue, are usually derogatory. Do you think one will trust the other even if they sit on a table and agree? No. When the DP goes on the campaign trail, it portrays the President as doing nothing. There is no way the President can accept this. This clearly shows that the problem is deep-seated. The efforts to reconcile the two are appreciated. However, an arrangement where Uhuru is reconciled with his deputy does not serve him well. Suppose they get back together and restore the UhuRuto pact, the DP is likely to hit back. Together with his allies, they have already shown their fangs and what they can do. I don’t think President Kenyatta will sit easily with such a deal. The two sides – Kieleweke and Tangatanga – are already on the warpath and rapprochement would mean some will lose their political careers. They do not want that. Remember that this war is a career opportunity for some people. People like Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi and Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kichumba Murkomen have made a career out of conflict and love such kinds of situation. In a scenario where that conflict goes, then you are also messing their careers. These are career war men. Look at how they fought ODM leader Raila Odinga after his handshake with President Kenyatta. They fought because they were losing out after building a career out of fighting the former prime minister. Their careers will be messed with if the fight between Uhuru and Ruto ends and the two go back to working together as they did before the 2013 and 2017 general elections. Senator Murkomen is what he is because he is fighting and abusing the Uhuru and Raila side. The same applies to Sudi. If you remove Raila and Uhuru, who will they abuse?
