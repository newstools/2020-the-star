Smart Applications International chairman Chris Kirubi welcomed the partnership, saying it will ensure Kenyans access affordable medical care. "The new partnership will go a long way in helping Kenyans reach more healthcare providers. We plan to introduce smart cards which patients will use to access services anywhere in Kenya,‚Äù he said.
