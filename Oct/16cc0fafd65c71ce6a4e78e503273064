A popular model and businesswoman is being accused of cheating on her husband with a tycoon. The two have been seen on vacations abroad and even posting on social media. A source told Word Is yesterday, "She and her husband are close friends of mine and it saddens me to see her do this in our group. "There is no way to tell her husband that another man took her to Dubai and Dar es Salaam for her birthday month as the man was also celebrating his birthday." Our source added, "I believe you can do your investigations, very simple. Check her Instagram posts for the month of September, where she shows she was in Dubai and Dar, then check the posts and compare. Thank me later." The model, who owns a business in the leafy suburbs of Nairobi, had previously reported that she was going to start her own reality TV show.
