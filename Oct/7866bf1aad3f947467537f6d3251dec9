More people are suffering from mental health disorders in Taita Taveta county, data from the Health department reveals. Health services executive John Mwakima said at least 858 cases of mental illness have been reported. The stigma associated with mental illness, Mwakima said, might have caused many people to suffer in silence. “This number could balloon if all people with these disorders sought medication. The stigma is because mental issues are usually attributed to either witchcraft or spiritual problems,” the executive said. His department has set up a psychiatric centre at the Moi County Referral Hospital in Voi to offer specialised medical treatment to patients. Nationally, it is estimated that one in every 10 people suffers from a mental disorder. The number increases to one in every four people among patients attending routine outpatient services. “People should be allowed to come in and seek medication. This is a very key aspect of health and regular checkup should be encouraged,” Mwakima said. Government statistics indicate that Kenya has a high burden of mental illness due to ill health, psychosocial disability and premature mortality with huge gaps in access to care. Depression and anxiety disorders are the leading mental illnesses diagnosed, followed by substance use disorders. In July, a task force on mental health recommended that mental illness be declared a national emergency of epidemic proportions. Macrina Mwamburi, the Sauti ya Wanawake chairperson for Mwangea branch, attributed the increasing number of suicide cases among the youth to mental disorders such as depression. She said drugs and substances abuse—citing bhang, hard drugs and alcohol—has also contributed to the growing number of cases. “At least 35 per cent of these cases are a result of substance abuse. Authorities should use such information to safeguard the youth from drug abuse,” she said. Edited by Henry Makori
