Kenya Rugby Union Championship and Nationwide leagues will have promotion/relegation playoff matches before the start of the 2020/2021 season, the federation has announced. However, the KRU board, in recommendations from the Kenya Cup caucus, said there will be no winner for the 2019-2020 campaign across all the leagues. In addition, Kisumu RFC and Western Bulls, who had been relegated from the top tier and Kisii and Mombasa from the Championship will not have their status reviewed since their matches had been completed. A statement from Kenya Rugby secretary Ian Mugambi following a full board meeting held on October 5 read: “Pursuant to clause 13.1.2 of the KRU regulations that gives the board the authority to amend competition rules during a season, it is decided that with the playoffs remaining to conclude the fixtures, it is not possible to determine a winner. As such, no winner will be declared across the various leagues. The results, up to the last matches, however, stand.” Mugambi added: “The teams that had been relegated will, however, remain relegated given their fixtures were complete. To determine promotion, the league’s (Championship and Nationwide) will have playoff matches. This means the pre-semifinals and quarterfinal fixtures will be played before the start of the new season.” The board announced that the transfer window will open from October 6 to November 30 but in regard to the playoff matches, only players who played in the previous season shall be eligible. The Union had cancelled the season in April following the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic but was forced to rescind the decision a couple of weeks following an outcry by clubs. Last month, the Kenya cup caucus gave up hope of completing on season after the Ministry of Sports classified rugby as a high risk sport and will therefore to wait much longer to get a green light for the resumption of their activities.
