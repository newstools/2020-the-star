Farmers at Wei Wei irrigation scheme have got a bumper maize harvest this year despite heavy rains. Many farmers in scheme never expected a great harvest after some of the pipes supplying water to the irrigation scheme were washed away. Speaking at Sigor, KVDA managing director Sammy Naporos said the authority is supporting food security to stem hunger. Naporos said the authority is supporting 800 farmers on 108 acres. He said farmers at the scheme are expecting 1,000 tonnes of maize seeds which will be sold to Kenya Seed Company. “We want to empower residents of this county and ensure that they shun from depending on relief food,” he said. He said farmers who have been depending solely on pastoralism have appreciated economic potential of farming. He said the authority is working closely with the government to ensure that the county is food secure and reduce reliance on relief food. Naporos said that the region had the potential to produce enough food and asked other organisations to chip in and help in setting up of irrigation schemes. “Cases of malnutrition will reduce if we empower residents to have enough food for household consumption and surplus for sale. If we join hands and set up more irrigation schemes in this are poverty levels will also reduce in this region,” he said. He said that farmers in the area have learned new farming methods that will help increase food productivity. He said that income at household level in the region had improved since residents have enough income form the scheme. “Parents are now able to pay schools fees and food for their children. I'm happy residents have begun to move from solely depending on pastoralism,” he said.
