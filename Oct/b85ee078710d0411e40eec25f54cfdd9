A matatu tout has been charged with forcibly pushing a passenger out of a moving bus and violently robbing him of his mobile phone valued at Sh16,000. Austin Chiteyi was charged before Kibera senior resident magistrate Renee Kitagwa on Monday. He denied the charges. Chiteyi is said to have robbed Leonard Thiong'o on September 6 in Uthiru within Nairobi county. He committed the offence with others who were not before court. The complainant had boarded the vehicle in the CBD to Cooperation  but the accused person terminated the trip miles away from the destination. The complainant then asked for his fare and the accused person threw him  out of the bus and he fell head first, sustaining deep head cuts. Thiong'o then found himself in the hospital moments after regaining consciousness and reported the matter to the police which led to the arrest of the accused person. Chiteyi however told Kitagwa that he never committed the offence. Kitagwa ordered his release on a Sh500,000 bond with a surety of a similar amount and directed the case to proceed on November 6.
