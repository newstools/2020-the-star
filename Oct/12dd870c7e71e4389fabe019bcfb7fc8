Harambee Stars head coach Francis Kimanzi has been shown the door. Kimanzi, who took over the reigns last year following the exit of his boss, Sébastien Migne, leaves the national team alongside his backroom staff who include: assistant Zedekiah ‘Zico’ Otieno and goalkeeper trainer Lawrence Webo. A communique from FKF and signed by CEO Barry Otieno said: “Harambee Stars Head Coach Francis Kimanzi and part of his backroom staff have left the national team by mutual consent.” “The federation is immensely grateful to Coach Kimanzi and his departing members of staff that include assistant coach Zedekiah Otieno and goalkeeper Trainer Lawrence Webo for their exemplary work, dedication and unrivaled professionalism, which has strengthened Kenya’s chances of qualifying for the AFCON 2022 final tournament.” “All at the federation wish them well, in their in their future endeavors, this even as the search for a replacement to take the national team forward begins in earnest.” And even though the federation said there will be no more communication until a replacement is identified, reports suggest that former coach Jacob ‘Ghost’ Mulee is set to retake the role. Mulee lastly coached Stars in 2010 and is likely to be deputised by Kariobangi Sharks tactician William Muluya as well as former Stars skipper Musa Otieno.
