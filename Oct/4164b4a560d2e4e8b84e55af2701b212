Embu Woman Representative Jane Wanjuki has condemned politicians who have been convening meetings in total disregard for Covid-19 containment measures. Wanjuki said she was disappointed that even as infection surges and more patients are succumbing to the disease, politicians were holding rallies with no social distancing and wearing of face masks. He said the leaders have set a very bad example by going ahead to shake hands. Shaking of hands is one way through which the virus spreads, hence the requirement to keep social distance and frequently sanitise hands to keep the virus at bay. "A lot of infection could be happening during public meetings and rallies. It is unfortunate that politicians have started early campaigns with two years to the next general election," Wanjiku said. She said politicians should engage in constructive activities, asking elected leaders to fulfill their pre-election pledges. Those aspiring to unseat current leaders should wait for the official campaign time, the lawmaker said. Wanjuki asked politicians to heed President Uhuru Kenyatta's directive to stop early campaigns and instead serve the electorate. She was speaking to the press at Slopes Villa Hotel in Embu town. The MP asked politicians to read the Building Bridges Initiative report thoroughly before commenting on its content to avoid misleading the people.  Edited by P.O
