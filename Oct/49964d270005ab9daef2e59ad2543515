Earlier this month, the regulator raised the price of petrol, diesel, and kerosene. The regulator said that the action came about following the move by the Kenya Revenue Authority to adjust upwards the Excise Duty on Super Petrol, Diesel, and Kerosene. It added that the action has been prompted by the average inflation rate of 4.94 per cent for the financial year 2019/2020.
