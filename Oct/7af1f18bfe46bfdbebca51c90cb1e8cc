A Garissa court has stopped the newly elected official of the Football Kenya Federation Garissa North East sub-branch from assuming office. Senior resident magistrate Ole Tanchu barred Abdullahi Salat from assuming office, pending the hearing and determination of an application. Salat was elected on September 26. Magistrate Ole Tanchu directed the application dated September 28 be served to all the parties for hearing on October 7. Through lawyer Suleiman Bashir, FKF Electoral North East South Branch vice-chair Hassan Abdi says the FKF board contemnor has violated the court order by refusing to comply with the dictates of the order. He adds that he thus conducted the FKF Garissa North East sub-branch election on September 26. “By a ruling of the court on September 24, 2020, FKF’S board contemnor was prohibited from conducting the elections that were scheduled for September 26, 2020, pending the hearing and determination of the application in court,” Suleiman said. He further said that FKF election board’s conduct and willful disobedience and defiance of the court order has brought the court into ridicule and great disrepute and amounts to prejudice against him. Lawyer Suleiman wanted the court to punish FKF board members Kentice Kitolo (chairperson), Patrick Onyango (secretary) and three others for contempt of court orders issued on September 24.
