Pastor Greg Laurie, who attended the White House Rose Garden event on 26 September where Trump announced his Supreme Court nomination, has just confirmed that he tested positive for Covid-19 on Friday. In a Facebook video message, he told supporters: "I have always taken the coronavirus seriously, and it has tragically taken many lives. "At a time like this, we need to pray for those that have it and avoid politicising it. If our President and First Lady can get Covid-19, clearly anyone can." US President Donald Trump on Monday tweeted that he is going to leave the hospital later today. His announcement came just before a press conference with his doctors was due to start. "I will be leaving the great Walter Reed Medical Center today at 6:30 P.M. Feeling really good! Don’t be afraid of Covid. Don’t let it dominate your life. We have developed, under the Trump Administration, some really great drugs & knowledge. I feel better than I did 20 years ago!" he tweeted. Earlier on, President Trump's doctors had announced that he has been receiving "outstanding multidisciplinary care." They are "monitoring him very closely for any evidence of complications" but say he hasn't had any fever since Friday morning. Trump isn't on oxygen at the moment. However, his doctors refused repeatedly to rule out that he had ever been on supplementary oxygen. He's receiving both the drug Remdesivir and experimental treatment. They tackle different aspects of the disease, the doctors say.
