Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya has once again warned that county workers who underperform will be fired. The county chief cautioned that shoddy work won’t be tolerated in his government. He said the county aims at delivering efficient services to its citizens. “We cannot fail the locals we promised to serve and it is our responsibility to meet their expectations,” he said. Mvurya spoke on Saturday at Kwale Cultural Centre in Matuga constituency. The governor said corruption, laziness and tribalism have no place in his administration. He asked the inept officers who cannot serve with honesty and diligence to resign. The county boss said there were many capable people who qualify to fill the posts. “Why should you play with your jobs yet there are a lot of educated and skilled people who can replace you at any time?” Mvurya said. He said the residents are in need of development projects and challenged county employees to work hard to realise the county goals. Mvurya said any delay in the implementation of projects by county workers derails his efforts to provide best services meant to improve the lives of the residents. He said he would not relent in his commitment to transform the lives of Kwale residents. Deputy governor Fatuma Achani told the workers not to take the county’s development for granted. Achani said appropriate actions shall be taken against undisciplined staff. Edited by Henry Makori
