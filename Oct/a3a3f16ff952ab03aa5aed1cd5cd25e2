Environment and Forestry CS Keriako Tobiko on Saturday caught top Kajiado public servants off guard when he arrived in Ngong Hills, planted a tree in their absence and left. Tobiko arrived at 7am aboard a Kenya Forestry Service helicopter. “I confirm there was such an arrangement, but I was out of the station off duty. I do not have all the details about what happened,” Kajiado North deputy county commissioner Patrick Mwangi said by phone. Mwangi is barely two weeks old in his new posting. Area assistant county commissioner, police boss and all Ngong chiefs arrived at the venue some minutes to 8am only to find the Cabinet Secretary gone. Some chiefs told the Star they were aware of the visit but thought Tobiko would arrive after 8am for the tree-planting exercise. “We were all shocked to find the minister had arrived at 7am. He did not even call the area DCC to say he was coming earlier than scheduled,” a concerned chief said. But it was not the first time the CS pulled the surprise and without  apologies later. He was at a loss why the CS did not even call one of their seniors to indicate he would arrive earlier than scheduled. The office of the DCC is said to have hired tents and chairs for the occasion only to be told to go for them as they would not be used since the CS had already left. A Ngong DCI official, who chose to be anonymous, said the CS had other functions to attend to. That is why he turned up earlier than scheduled. Tobiko told the Star he was in company of KFS officials who helped him plant trees before leaving Ngong to attend to other urgent assignments. “I was not alone but in company of other government officers at Ngong Hills. Other assignments cropped up on Friday. This is the reason I rescheduled the time on Saturday,” he said.
