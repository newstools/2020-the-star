 A suspect was on Saturday shot dead by police after attacking and injuring a man in Naivasha. The suspect had months ago escaped lynching by an angry mob. His victim was rushed to Naivasha Subcounty hospital with injuries on the hands and back. The suspect has been on the run and had returned to Kasarani estate within Naivasha that is home to hundreds of flower farm workers. Witnesses said the man was drunk. He wanted revenge for a previous attack. John Mbuthia said he attacked a reveller, slashed him on the hand after accusing him of having organised his beating. “The deceased had come to revenge and in the process, he cut and seriously injured one man before police gunned him down,” Mbuthia said. He said the man defied orders to surrender and tried to attack one of the officers with a machete before he was shot. Naivasha police boss Samuel Waweru said an inquest file had been opened as part of investigations. “Initial investigations indicate that the deceased was the aggressor who injured another man and tried to attack a police officer before he was shot dead on Saturday evening,” Waweru said on Sunday.
