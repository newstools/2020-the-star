Passionate about the power of the mobile phone and the Internet to change people’s lives meaningfully, Muthoni Maingi has founded a pan-African media company. ‘The Catalyst’, launched at an event held on September 28 at Metta, Nairobi, is the first product produced by the company. Each season of the show will have 12 episodes, interview exclusives. Stretching across themes in politics, culture and entertainment, The Catalyst is a space to connect, create stories for ourselves and by ourselves and deep cuts on YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, newsletter and a podcast. Writers include Justine Wanda, Sheila Omondi and Ciku Waithaka.
