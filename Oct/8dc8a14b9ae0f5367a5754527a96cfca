DCI sleuths have arrested one suspect for the gruesome murder of Julius Mohere who was killed last Saturday in Migori. Frenk Nyandoto, 26, was nabbed from his hideout at Lolgorian in Narok County by a combined team of DCI and police officers based in Kuria West. Preliminary investigations from the police reveal that the suspect stabbed the deceased in the stomach using a sword following a misunderstanding while on a drinking spree. The police said that the suspect fled the crime scene and later made a false report at Lolgorian police station that he had been robbed off. The arrested suspect had claimed that he was robbed off a motorcycle and sustained an injury on his left hand as he tried to fight with the thieves. The police have kept the weapon believed to have been used during the murder and will be used as an exhibit awaiting his arraignment. Meanwhile, the police arrested 52-year-old Archibald Kalela Mwandawiro, a suspect of Cyber Espionage. The DCI said upon his arrest, devices used in the interception, access and transmission of messages to unauthorised recipients were also recovered.
