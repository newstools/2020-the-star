SportPesa CEO Ronald Kauri has announced the betting firm's return to the Kenyan market. Karauri on Friday said the company will focus on upholding the highest standards of service and responsible gaming. "SportPesa is back! I’m happy to announce that the SportPesa brand is back under a new BCLB license holder," Karauri tweeted. The Sportpesa boss said as market leaders, the firm will focus on upholding the highest standards of service and responsible gaming. Karauri said he was looking forward to working closely with BCLB and all other stakeholders. "We are excited to explore a wide range of partnerships in Kenya over the coming weeks and months, which will prioritise the development of sports in communities across our Great Country!" Karauri said. The firm last October sent more than 400 employees home following its shutdown. The firm said it would resume operations when Kenya puts in place "adequate taxation and non-hostile regulatory environment". The move followed the government's decision to impose a 20 per cent tax on all betting stakes, a move that the firms cited as damaging on both their customers and Treasury. The firm said compounded by the currently in-effect 20 per cent Withholding Tax on Winnings, the economic incentive to place bets will be completely removed as the taxes will deprive consumers of their total winnings.
