Diamond Platnumz has been performing in Tanzania President John Magufuli's campaign rallies together with his signees. Magufuli is seeking reelection for a second five-year term. He even remixed his popular song Baba Lao, a Swahili phrase that loosely means 'Their Boss', to Magufuli Baba Lao. The song not only praises the President but also Vice President Samia Suluhu, Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa and other leaders, as well as CCM. In one of the performances, Magufuli called Diamond and put his hat on him as a sign of appreciation. Despite these activities, Diamond has said he will not join politics any time soon. "Honestly, not yet. As a Tanzanian, I will support anyone who will bring development but at the moment, I want to be fully in the music industry to bring development." He went on to say that the youth need to put more effort into what they are doing as hard work is rewarding. Diamond's manager Babu Tale is running for MP in Morogoro on the CCM ticket.
