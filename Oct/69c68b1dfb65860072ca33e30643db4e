The death toll in the Sunday morning accident in Naivasha hit seven after two more died while undergoing treatment. The two men succumbed to their injuries while undergoing treatment at Naivasha Subcounty Hospital where they had been rushed following the accident at Raini centre along the Nairobi-Nakuru highway. The victims were identified as workers from Eldoret-based Mega Wholesalers. They were heading back to their work station from Nairobi when the van lost control and rolled several times. Three died on the spot, while two were pronounced dead on arrival. The other two succumbed to their injuries while undergoing treatment. Naivasha police boss Samuel Waweru said the two were in the process of being transferred to KNH for specialised treatment. “The Sunday accident has claimed two more lives, bringing to seven the total number while the remaining two are undergoing treatment,” Waweru said. The accident occurred on the same spot where two years ago 14 vehicles were involved in an accident that claimed the lives of over 60 people. The management of Naivasha Subcounty Hospital expressed its concern over the rise in the number of accidents since the restrictions on movement were eased. The superintendent in charge of the Level 5 hospital, Dr Angeline Ithondeka, said the number of accidents, especially on weekends, has shot up by over 300 per cent, with many involving cases of drink-driving. Ithondeka attributed this to the high number of vehicles on the road since the travel regulations were eased and bars reopened. “At the height of the pandemic when movement was limited, we were recording less than 10 accidents per week but this has shot to over 200,” she said. “We had an incident in which two drivers involved in a serious accident were drunk and this is turning out to be the norm on weekends,” she said.
