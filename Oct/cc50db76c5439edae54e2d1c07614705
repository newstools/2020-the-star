At least one day school in each ward in Othaya constituency will be turned into a centre of excellence. MP Gichuki Mugambi said the objective is to ensure day schools have facilities similar to those in boarding institutions. The move will enable children who cannot afford to join boarding schools to access equal opportunities in day schools and compete with their boarding colleagues. The learning institutions will be upgraded using Othaya NG-CDF. Already, Kiahagu Day Secondary School has been selected to pioneer the project . The MP on Friday presented a Sh7.5 million, 51-seater school bus bought with CDF for the institution. A laboratory has also been constructed and the building of a computer lab and a library are ongoing. “We have picked a school in every ward. Every year we are going to be promoting one school in each of our four wards into a center of excellence,” he said. “I started with Kiahagu Secondary School because it has the biggest population in day schools. It has 420 students, it's in town and so it is centrally accessible from all wards.” The MP also distributed revision books to 56 primary schools procured by NG-CDF for Sh6 million to help pupils revise and prepare for their exams. The MP also presided over the disbursement of Sh4.2 million Uwezo Fund cheques to 68 groups. The money, he said, will help people whose businesses were adversely affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. Kiahagu school Board of Management chairperson Ruth Ngechu thanked CDF for the bus and the school’s infrastructure improvements. The student population is growing and at times the school had to do extra work to take students out for learning, she said. “We used to hire vehicles for school activities, but some were not appropriate so we had to use public means,” she said. The school, she added, is doing well in sporting activities and the bus will carry them for sports events.(Edited by V. Graham)
