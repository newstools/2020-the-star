Police in Mai Mahiu, Naivasha, are searching for a man who allegedly stabbed his friend, killing him over a Sh20 bar bill. The body was found on Monday morning a few metres outside the bar in Governors Camp centre where the fight occurred. Witness Jeremiah Maina said the two drinkers were arguing over the Sh20 when one man pulled a knife on the other. The victim was stabbed in the chest; the assailant fled in the night. “On being stabbed, the victim stumbled out of the bar," Maina said. Meanwhile, a mother and her four-year-old son on a motorcycle were killed in a crash in Mai Mahiu on Monday morning. It occurred hours after three people, including a minor, were killed in an accident involving three vehicles on the Nairobi-Nakuru highway. The latest accident brought to five the number of those killed on the road in two days. The mother and son died after their motorcycle was hit by a truck that had collided head-on with another truck near Mafuta Taa centre on the busy road. Witness John Kimani said the two lorries were headed in opposite directions and collided head-on, seriously injuring the occupants. The driver of one lorry lost control and crashed into the passing motorcycle carrying the woman and her son. “The mother and the boy died on the spot while the motorcycle operator and all the people in the lorries were seriously injured and rushed to Mai Mahiu health center,” Kimani said. Naivasha OCPD Samuel Waweru said police were seeking the murder suspect. "The rise in the number of accidents is due to the high number of motorists on the road after travel restrictions were eased," he said. (Edited by V. Graham)
