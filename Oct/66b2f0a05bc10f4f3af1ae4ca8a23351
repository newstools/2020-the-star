After stepping up on their fitness levels for the past one month, Wazalendo are expected to begin intense training anytime in readiness for the African Cup of Club Championship later next month in Blantyre, Malawi. Players are required to run 20km a week to test their endurance as the team seek to embrace the once a week training. Wazalendo Masters’ forward Richard Njuki, who plies trade in the Super League and waits promotion to the senior team that plays in the Premier League, is hoping to make the cut for the Africa club show. The 20-year-old scored eight goals last season. The attacker was part of the national Under-18 team that took part in 2018 Youth Olympic Games in Argentina, where he scored thrice. He had a mixed season in 2019, owing to illness hence his form dipped a bit. The now fit-gain Njuki is focusing on impressing in training in a bid to catch the eyes of the team selectors. “The illness is behind me and I am working hard to be fully fit and who knows, I may be part of the traveling party. All I need is to remain grounded.” Njuki is, however, impressed with the way the players have managed themselves amidst the Covid-19 challenges. “We are working hard to get to competitive levels. Our opponents in Africa Club show started training long time ago and we will need to catch up fast. So far so good as we wait for the crucial part of training to commence.” The Kenyan representatives will be making a debut in the prestigious competition need close to Sh8 million to make the trip.
