Motivational speaker pastor Robert Burale says his father's fighting spirit helped him live longer after developing a brain tumour. Speaking on Jessy Junction, Burale said, "The doctor gave him seven days to live, but he was a fighter and he died one year after the surgery," he said. "He was a good man who made sure I went to church even when my siblings and I wanted to go out. He would say, ‘Let's go to church, you will go to the club later.’ He knew what he was doing." Burale says his father was planting in him the seed of salvation. "I was listening to a story on Hope FM and that’s when I called a pastor," he said. "He told me to see him the next day but I told him I did not have until tomorrow. He asked me to meet him on Ngong Road. We stayed till midnight, and that’s when I gave my life to Christ."
