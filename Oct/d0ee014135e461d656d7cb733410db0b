Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu wants Kenyans to endorse the Building Bridges Initiative report as it addresses the country's endemic problems and provides their long-term solutions. The governor said the 35 per cent allocation of the country's revenue share to the counties from 15 per cent will not only strengthen devolution but ensure the devolved units have adequate funds to function efficiently. Ngilu, who spoke at Katulani in Kitui Central on Thursday, said youth unemployment will be sorted out through skills development and innovations and not through the culture handouts and tokenism practised by some politicians. "The unemployment and economic disparity among Kenyans cannot be solved by wheelbarrows but by skills development, apprenticeship and creation of a market for manufactured products," she said. She said the BBI will boost the implementation of healthcare, pre-primary education, food production, water provision and maintenance of roads. The governor noted that the increased resource allocation will grow her governmentâ€™s already initiated manufacturing sector for more job opportunities and enhanced revenue base. She welcomed the BBI report for addressing gender disparity in both elective and appointive public organisations. "Women will have the right to seek elective positions as enshrined in the 2010 Constitution. These positions are not a preserve of any gender," Ngilu said.  - mwaniki fm
