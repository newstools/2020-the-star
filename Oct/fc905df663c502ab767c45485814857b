The Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions has okayed a murder charge against Malindi MP Aisha Jumwa over the killing of a man during last year's Ganda Ward by-election. The ODPP on Wednesday said it's Mombasa Regional Head Alloys Kemo had approved murder and assault charges against Jumwa and Geoffrey Okuto Otieno over the fatal shooting of the man and injury of several people during the poll. The man was shot in the shoulder and killed during the chaos and several other people, including police officers, were injured. Jumwa had stormed a meeting organised by Reuben Katana, an ODM candidate in the by-election. Gumbao Jola, 48, died upon arrival at Malindi General Hospital. He was Katanaâ€™s uncle. Chaos erupted soon after the MP arrived at the meeting in a convoy of three vehicles forcing police officers to shoot in the air several times. Jumwa had accused Katana of campaigning long after the campaign window period had been closed. Katana was at the time hosting more than 500 people at his home. The murder charges come a few months after Jumwa was freed on Sh5 million bond after pleading not guilty to six counts of money laundering, acquiring proceeds of a crime, conflict of interest as well as fraud. Jumwa, alongside six other people and a company, was accused of defrauding the Malindi CDF of Sh19 million. The money was allegedly misappropriated during the construction of a school building. She faced two charges of acquiring proceeds of a crime. Jumwa was accused of receiving Sh2.5 million in her Cooperative bank on September 12, 2018, and Sh900,000 on August 17, 2018, from Multserve Contractors Limited. The legislator is also accused of money laundering by unlawfully disposing of funds received from the NG-CDF by concealing the two transactions.
