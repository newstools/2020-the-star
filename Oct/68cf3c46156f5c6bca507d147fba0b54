Following the opening of motorsport events provided they comply with the COVID-19 protocols, the Kenya Motor Sport Federation (KMSF) has set the date for this year’s Total Excellium Economy Run for November 21st. This annual event has been held by the Alfa Romeo Owners Club for the past 38 years to encourage driving safely within speed limits. In addition to promoting safe driving, the event will demonstrate the advantages of Total Excellium fuel. The winner will be the competitor using the least amount of petrol within the allocated time. The route will start at the ABC Service Station in Waiyaki Way and finish at the Total Moi Road outlet in the centre of Naivasha town. Last year’s winner was Micky Bassi, driving his 1989 Alfa 75 fuel injection sports saloon. This was Micky’s second successive victory and he used only 2.54 litres of fuel to cover the 94-kilometre route, giving him the outstanding fuel consumption of 37km per litre. After completing the course competitors will gather in the grounds of Matteo’s Italian restaurant on South Lake Road for a care contest, lunch and prize giving.
