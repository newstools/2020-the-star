President Uhuru Kenyatta has sent a message of congratulations to his Tanzanian counterpart John Pombe Magufuli following his re-election in the just concluded General Election. The President said Magufuli's re-election demonstrates the deep love, confidence and trust the people of Tanzania have in his leadership. "On behalf of the People and the Government of the Republic of Kenya and on my own behalf, I congratulate you, my brother, Dr John Pombe Magufuli on your election victory and that of your party, Chama Cha Mapinduzi, in the just concluded election. Uhuru added that Magufuli's extension to power is an endorsement of his plans for the future prosperity of the country. "We in Kenya look forward to continuing working with your Administration for the benefit of the people of our two nations, for the prosperity of East Africa and for the peace, stability and growth of the African continent," Uhuru said. Magufuli's landslide victory was however described as fraudulent by his main rival, Tundu Lissu. Lissu has said his party's agents were prevented from entering polling stations during Wednesday's election. However, the National Electoral Commission (NEC) has dismissed the claims of fraud. In its final results, the NEC said the president took 84 per cent of the vote, while Mr Lissu received 13 per cent. President Kenyatta wished his Tanzanian counterpart good health and success as he settles into office for his second term and assured him of Kenya's continued collaboration with his administration. â€œYour Excellency, as you settle down for your second term in office, I wish you good health and assure you of Kenya's support and commitment to continue partnering with your Administration in pursuit of mutually beneficial objectives," Uhuru said.
