One person died on Tuesday after a quarry collapsed at Maweni in Ukunda, Kwale county. Another person is feared dead as evacuatino efforts continue. The quarry caved in as the two were harvesting sand, burying them alive. Msambweni sub-county police commander Nehemiah Bitok said the two were trapped in a mass of stones and sand. Rescue efforts by locals were hampered by lack of  proper equipment. Red Cross and police officers have joined rescue efforts. “We believe, it was only the two trapped, but we will try hard to rescue any other survivor,” Bitok said. The collapse is suspected to have been caused by loose sand and stones around the mining site. In April, three people were rescued after a 20-foot pit-latrine collapsed in Matuga. The county meteorological department in May cautioned miners against landslides due to the heavy rains. Met director Dominic Mbindyo warned that the quarry might not be safe even after the rainy season was over due to the water intensity in the soil. “Heavy rains were experienced and the soil is wea;, the mining activities should at least be temporarily stopped to avoid disasters,” said Mbindyo.
