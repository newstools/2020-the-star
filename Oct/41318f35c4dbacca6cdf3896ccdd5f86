Mt Kenya politicians who have been following their colleagues from other regions for cash handouts are to blame for the chaos that left two dead in Kenol, Murang’a, on Sunday. Othaya MP Gichuki Mugambi said on Tuesday some people are out to cause divisions in the Mt Kenya region for their own political interests. The MP termed it unfortunate for people to lose their lives long before the electioneering starts because of the political heat introduced in the region by 'outsiders'. “Why did they have to lose their lives? It is time we ask ourselves why we are fighting among ourselves, yet we have the presidency,” he said. Mugambi urged Mt Kenya politicians to respect the President. Some of them have been talking about the 2022 succession, he said. The MP said President Uhuru Kenyatta has done a lot for the region and the country as a whole and wondered what the leaders are looking for from aspirants. He cited the construction of new roads, the recarpeting of others and the operationalisation of Othaya Level 6 Hospital as some of the projects the President has implemented in Othaya. Oxygen bulk tanks have been installed at the facility. Heath CS Mutahi Kagwe is also expected to commission the construction of KMTC in the area on Friday this week. “Let people not lie to you that they have better things to offer in 2022 than what is being done now. But we shall chart the way forward when that time comes,” he said. He said leaders should allow Uhuru to complete his term and fulfil his pledges to Kenyans. Edited by A.N
