The widow of the late freedom fighter Dedan Kimathi has asked Kenyans to unite and create a peaceful environment for co-existence. The 93-year-old Mukami Kimathi said a peaceful environment will enable everyone to transact their business without fear. She said the handshake between Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga was necessary so that the country remains united. “Watu wapendane. Tulifurahi wakati Uhuru walishikana na Raila. Wakishikana wote pamoja Mungu anaishi mahali kuna upendo (Let people love each other. We were happy when Uhuru joined hands with Raila. God lives where there is unity),” she said. Mukami said Mashujaa Day should be a day in which war veterans have reason to be happy. She asked the president to remember the woes of those who labored to liberate Kenya from the hand of colonialists. “Let the president hear our cry that those who fought for independence must not be forgotten,” she said. She was addressing journalists at her home in Komarock area, Nairobi when a section of leaders visited her as part of Mashujaa Day celebrations. “If the president gets back the land that was grabbed by colonialists we will be happy,” she said, asking the state to allocate her a piece of land in Laikipia. Former Makadara MP Reuben Ndolo and East African Legislative Assembly MP Mpuru Aburi led a section of politicians who visited her. Ndolo urged government leaders to stop politicking and focus on the citizenry most of whom remain in poverty. “Our people still need employment and development, there is no reason to engage in politics all the time,” Ndolo said. The leaders gifted the war veteran with foodstuffs. Others in the ceremony were Mukami’s daughters Everlyn Kimathi, Mirriam Nyawira and her brother Mbuthia Wangombe.
