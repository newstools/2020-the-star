Ndhiwa constituency has started renovating school infrastructure ahead of reopening, which as yet has not been scheduled. The Sh42.25 million project includes expanding classrooms, constructing lockable desks and buying laboratory equipment. The money has been sourced from the Ndhiwa CDF fund. Area MP Martin Owino disbursed the cheques on Saturday at the constituency offices in Ndhiwa town. In the programme, Sh22.25 million has been disbursed for construction of classrooms and dormitories in 27 primary schools and seven secondary schools. The kitty also allocated Sh10 million for the construction of lockable desks for 35 secondary schools. Another Sh10 million has been spent on buying laboratory equipment for 17 secondary schools. Speaking during the distribution, the MP said part of the money had been sourced from the bursary. “The NG-CDF board allowed us to spend the money on infrastructure instead  because students were not going to school due to the Covid-19 pandemic,” Owino said. The MP said the infrastructure project aims to create more space for pupils when undertaking their studies. “Adequate space is among the protocols required to contain coronavirus,” Owino said. He said his office will always put the necessary measures to create an enabling environment for learners to go to school. Owino also bought seven water tanks for seven primary schools. “Education is the key to economic development in the society, hence we must equip our children with learning facilities,” the MP said. The initiative will supplement the ongoing government’s programme of adding more desks to school. Ndhiwa assistant county commissioner Joseph Maina told the boards of management of schools targeted to use the resources wisely. “Let schools which have benefited utilise the funds appropriately so that residents can get value for money,” Maina said.
