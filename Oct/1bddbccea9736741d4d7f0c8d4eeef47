Nairobi Water Company has announced a plan to shut down water supply pipeline along Mombasa road. The company on Friday said this is following the ongoing construction of the JKIA-Westlands Expressway near Bellevue to Southern bypass. Managing Director Nahashon Muguna said the shutdown will start at 6am on Saturday to Sunday 11 at 6am. "This will facilitate the interconnection of the new and old pipelines and enable the release of the road median to the Expressway road contractor," Muguna said. He said Estates along Mombasa road from City Stadium including the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, Standard Guage Railway, Athi River Export Processing Zone, Coca Cola, Mukuru, Imara Daima, North Airport road and Embakasi.

"We appeal for public indulgence as we work towards restoring the supply. We further urge members of public to use the available water sparingly,"Muguna said.
