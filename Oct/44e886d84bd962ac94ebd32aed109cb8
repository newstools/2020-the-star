AAR Insurance has reported a 40 per cent rise in uptake of its digital platforms signaling a shift towards technology in health underwriting. Most use is in the 25 - 45 age group, the underwriter said yesterday, with 52 per cent of users being men and 48 per cent women. Chief Operations Officer Mercy Ndegwa said while the increased use of digital platforms is partly attributable to Covid-19 limiting in-person contact between clients and service providers, convenience is a key factor for tech-savvy consumers. “As part of our digital transformation strategy, we have automated most of our services leading to improved efficiency, faster turnaround times and a better customer experience,” Ndegwa said. Ndegwa added that digitisation of processes means customers can conveniently access services from anywhere using various mobile applications thus saving time. “Our core operating systems are now cloud-based and able to support real-time, secure online transactions while reducing our operational costs as we don’t have to maintain a physical data center,"she said. AAR clients can also access their records electronically via mobile apps and the company’s web portal and pay for services using mobile money platforms like M-Pesa. This has seen the time taken to process claims fall teduced to 48 hours. The M-TIBA online health platform enables clients to manage their medical expenses using mobile phones. AAR has also partnered with e-health providers MyDawa and CheckUps to offer home delivery services for prescription medicine. Digital insurance, also referred to as insuretech, has been touted as an effective channel for boosting insurance uptake in the country.
