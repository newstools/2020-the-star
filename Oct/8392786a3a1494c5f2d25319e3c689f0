Two men are expected in court on Wednesday after they were arrested for running a fake Facebook account and impersonating immigration personnel. The two identified as Joseph Karanja and Dennis Ndambuki were arrested after it emerged they have been running a Facebook page “Immigration Customer KE”. It is on this page that they frequently post information on the services offered by the department. They then direct the unsuspicious public seeking services at immigration to send direct messages to them for any assistance. They then give personal numbers for further communication. Investigations have shown the two have been working with individuals stationed at the Immigration offices Nyayo House who helped them access the victims’ data and later use the same to make documents. The suspects would then promise the victims that they would help fast-track their applications such as those for passports, visas, and work permits and charge various amounts for the services. Once the victims pay the deposit for the process to begin, the two create hurdles after hurdles that they use to keep siphoning money from the victims. They eventually stop answering the victims’ calls.
