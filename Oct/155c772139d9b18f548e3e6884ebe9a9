Singer Victoria Kimani says she has never felt safe or protected by African men. In a series of tweets and Instagram posts, the American-born Kenyan singer, who was calling for an end to gender-based violence (GBV) in Africa, said African men have always looked down on women. "I can’t lie, have I ever felt safe or protected by African men? Nope," she said. She explained why it "sucks" to be a woman in Africa. "Being an African woman in Africa is the f***g ghetto, it’s a traumatising experience, it sucks. "We are undervalued, underpaid, underappreciated and simply under the radar. I hate it here from the bottom of my heart. We won't even talk about the men." Victoria said African men belittle women to the point they only exist to serve men's purposes. "African women are not your punching bag, not your sex toy, not your ego boosters, not your servant and certainly, not your enemy," she said. "African men reduce their women constantly. Break them down to a size that serves them only."
