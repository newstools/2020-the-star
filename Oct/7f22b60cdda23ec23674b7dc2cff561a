Classic 105 presenter Maina Kageni has urged Kenyans to show support and pray for Nigeria as the country battles with police brutality. For two weeks, Nigerians have protested over a now-disbanded police unit - the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (Sars) which is linked to numerous unsolved rapes, murders and theft. In a video recording on Wednesday, Maina encouraged Nigerians not to relent in their quest for their rights as he assured them of Kenyans' support. "You are not alone no matter what they do. We shall stand by you. You deserve your rights. You are the richest country in Africa and yet you don't get anything near what you deserve," he said. "Whatever they throw at you, be strong,  we move together. Not just as Nigerians but as Africa." It was alleged there were several killed and several others injured after police in different districts of Lagos fired shots directly at protestors. The government has, however, denied this. The chaos happened during attempts to enforce the the indefinite 24-hour curfew  imposed on Lagos and other regions. Citizens have condemned President Muhammadu Buhari, accusing him of being silent about their plea. Buhari has since appealed for "understanding and calm".
