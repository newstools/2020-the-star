The government owes the National Cereals and Produce Board Sh18 billion dating back to 2017. Joseph Kimote, NCPB managing director, said this is money accrued from the purchase of subsidy maize and fertiliser. He spoke last week during a meeting with partners fighting aflatoxin at NCPB headquarters. He said some government institutions and agencies are yet to pay their debt for grain management and purchase of fertiliser that the cereals board did on their behalf. "The Devolution ministry owes us about Sh974 million and we also have some counties that bought maize from our depots," he said. Kimote, however, said discussions are underway with the government to address the issue. He said NCPB is planning to buy at least 3 million bags of maize from farmers for the long rains season harvest. The director said they are prepared to buy over 3 million bags and with the minimum price of Sh2,500 per 90kg bag as directed by the President, this will cost an estimated Sh7.5 billion. President Uhuru Kenyatta on September 28 directed that the minimum maize selling price by the farmers of maize be Sh2,500 per 90kg and that the Ministry of Agriculture should ensure they enforce these prices. "The above interventions will therefore mean that the Country will have sufficient maize and therefore there will be no maize imports from outside Comesa/EAC. The millers are therefore directed to ensure that they prioritize mopping up all the maize available locally," Uhuru said. Kimote said they do not have the money and called upon the institutions and agencies to honour their debts. He explained that despite the new reforms at NCPB, they will still be buying maize from farmers on a commercial basis but not on behalf of the government. â€œInitially, NCPB bought and sold maize on behalf of the government but this has changed with current reforms," Kimote said.
