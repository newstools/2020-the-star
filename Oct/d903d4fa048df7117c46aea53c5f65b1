Troubled Tuskys Supermarket has made two key appointments to help improve its financial systems. The firm has been battling a mass exit of senior managers with the latest being the exit of the chief financial officer Daniel Ndirangu who left last month. The retail chains board yesterday announced the appointment of Chadwick Okumu and Caroline Karimi as the Chief Finance Officer and Internal Audit Manager respectively. Board chairman Bernard  Kahianyu said the appointments form part of reorganising  Tusky's management functions in line with existing operating challenges as it seeks to boost investor confidence. The two executives, he said will provide much-needed support to the  management team led by the CEO Dan Githua to secure value for the firm’s shareholders and other stakeholders. Kahianyu said the two seasoned financial experts would play a key role in steadying the firm’s financial docket. “We are excited to be welcoming aboard these two executives to Tuskys as we continue to define and chart a new course for this ship in turbulent times,” said Kahianyu. Okumu is joining Tuskys from IwayAfrica Kenya Limited where he has been serving as the Finance Manager. Karimi is joining the retailer from Qatar Airways, where she has been serving as the Uganda and Rwanda Finance Manager.
