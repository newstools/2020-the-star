Machakos county police commander Karanja Muiruri has been promoted to Nyanza regional police commander. He replaces regional boss Lydia Ligami who had taken over from Noah Mwivanda. Sources said Ligami has been recalled to the headquarters. Mwivanda was moved to Nyanza in May this year to replace Vincent Makokha. Karanja is expected to take over immediately. Ligami was among senior security officials who were injured in a plane crash in June this year in Meru as they headed for a security meeting in Sololo, Marsabit county. Sources termed the change normal. Karanja has served as Msambweni subcounty police boss, Samburu county police commander before being transferred to Machakos in the same position. In 2015, Karanja was pivotal in the crime management in Kisumu, where he led Quick Response Team to fight illicit brew and criminal gangs in the lakeside city. At one point, he impounded thousands of litres of illicit brew in a building near Kisumu State Lodge.
