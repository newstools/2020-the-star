Khaligraph Jones and his wife Georgina Muteti have welcomed a new addition to their family. Baby Lu was born on October 11 but the couple kept the news to themselves. Georgina revealed through her Instagram page that she gave birth to her second-born through normal delivery, unlike her first pregnancy where she had to undergo an emergency Cesarean Section. "I did it! I got my VBAC! 11/10/2012:58 AM, After having a caesarean birth *emergency* with my first child (Amali), I had a safe vaginal delivery with my second. Baby Lu. That was only after changing hospitals twice, switching doctors last minute and believing in myself. "Through prayer and screaming during labor I delivered my son. Iâ€™m a happy and tired mum of two now," she posted. Khaligraph posted a video of himself with his two children rapping to his latest track Kwenda.
