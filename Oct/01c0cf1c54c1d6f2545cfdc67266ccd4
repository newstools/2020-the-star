A candidate from Mbale High School died in a road accident on Monday at Lunyerere in Vihiga as schools reopened. This happened as learners went back to their learning institutions after a seven-month break. Speaking on Monday, Education CS George Magoha said no child should be sent home for lack of school fees. "For boarding schools, may I plead with principals to ensure that no child is sent home on account of school fees," Magoha said. The CS said with the progressive reopening of schools, all protocols of MoH have been put in place. During the 12th address on the Covid-19 in the country at the Kenyatta International Convention Center on Monday, President Uhuru Kenyatta urged a focus on ‘how’ schools would reopen and not ‘when’. He charged CS Education to come with modalities on how the students can be kept safe in schools before announcing the reopening date.
