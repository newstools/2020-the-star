Kwale has recorded more than  200 cases of road accidents since the beginning of January. More than 15 people died outright, many more died from grieious injuries later. The exact number was not known, nor the number injured. Police commander Joseph Nthenge said the county has been listed as among the regions with an alarming number of road accidents. He said most accidents were caused by boda boda and tuk-tuk drivers. “So many motorists drive so recklessly like they never went to driving schools and boda bodas are notorious,” he said. Speeding and violting traffic rules by most drivers were cited as among the causes of road accidents . By February about, 60 per cent of road accidents in Matuga constituency alone were reported to have been caused by reckless boda boda riders. Many accidents happened along the Mombasa-Ukunda-Lunga-Lunga highway followed by the Kwale-Kombani route. Nthenge said the accidents have claimed  innocent lives while some sustained permanent injuries. “Many have died, and human bodies don’t have spare parts, so some survivors cripples forever,” he said. He said majothe rity of the victims of road accidents in Kwale are passengers whose lives are cut short by "arrogant drivers". Recently, more than five people died and several others were seriously injured in head-on crashes in Matunga. The officer emphasised that motorits should observe traffic rules to bring order to the roads. Violators wil face stern action, he said. He urged PSV drivers to obsrve covid-19 health protocols.
