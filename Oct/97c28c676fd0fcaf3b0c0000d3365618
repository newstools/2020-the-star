Three saccos have sued the Nairobi Metropolitan Services for banningÂ  matatus from the Central Business District by Sunday. Snowball, Astra Ell and Avertech want the court to suspend the blanket ban, saying it is unfair. Their matatus ply Nairobi-Ngong-Kiserian and Langata routes. In February, the Nairobi City County government and the national government signed a Deed of Transfer under which the county government surrendered some of its functions to the national government. The NMS was established by President Uhuru Kenyatta to perform those functions. The saccos said they learnt that NMS was in the process of introducing a blanket ban on all PSVs from accessing or operating in the CBD. On September 8, NMS director general Mohamed Badi announced that a decision had been made to ban all public service vehicles from the CBD with effect from November 1. Matatu operators were given 14 days to leave. The three saccos say that their concerns were unique and different from those of other PSV operators that do not have private bus termini, parking, holding areas or stages for dropping and picking up passengers. They said they sought to meet the NMS to raise their grievances but this was unsuccessful.  Edited by Henry Makori
