Gor Mahia are threatening to hire a new head coach should Steven Polack fail to jet back to the country by the end of the week. Polack proceeded on a 10-day leave to Finland at the start of the last month but he is yet to return. Despite the existing restrictions on football, the Kenyan champions resumed training two weeks ago under  assistant coach Patrick Odhiambo revealing that they are preparing for the Caf Champions League. Having watched Polack's predecessors proceed for leave only to fail to come back, Gor said they will not be caught flat-footed this time round if their gaffer fail to resume work. Club treasurer Dolfina Odhiambo said they will seek to peruse through the curriculum vitaes of the coaches who have expressed interest in the job starting next week. "We are expecting Polack to be back at the end of the week. He was supposed to come earlier but we understand he delayed due to the 14-day mandatory quarantine when he arrived home," said Odhiambo. "If he doesn't come back by the end of the week, then we will have to bring in a new coach. There are a handful of applications at our disposal and from which we can get a replacement," she said Meanwhile, clubs taking part in the top flight yesterday received the first consignment from a set of 1,600 balls lined up by Football Kenya Federation as a grant ahead of the 2020/21 season. Each club in the top flight league, National Super League and Women Premier League will receive 20 balls each while clubs participating in the men Division One League and Women Division League will get 10 balls each. "It is a good gesture from the Federation to provide quality training and match day equipment,” said Gor Mahia Acting Secretary-General Raymond Oruo who was confirmed by the club as the sports management consultant. “As you know, match balls are pretty expensive. This grant goes a long way in reducing club expenditure,” he added.
