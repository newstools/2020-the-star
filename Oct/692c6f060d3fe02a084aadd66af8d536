Inspector-General of Police Hillary Mutyambai has announced the enforcement of random alcohol checks in all major towns. This he said, follows the rise in fatal accidents in past weeks linked to drunk-driving. During the #EngageTheIG QnA session on Twitter on Monday, the police boss said alcohol levels will be determined in hospitals under strict Covid-19 rules. "There will be random drunk-driving checks mainly because there has been a rise in the number of fatal accidents related to drunk-driving," he said. "The alcohol levels in the bloodstream will be determined by doctors in hospitals under strict Covid-19 rules." This comes hours after three people, including a four-year-old child, died after a matatu they were travelling in was hit by a speeding bus near Kinungi trading centre in Naivasha. More than 10 people were injured, six of them seriously, in the Sunday morning incident that also claimed the lives of a man and woman. The driver of a bus headed to Kisumu from Nairobi hit a lorry heading in the same direction before crashing onto an oncoming matatu, killing the three. In a joint statement on October 9,  Mutyambai and National Transport and Safety Authority Director-General George Njao revealed at least 60 people lost their lives between October 2 and 4 with the accidents being attributed to speeding and drank driving. According to the police, some 2,689 people have lost their lives so far between January 1 and September 30. This is an increase of 1.3 per cent compared to the same period last year where 2,655 people had lost their lives. Motorcyclists and pillion passenger deaths increased by 44.94 per cent and 19.44 per cent respectively.
