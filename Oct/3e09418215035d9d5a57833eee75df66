An Embu court has reprimanded policemen who locked up a suspect who was seriously injured in a bar brawl and did not take him to hospital Principal Magistrate Henry Nyakwemba said it was wrong for Itabua Police Station officers to keep Sammy Mbogo, who had a serious eye and forehead injury, in the cell without taking him to the hospital. Nyakwemba wondered what could have happened if the suspect bled internally in the brain and died in the cell, noting that this is a mistake that should not be repeated again. Mbogo, who was taken before the magistrate on Monday to answer to charges after a fight at Kivue Town in Embu County, said he was injured as he separated revellers who were fighting during a birthday party. The suspect could not see with his left eye, which was swollen. Mbogo said he was locked up at the station and was never taken to the hospital despite the pain. Nyakwemba released the suspect on a personal bond so that he could go to hospital and return to plead to his charges on October 26 this year.
