Kakamega Homeboyz's skilful winger Moses Mudavadi is happy with his call up to the national team and has promised to fight for a position in the first eleven. Mudavadi is grateful to the new Harambee Stars' leadership under Jacob Ghost Mulee for giving him an opportunity. This is the second time Mudavadi is being called up to the national team and hopes to reciprocate in a big way. “This is a dream come true and I can assure you I will not disappoint those who have shown confidence in me," he added.  "This is a good for my club Kakamega Homeboyz too because it will motivate other players to work hard knowing they are closely being monitored,” he added. He said his aim is to work with other players to ensure Stars qualify for the  African Cup of Nations. “I know most of the players have struggled with match fitness but I believe we have the time to catch up before the assignment at hand,” he added. Homeboyz coach Nicholas Muyoti lauded Jacob 'Ghost' Mulee for giving Mudavadi the opportunity. “He has assembled a good side and  we need to rally behind the team,” said Muyoti.
