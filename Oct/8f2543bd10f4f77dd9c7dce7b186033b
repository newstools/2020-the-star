Mombasa MCAs are on the spot after it emerged some of them are still interacting with staff members despite being asked to self-isolate. This comes days after the county assembly was shut for two weeks as seven MCAs tested positive for Covid-19. Deputy speaker Fadhili Makarani said the health committee issued a letter to all members who tested positive to stay at home. Chief whip Junior Wambua said those who tested negative for Covid-19 can continue with their normal duties apart from attending sittings, which were put on hold for 14 days. The premises have not been fumigated. But Wambua said fumigation will be carried out soon. â€œFumigation of the place is a process because a tender needs to be done but it will take place anytime. To the MCAs who are still visiting the place, I will talk to them to stay at home and stop interacting with the staff who have not been tested until the process is done. Public relations communications officer Richard Chacha said contact tracing was being done.
