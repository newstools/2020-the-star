Many of Nairobi's street children have been victims of human trafficking, Awareness Against Human Trafficking Kenya has said. In a study titled 'From Streets to Slavery', HAART says the children are always at risk of trafficking because of their desire to leave the streets, which they deem violent. They seek to escape violence from other street people, bystanders and the police. There is also constant sexual abuse. "Heavy substance use also makes it easier to lure the children," HAART found in the research. However, there is no concrete data on trafficked street children as they are constantly mobile. Noting that Covid-19 has worsened the situation, HAART says the loss of livelihood for many street children during the pandemic puts them at a higher risk of trafficking and re-trafficking. The study also found the street children collect different types of recyclables,  beg and sometimes engage in crime to earn an income. And with the increase of cashless transactions, begging no longer brings a lot of income. The children have thus taken up more illegal money-making activities, putting them at risk of trafficking. "The illegalities included stealing, snatching bags and phones, pickpocketing, stealing side mirrors and tricking people to give them money," HAART said. Street children also ferry drugs or other illegal substances as they do not raise suspicion easily, the anti-trafficking organisation said. Both street boys and girls also get income from prostitution but it is more common with the latter, with most not getting compensation for what they do. More and more children are moving to the streets according to the Ministry of Social Protection following the economic insecurity occasioned by Covid-19. Data from the recently launched national census of street families indicates Kenya has 46,639 street people, with seven out of 10 being male. Edited by EKibii
