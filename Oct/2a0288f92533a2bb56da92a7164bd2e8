Tusker Project Fame duo Amos and Josh are back together after three years of working separately. Amos went into gospel, while Josh was doing music alone. Speaking to Word Is, Josh said they have wandered for three years but now they are back to doing music together. They came to the limelight after featuring in music reality show Tusker Project Fame. "One of the reasons we completely separated was after our mentor music producer Bruce Odhiambo died," Josh said. "We were lost and did not know how to move on together. We are both born-again. I was lost but now I am back to church. We are determined to do music that cuts across religions and brings people together. "Things changed. I became a father but we are back and have done two EPs." Josh says Bruce taught them many things and have been applying them in life. "For his birthday, we have four songs to remember him, including 'Sherehe', which we released on Monday, which would have been his birthday," he said. Josh posted on Instagram, saying Bruce would have thrown a home party for his birthday with his closest people. "He was a party person and we want to celebrate him. He was more like a father to us. He taught us to work and he even gave us our first car. He raised us to the industry," he wrote. Bruce Odhiambo died in January last year while undergoing treatment at the Nairobi Hospital after he suffered a massive heart attack. He was behind big hits, such as 'Niache Niimbe' by gospel singer Pitson and 'Baadaye' by Amos and Josh featuring King Kaka. A live concert to commemorate Bruce Odhiambo was broadcast on Facebook Live on Sunday.
