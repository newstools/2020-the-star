Narok Governor Samwel Tunai and three others on Saturday survived a Chopper crash in Eldamat Narok County. Tunai was leaving for a funeral of Tompo ole Sai when the incident occurred. Witnesses said the pilot of the chopper tried to take off several times but was unable to. "After taking off for the fifth time, it crash landed after a 100m distance," the witness said. Tunai and the injured people were taken to hospital with a Red Cross ambulance. Area MCA Moses Ole Samante said the governor is out of danger and that people should not worry. It remains unclear what led to the helicopter crash. The accident attracted a huge crowd as area residents tried to catch a glimpse of the aircraft.
