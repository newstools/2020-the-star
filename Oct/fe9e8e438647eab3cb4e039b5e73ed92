Wiper party leader Kalonzo Musyoka is expected to jet into Mombasa in the next one hour to bury his close ally and Wiper deputy organizing secretary Salim Ali Sheikh Bajaber who died on Sunday. Bajaber, who hosted Kalonzo in Mombasa on September 28 while the party leader was on the party’s rebranding tour of the Coast region, died at the Mombasa Hospital after a short illness. Friends and family say he had diabetes and pressure complications. He had been admitted for two days. Bajaber is expected to buried at the Kiziwi cemetery at 1 pm after prayers at the Sparki Mosque. The politician served as Mombasa deputy mayor and Tudor Four councillor on a Kanu ticket in the 90’s. In 2013, he unsuccessfully vied for the Tudor MCA seat through Wiper under Cord. During his last visit to Mombasa on September 28, Kalonzo tasked Bajaber to unite the party after a seeming fallout over businessman Suleiman Shahbal’s expected comeback to the party. Shahbal and Kisauni MP Ali Mbogo are eying the Mombasa governor seat, which is at the centre of the near-fallout. Together with businessman and Wiper NEC member Mohamed Zakir, the former Mombasa deputy mayor was key in the opening if the first ever Wiper office in Mombasa. He was heavily involved in the planning of Kalonzo’s Coast tour.
