Four suspects who obtained over Sh21 million from a Nigerian after luring him into the country in a gold deal scam have pleaded not guilty and released on bond. On Monday, the police said the four lured the Niger man into the country in a gold deal scam. Seth Steve Okute , who is the prime suspect, is accused of luring the victim to his Lux Cargo Group offices at Siginon Warehouse within JKIA, in a plot he termed as following up on the victim's gold from Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire. The suspects obtained the said amount allegedly to expedite a rerouting process of the cargo to the desired destination, before disappearing and leaving the victim stranded. The police said that the four suspects were working alongside other three accomplices. The case will be mentioned on January 18, 2021. On Tuesday, four men who allegedly posed as DCI officers pretending to sell gold, obtained Sh29.9 million from city doctor, court documents said. They were charged with obtaining money under false pretences. Arthur Agutu, George Mbugua, Erick Odinya and Antony Ngeso pleaded not guilty before Kibera senior principal magistrate Charles Mwaniki. They are accused of committing the offence between March and December 1, 2019, at Landmark Suites in Westlands, Nairobi, jointly with others not before court. The charge sheet says they obtained Sh29,956,000 from Dr Ali Raza by purporting that they were in a position to sell him 11.6kg of pure gold.
