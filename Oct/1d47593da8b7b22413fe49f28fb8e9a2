The Kenya Civil Aviation Authority-KCAA has launched investigations to ascertain what caused a chopper crash in Narok County. Director General Capt Gilbert Kibe on Sunday said the Air Accident Investigation Department has already initiated the investigation and will inform the public once concluded. Narok Governor Samwel Tunai and three others on Saturday survived the crash in Eldamat Narok County. Tunai was leaving for a funeral of Tompo ole Sai when the incident occurred. Witnesses said the pilot of the chopper with registration 5YMEP, type Robinson 44 tried to take off several times but was unable to. "After taking off for the fifth time, it crash-landed after a 100m distance," the witness said. Tunai and the injured people were taken to hospital with a Red Cross ambulance. Area MCA Moses Ole Samante said the governor is out of danger and that people should not worry.
