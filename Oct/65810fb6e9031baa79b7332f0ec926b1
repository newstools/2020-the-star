@ppcheti Lamu ward reps have yet to begin using the new Sh214 million assembly building completed 18 months ago for lack of electricity. The premises in Mokowe, Lamu West was completed in April last year. Construction of the complex began in 2016. The new facility is expected to house 36 MCAs and more than 100 members of the public interested in following proceedings. The ward reps currently work from a small block on Lamu island. On Wednesday, Lamu county assembly speaker Paul Kimani said electricity installation was ongoing and the relocation will be done once it is complete. “The plan was to have moved in by July but that hasn’t happened. We are glad the installation of power is underway and will be done soon,” Kimani said. Each of the 32 MCAs will have an office when they occupy the new building. Assembly clerk Mboche Wanyoike who is in charge of the project said they are putting final touches, including ground levelling and planting flowers. “We are basically done and are confident we shall move into the new offices before end year,” Mboche said. The MCAs have complained many times that the current assembly is small and stuffy and hinders effective running of affairs. They said the speedy opening of the new facility will also enable them to practise social distancing among themselves and with the public.
