Truck Drivers and Allied Workers Union has sought to be included in a case challenging the restructuring of Automobile Association of Kenya. The Kenya long-distance drivers union say it is an interested party and needs information about the proposed restructuring to protect members' interests. “We have an existing relationship with AA (K) because of the members we represent. Any restructuring of the entity has serious repercussions hence the reason for the joinder application as an interested party in the case," it says. But AAK officials say the union's application for joinder is based on a misleading and incorrect set of 'facts'. It claims that only members can participate in the decision to convert the association into a public entity and not employees of AAK. “The union is an intruder into affairs that don't concern it and its presence in the suit will only delay the determination of the suit. It is a busy body with no reasonable or genuine concern or grievance,” the officials say. A Nairobi court will on October 21 rule on whether the truck drivers' union will be allowed to participate in proceedings. The case in court was filed by members of AA (K) against its officials. The members sued to stop AA's Annual General Meeting which was scheduled for the election of the officials of the AA's governing council and a vote on a  resolution to demutualise AAK. Principal magistrate Edgar Kagoni had in August barred AA (K) from convening its AGM, conducting elections and transacting any business pending an inter parties hearing of the case. The association which has been in existence for over 100 years is a self-governing club exempted from registration. Membership eligibility is through the payment of subscription fees renewable annually.
