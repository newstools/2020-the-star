Kiss FM presenter Kamene Goro says media was not her first choice in school. Speaking to MC Jessy on his YouTube channel, Kamene said she went to the University of Nairobi and pursued an undergraduate law degree. "I had numerous scholarship offers to study abroad, but my father declined all of them," she said. Her choice to pursue law was influenced by her father's close connections in the industry. "During my second year, I was dispatched to a law firm owned by my father's friend as a paralegal," she said. "Eight months passed by and I felt a calling to pursue something else. Then an opportunity presented itself at Ebru TV, which I took," she recounted. Life took an immediate turn for her in 2016, when she exchanged vows with a foreigner who had charmed his way into her life. "I quit my job, so I gave my former employer two-days notice, after which I travelled to Tanzania to live with my husband," she said, adding that the decision still haunts her. In the two years in marriage, she experienced domestic squabbles like any normal couple, but one phone call from her husband one evening changed her life. "He called me and decided to end the marriage. I hung up the phone and that was the final time we spoke," she said. "Looking back, I thought he was my everything. For a whole week, I was a total wreck because of the separation as I blamed myself for the failure of the marriage." Kamene urged women in similar situations to get back in the dating game to cease from self-accusation.
