Three ex-senators have appealed to the international community to shift their focus on Kenya ahead of the 2022 General Election. Former senators Johnson Muthama (Machakos), Boni Khalwale (Kakamega), and Hassan Omar (Mombasa) want the international community to take note of the tensions and polarisation of the country's political environment. The leaders also called for a travel ban on leaders fueling the animosity being witnessed currently. "We call upon the United Nations Security Council to take note of the tensions and polarisation of the political environment precipitated by Uhuru Kenyatta and Raila Odinga," Muthama said. They cited the recent Public Order Act regulating assemblies and gatherings. "Their foolish audacity to affront and scuttle our Constitution and hard-won freedoms has been witnessed in Murang'a, Kisii and Nyamira, Diani in Kwale and Kakamega." "...part of which is the illegal enforcement of the directives on public order by an illegal entity disguised as the National Security Advisory Committee," Khalwale added. The leaders were speaking at Muthama's private office at Gigiri on Thursday morning.
