Kenya's Peres Jepchirchir has won the women-only world record of 1:05:16 becoming the 2020 World Half Marathon champion. During Friday’s pre-race conference, Jepchirchir had warned that the world record of 1:05:34 she set in September in Valencia was in danger of falling due to the quality of the field And with a spirited sprint in the final 500m, the Kenyan who won the title in 2016 proved her prediction right, slashing 18 seconds off her previous mark. Germany's Melat Yisak Kejeta took silver in the women-only European record of 1:05:18 with Ethiopia's Yalemzerf Yehualaw taking bronze in 1:05:19. The first six women are all under 66, the first time that's ever happened in any race in history! The World Athletics Half Marathon Championships is a biannual competition that, this year, takes place in Gdynia, Poland. The event was due to take place on 29 March but was postponed until October due to the Coronavirus pandemic. Kenya’s former world record holder Joyciline Jepkosgei finished sixth in a time of 1:05:58. She dropped out of the leading pack after taking a tumble in the final five kilometres tripping with Ethiopian Ababel Yeshaneh who finished a place above her.
