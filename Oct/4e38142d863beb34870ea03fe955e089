More than 200 fishermen who depend on Lake Jipe in Taita Taveta county have raised concerns over the fast-falling water levels. They want the government to desilt the freshwater lake to avert possible collapse of the fishing industry. They also want farmers to stop abstracting huge amounts of water from the Njoro Kubwa canal that empties water into the lake. “The low water level has cut short our fishing business that had created employment for over 200 fishermen. Siltation has to be stopped,” Willy Mkudi, the Jipe Beach Management Unit chairman, told the Star in an interview at Mkanjuni beach. He said if the water levels continue to drop, it might lead to the extinction of the Jipe Tilapia locally known as Asili. The lake’s native fish species has helped residents fetch good money after the sale. “We are only left with mudfish that does not fetch good money in the market. There are few tilapia fish left, but they are hard to catch,” Mkudi said. Past research by the International Union of Conservation of Nature listed the Jipe Tilapia, as critically endangered. The 2006 research pointed out the possible extinction of the fish within 20 years. Edited by A.N
