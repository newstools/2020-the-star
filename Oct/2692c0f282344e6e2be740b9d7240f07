World 3,000m steeplechase record holder Beatrice Chepokech continued with her dominance in the water and barrier event when she claimed the Kip Keino Classic title at Nyayo Stadium on Saturday. The resilient Chepkoech won in 9:29.05, edging out Hyvin Kiyeng, who returned 9:34.07 for second with former world junior champion Rosefline Chepngetich taking the last podium slot in 9:46.14. In what was a clear show of might, Chepkoech stepped into the lead in the third lap and kept her slot until the finishing line. “I thank God for such an opportunity, ending the season on a high and hoping to resume in good shape. Winning at home was good. With this, I will walk shoulder high,” said Chepkoech. Willaim Mbevi of Kenya Defence Forces led fellow soldiers Nicholas Chricchir and Edward Ngujiri to a podium sweep in the 400m hurdles race. Mbevi won in 51.21 with Chirchir and Ngunjiri clocking 51.48 and 51.91 for second and third places respectively.
