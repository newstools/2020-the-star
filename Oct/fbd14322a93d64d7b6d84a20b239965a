Police in Lamu have been urged to arrest a Kenya Wildlife Service officer who allegedly defiled a 14-year-old girl last week. The two are said to have spent three days inside a forest in the county. The officer turned up with the girl at Kiunga police station upon finding out that her family was looking for her. He told police that he found her lost in the forest and decided to take her home. But after the girl was questioned, she said the officer defiled her for the entire three days they were together in the forest. Activists and family members are calling for the arrest and prosecution of the officer. Kiunga community activist Fatuma Nurie said the girl had undertaken several medical tests which proved she was repeatedly defiled. Haki Africa Gender Rights officer Zeinab Ahmed demanded immediate arrest and prosecution of the officer. “We have spoken to the family and all they want is justice. We are also wondering why the officer hasn’t been arrest until now,” she said. Lamu county police commander Moses Murithi said the officer will be arrested once investigations are concluded. “We can't arrest someone unless we have evidence of the alleged crime. We have received the complaint and will arrest him once investigations are over,” Murithi said.
