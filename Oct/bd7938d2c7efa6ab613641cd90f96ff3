A water and sanitation project is relieving residents of Riba, Wajir East, of their water supply problems. Residents have been relying on trucks from the county government or shallow wells to get water. But yesterday, area MP Rashid Kassim, together with officials from the Water Sector Trust Fund, commissioned the Riba Water and Sanitation project. Speaking during the ceremony, the MP termed the development a milestone achievement. “This was one of my campaign pledges and which I have lived to fulfil,” he said. The CEO of the water trust fund, Ismail Fahmy, said water is not only a basic need but a fundamental right that is supposed to be provided in the right quality, quantity and place. Community elder Issack Ali said the project comes as a great reprieve to the people of Riba and its environs at large. “Lack of water has led to the death of many animals, making the cycle of poverty worse. But with this project, we have a reason to smile,” he said. The project activities include fabrication and installation of a steel tank, installation of a pipeline extension and construction of a closed water kiosk. Others are construction of cattle troughs, rehabilitation of a steel tank at Riba Water Supply and installation of a fence at borehole one and two. There will also be an installation of a solar pumping system at borehole one and two and installation of 100 prepaid meters (household) and chambers.
