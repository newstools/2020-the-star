Vihiga Governor Wilber Ottichilo has promised residents he will outperform his Kakamega counterpart Wycliffe Oparanya if he secures a second term in office. Oparanya is serving his second term in office and has been praised by leaders from Western for exemplary management of his county and a strong development record. Ottichilo termed it unfair to compare what his Kakamega counterpart has achieved in eight years to what he has done in three. “Yes, Oparanya has done a good job for Kakamega people. Give me a second term in office and you will see what I will achieve for this county,” Ottichilo said. He said development comes gradually and he has tried to serve residents to the best of his ability in the last three years he has been in office. The governor spoke in Luanda subcounty where he inspected works on a modern slaughterhouse at Mukhalakhala in Mwibona ward. “In this slaughterhouse, we are no longer going to use old methods to slaughter our animals,” he said. He said his administration will acquire a gun licence for killing animals. “We shall have a safe place to keep it to avoid unfortunate scenarios,” Ottichilo said. The governor said the waste management team will be deployed to compact the waste and control the bad smell in the area. Ottichilo said they will boost security in the area to allow animals to be slaughtered the following day spend the night there. “We are also going to use our local people to work here so that they can help us to monitor this place as well,” Ottichilo said. He said the administration has given the Nang’oli water project contractor a last chance to complete it. The project is long overdue. The governor said once completed, the project will supply water to the slaughterhouse at Mukhalakhala.
