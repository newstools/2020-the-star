Vihiga Senator George Khaniri has asked residents to hold Governor Wilber Ottichilo accountable for all the funds he receives from the Treasury. Khaniri said the county has been receiving billions of shillings but the money has yet to trickle down to residents. The senator said the county also received billions in former Governor Moses Akaranga's term but there were no major projects completed. “In the current administration, the same thing is happening.  I've yet to see what the county is doing with the billions they are receiving from the Treasury in terms of development,” Khaniri said. “What I have seen here are only projects funded by the World Bank and other agencies.” Projects that have been undertaken in Vihiga include the Sh1.7 billion water project funded by the Belgian government. Another is the Sh211 million Mbale municipal beautification project. Modern markets in Emuhaya and Hamisi subcounties will also be constructed for Sh160 million. “If you visit other counties, you see the projects they have done to stimulate their economy while in Vihiga, our aim remains to be scams,” he said. He said the county will receive an additional Sh416 million in the new County Revenue Allocation formula. “The governor must come clean and tell us what else has he done with the funds from Treasury apart from paying salaries,” he said in Sabatia on Saturday during the funeral of his uncle.
