DCI Detectives based at Kajiado West Sub-County have arrested three suspects in connection to a recent violent robbery incident. Boniface Lesagi, Joseph Ole Ntito and Lekina Monoi are currently lawful custody after they were nabbed by DCI sleuths investigating the claims of robbery in the area. Via Twitter on Wednesday, the directorate said all the three suspects have been identified as foreigners from a neighboring country. They are accused of shooting at a lorry enroute Shompole Market with passengers on board, forcing the driver to stop. "Seven individuals lost thousands of shillings and their mobile phones, some of which were recovered from a motor vehicle (Reg No. KBA 626Q) which the robbery suspects were traveling in," the DCI said. A loaded AK47 rifle was recovered from the suspects during the arrest. This comes amid rising violent crime cases in different parts of the country. Barely six days ago, a 34-year-old man was arrested in connection with an armed robbery incident that occurred at Lavington West Estate Phase II which left a civilian with gunshot wounds. The suspect alleged to be armed with pistols in the company of his colleagues accosted the victim as she parked her car at her residence. Acting on forensic leads, detectives ambushed the suspect at his hideout early in the morning, recovering a number of mobile phones. The suspects smashed the victim’s car windows with a huge stone after she refused to unlock the doors.
