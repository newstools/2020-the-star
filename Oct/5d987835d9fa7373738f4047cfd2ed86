Siaya Senator James Orengo has asked Deputy President William Ruto to table any differences he has with Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiangi before President Uhuru Kenyatta. Orengo, a key ally of ODM leader Raila Odinga, said Ruto should table any such differences before the cabinet. Orengo said he was aware that Ruto came under fire during a cabinet meeting on Thursday. There have been claims that the meeting was stormy as the cabinet discussed resolutions on tough security measures to contain growing political animosity in the country. “I want to tell Ruto that if you have any problems with Matiangi, table it in the cabinet. During the cabinet meeting, [on Thursday] people started asking questions and Ruto could not answer,” Orengo said. Orengo also reminded Kenyans of the controversial Security Amendments Bill that was bulldozed in Parliament by Jubilee. Orengo said the law which Ruto and his allies supported has come back to haunt him. “If he sees teargas he should know that that was the law he passed,” Orengo said. The Nasa Coalition strongly opposed the laws and even moved to court to have it struck out. Only sections of the bill were declared unconstitutional. Ruto’s supporters were teargassed in Kisii on Thursday and his rally dispersed by security officers. Orengo was speaking in Kisii during the burial of the father of former TV Journalist Denis Onsarigo. Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya said Ruto should stop early campaigns and give both the county and national government time to deliver.
