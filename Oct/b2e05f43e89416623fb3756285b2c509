ODM leader Raila Odinga has hit out at Deputy President William Ruto for opposing BBI, yet "he is campaigning two years before the election." "Hold your horses and wait for the report and see whether it is a priority... the prophets of doom say it's not a priority but they run around campaigning for 2022. Is that a priority?" he said. Raila said Ruto has been in government for eight years and campaigned on the promise of job creation, but has resorted to "giving out wheelbarrows". Without directly mentioning Ruto, Raila said the DP has undermined service delivery. He spoke during an interview with KTN aired on Thursday night. "I'm not part of the Jubilee government. I don't know what you mean by being sidelined. He is supposed to be part of the government... If I felt sidelined, I would take a walk... I would resign saying I can't take a salary and I'm not doing anything," Raila said. "If someone chooses to sideline himself, he should not blame others for that." Raila said his focus is on BBI, not the 2022 election. "We want to fix what went wrong in 2017, not look at 2022," he said. The ODM leader said he would accept if Kenyans reject the BBI, but described as 'anarchists' those opposed to the initiative. "The document is not for Uhuru Kenyata or Raila Odinga. Let it be released and the people decide... If people reject it, it's their democratic right.. you cannot force it on anybody... we will have no problem with that."
