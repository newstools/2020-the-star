Deputy President Wiliam Ruto is expected to preside over two fundraising functions in Kisii and Nyamira counties on Thursday. On Wednesday, the DP met East African Court of Justice Judge Charles Nyachae at his Karen office, Nairobi. The two discussed matters of national interest as well as regional integration, linkages, and how Kenya can make optimum gains from the five-member trade bloc through improved market efficiency. Nyachae was the Chairman of the Constitution of Kenya Implementation Commission (CIC) from 2011 to 2016. As Ruto continues to sell his ‘Hustler Nation’ brand in Kisii, Nyachae is expected to join the caravan. The police granted Ruto permission to go ahead with his public meetings in Nyamira county on Thursday after his hosts applied for permission. Ruto will hold a funds drive for Nyamira South Sub County Boda Boda Sacco at Sironga playground and later, a funds drive at Miriri in Kitutu Masaba constituency for Seventh Day Adventist Churches in Nyamasebe district. The two functions were disrupted last Thursday by heavily armed policemen who said the hosts failed to obtain permission from the local police, which they disputed. On Tuesday, West Mugirango MP Vincent Kemosi and Pastor Richard Nyaribari applied and were granted permission to host the Deputy President, who is returning to the Gusii region. According to a letter by Mohammed Susura, the Nyamira Police Station commander, the MP as the convener must comply with the National Security Advisory Committee directives, obey of the Public Order Act and adhere to Covid-19 health protocols.
