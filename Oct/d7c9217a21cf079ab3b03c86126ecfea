Liban Abdillahi Omar, a Westgate terror suspect who was acquitted, was on Thursday whisked away by gun-totting men in what appeared to be an abduction. The incident happened as Omar left ATPU headquarters on Thursday morning. Nairobi Chief Magistrate Francis Andayi on Wednesday cleared Omar of Westgate terror attack charges while while ruling that Mohammed Ahmed Abdi and Hussein Hassan Mustafa had a case a to answer. But minutes after leaving regional ATPU headquarters in Upper Hill, Omar was abducted by four gunmen, the Star has established. Reports indicate that Omar was in the company of his sisters in a taxi when gun-totting men in a Subaru  ordered them to stop. The driver ordered the taxi driver to stop, pointing a gun at him, a witness said. The gunmen then pulled Omar out of the car, pushed him into their car and sped off. They left with the taxi car keys, leaving the driver and sisters stranded on the road. The incident took place near KCB Towers. Lobby Muslim for Human Rights (Muhuri) pointed a finger at the police. Muhuri chairman Khelef Khalifa condemned the incident, saying “Rearresting a person after the court gives its verdict amounting to disrespect court orders.” “If the police are not satisfied with the ruling they should appeal and follow the laid down processes,” he said. However, Nairobi Central police boss Mark Wanjala said he is not aware of the abduction.
