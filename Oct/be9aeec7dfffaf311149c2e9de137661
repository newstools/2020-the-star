Narc Kenya party leader Martha Karua has criticized alleged plans to release the BBI report on Mashujaa Day. Karua, in a tweet to ODM leader Raila Odinga,  said such a move will plunge the country further into political crisis. Via Twitter on Monday, the party leader said President Uhuru Kenyatta should instead honour the constitution by dissolving parliament and by adherence to it. "Raila Odinga using a National day to release a divisive report like the Breaking Bridges initiative aka BBI is to further escalate an already poisoned environment . Honor the constitution by dissolving parliament and by adherence to the constitution," Karua said. Uhuru is expected to lead Kenyans in marking the country's 57th Mashujaa Day tomorrow at the 25,000-seating capacity Gusii Stadium in Kisii County. There have been speculations that he might use the event to release the BBI report. On October 4, Raila told Kenyans to be ready for BBI, stating it is just a matter of days before the document is made public. Raila drumming support for the document, touted as the solution to country's problems, said together with Uhuru  they will soon receive the document and make it public. "The second report is ready and within few days we will make it public," Raila said.
