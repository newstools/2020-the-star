Genegetone rapper Zzero Sufuri says he does not have a tattoo since he believes it is ungodly. In a conversation with Nonini, Sufuri said he feels if he gets one, he wonâ€™t go to heaven. "I have read the Bible a bit and my background gives me a lot of support," he said. "My father is a pastor. When we were growing up, the teachings were against piercings, polish and tattoos." Zzero also talked about the success of his verse 'Zimenishika', saying it went viral three years later. "That video I was just having fun. It was recorded in 2016 and I had even forgotten all about it before it went viral in 2019," he said. "I later heard that some people were looking for me but I didn't even have a phone." He attributes all his success to God.
