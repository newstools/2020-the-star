Sirisia MP John Waluke on Thursday brought Parliament to a standstill as he reported back to Parliament days after a court released him on bond. The MP who was in custody for almost four months was last week released on a cash bail of Sh10 million pending appeal of his jail sentence in a multi-million shilling corruption case. The entry of the lawmaker interrupted the business of the House as colleagues jubilantly welcomed him. Nominated MP David Sankok was forced to apologise for clapping his hands loudly as he welcomed the lawmaker who was appearing in public for the first time since he was released. “We don’t clap our hands; you know how we do it. Let us have decorum in the House,” said Jessica Mbalu who was chairing the session. “We are colleagues, Speaker you know I don’t have legs so I must use the hands and mouth,” Sankok said. Waluke on his part thanked Kenyans who stood by him during his lowest moment. “I have been away for months and I want to take this opportunity to thank those who stood by me. I want the nation to know that I did not steal anything,” Waluke said. As a director of Erad Supplies and General Contractors, Waluke made a false invoice worth Sh114,600,000 as evidence to support a maize storage claim by Chelsea Freights. He was also charged with fraudulently acquiring Sh297 million from the public as the cost of storing the maize, which was to be supplied to NCPB.
