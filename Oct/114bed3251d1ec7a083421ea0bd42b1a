National Super League side Sony Sugar FC is scouting for a new head coach in readiness for the 2020/21 season. The club has recruited 25 new players who are currently training under goalkeeper coach James Odhiambo. "Our plan is to move back to the premier league. We are negotiating with someone and are sure we will start the season strongly if all goes well," club secretary Boniface Odhiambo said. The 2005/06 premier league champions were relegated from the Kenya Premier League last season after failing to honour three consecutive matches - in contravention of Article 4.1.7 of the laws governing the league. Due to financial constraints experienced by their sponsor — Sony Sugar, the millers did not turn up for their duels against AFC Leopards, Tusker and Zoo Kericho, subsequently sealing their fate. "We have been forced to recruit these new players because we could not hold onto those who played for the club in the top flight," Odhiambo said. Formed in 1982, Sony Sugar clinched the league in 2005/06 with an impressive 20 wins under the tutelage of Francis Baraza. Their stay in the second tier offers a tantalising prospect of mouthwatering derbies against local rivals Shabana FC from Kisii and Migori Youth FC.
