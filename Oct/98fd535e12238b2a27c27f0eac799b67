Construction has started on the first phase of the Sh35 million Kenya Medical Training College In Othaya, Nyeri county. It will enrol about 1,000 students in nursing, clinical medicine, orthopaedics and pharmacy courses. Other courses will be added later The foundation stone was laid at Kiri-ini area in Othaya town by Health CAS Mercy Mwangangi on Friday. Phase one will be a tuition block with six classrooms costing Sh24 million. An Sh11 million administration block also will be built. Mwangangi said money will be committed yearly to expand the institution. It is being built through cooperation between the national government and the Othaya NG-CDF. Chairman of the KMTC board Phillip Kaloki said the campus will be constructed in seven months and students will be admitted immediately. Some students are housed at Decece where only health records courses have been offered since 2016. Kaloki said health funds have been received for the administration block and the tender will be advertised. "We are ready to move and in about two weeks we will be coming back to launch it," he said. Othaya MP Gichuki Mugambi said the institution will greatly improve the local economy and called on residents and investors to set up hostels for the students. The MP said the area received a license for the college in President Mwai Kibaki's time but was unable to set up the training college. â€œWe had no Level 6 hospital where students can do their practicals, so we started with a health records course only. We had no classrooms and students had to occupy Decece buildings," he said. Kenyatta National Hospital's Othaya annex will help in offering practical courses. The MP said the Othaya NG-CDF has already bought a Sh7 million college bus. KMT has promised to provide another bus and pick-up truck to be used as an official vehicle by the principal. (Edited by V.
