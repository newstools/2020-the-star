Besiktas JK forward Esther Mbeyu Akida has joined the rest of the country in mourning the late former Harambee Starlets goalkeeper Rosemary ‘Mara’ Aluoch. The 2019 Cecafa Senior Women Challenge Cup winner in Tanzania, described Rosemary as a big sister who  always put her life on the line in the battlefield to defend the team in excruciating duels. “You mean Mara is gone just like that? One dedicated person who would give her all for the team. Really enjoyed our wins more so after the AWCON qualification. Consoled us after losses and was an approachable human being. Above all, she wanted the best for everyone,” said Akida. Former Starlets’ captain and Under-20 women’s coach Anne Aluoch remembered the deceased as an affable individual who was passionate about what she set out to do. “She was very industrious and passionate in her job,” said Aluoch. Aluoch  (Anne), who was recently elected as Nairobi Women Representative in the just concluded Football Kenya Federation county polls, played alongside Rosemary. Rosemary, 44, lost the battle on Sunday at St. Francis Hospital in Kasarani, Nairobi where she had been admitted shortly after falling ill. Until her death, she had been assigned roles as Starlets goalkeeper trainer and kit manager.
