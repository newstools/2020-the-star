The High Court has ordered Education CS Gerorge Magoha to convene a meeting with TSC and other stakeholders on the issue of reopening schools. This follows a case in which a parent by the name Joseph Aura moved to court on claims that the indefinite closure of schools was affecting children, yet the government had failed to put in place measures to address the issue, since the institutions were closed in March. Justice James Makau on Wednesday said the first meeting shall be held on Thursday at Jogoo House where parties are expected to reach a settlement on conditions set for reopening schools. Once a settlement has been reached, parties will have to report to court on Wednesday next week. "The CS Education or his representative to invite the parties in the petition and stakeholders within the shortest time possible to constitute or reach settlement on the issues of reopening the school, on what conditions and when and report to this court on or by October 14, 2020,‚Äù Makau said. This ruling comes as Magoha on Tuesday instructed Grade Four, Standard Eight and Form Four learners to report for their second term next Monday. Aura, a father of three, had moved to court, saying in-person learning is the best when it comes to the education of children rather than virtual or any other method.
