More than 90 per cent of police officers do not like their new uniforms, the Parliamentary Committee on Administration and National Security has revealed. The team, which is on a countrywide fact-finding mission on issues that affect service delivery, said officers prefer the old uniforms. Committee chairman Paul Koinange said on Thursday some officers lamented that they are mistaken for Kenya Power staffers. "We have to find a middle ground, so we don't seem to be pushing them to put on the new uniform," he said after visitingÂ Malindi police station The chairman, who is also Kiambaa MP, said apart from uniforms, there are other major concerns that need to be addressed, including the officers' welfare, infrastructure and promotions. Koinange said most of the officers have complained of poor working conditions, which makes it hard for one to execute his or her duties effectively. He further said there is a need to address psychological welfare among police officers to bring an end to security personnel shooting themselves, their colleagues or family members. Koinange said psychological centres must be established within police stations to offer counselling to officers on stress management. Other than the officers' welfare, the legislator said police stations need to be upgraded and officers given tools to enable them to effectively undertake their work. They include vehicles and communication equipment. In Malindi, he said, police have no communication equipment. Teso North MP Oku Kaunya, a committee member, said their tour also seeks to get more information on how police work with the community. "It's one of the things that we are going round to establish how community policing is working and how Nyumba Kumi officials are working. We want all of this to be harmonised in law," he said. At the end of their inspection tour, the team will come up with a report and give recommendations to Parliament on the way forward.
