Normally, when roads are under construction, contractors provide diversions that allow traffic to flow, even as works progress. Unfortunately, however, pedestrians, arguably who are the majority, are left out. Footpaths are dug out and no alternatives are provided. Worse, some of the trenches and ditches that are dug are left open, posing great danger to pedestrians and even road users. You would expect the Chinese to be more organiSed and profession in doing their construction. Unfortunately, they have also followed this template as they build the Expressway. Pedestrians are finding it extremely difficult to use Waiyaki Way. The responsible contractor should ensure pedestrians have safe walking paths even as the contraction works continue.
