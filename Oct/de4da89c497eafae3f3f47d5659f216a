ODM party leader Raila Odinga joined Gor Mahia for the viral 'Jerusalema' dance challenge on Wednesday. "Nani kama Baba...At the Gor Mahia event this afternoon I let loose and shook a leg with the team," Raila tweeted. The dance, inspired by Master KG's hit track 'Jerusalema' featuring Nomcebo Zikode, has been trending for months. This was after the team sealed a deal with the Two Rivers Development Limited management which will see Gor Mahia using the mall’s Sports District as their training grounds this season. Raila was joined by the owner of the mall  Chris Kirubi. Raila used the opportunity to urge more corporate entities to support local sports teams, especially community clubs. This comes hours after National Assembly Majority and Minority leaders Amos Kimunya and John Mbadi led the House in the dance. The MPs made a two-line queue along the corridors of the National Assembly as they cheered and made their own 'choreographed' dance moves. The official music video has garnered 180 million views since it premiered on YouTube in December 2019.
