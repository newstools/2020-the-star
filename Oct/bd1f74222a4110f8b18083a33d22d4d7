@alalmaurice  Religious leaders from Nyanza have rallied behind the Building Bridges Initiative report and urged Kenyans to read and support it. Nyanza Council of Church Leaders said the BBI targets will unite the country and ensure inclusivity in governance. Led by Apostle Washington Ogonyo, they lauded President Uhuru Kenyatta and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga for working together to unite the country. “The handshake between the two leaders has ensured peace in the country. It has created a conducive environment for Kenyans to do businesses without fear,” Ogonyo said. He said the handshake led to the birth of BBI that is aimed at ending perennial chaos, negative ethnicity and bloodshed often witnesses after every election. “This indeed was a great gift to our nation and as church leaders, we want to register our commitment to this course of changing the way we govern ourselves and relate with each other,” Ogonyo said during a press conference in Kisumu. The clerics assured Uhuru and Raila that they will rally massive support for the BBI in the region. “We are praying for you that the dream of a peaceful and a united Kenya be fully realised on the platform of the BBI,” Ogonyo said. They urged Kenyans to stand behind the two leaders in their quest to unite the country. The church leaders distanced themselves from a group of the clergy from Nyanza that recently paid a visit to Deputy President William Ruto at his home in Sugoi. “We are not part of that group because as is in the public domain, the reckless statements by the said church leaders are very divisive and very dangerous,” Ogonyo said. He added, “ The statement of those clergymen seems to introduce a new phenomenon in political contestation by advising their host, Ruto, to inflict pain and cause slow death on his political opponents.”  Edited by P.O
