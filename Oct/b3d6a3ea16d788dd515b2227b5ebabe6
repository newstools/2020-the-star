Victor Mbuvi has launched a gospel record label called Panache Plume Interactive, with signees including Nicole Bett, a young, inspirational 15-year-old girl. Speaking to Word Is, the 'Kwata Kawaya' singer said he wants to address criticism there is no good gospel content by producing quality gospel music. "We have signed several artistes and are looking forward to signing many more as we stretch out gospel tentacles," he said. He started the record label on his 20th anniversary in the gospel industry. "I felt like I need to leave a legacy of other gospel artistes and widen the scope of God's ministry with the ability, experience and wisdom God has granted me over the year," he said. "At the same time, offering great quality music. I believe success is inspiring others to excel also in their talents."
