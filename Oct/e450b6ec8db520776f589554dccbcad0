Nairobi Governor Mike Mbuvi Sonko’s daughter Saumu Mbuvi has told her two daughters there’s more they can get in life than attention from men. In an Instagram post, Saumu promised to always love the daughters, reminding them they were born queens and there is nothing they cannot achieve in this life. She added she will teach them the things she learnt when she was older and that she will not put her mistakes on them. The mother of two then prayed for God’s protection and guidance on her two daughters as they grow old. "To my dear beautiful daughters. Always keep in mind there is more to life than just male attention," she wrote. "I will always be here for you mostly to teach you the things I learnt late. I will never write my mistakes on you but I will always want you to know that mummy’s love will always be here to guide you, but for now you are mummy’s queen-lets."
