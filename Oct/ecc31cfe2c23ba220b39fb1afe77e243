The electoral commission's chairman, Wafula Chebukati, has hit out at ODM leader Raila Odinga and other BBI proponents, accusing them of singling out the IEBC as the boogeyman. In a statement on Friday, Chebukati said, "The IEBC makes reference to the contents of the Report of the Steering Committee on the implementation of the BBI and notes that it has been singled out as the only Independent Commission and indeed entity whose establishment is sought to be removed by way of the proposed changes in the Report." He continued, "This targeted onslaught against the Commission is not new as it has been occurring afterevery general election since 1992." Raila has on several occasions called for the overhaul of the IEBC to prevent rigging. President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga are banking on a raft of changes to end vote-rigging. Rigging is one of the root causes of post-election violence in every election cycle. The Building Bridges Initiative spearheaded by the two leaders seeks to remove the provision for an IEBC vice-chairperson to act when the chairman is away. The proposed amendment to various election laws wants members of the electoral commission equally barred from executing the chairperson’s duties. The existing law provides that whenever a vacancy occurs in the office of the chairperson, the vice-chairperson shall act as the chairperson. Such appointees exercise powers and responsibilities of the chairperson until the position is filled substantively. The BBI task force also recommends the recruitment of new commissioners ahead of the 2022 General Election, saying the move will strengthen faith in IEBC. The committee suggested that there should be clear and proper induction of the new commissioners' responsibilities and management of elections in general. "They are to be given a thorough grounding in matters of corporate governance as it relates to IEBC and the relationship between the commissioners and the secretariat in particular."
