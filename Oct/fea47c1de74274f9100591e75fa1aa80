Biogas International will manage solid waste in Kisumu following a deal with the county government. The memorandum of understanding signed by the two parties says waste will be separated at source for recycling and production of fertiliser and biogas. Non-organic waste will be crushed and used to make interlocking bricks. The MoU was signed by Biogas International chief executive Dominic Kahumbu and county Environment executive Salmon Orimba. Governor Anyang' Nyong'o was present. Kahumbu said the environment-friendly technology will be piloted in Ahero town. Waste at Ahero market has been a challenge to manage. The company plans to produce biogas from 80 per cent of the waste. Kahumbu said they intend to roll out biogas production across the county. The gas will be supplied for use in cooking and drying of fish and vegetables to discourage the use of charcoal and firewood. Besides conserving the environment, the CEO said jobs will be created for the youth through brick production and transportation of waste to strategic collection points. "We must change the narrative and look at garbage as a resource. Apart from biogas, we are going to produce fertiliser from our biodigesters and bricks from non-organic waste,” he said. "The company has also developed an incinerator, which will be used to burn nonbiodegradable matter like pampers to ensure all the waste from the market and the town is managed.” A similar project is being implemented at Dunga Beach. It involves the harvesting of water hyacinth from Lake Victoria for the production of biogas. The gas is supplied for fish drying and frying. Kahumbu urged residents to establish kitchen gardens to grow vegetables and fruits using fertiliser from biodigesters. Orimba said the county is grappling with the management of more than 200 tonnes of waste daily and the partnership came at the appropriate time.
