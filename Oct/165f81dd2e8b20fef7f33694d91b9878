Still at Ponda Mali Bar, Inspector Tembo and I are enjoying the chance to finally have a cold one after the president lifted the national moratorium on alcohol. Previously very chatty, my boss suddenly gets eerily quiet. “What’s the matter, boss?” I ask. He looks up at me. His eyes misted over. “I think you’ve had enough.” I get to my feet, ready to escort him back home. “Get away from me!” He brushes me off. “No amount of alcohol has ever defeated Cornelius Tembo.” “Sir, I strongly advise that we…” “Did you know I was married once before I met The Dragon?” “I thought your wife was Pum’kin now, not The Dragon.” “Even Medusa was once a lovely woman.” He snorts. “My first wife was a real medusa. She was so stone-faced, I thought I’d turn into stone if I stared at her long enough.” “You’ve had bad luck with women, Inspector, haven’t you?” “Better bad luck than none. Like you’ve had.” “I’ve had my share of women, sir,” I protest. “Yeah, right. Relatives don’t count.” He laughs aloud at his own joke. “Anyway, her name was Brooklyn. We had two beautiful boys.” I almost choke on my beer. “So, you have kids out there?” “Do you have kids, Makini?” “The closest I’ve come is Millicent’s new kid. And you know how that is.” Millicent is a roommate I took in after her father kicked her out. We don’t get along too well. “Brooklyn took mine away, Serge,” Tembo says. “Forty years of police experience, and I can’t find them.” “I’m sorry to hear that, sir.” “I think that’s why I’ve been so hard on Pum’kin. But now I have a way to make it up to her.” He stands up on wobbly legs. “Come. I want to show you something.” We settle our bill and head back to the police post. My boss leads me to the back where lo and behold stands a used baby crib. “Oh, boss!” I say. Excited. “This is so nice of you.” “Yeah? You think she’ll like it?” “She’ll love it, sir. It’s absolutely beautiful.” “I couldn’t find a new one. I got this from one of the villagers.” “Doesn’t matter, sir. Millicent will love it.” “Millicent?” Inspector Tembo almost falls off his feet. “I didn’t get it for Millicent, I got it for my wife!” I’m lost for words temporarily. “Well?” the Inspector prompts. “What do you think?” “Have you talked to Millicent yet?” I say when I find my voice. “What’s there to talk about? She already said she didn’t want the baby, remember?” “Inspector, I think you’d better come with me.” I literally drag my boss to my place. Mrs. Tembo is there, taking care of Millicent. Tembo gets out of my grip. Uses his hands to brush his clothes. “How do I look?” he asks. “Do I look like a new father?” Not knowing what to say, I go to the door but before I knock, it opens. Mrs. Tembo steps out. “Shhh! For policemen, you two make an awful lot of noise.” She sniffs the air. “Is that alcohol I smell?” “I bought you a crib,” says Tembo. “For our baby.” “Are you crazy? I’m not pregnant.” “It’s Millicent. She promised.” “Makini.” Mrs. Tembo turns to me. “Go in and see to her. My husband and I need to have a talk.” They walk off and I get into the house. “Shhh!” Millicent says. “Hannah is sleeping.” My heart almost stops. “You named her Hannah? But that’s my mother’s name.” “I know.”
