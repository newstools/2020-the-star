Vanessa Mdee’s baby sister Mimi Mars has denied dating Diamond Platnumz after seemingly inviting his attentions. Diamond confessed his love for her in an Instagram message that read, "I love this babe, I don’t know where I went wrong with the timing, Doh." Mars replied to Diamond, asking him not to be afraid to love. "Where there is love, there in no fear. Real love chases away fear. So if someone is afraid, they are not fully in love." But in a recent interview, Mars shut down the rumours, saying she is already dating but not Diamond Platnumz. "Those with eyes have seen and those with ears have heard. Those people who know me, understand what is happening. Me being with Diamond is something that cannot happen," she said. Mars once said she is tired of dating Tanzanian men.
