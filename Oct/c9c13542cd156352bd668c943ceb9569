H_art The Band is back with a new banger titled 'Watabonga', featuring BET nominee Khaligraph Jones. The group describes this new project a proclamation of love to your partner amid all the noise, drama, rumours and/or hurdles. A re-affirmation that you will always choose them no matter the circumstance. The song was written by Bensoul and Mordecai two years ago. Shortly a year after the release of their debut album 'Made In The Streets', they released the Hit 'El-Shaddai' as the lead single off the album, which has garnered millions of views. Band member Wachira 'Skoko' Gatama said, "To have a dream is just the beginning. "Starting out, we used to walk miles almost every day to make ends meet and today, we hired a chopper for a full day just to shoot a video. Mind you, we didn't even board it."
