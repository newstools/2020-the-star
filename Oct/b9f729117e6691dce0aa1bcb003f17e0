President Uhuru Kenyatta on Saturday launched the biometric registration of the Universal Healthcare Coverage Programme in Mombasa. Health CS Mutahi Kagwe said the digitisation of the health sector will ensure the authentication of patient identification prior to treatment therefore drastically reducing fraud in health insurance. Speaking during the official launch, Kagwe said the biometric registration will go hand in hand in reducing the cost of maintenance and in turn reduce the cost of treatment in the country. "We have a new baby in town with teething problems. We expect challenges, but we will be addressing the challenges as they come," Kagwe said. According to Kagwe, this system will enable patients in remote areas to access treatment from doctors across the country. "As we advance to the digitisation of our health sector, it will also prove valuable in cases where we have patients in remote regions requiring treatment, They can simply upload their latest record instantly enabling doctors elsewhere to examine them at their location," Kagwe said. According to the CS, with improved efficiency,Â  the cost of savings can be channelled to Kenyans with no medical insurance or those who are underinsured. During the launch, President Uhuru Kenyatta urged all Kenyans to register for NHIF and ensure that they remain up to date with their subscriptions. "This will ensure that the fund has the necessary financial depth to required to deliver on its mandate," Uhuru said. The president cautioned on the misappropriation of the UHC funds warning that culprits will be dealt with accordingly.
