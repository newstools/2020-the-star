Traders operating along the busy Nairobi-Nakuru highway should obey a notice by the Kenya National Highway Authority and relocate, a Kiambu MCA has said. Lari Kirenga MCA Joseph Karichu asked fruits and vegetable sellers and poultry traders to look for alternative places for their businesses. Kenha has asked roadside traders and those on road reserves to move to allow the expansion of the highway from Kamandura up to Mau Summit in Molo. The expansion of the highway started from Westlands in Nairobi up to Kamandura. Kenha says it plans to extend from there any time. Karichu thanked President Uhuru Kenyatta for expanding the major highway as it will cater the country's growth. The MCA also revealed that he was pushing for the fast-tracking of construction of a modern market at Nyambare trading centre. He said the market will be built in three phases. Phase one will cost Sh11 million. "The construction of the market is being funded by the national government. We do not want our people to be stranded," he said. "We are planning to relocate the traders operating a market next to the highway to the new place. This is because they will be affected by the national highway expansion." Hannah Wanjiru, a trader, said they do not object to the plans as they want to operate in a modern facility. "We do not want to be left behind by other areas," she said.
