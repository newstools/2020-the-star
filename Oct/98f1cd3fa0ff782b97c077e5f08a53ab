ODM leader Raila Odinga has warned the youth against "blindly" joining DP William Ruto’s 'hustler' wave. Raila, who was giving a keynote address at the ODM Women's League Delegates meeting at Kitengela, likened DP Ruto to a wolf hiding in sheep’s skin.“We know who the liberators of this country are. For Ruto to claim he will liberate the youth from poverty by giving them wheelbarrows without showing them the work they will do is quite misleading,” he said. The opposition leader claimed Ruto is a product of YK92. “He is a hypocrite out to hoodwink the youth into following him blindly. About 75 per cent of Kenyans are youth under 35 years of age, and these are the people the hustler nation is targeting. It will be disastrous for them to join his bandwagon,” claimed Raila. Raila said meaningful changes that will benefit Kenyans are in the Building Bridges Initiative that he formed with President Uhuru Kenyatta.“This is where the real change to better Kenya and its political space, economy, and shared leadership is. The economy of this country is dwindling because the cooks are few and those eating the cake are many,” he said. “Those opposing the BBI will be forced to swallow their pride because the document has the support of the majority of Kenyans. We know those opposing it, and yet calling themselves liberators. Liberators of what?” asked Raila. The main agenda in the Kitengela meeting was women empowerment. The opposition leader thanked Kenyan women for standing with their families during this coronavirus pandemic by providing them with food. He said it is time Kenyan rejects some other traditions and practices that discriminate bases on gender lines. Raila said women have an equal role with men in Kenyan politics and in building the country’s economy.“This is the reason ODM is supporting the two-thirds gender rule wholesomely,” added Raila.
