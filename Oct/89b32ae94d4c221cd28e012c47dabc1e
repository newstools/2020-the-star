Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero has been ruled out of Tuesday’s Champions League trip to Olympique Marseille through a hamstring injury and could be out of action for two to four weeks, manager Pep Guardiola has said. Aguero was withdrawn at halftime in Saturday’s 1-1 Premier League draw at West Ham United with Guardiola confirming the 32-year-old suffered a muscular problem, only a week after making his first start of the season following knee surgery. “It depends on the injury. We expect 10-15 days for sure minimum, or it could be three weeks or a month,” Guardiola told reporters. “When you are out for four or five months with a knee problem, you always have a risk when you come back. “We tried to handle it the best as possible, (playing him)50-55 minutes in the games, but it was not enough to maintain it and get him through the games. Meanwhile, West Bromwich Albion manager Slaven Bilic said he did not want Egyptian defender Ahmed Hegazi to leave the club and was shocked when he made the switch to Al Ittihad. West Brom said on Monday the 29-year-old centre back had moved to the Saudi Professional League side on loan and would sign permanently at the end of the season. Bilic said Hegazi had been part of his plans for Monday’s Premier League game against Brighton & Hove Albion, which ended 1-1, and that they could not afford to lose their top players. “He is the player that has know-how in the Premier League, that has vast experience, a national team player, a great professional and played last week against Burnley,” Bilic told a news conference. “I wanted him to stay. He wanted to stay this week. It was a shock that he left. Obviously the club wanted to sell him.” Hegazi played 104 games for West Brom and started 14 matches last season as they won promotion from the Championship. West Brom are 17th on three points from their first six matches.
