Singer Nadia Mukami has released her much-anticipated EP 'African Popstar'. This project encourages embracing pop culture no matter where you are without limit. Announcing the news, Nadia wrote on Instagram, "#AfricanPopStarEP the previous post is full of bitterness because a woman (a small one for that matter😁) is doing numbers amidst a male-dominated industry. "When a man does it, it's hard work but if it’s a woman, excuses have to be made! "Brace yourselves, with this EP, we are taking the number one spot on streams/ sales! #TeamNadia / #NadiaFC / #kaNadians Let’s show the doubting Thomases how it’s done! Keep streaming my new EP African PopStar the EP." The EP features collabos with Maua Sama, Rosaree, Sanaipei Tande, Joe Mfalme, Fena Gitu and Marioo. She has released some of its songs, including 'Jipe', 'Tesa' and 'Million Dollar'.
