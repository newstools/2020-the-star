Renowned branding coach and corporate trainer Hannah Githuki recently unveiled her new branding book, ‘Flaunt Your Genius’, at the Trademark Hotel in Nairobi. The book is an eight-step practical guide on how to build a personal brand that makes cash. During the launch, Hannah offered rising star Tracy Waithera a three-month brand coaching deal. The upcoming actress and Instagram comedian will get an all-access coaching experience to help her build a money-making brand. “My book is a practical guide and I challenge my readers not just to read passively but to step out and apply it,” Githuki said.
