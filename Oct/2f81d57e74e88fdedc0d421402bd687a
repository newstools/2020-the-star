A labour court has extended orders stopping the Nairobi assembly from hearing impeachment proceedings against Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko. Justice Byrum Ongaya of the Employment and Labour Relations Court said the orders shall remain in force until further directions. He also dismissed an objection by the assembly speaker, who questioned whether the court has the mandate to hear the case. Ongaya said the court’s jurisdiction cannot be forced out from investigating the legality and constitutionality of the process of Sonko's impeachment. “By entertaining the case, this court is not supervising the workings of Parliament or even the county assembly. The court further finds that by entertaining the petition, it is not, thereby, intruding in the political realms of things,” he said. Byrum said it is valid for the court to intervene where it is shown that the impeachment proceedings are in violation of the Constitution. “Disciplinary process is obviously a human resource function being undertaken within the relevant constitutional provisions and the court returns that the dispute is within its jurisdiction to decide disputes about employment and labour relations,” he said. The speaker had asked the court to strike out the case on grounds of jurisdiction. Also claimed Sonko has not established an employer-employee relationship to invoke the jurisdiction of the court. According to the court documents filed in February this year, Sonko accused then  Nairobi assembly speaker Beatrice Elachi of wanting to get rid of him for political expediency and to have his post filled in a manner against the law. “I am entitled to due process of the law. It is the exclusive mandate of the clerk of the assembly to submit the proposed motion to the speaker for approval but the clerk never submitted such a motion,” he said. The case will be mentioned on October 27.
