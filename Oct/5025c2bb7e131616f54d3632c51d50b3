The High Court has freed on bond two police officers accused of murdering two unarmed civilians in Garissa county. Justice James Wakiaga said he had considered submissions by parties involved in the case, including the victims’ families represented by lawyer Bryan Odhiambo. He granted Adan Ibrahahim Salat and Abdirahman Roble Samow bond of Sh1 million each with two sureties of a similar amount. “I give orders that the accused persons deposit in court their passports and not to interfere with witnesses. They should not travel to Garissa county,” Wakiaga said. The Director of Public Prosecutions had opposed the release of the accused on bond. The prosecution argued that they face murder charges which are serious offences whose penalty is death if found guilty. Salat and Samow have denied that on July 25 at Soko Ngombe area in Garissa, they jointly murdered Aden Abdi Madhobe and Mudhidin Aden Mudhow. The prosecution said if the two officers were released, they would interfere with key witnesses in Garissa. But Salat and Samow opposed the prosecution's application, saying they are family men and not a flight risk. The judge directed the case to be mentioned on November 9.  Edited by Henry Makori
