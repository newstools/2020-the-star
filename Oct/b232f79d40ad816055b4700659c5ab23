More Covid-19 tests will equal more cases. That's what Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe said Wednesday when confirmed 321 new cases from 4,342 samples tested. The figure was the highest in recent weeks. On Tuesday, the government had announced it had received 150,000 testing kits to be distributed to the various laboratories across the country. “These new kits will boost our testing capacity as we continue in this fight against the Covid-19 disease,” Health CAS Rashid Aman said. “We also have another 300,000 test kits that are in the pipeline that will hopefully be received before we exhaust the supplies just received.” Recoveries from Covid-19 in the country have hit 30,659 after 4,328 more patients recovered on Wednesday. Some 4,222 patients were from the home-based care programme and the other 106 discharged from various hospitals. The virus caseload in the country is 39,907 from 569,678 tests conducted since March. The youngest patient from Wednesday's test results was a nine-month-old infant and the oldest being 88 years. “From the cases, 309 are Kenyans and 12 are foreigners; 183 are males and 138 females,” the CS said. “Sadly, five patients have succumbed to the disease bringing the fatality to 748. Our condolences to the families and friends of those who have lost their loved ones.” Nairobi recorded the highest cases with 109, followed by Nakuru with 37, Trans Nzoia with 32, Mombasa with 31, Kisumu and Narok with 16 cases each while Kisii had 15. Uasin Gishu recorded 12 cases, Meru nine, Kilifi eight, Kiambu seven, Siaya and Laikipia five cases each, Kajiado four, Kericho three, Machakos and Migori two cases each, while Bomet, Homa Bay, Kitui, Lamu, Marsabit, Nandi, Nyandarua and Tharaka Nithi had one case each. The ministry has been focusing the testing on areas considered high-risk and hotspots. These are counties that have seen an exponential rise in cases such as Nakuru, Mombasa, Trans Nzoia and Nairobi.
