ODM party leader Raila Odinga has said the country should never again witness violence during and after General Elections. President Uhuru Kenyatta, who is commissioning development projects in Kisumu together with Raila, addressed residents at the Jaramogi Odinga Oginga Recreational Center on Thursday. Raila said that the changes in the proposals in the Building Bridges Initiative report will transform the face of the country. “Sisi tumesema vile vile tunataka kuona hakuna mapigano. Kama kuna uchaguzi hakuna mapigano na hakuna teargas (we’ve said that that we would like to see a smooth election without violence nor tear gas to demonstrators), Raila said. He continued that “We’ve said that the death of Baby Pendo would be the last, there would be no similar incidents in the upcoming elections.” Raila said that the opposing teams seeking the top seat will shake their hands after the elections and accept the outcome. Baby Pendo was killed by police on August 11, 2017, during post-election violence after the Supreme Court annulled President Uhuru Kenyatta’s reelection. Uhuru said the country will be more united than ever by the report. He said BBI will help the youth as well as settle gender imbalance during elections. Uhuru said that the proposals in the report  should be implemented together. "It is a package. It must be taken together...a package that is addressing what is ailing the Republic of Kenya in the hope of making our country better...ensuring that our people are able to leave a secure prosperous life," Uhuru said. Earlier on, the president inspected the ongoing construction of the ultra-modern Uhuru Business Park Market Complex in Kisumu county. The Sh600 million multi-purpose facility is being implemented by the national government and will be ready for use by the end of this year.
