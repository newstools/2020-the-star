Iravonga Jiveri, a 41-year-old entrepreneur and her husband are the latest Betika Sh15 million Jackpot winners. Iravonga, who analysed the games with her husband correctly predicted 15 games with a paltry Sh15 stake to take home the midweek jackpot. “My husband works as a brick maker and I sell vegetables in Mgoiywa village. We have six children with the oldest in Form 3 and the youngest in Class 2. My husband has been betting from way back and I am still in awe knowing that our persistence has changed our family’s life with just Sh15" said Iravonga, who lives with her family in their small house in Mgoiywa village. She added: “Neither of us have a smartphone, so we bet through SMS. Life has been very tough for us, six children to feed, school and clothes has always been a challenge but God has answered our prayers,” said Iravonga with a hearty smile. She continued: "My husband loves football and I’m glad that love has finally paid off. We analyse the games thoroughly and place different combinations. This time, we placed 9 combinations and spent Sh135, but one combination gave us all 15 games," she added. Speaking during the handover, Betika’s Business Head, John Mbatiah expressed his delight at Iravonga’s win. ‘It’s evident that a family that hustles together, reaps the benefits together. Persistence and precision is important. Betika will offer the family the option of a partnership with a credible Financial Advisory firm who will offer both financial and legal advice on sensible use of the winnings. We encourage all our customers to engage in responsible gaming as they continue enjoying the sports they love," he said.
