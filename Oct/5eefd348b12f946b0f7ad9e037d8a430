Former Auntie Boss actress Nyce Wanjeri begged her friends for money to feed her daughter during the Covid-19 shutdown. Speaking on her YouTube channel with comedian MCA Tricky, Nyce said she had to beg for Sh200 to feed her nine-year-old daughter when things got tough. "I won’t lie, there was a time we almost went hungry. I would call a friend and ask for Sh200 only," she said. "We don’t talk about such things because sometimes you feel like you are embarrassing yourself for asking for help. But when you have a baby, they have to eat so you have to put your pride aside and ask for help." She says things are looking up since the night curfew was loosened and the country reopened for business. "As per now, we thank God. I have food in the house and when I have enough for us I give to other people who are struggling," she said. MCA Tricky said the pandemic was a blessing in disguise as he landed a new radio job. "And I have used my show Step By Step as a channel of charity during this time," he said. Nyce and her baby daddy, Tito Wagithomo, separated in 2018.
