A woman who sold alcohol in the wee hours of the night against Covid-19 measures has been jailed for seven months. Elizabeth Kamiti admitted selling alcohol in a bar in Manyatta town in Embu North subcounty on October 10 at around 2am, saying the coronavirus containment measures hit her hard when the government closed bars. She told principal magistrate Henry Nyakweba that her finances had deteriorated. She needed to do extra business to get money to feed her children. Kamiti said she was remorseful and would not repeat the crime. She begged for pardon, saying if she was jailed her children would suffer. Nyakweba told her that he had considered her plea for pardon but that she had committed the crime of selling alcohol past the legal hour deliberately and another of selling alcohol without a medical certificate. The judge ordered her to pay a fine of Sh50,000 for the offence of selling alcohol past lawful time or to serve six months in jail and Sh1,000 for selling alcohol without a medical certificate or to serve one month in jail. The convict could not immediately afford the cash and was escorted to the Embu prison to serve the sentence. Edited by Henry Makori
