Ndaragwa MP Jeremiah Kioni has warned leaders seeking to exploit historical issues to divide Mt Kenya saying such moves will be highly resisted. The lawmaker said they will not welcome anyone seeking leadership of the country to create animosity among residents of the region. He said specifically pointed out that they will not allow any presidential hopeful to exploit the historical issues between the community and Luos. “We have our historical differences with the Luos and we can assure you that nobody will exploit them for political gain,” Kioni said. “At the opportune time, we will address those differences with the Luos to get where we went different ways,” the lawmaker told the Star on the phone. He said this will be done in the same way the region intends to mend fences with any other community. “Our main preoccupation is to mend fences with communities, and they are not imaginary fences,” Kioni said. He added that it was unfortunate “there are people who will be happy when they are fighting one another as Mt Kenya.” “We will resist such attempts strongly. Even if we have our own issues, nobody should be seen to fuelling chaos in our region.” His sentiments came in the wake of word that President Uhuru Kenyatta’s allies are banking on ODM leader Raila Odinga candidacy to beat DP William Ruto in 2022. The President's allies believe that once Uhuru declares 'Raila tosha', Ruto will be boxed out of Mt Kenya region. Raila's camp is optimistic that the President will support the ODM leader, though the latter is yet to declare his interest in the 2022 duel.
