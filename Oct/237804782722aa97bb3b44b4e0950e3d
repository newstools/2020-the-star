Kikuyu elders have said there is no political vacuum in Mt Kenya and have warned leaders against engaging in early campaigns. Speaking at a press briefing at Bowling Green restaurant in Nairobi, the national chairman of the Kikuyu Council of Elders Kimani Maigua said those who have been camping in several regions endorsing leaders should stop as they are disturbing the existing peace. He cited the Kenol violence on Sunday where two people died. “The President is the kingpin of Mt Kenya region and when the “Michuki” period comes, the community will pronounce itself accordingly, " he said. The national and county leadership of the council of elders and Kiama Kiama are the twin leadership groups within Mt Kenya region. The council cautioned politicians who have defied Uhuru’s order and are engaged in divisive politics of succession. “We want to warn those politicians who are moving around Mt Kenya region campaigning. Let all sit down and concentrate on service delivery while supporting our leader," Maigua said. The council said the politics of 2022 shouldn’t be used to divide the community, noting they will sit down with Uhuru and chart the best way forward. The council also warned Kenyans against a lobby group registered as a CBO in Embakasi led by Wachira Kiago. They said that Kiago’s team has been promising Kenyans positions and endorsements. Ndungu Gaithuma and Kigochi Waimiri who are the co-founders of Kiama Kiama said the community declared support for Uhuru in 2013 and will do the same for another candidate in 2022. “Uhuru promised to support Ruto in 2022 but we aren’t yet there. He can’t endorse while he is still serving and this is bringing a lot of tension. It should end, for when the right time comes we will make a decision and guide our community," he said.
