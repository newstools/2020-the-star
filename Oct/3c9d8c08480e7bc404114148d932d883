The passing on of former Football Kenya Federation Coast region chairman Mohammed Omar has been received with grief with FKF President Nick Mwendwa among those who have sent messages of condolence to the family of the late administrator. Omar was an influential figure in football at the coast and a strong ally of former FKF supremo Sam Nyamweya. In mourning the former CAF commissionaire who passed on earlier today in Mombasa, Mwendwa said: “Football has indeed lost a dedicated hardworking individual who lived and loved the game. May his family and friends find solace during this trying times.” Nyamweya equally shared his appreciation of the role Omar played in bringing back sanity in the management of football in the country. “Omar diligently served Kenyan soccer as an administrator for over two decades, playing a big role in ensuring that the game grows not only in the coastal region but also at the national level,” said Nyamweya. “He fearlessly fought bad leadership in the sport and was always on the side of the real stakeholders. His tireless efforts to bring sanity to the game was evident when he played a big role pushing for the management of the game to return to the people after some officials had turned the federation into a limited company.” Also condoling Omar’s family was Tom Alila, who served with him in the FKF National Executive in 2011. “Omar loved football and was a vocal crusader for accountability in the management of sport and of nurturing football from the grassroots,” Alila said. Similar message of condolence came from Simon Mugo, former Nairobi FKF Nec member.
