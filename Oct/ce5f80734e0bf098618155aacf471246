Leadership wrangles continued to rock Ford Kenya as a faction led by Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang’ula moved to dispel reports that the party had planned to hold a National Delegates Congress. “The true position is that the party is awaiting to have a National Governing Council which will culminate to an NDC in accordance with the party’s constitution,” a statement released to media houses said. A rival group led by Tongaren MP Eseli Simiyu and Kanduyi MP Wafula Wamunyinyi had on Saturday said in a notice that the party will hold the NDC on November 21 at the Bomas of Kenya's Main Auditorium. But Wetang’ula’s group said there exist conservatory orders barring Eseli from transacting any business for or on behalf of the party. “The Simba Party is intact under party leader Moses Wetang’ula who will give direction going forward,” the statement, signed by Joel Ruhu (national chairperson) and Chris Mandu (national organising secretary), said. “We assure members and supporters of the party across the country to ignore the notice by individuals seeking attention to please their masters who are the core funders of the coup.” The Court of Appeal is yet to determine a case filed by Eseli and Wamunyinyi challenging the June 25 High Court's decision to issue conservatory orders staying the gazette notice effecting leadership changes and restraining them from representing the party. In June, Justice James Makau suspended the implementation of a gazette notice announcing the removal of Wetang'ula from the helm of Ford Kenya party. The Registrar of Political Parties Ann Nderitu had issued a notice announcing the intended removal of Wetang'ula. Wamunyinyi was to replace him. The court directed the registrar not to acknowledge or transact the party's business with Eseli and Wamunyinyi.
