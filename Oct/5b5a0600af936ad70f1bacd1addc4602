President Uhuru Kenyatta on Monday was treated to a unique birthday gift by a crowd of over 6,000 people at the Bomas of Kenya. The president turns 59 today when the country is unveiling the Building Bridges Initiative whose proponents say is aimed at uniting the country. Those at the auditorium stood to their feet during the launch as they sang a happy birthday to the President. “Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to. Happy birthday dear President. Happy birthday to you.…” The congregation sang in unison. The launch of the BBI report is seen as a birthday gift handed over to Uhuru. He was born on October 26, 1961, to Kenya’s founding father Mzee Jomo Kenyatta and Mama Ngina Kenyatta. Uhuru and his counterpart ODM leader Raila Odinga have been championing for the report urging Kenyans to read it before commenting on it. The duo is expected to roll out joint BBI rallies to market the report and lobby for national support in the coming days to counter opponents of the report Deputy President William Ruto through his Twitter account wished the president happy birthday. “Happy birthday to my friend and boss HE. Uhuru Kenyatta. May God almighty grant you good health and long life,” Ruto tweeted. But this is not the first time Uhuru’s birthday is falling on the same day a major event is occurring in the country. Today is also the third anniversary of the presidential repeat election that was conducted on October 26, 2017. Uhuru was made to spend his birthday queuing to vote and monitoring the electoral process after the August elections were declared null and void by the supreme court over illegalities and irregularities.
