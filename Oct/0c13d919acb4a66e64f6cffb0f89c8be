The schools reopened on Monday as learners went back to their learning institutions after a seven-month break. Teachers could be seen distributing masks as the learners arrived. A spot check by the Star revealed that learners were eager to return to school with most of them being happy to see their friends. "I am very happy to come back to school. I arrived here early and found changes in the school. There are water points and we even found teachers waiting for us here," a candidate at a Migori school said. However, in a section of schools, social distancing became a challenge even as parades were held, something that the Education CS George Magoha had warned about. The CS on Monday said no child should be sent home on account of school fees, both in the private and public sector. Magoha spoke on Monday when he coordinated the monitoring reopening of schools in Nairobi County at Olympic Primary School. A  similar exercise is expected to take place in all parts of the country under the supervision of the Ministry of Education and Teachers Service Commission officials as schools reopen after a seven-month break due to the coronavirus. "For boarding schools, may I plead with principals to ensure that no child is sent home on account of school fees," Magoha said. The CS said with the progressive reopening of schools, all protocols of MoH have been put in place. During the 12th address on the Covid-19 in the country at the Kenyatta International Convention Center on Monday, President Uhuru Kenyatta urged a focus on ‘how’ schools would reopen and not ‘when’. He charged CS Education to come with modalities on how the students can be kept safe in schools before announcing the reopening date.
