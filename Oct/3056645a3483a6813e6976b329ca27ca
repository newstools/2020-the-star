Beer lovers who are usually more disorderly once tipsy can now congregate yet the government is still procrastinating on when to open schools. Education Cabinet Secretary George Magoha has not helped the situation as he has been very inconsistent in his pronouncements. The daily Covid-19 data released by the Ministry of Health has shown that the young are not as susceptible to Covid-19 as the elderly and thus coming into contact with each other while at school exposes them to fewer risks than drunkards. In his last address, President Uhuru Kenyatta said the country should not be concerned about the when but on if the facilities are adequate to meet the Covid-19 measures. Covid-19 has been with us since March, when schools were shut. What has the Ministry of Education done in the six plus months that learners have been home? A visit to several learning institutions shows little has been done and even if given till January, this situation is unlikely to change. It is sad that Covid-19 turned some into millionaires, yet it is being used to impoverish children in terms of gaining knowledge. Any extended closure of schools in the name of preparing them for opening will be doing injustice to the millions of children who have patiently waited to resume learning. If drunkards can easily mingle without restrictions, let children go back to school and recoup the lost time. Lack of planning on the government should not be used to deny the young ones their right to education. Quote of the Day: "To really ask is to open the door to the whirlwind.
