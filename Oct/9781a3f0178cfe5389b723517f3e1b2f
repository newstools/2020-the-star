Turkish tycoon Osmal Elsek has been arrested for shooting a teenager. Police reports indicate the businessman initially shot in the air to disperse a group of boys who clashed after a football match on Friday. The reports say that boys from Good News Rehabilitation Center were attending a football match when a group of 10 boys from the village attacked them. “Then came a Turkish national namely Osman Elsek who alighted from his motor vehicle, drew his pistol, fired one shot in the air, another to the ground and finally shot Frank Omwenga a Kisii juvenile aged 15 years on the chest right below the left nipple,” a police report filed at Kijipwa Police Station under OB no 20/23/10/2020 reads in part. After the shooting, Elsek drove off, prompting the boys to carry their colleague to Elsek's gate, the report adds. Cornered, the businessman took the boy to Mombasa Hospital. Police say the boy has been admitted in the ICU, but is in stable condition. Following the shooting, Elsek, 55, surrendered at the police station where he was arrested and his Glock pistol serial no. RBV973 with 15 rounds of 9mm ammunition impounded. His civilian firearm license was also held, according to police. He will be charged. Kilifi North deputy subcounty police commandant confirmed the incident on Saturday, saying the suspect is currently held at Kilifi Police Station. The businessman-cum-philanthropist is not new to controversy. On January 2019, he appeared at Shanzu Law Courts on charges of defiling three girls in his house in Kikambala, Kilifi county.
