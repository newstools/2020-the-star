Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen has accused police boss Hillary Mutyambai of "stoking hatred and tension" through his selective application of the law. The senator was responding to a tweet by Mutyambai who was dismissing claims of bias in enforcing public gathering laws. Mutyambai while acknowledging complaints about the selective application of enforcing the law insisted there is no risk of violence or attack on some groups. "There are groups that have not attracted any form of violence while others have attracted violence, hence the varied authorizations," the IG said. In a quick rejoinder, Murkomen asked the police boss to stop using PR and consider resigning if he cannot handle political fights between his bosses. "So according to you, the risk is the Deputy President? Please don’t do PR here. If you don’t want to serve all fairly or if you are got in between the political fights between your bosses and you can’t handle it resign, "Murkomen responded. "As per the Constitution, the President can’t even direct you." Murkomen who is a close ally to Deputy President William Ruto went ahead to say Mutyambai will be held responsible should violence escalate in the country. "If anything goes wrong in our country especially because you are stoking hatred and tension through selective application of the law you will be held personally liable even if you will have retired. Don’t say you were not warned," he said. This comes as a cross-section of legislators accused the government of applying double standards by disallowing some politicians to hold meetings citing the Covid-19 pandemic and security concerns. Ruto has accused top government officials of instigating chaos that left two people dead during his church function in Kenol, Murang'a county, on a week ago. However, his claims were swiftly dismissed as empty propaganda by Murang'a Woman Representative Sabina Chege.
