KPL giants AFC Leopards' chairman Dan Shikanda is looking forward to next week’s Mashujaa Day Cup encounter against National Super League side Shabana FC at Gusii Stadium. “It’s an exciting fixture against our old rivals Shabana. This game will also form part of our pre-season,” said Shikanda. Shikanda said the team has been preparing for the game which will be played on Tuesday as from 3pm. “We received communication from the national government and asked to prepare for the game. We have stepped up our preparations for the encounter which will see us renew our rivalry with Shabana,” he added. At the same time, AFC Leopards’ coach Antony Kimani has promised that Ingwe will hit the ground running in search of their first league title after the first five fixtures were released on Wednesday morning. The Leopards’ coach is currently sharpening his charges for the upcoming season which kicks off in under a month’s time if government lifts the halt on contact sports following the upsurge in the Covid-19 pandemic. Kimani said on the club website that he is happy with the preparations so far and the input of the new signings makes the prospects even better. “The team is in good spirits and with new players coming in, we believe they have added the much-needed aspects in the team. Definitely what we needed in order to have more stability and depth.” The season kicks off on November 20 with a mouth-watering clash against Western Stima at home. Kimani knows how difficult this could turn out to be if they do not start the season on the right foot. “The goal is to ensure the team picks as many points as possible and this has to start with the opening fixture.” “We respect all opponents but our aim is to win matches and challenge for the title.”
