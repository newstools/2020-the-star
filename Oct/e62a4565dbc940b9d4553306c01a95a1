Former ANC secretary general Barrack Muluka has admitted to joining Deputy President William Ruto's camp. "I have gone to school, taken degrees... including a doctorate... it would be self delusion to say that I will not work for the second highest person in the country. How many people are going to be called for that kind of mission?" he said. Muluka spoke during an interview with Citizen TV on Wednesday night. Former EACC chairperson and prominent lawyer PLO Lumumba, however, took issue with Muluka working for Ruto, comparing him to a 'kinuka mito', likening him to someone who has many partners but is loyal to none. "It was in the public domain that he was in Nasa... it was in the public domain he was with Kalonzo Musyoka... it was in the public domain he was with Raila... it was in the public domain that he was the secretary general of ANC," Lumumba said. In August, Muluka resigned as the secretary general of the Amani National Congress party. In a letter addressed to party leader Musalia Mudavadi, Muluka said ANC needs a fresh start ahead of 2022 polls. "I doubt that i could add more value to what i have done so far. Moreover, it is now fitting that the space around you should be decongested. this will allow you to make critical decisions on the population and leadership of the party under the new constitution," he said. Muluka said his resignation would ease  Mudavadi's making of personal political choices in the lead up to the 2022 elections. "As part of giving you the necessary latitude on the arduous political journey ahead, I have now decided to step aside and move on to other horizons," he said. "This therefore is my formal letter of resignation both as secretary general and a member of ANC."
