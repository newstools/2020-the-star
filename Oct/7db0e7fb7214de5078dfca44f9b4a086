Police have arrested at least 18 suspects among a mob that burnt Mbururu Police patrol base in Kakamega. The mob was retaliating on Thursday for the arrest of a 21-year-old suspect said to have been released. His family said he disappeared. The Directorate of Criminal Investigations said the mob also assaulted the OCS of the Matunda Police station in Likuyani. The suspect, Denis Lusava, alias Makali, was arrested on October 7 for the alleged assault. Detectives said Lusava was released on free bond at 12.40pm, pending filling  out a P3 form. His mother said he never returned home after his release. She insisted on being shown where her son had been taken. The DCI said suspect's mother went to the base on Thursday evening and reported that her son never went home after being released. She was referred to the OCS for assistance. Responding to the complaint, the OCS went to the patrol base where he found about 200 people. The crowd hurled stones, seriously injuring him. He was hospitalised. The crowd then torched the patrol base and damaged a police vehicle. Six officers from his station lost their personal effects and equipment in the attack at 11am. Reinforcements by APS, DCI and GSU from Mt Elgon restored order. The 18 suspects were taken into custody. Western regional police commander Perris Muthoni urged residents to help trace Lusava. "We are appealing to the public to volunteer information on the whereabouts of the suspect who went into hiding after release from police custody," she said. The arrested menwill be arraigned on Monday. (Edited by V. Graham)
