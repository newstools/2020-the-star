Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has ordered an extension by six months of a rent waiver on houses owned by the county government. The governor cited  financial challenges which has been heightened by the unprecedented Covid-19 pandemic. “I do hereby extend the waiver earlier granted for a period of a further six months, as our residents continue to recover economically from effects of Covid-19 pandemic,” Sonko said in a statement via Facebook on Friday. Sonko said his directive follows outcry by tenants citing harassment by officers from the Kenya Revenue Authority and the Nairobi Metropolitan Services over rent arrears. He said the waiver will help tenants recover from the adverse effects of the global health crisis. In April last year, Sonko ordered a waiver on all rent arrears owed to the city government. He said the waiver was aimed at ending cases of tenants being evicted by cartels keen on allocating the houses to new tenants at a fee. He said his administration was keen on empowering the tenants so they can pay future rent on time. “In recognition and honour to our workers, I have issued a waiver of rent arrears owed to the Nairobi City county government by our tenants. I'm appealing to tenants to pay their monthly rents on time without defaulting,” Sonko said. The arrears date back to more than 10 years ago when the houses were managed by the defunct Nairobi City Council.
