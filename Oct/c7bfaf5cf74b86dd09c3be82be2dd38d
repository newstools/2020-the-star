Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi has accused Police IG Hillary Mutyambai of illegally withdrawing his security. The MP who appeared in court on Tuesday pleaded not guilty to two counts of hate speech and one of offensive conduct. Sudi is charged that on September 7 and at an unknown place in Kenya, through social media he committed two crimes of hate speech by uttering words that could stir up violence. He is facing a third count of offensive conduct likely to breach the peace. In an application before Nakuru Senior Resident Magistrate's court, the Kapseret MP wanted Inspector General of Police, Hillary Mutyambai ordered to reinstate his bodyguards. Sudi claimed his life was in danger after his security detail was withdrawn on September 14. His lawyer, Bernard Ng'etich said the withdrawal was unfair and unjustified because the MP is still deemed innocent unless proven guilty. He alternatively asked the court to direct that Mutyambai appears before it to explain why he withdrew his client's security. â€œMy client is in the limelight because of the case he is facing, he has political opponents and people he oversights who could be a threat to his life," said Ng'etich. He added that withdrawal of Sudi's security was prejudging him, uncalled for and unfair. The prosecution led by Assistant Director of Public Prosecution, Daniel Karuri opposed the application and urged Senior Resident Magistrate K. I Orenge to dismiss it "I am unable to respond to the application because the prosecution was not informed about it," said Karuri. He urged the court to desist from handling it because it was a security matter and beyond the Prosecutions jurisdiction. Karuri said Sudi should approach the IG instead of dragging the issue to court. Orenge said he will deliver his ruling on the application on Wednesday at noon. The hate speech and offensive conduct case will be heard on October 30
