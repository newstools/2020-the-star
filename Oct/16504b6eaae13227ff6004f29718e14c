You might soon seeÂ US Ambassador Kyle McCarter in the colourful African print shirts from Rivatex made popular by President Uhuru Kenyatta. McCarter joined Uhuru on Friday on a tour of Rivatex and got a Kenyan print shirt custom-made for him at the factory. The ambassador tried his hand at the equipment inside Rivatex as other officials looked on. After a few hours, the envoy showed reporters his print shirt, with the same patterns and colours as one previously worn by Uhuru. "Sewing diplomacy!! Ever seen such a thing? @rivatex_ltd is just 1 example of how Kenya can become a manufacturing source for EA & the world," McCarter tweeted. He added:"Angalia shati safi yangu! #USAMarafiki is committed to self-reliance & going from aid2 trade." Uhuru has been the marketer-in-chief for the Rivatex brands. During several press briefings since last year, Uhuru has been wearing colourful shirts made by Rivatex. His attention-stealing shirts have caught the collective eye of Kenyan netizens. The eye-catching shirts have made people talk and admire them, with others asking where they can get them and at what cost. All the shirts are designed and made by Rivatex East Africa, the textile factory based in Eldoret. You'll part with Sh2,000 for a shirt, according to Rivatex.
