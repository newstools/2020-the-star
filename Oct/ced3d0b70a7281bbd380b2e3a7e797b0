A 70-year-old woman has been hacked to death by unknown people at Mazeras in Kinango within Kwale County. Mnyazi Mkomba Njei, an elderly resident of Mikanjuni, was attacked by goons while having a Friday night breeze outside her home. The goons cut her head with a Panga. Kinyavu Mkomba said her mumâ€™s killing had caught her by surprise. She said the mother had just had her supper when she opted to find fresh air in the calm cloudy night. So far, no suspect has been arrested. The daughter stated that they found her floating in a pool of blood having several body cuts. She said her mother might have bled to death because of the deep cut on the head. County police commander Joseph Nthenge, who strongly condemned the act, said the motive of the killing is not known. The elderly killing has been on the rise in Kwale since January this year and majority of cases are linked to witchcraft activities and protracted land disputes. Most victims are people aged 60-80 years. In July, three white-haired men were killed in a span of two weeks in different places of the county. Matuga, Lunga-Lunga and Kinango sub-counties are leading in the elderly killing, according to Nthenge. The officer has challenged the locals to solve disputes through peaceful dialogues and the court system. Police have launched investigations and the body was taken to Kinango mortuary for autopsy. Meanwhile, two Ethiopians are being held at Lunga-Lunga police station after attempting to cross to Tanzania through Vanga. Said Kadir, 30, and Muzimil Meka, 27, are believed to have used the porous routes of Kwale-Taita-Taveta in Kinango. They were nabbed by patrolling officers who got wind of them. Two weeks ago three Ethiopians were arrested while hiding in a house in Vanga. The duo will be arraigned and charged in a court of law on Monday.
