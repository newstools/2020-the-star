The Jubilee Party Friday held a primary to select a candidate for Gaturi ward by-election to be held on December 15. The seat fell vacant last month after MCA Kiiru Mwangi died following a long illness. Only three candidates: Esther Mwihaki, Joshua Githinji and Rosemary Wakuthii made it to the ballot. Polling stations opened at around 8am, with party members arriving in small numbers. Branch secretary Joel Irungu said the exercise will be concluded at 4pm. The ward has 20 polling stations and more than 19,000 registered voters. Residents were only required to produce an ID card and have their names verified in the polling station’s IEBC register to take part. A spot check at Nyakihai and Githundi polling station found a low turn-out as many voters rushed back to their farms. Nyakihai presiding officer Bernard Ngari said the station received its polling materials at 8am. “We first explained to the voters what was required of them and took them through the process of voting to ensure they take the shortest time possible,” he said. Ngari said that some people had gone to the polling stations as early as 6am but left with the promise of coming back later. “We explained to them that the process would end at 4 pm. We hope as many people as possible will turn up,” he added. Police officers were deployed to the polling stations to avoid a repeat of the 2017 irregularities that marred the party primaries. The Civic Renewal Party associated with Governor Mwangi Wa Iria has announced it will not field a candidate. It will support the Jubilee Party’s flag bearer. It is almost certain that whoever clinches the Jubilee ticket will take the vacant seat.
