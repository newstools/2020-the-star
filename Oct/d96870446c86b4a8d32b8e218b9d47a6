The National Cohesion and Integration Commission will seek an audience with top leaders in the country to help reduce rising political temperatures. NCIC says as the country moves towards the 2022 General Election, there were fears of violence across the nation as leaders trade accusations against each other. The commission wants to meet President Uhuru Kenyatta, Deputy President William Ruto and ODM leader Raila Odinga. NCIC commissioner Philip Okundi said they had identified political flashpoints and were holding consultations with elders, political and opinion leaders. Okundi said that peace and stability are the most important ingredients for any meaningful social-economic development for any country. He spoke in Kapsabet at the opening of a three-day NCIC workshop for peace actors among them journalists and bloggers in Nandi county. The commission will also meet officials of the boda boda operators. Okundi was accompanied by commissioner Dorcas Kedogo. He said NCIC was behind the peace accord signed at Tabolwa in Nandi along the Nandi-Kakamega border on September 21. “The peace accord has been circulated around the world so that anyone who breaks it faces the full force of the law even if it will mean being taken to the ICC in the Hague, we will do it,” Okundi noted. In September, 14 counties under the auspices of the Lake Region Economic Bloc agreed to not condone acts of violence and lawlessness and instead promote inter-country trade. They also commissioned peace markets in all the hot spots to promote business and interactions among communities. “The commission has been at the heartbeat of various peace meetings from Kerio Valley, Mandera, Marsabit, Nandi, Kisumu, Kakamega and Vihiga,” Okundi said. Commissioner Kedogo said they wanted homegrown solutions to all forms of skirmishes. She said politics should not be allowed to divide the citizens, saying the issue of elections should not be allowed to split residents.
