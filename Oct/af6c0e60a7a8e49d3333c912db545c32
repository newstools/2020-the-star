Embu Senator Njeru Ndigwa has called for party elections to end confrontations and factional politics in Jubilee. Ndwiga said current national and grassroots party officials are in the office illegally as elections are two years late. “I’ve said time and again that party elections are long overdue. To solve the bitter disagreements that the party is facing, it's only the poll that will solve them. The new leaders will be acting on behalf of the members,” he said. Ndwiga told journalists in Embu that once elections are held, officials will be recognised as the bonafide leaders and their decisions binding. He called on the party elections organ to organise polls as quickly as possible. Ndwiga condemned the bloody chaos that took place at Kenol town in Murang'a county on Sunday. Two youths lost their lives in confrontations ahead of Deputy President William Ruto’s funds drive in aid of Africa Independent Pentecostal Church of Africa. The senator said the party leader President Uhuru Kenyatta and his deputy Ruto should be respected by all members. Disrupting functions held by the top leadership should not be entertained, he said. Ndwiga condoled with the families of the youths. He called for investigations to hold perpetrators of the chaos accountable.
