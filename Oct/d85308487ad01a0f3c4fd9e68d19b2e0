New AFC Leopards shot stopper John Oyiemba, who arrived from Kariobangi Sharks on a two-year contract, has revealed his ambition to help Ingwe end their over two-decade top flight heartache. The Harambee Stars goalkeeper, who made his debut for Ingwe in yesterday's Mashujaa Day exhibition match against Shabana FC at Gusii Stadium, Kisii said the squad at Ingwe, coupled with their fervent fan base will prove a good mix in pursuit for glory. The Jamhuri High School alumnus expressed his excitement in joining Leopards and was confident of helping the team achieve league glory this year. “I’m confident that the technical bench and my teammates will hit the winning formula and bring success to the club. I’m excited to join one of the best-supported clubs in the country with a fantastic fan base,” Oyemba said on the club's website. The 26-year-old shot-stopper is the second international calibre player to move to the Den following hot on the heels of former Sharks teammate Harrison Mwendwa. Oyemba joined Kariobangi Sharks in 2015 from Nairobi Stima, where he was plying his trade soon after completing his secondary school education. His heroics at Sharks saw him named Goalkeeper of the Year during the Sports Journalists Association of Kenya (SJAK) in 2017. He was also part of the national team that took part in the 2019 African Cup of Nations (AFCON) in Egypt. He will be competing for the number one jersey against Ugandan Benjamin Ochan, who extended his stay at the Den for a year.
