Nairobi Diaries actress Stacy Vugusta popularly known as Pendo has been charged with failing to pay Sh208,000 bill she accumulated alongside her lover while staying at English Point hotel. Pendo and the unidentified man allegedly stayed in the high end hotel with full knowledge that she was not in a position to pay the bill. She denied the charges before Shanzu magistrate David Odhiambo. According to the hotel management, Pendo had checked in with her lover and their bill accumulated to Sh330,000. However, the man disappeared even before they settled the bill and the actress was left to shoulder the remainder of the bill. The management said the actress was only able to pay Sh 145,000 and promised to pay the remaining balance within two weeks. They however said she failed to keep her word after failing to pay on the agreed dates of between September 14 and October 7. The decision to charge the actress was reached by the hotel as the bill was accumulating as they had restrained her from leaving the hotel. The magistrate released the accused on a Sh100,000 bond with an alternative of cashbail of Sh35,000. The magistrate directed the actress to pay the balance before trial which has been scheduled for March 15.
