Vihiga county commissioner Ochillo Oyugi has urged the youth to use their talent to create employment. "We all can’t fit in the office with the current shrinking employability globally," he said. Oyugi said Vihiga is one of the counties with huge potential in music and sports, among other areas. “Daudi Kabaka, John Nzenze and David Amunga are just a few talents who have put this region on the music industry map,” Oyugi said. The administrator further urged Governor Wilber Ottichilo to invest heavily in sports to help the youth. "Vihiga United [football club] can be great if you fully support it," Oyugi said. "Those young players should be nurtured well to propel Vihiga United to the next level and that's the only way we can create employment," he said. The commissioner was addressing residents at Kidundu Stadium during Mashujaa Day celebrations on Tuesday. Oyugi further said farmers should be celebrated for their contribution to national food security. On Covid-19, he said the virus is still spreading and people should heed to the prevention protocols rolled out by the government. Present during the ceremony were Governor Ottichilo, Deputy Governor Patrick Saisi, CECs and MCAs. Edited by A.N
