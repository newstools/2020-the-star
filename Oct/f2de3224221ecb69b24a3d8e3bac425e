Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru on Tuesday cautioned residents against disregarding the Covid-19 prevention guidelines. Waiguru also warned that even though infection numbers reported daily are declining, it should not be construed to mean the disease has been eradicated. The county chief spoke at Kerugoya County Hospital when she received personal protective equipment for healthcare workers from the Safaricom Foundation. Safaricom donated 250 packets of surgical face masks, 30 packets of surgical gloves, 30 pieces of Hazmat suits, 500 protective goggles, 174 N95 masks, 50 disposable surgical gowns and 80 bottles of hand sanitiser. Waiguru said everyone must continue following all the measures to protect themselves from contracting the virus. “We are asking our people not to let their guard down as there is still a chance of a recurrence if we are not careful,” Waiguru said. Safaricom’s senior enterprise manager for Mt Kenya Josephine Mwikali said the donations were part the foundation’s initiative to help Kenyans fight Covid-19. The governor thanked Safaricom for the equipment, which she said will help the county’s health workers serve the residents better. “We appreciate every effort from all our partners who have supported us in ensuring that our health workers remain protected from contracting Covid-19,” Waiguru said. She praised the county’s healthcare providers for their efforts in ensuring that the virus did not overwhelm the facilities. Waiguru added that county health officials will continue educating the public on the need for wearing masks, washing hands and keeping social distance among others. On Friday, Waiguru said at Kerugoya Referral Hospital that she was worried some residents are not wearing masks and keeping social distance. The county has so reported 88 cases out of 856 samples collected.  Four people died but 83 patients have recovered.
