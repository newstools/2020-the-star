A goal from Anthony 'Walcott' Rupande was enough to eliminate the champions and book a place in the last four slot for Terror, from Mwiki, who will now face Kipande FC. The other semi final will pit Samba Boys from Korogocho against Kariobangi Sports. The grassroots tournament has been going on despite the government restrictions that bar contact sports but Stephen Omondi, the organiser from Simama organisation, said it was the clubs' ideas for the tournament to be held as part of their pre season preparations. "This tournament has helped keep players and fans busy at this time when we are in the middle of a pandemic. The stress brought about by job losses for most can be redirected into doing positive things particularly in neighborhoods where criminal activities can soar,"he said. 22Bet, who are the African partners of French giants PSG said they will roll out such  tournaments countrywide and also include a girl's version. "Talent is in abundance at the grassroots and if well harnessed, we can regularly produce players who can play in the world's best leagues.
