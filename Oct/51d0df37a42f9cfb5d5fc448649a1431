Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi has blamed politicians for the new rise in Covid-19 cases in the country. Kingi said top politicians have been seen in the media holding huge rallies without observing the anti-Covid-19 protocols. Speaking in Kilifi together with county commissioner Kutswa Olaka during Mashujaa Day celebrations, the governor said since the second wave started six people had died as 404 tested positive in the county. "It will be a big burden as the cases keep rising in the country. To win the war we must lead by example as leaders," he said. He said Magarini is leading with 90 cases followed by Malindi with 75, while Kilifi South recorded 70 cases. Kingi said Kilifi North recorded 66 cases, Rabai 55, Kaloleni 46 cases, while Ganze has the lowest number with two cases. "Burial permits will from now henceforth be issued for one day only from 8am to 5pm," the governor said. The county Covid-19 response committee resolved that very few people will be allowed at mortuaries to pick bodies of their loved ones. Kingi said bars and clubs that will be found operating overnight shall be shut and their licences revoked. He advised local politicians to desist from attending funerals that do not follow the Covid-19 protocols. County commissioner Olaka said there was a risk of many people dying from failure to observe Covid-19 protocols. ''Recently, the pandemic resurfaced. We agreed with the governor that we will do all we can to prevent the spread. We call for cooperation among elected leaders," he said. Edited by Henry Makori
