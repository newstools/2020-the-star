Foreign Affairs CAS Ababu Namwamba, on behalf of the government, delivered food and medical aid to the Mozambican Government in Pemba Bay, Cabo Delgado Provincia on Wednesday. The aid, aboard a Kenya Airforce carrier, will assist about 300,000 people displaced in Mozambique's Cabo Delgado province following insurgence by the jihadist al Shabaab that has tormented the region since October 2017. "I'm happy to be on this great land of Samora Machel, a truly fine son of Africa, to deliver a special message of goodwill and solidarity from my President, His Excellency Uhuru Kenyatta,” Ababu said. The CAS added that the government of Kenya stands in solidarity with Mozambique in rejecting terror of any form or complexion, and in line with the warm bilateral ties that have bound our two brotherly countries for decades. “President Uhuru Kenyatta and the people of Kenya extend our sincere sympathies and humble assistance to the people of Mozambique. This is the spirit of global solidarity against terror. This is the spirit of African solutions to African problems.” He continued that, “This is the spirit of silencing all guns across the length and breadth of Africa by this year 2020 as desired by the African Union.” While appreciating Mozambique for firmly supporting Kenya's successful UN Security Council bid, CAS Ababu expressed confidence that the long-standing fruitful friendship between Kenya and Mozambique will continue for the mutual benefit. Mozambique's Minister of State for Administration and Public Management Ana Comoane said while receiving the donation that: "It is an honour for me to accept this generous donation of food and medical supplies sent by the government of Kenya. We thank the government of Kenya especially President Uhuru Kenyatta.” Minister Comoane added that “We can say Kenya is always the first government who respond to our plea for help. Kenya is a real friend and Kenyans are always with us all the time.”
