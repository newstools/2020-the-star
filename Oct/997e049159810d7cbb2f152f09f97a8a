Water supply in parts of Nairobi will be cut off from Thursday 6 am. The Nairobi City Water and Sewerage Company said the disruption follows an emergency shutdown of Ng’ethu Water Treatment Plant, the city's main one. NCWSC in a statement on Wednesday said the closure of the plant will facilitate maintenance works at Mwagu water intake along Chania river. This is in preparation for the coming short rains. The normal supply is expected by Friday at 6 pm. Some of the areas affected are the whole of the city centre and Industrial area, University of Nairobi main campus, the Coco-Cola Factory, Jomo Kenyatta International Airport and Athi river EPZ. The others are areas along Mombasa, Juja, Jogoo, Outer-ring, Kangundo, Thika and Limuru roads. This comes barely three days after water supply in the mentioned areas was shut down following the ongoing construction of the JKIA-Westlands Expressway near Bellevue to Southern bypass. The shutdown started at 6 am on Saturday to Sunday 11 at 6 am. "This will facilitate the interconnection of the new and old pipelines and enable the release of the road median to the Expressway road contractor,"  Managing Director Nahashon Muguna said in an announcement last week.
