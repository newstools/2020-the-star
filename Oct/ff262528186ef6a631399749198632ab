Former Toronto Marathon champion Bernard Kipruto will not participate in any races this year after he picked a hamstring injury during the London Marathon. Kipruto was disappointed with his seventh place finish at the race despite finishing one place better than top favourite Eliud Kipchoge, who placed eighth. “I had prepared well for the race to win but I had challenges. I was one of the best competitors but the injury slowed me down hence I got this result that I did not plan for,” Kipruto said. Apart from the injury, Kipruto also blamed the blistery weather conditions in London for his under-whelming performance. “I don’t know how Ethiopians train in such wet and windy conditions but when it is sunny, we always beat them hands down,” he said. Nonetheless, his performance at London Marathon was much improved from the Boston Marathon in September 2020, where he finished 10th. Kipruto said he has taken vital lessons from this year that will be useful as he trails his focus on next year. “After the race, I took time to review my performance. It was tough. This time, I want to get a good rest before deciding with my coaches on the plan for next year. I will be looking to participate in most of the major races next year, especially marathon races,” he said.
