 The Kenya National Highways Authority will implement development projects worth Sh2.8 billion in Turkana county. The projects include the construction of the Lokichar-Nakodok road which is underway. Kenha on Monday held a meeting with county leaders and community representatives to agree on the implementation of the projects. Turkana leaders led by Governor Josphat Nanok signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure and Kenha for the implementation of the projects. The county agreed to waive levies and fees charged on materials for road construction. “The agreement unlocked Sh2.8 billion funding the infrastructure projects as part of social corporate responsibility by the authority,” Nanok said. The projects will be spread across all the region's six subcounties. Nanok said leaders agreed to reduce the list of projects they wanted to be implemented for the projects to start. “These few projects will have to undergo the technical estimation and costings to arrive for the final projects that will be procured and implemented. The projects are distributed in sectors including education, health, water and trade," he said. Turkana South will receive Sh900 million, Turkana West (Sh700 million), Turkana North (Sh460 million), Turkana Central (Sh401 million), Loima (Sh276 million) and Turkana East (Sh262 million). Turkana North MP Christopher Nakuleu assured Kenha of their support for the projects and political goodwill. Nakuleu is the chairman of Turkana MPs' caucus. He urged the authority to shorten the procurement process to speed up the implementation. Kenha deputy director in charge of East Africa Regional Transport and Trade Development Facilitation Project John Ndinika said the 338km Lokichar-Nakadok road is 60 per cent complete.
