Stecol Corporation that is building the Malaba water supply and sanitation project has been ordered to complete the work by June. Water and Sanitation Principal Secretary Joseph Irungu said the Sh306 million project should be completed within the agreed 20 months to serve the over 120,000 residents of Malaba town and its environs. The PS spoke when he toured the project on Tuesday. “I am here to track the implementation of the Malaba-Malakisi sanitation project as one of the flagship projects that should be delivered by June 2021,” he said. “This project must be complete by June 2021. I have already instructed the contractor to make sure that by June next year this project is complete and ready for handover. It should also be ready for testing and commissioning.” Malaba town has no sewerage system and the project’s completion is expected to improve the town’s rainwater flow problems as well as sanitation. The border town usually floods during heavy rain since it lies on relatively flat land. Its environs are swampy. “There have been challenges here witnessed including the acquisition of this 45-acre land that is supposed to host the sewerage project,” the PS said. “The pipeline has already been laid and therefore the project is 26 per cent complete. We designed this sewerage project so that it can sort out the sewerage problems of the area.” The contractor, whose engineer according to documents seen by the Star is Lake Victoria North Water Works Development Agency, has already been given an advance payment of Sh61 million. Stakeholders during the PS’s visit pointed out Covid-19 among challenges that have slowed construction of the project located in Amoni village on the Kenya-Uganda border.  Edited by Henry Makori
