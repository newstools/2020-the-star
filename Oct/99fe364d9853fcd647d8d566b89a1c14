President Uhuru Kenyatta has sent a congratulatory message to Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern of New Zealand following her re-election for a second term in office. Prime Minister Ardern's Labour Party won the elections with a historic margin, winning 64 seats in Parliament. In his message of goodwill, Uhuru wished Prime Minister Ardern good health and success as she steers her nation to greater prosperity. "...and pledged Kenya's continued solidarity with New Zealand as a valued bilateral and multilateral partner," he said. With all votes tallied, Ardern's centre-left Labour Party won 49.1%, bringing a projected 64 seats and a rare outright parliamentary majority. The opposition centre-right National Party won 26.8% in Saturday's poll - just 35 seats in the 120-seat assembly. The poll was originally to be held in September but was postponed by a month after a renewed Covid-19 outbreak. Ardern, 40, told her supporters after the victory: "New Zealand has shown the Labour Party its greatest support in almost 50 years. We will not take your support for granted. And I can promise you we will be a party that governs for every New Zealander." Additional reporting by BBC
