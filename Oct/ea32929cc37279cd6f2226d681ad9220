The Kenya Forest Service is yet to surrender land for the Sh21 billion Bosto water project in Bomet county, Water CAS Andrew Tuimur has said. It hasn't issued a licence either. The project was to start seven years ago in Mau forest and serve Bomet and Kericho counties. Be patient - that what Tuimur told residents recently. The planning was in final stages and it was "only a matter of time" before it is launched, he said. KFS was yet to issue a license for the project - the reason for the delay, Tuimur said. “The project is in the final stages of its implementation and once we get the license, we are going to launch it…let us be patient,” Tuimur said. The national water harvesting and storage authority needs more than 100 acres of land in the forest for the project. A reservoir  is to be built. The CAS spoke on Tuesday in Bomet when he commissioned the Sh3.9 million Koita and Sh5.3 million Kabusare community water projects to serve 1, 000 and 2, 000 residents, respectively. He was accompanied by the Lake Victoria South Water Works Development Agency officials led by chairman Dan Omino and acting CEO George Odede. Tuimur also said the process of awarding the tender for Bomet, Longisa and Mulot water supply will be completed and the contractor will be on site by November. The project is being implemented under the Kenya towns’ sustainable water supply and sanitation programme and Lake Victoria South Water Works Development Agency. Omino said the Sh1.4 million water project will be financed by  the African Development Bank and will cover all of Longisa and Mulot towns and 20 per cent of Bomet town. “The supply will cover 118 kilometers, the total distribution network, by gravity and villages upstream will be pumped water," Omino said.
