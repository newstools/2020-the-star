 With hopes that football might resume soon as the government continues with the review of the coronavirus restrictions, Football Kenya Federation has rolled out a three-day Physical Endurance Test exercise for referees tasked with officiating in the Kenyan Premier League, the National Super League and Division One League matches. About 240 match officials are undergoing the three-day physical assessment program, which culminates on Saturday, and whose aim is to test their physical preparedness to handle matches. Theory sessions, to be capped off with a written exam to test their knowledge on the laws of the game, have also been lined up. “Our target is to not only ascertain the referees’ physical shape but also keep them abreast with the laws of the game,” said FKF referees manager Sylvester Kirwa. The course is being spearheaded by Steven Oduor, Edward Lumbugu, Caleb Amwayi, Margaret Omondi and Kirwa.
