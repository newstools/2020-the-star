Gatundu North MP Wanjiku Kibe has challenged the decision that declared her seat vacant. Wanjiku has filed a notice of appeal at the Court of Appeal. On Wednesday, Judge Weldon Korir declared her seat vacant and directed IEBC to conduct fresh elections. Justice Korir ruled that her election was illegal because she was still an MCA when was gazetted by IEBC. However, Wanjiku says she is dissatisfied with the decision by Judge Korir. In the case, former MP Clement Waibara had challenged her election and the Court of Appeal had directed that the matter be heard by a constitutional court. In his judgment, Korir noted that evidence shows Wanjiku was still a nominated MCA on June 27, 2017, when her nomination to run for the Gatundu North MP was gazetted by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission. The judge directed the deputy registrar to immediately and without delay, transmit his decision to the Speaker of the National Assembly for action. Justice Korir agreed with Waibaraâ€™s lawyers who had argued that unless an MCA or a state officer resigns before the nomination date, he or she cannot contest for either parliamentary or a presidential seat.
