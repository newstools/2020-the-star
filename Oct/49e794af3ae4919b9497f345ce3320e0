The Garissa county government has started upgrading two key roads in Garissa Municipality from earth to bitumen standards. Speaking on Monday during the commissioning of the project, Lands, Urban Planning, Housing and Public Works executive Abdi Omar said work on the 3.6 kilometres Waberi and Galbet roads is set to be completed in two weeks. "These two ambitious and timely projects will benefit residents of these areas and elsewhere as well as create jobs for our youth at this critical time," he said. Drainage systems will also be rehabilitated. Garissa Municipality acting CEO Abdinoor ole Hussein said on completion, the project, which is funded by the World Bank, will ease movement of residents and traders. It is not clear how much money will be spent on the roads. Similar projects have been undertaken recently, including road construction, improvement of drainage systems, walkways and the building of the ultra-modern Qorahey market. “We have seen what good roads can do in improving business and the economy of an area. If the same is replicated in our county like is currently happening, then we will definitely go far bearing in mind that our people are very aggressive when it comes to doing business,” resident Abdullahi Ali said. During Mashujaa Day celebrations, Governor Ali Korane said his government would continue to improve infrastructure in the municipality and by extension, rural access roads in the subcounties to all-weather status.
