Kirinyaga Governor Ann Waiguru has expressed worry over the abandonment of Covid-19 health regulations by local residents. Four locals have already succumbed to the virus. Waiguru who was speaking at Kerugoya Referral Hospital said she was worried that some residents are not wearing masks and keeping social distance She lamented that the people have come up with a belief that the coronavirus had ended and thus thrown all caution out of the window. Waiguru noted that the trend is worrying given the fact that the county had so far recorded 88 infections. The governor said the county is putting in place all necessary measures to prevent further spread of the virus. “There is a narrative going around that Covid-19 is finished and I want to say as the Governor of Kirinyaga that we need to be very careful not to let our guard down. We have to continue putting on our masks... we have to continue keeping social distance,” said Waiguru. She urged health workers to continue sensitizing the people on the need to continue observing the health procedures that were put in place by the government to curb the further spread. Waiguru reminded the residents that there have been very few cases of infections and death owing to the observance of the rules put in place to prevent infection. She was speaking when she toured the referral hospital to assess the progress of a medical complex under construction which has intensive Care Unit (ICU) and High-Dependency Unit (HDU). The governor said she was impressed by the progress of the facility which cost Sh420 million revealing that it would be finished before the year ends. She also received a bulk of Personal Protective Equipment (PPEs) from the Safaricom Foundation. Waiguru also toured Kerogoya Town to assess the progress of a World Bank-funded street upgrading project which she said will greatly improve the image of the town
