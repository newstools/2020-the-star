Football Kenya Federation (FKF) President Nick Mwendwa has reiterated his earliercall to the government to allow football activities to resume. Speaking after being handed another four-year term as FKF President, Mwendwa said with international commitments coming up and having shown they can follow all government health protocols, it was time the game resumed. “We are ready to have football played in a safe environment. It can be handled the same way we did with the Harambee Stars vs Zambia’s Chipolopolo friendly and we are hopeful the Ministry of Sports Cabinet Secretary, Amina Mohamed will consider,”  said Mwendwa. He said the presence of Sports Registrar Rose Wasike during the FKF polls was another thumbs up to the ability of the federation to ensure government concerns are being addressed at every turn when football activities resume. Newly elected FKF NEC member for Nairobi Michael Ouma, who has been a member of the FKF International Match Organising Committee, said all stakeholders are willing to adhere to all public health measures to ensure football returns safely. “Everyone wants football to resume and in the two events the federation has held (Stars friendly and FKF polls), we have shown it can be done in a safe manner if the health directives are followed strictly,” Ouma said.
