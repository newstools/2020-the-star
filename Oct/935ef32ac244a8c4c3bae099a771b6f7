Wazalendo are still far off their budgetary target with the African Cup of Club Championship a month away. The Fidelis Kimanzi-coached side have so far raised a paltry Sh730,000 out of the estimated budget Sh7 million.  Wazalendo had launched the funds drive on July 12 to help them prepare and feature in the 2020 edition of the ACCC competition. Wazalendo Steering Committee chairman, Moses Majiwa, appealed to corporates to help the club raise funds to help the players make their dream debut in the annual continental showpiece. Majiwa is one of the founders of the club and also doubles up as the deputy match and fixture secretary in the Kenya Hockey Union (KHU). "The contributions are very slow but our spirits are not dampened yet. There are avenues we are trying to exploit but I urge the corporates to help us rescue the situation." The team received a Sh50,000 boost yesterday from WizGlobal Kenya Ltd towards the purchase of  uniforms for the tournament. Having learnt from past experiences, he said the club cant cancel their participation at this point in time. Wazalendo arrived late for the competition in 2007 held in Cairo, Egypt and were subsequently locked out of the continental showpiece. "Players deserve to be rewarded for the hard work. Appearing at the event is the most important thing and we are all looking forward to it. We cannot nullify our participation this late as there are penalties involved." Wazalendo plan to take a total of 25 players should they hit their target.  Priority will be given to the players in the top tier but the development side will have their chance should they impress the coaches. "The club is focused on taking 18 players who will play but we will also have seven players from the development side also." The club is awaiting to be cleared  by the government to start large group training anytime, according to the supremo.
