Services in public health facilities are likely to be paralysed from Thursday. This is after public health workers threatened to down their tools effective midnight in what they have termed as the failure by the national government to address their grievances regarding promotions and re-designations. The strike will affect all port health facilities including airports, border points and all points of entry and the National Spinal Injury Hospital. Others include Mathari Hospital, Othaya Hospital, the national blood bank, national public health laboratories and all other facilities served by members working under the Ministry of Health. "It is a very unfortunate moment that we are giving you such bad news. Beginning midnight, there will be no Covid-19 screening at all ports of entry," the Kenya National Union of Clinical Cfficers chairman Peterson Wachira said. "We have been played in the past severally, we will not be played again because we are no longer babies." The other unions include the Kenya National Union of Nurses, the Kenya Health Professionals Society, the Kenya National Union of Laboratory Officers, Kenya National Union of Pharmaceutical Technologists and the Kenya Union of Nutritionists and Dieticians. Speaking in Nairobi on Wednesday, the unions termed it demoralizing that the ministry has for years promised to effect the promotions in the various cadres only to backtrack later and employ delay tactics. As a result, some of their members have stagnated in the same job group for more than 15 years. "The situation has become so bad that most of the discriminated professional head of departments within the ministry are several job groups below their juniors in some counties who they are supposed to lead," Wachira said.
