Mandera Governor Ali Roba has expressed his delight after two Cuban doctors were released by al Shabaab. "We are extremely happy and delighted to hear of the news of release of our Cuban doctors by al Shabaab," he said. "We thank all that were involved in securing their release. We will remain forever grateful to our Cuban doctors for what they have done for the people of Mandera." The two Cuban doctors - Landy Rodriguez and Herera Correa- were kidnapped in April last year in a daring road ambush where gunmen shot and killed one of the police officers guarding the medics. The two doctors were being escorted to work when two salon cars blocked their way in the ambush. A senior Somali intelligence official told The Associated Press that the doctors were released over the weekend after months of negotiations with their captors. He declined to give further details. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to the media.
