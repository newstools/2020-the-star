A women's Sacco in Lamu is transforming the lives of hundreds of residents by empowering groups with equipment and loans to do business. The Lamu Women's Sacco, which raised over Sh10 million last year, offers interest-free loans to groups in the form of equipment. So far, 120 groups out of the total 150 have received motorcycles, gas cylinders, tents, cattle and ovens among other equipment. Lamu Woman Representative Ruweida Mohamed, who is the patron of the Sacco, said phase one of the programme will be completed at the end of this year. She spoke during the handover of the equipment to 25 groups at Mkunguni Square in Lamu. Mohamed said early this year the Sacco delivered 60 new motorbikes, 30 of which were handed over to groups in Lamu East and the rest to groups in Lamu West. She said 60 other groups got gas cylinders, freezers, tents, cattle and goats. The MP said 23 women's groups received different equipment for businesses. ''Seven groups have not received anything because they did not apply. They are yet to met the criteria. We don't just give out the equipment. By December if they do not fulfill the requirements we will roll out phase two in January,'' she said. Beneficiaries said the programme has uplifted their livelihoods and would transform their lives for the better. Sofia Gitau, one of the beneficiaries who got a motorcycle, said the Sacco is not discriminatory againstÂ  Christians or Muslims. She said since they got the boda boda they earn Sh7,200 per month. They give the Sacco Sh4,000 and save the rest. Beatrice Ngoro, another beneficiary, thanked the woman rep for the idea of the Sacco, saying now they no longer depend on their husbands for money for household use. Lamu county commissioner Irungu Macharia urged men not to misuse the women's funds. Edited by Henry Makori
