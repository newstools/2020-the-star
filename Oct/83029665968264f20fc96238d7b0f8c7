Felix Orinda, popularly known as DJ Evolve, now wants a case against Embakasi East MP Babu Owino withdrawn. The DJ says that after consultation with his family, they agreed to concentrate on his health rather than the case of attempted murder case pending in court. In the matter, Babu was charged with attempting to kill Evolve by shooting him on the neck. In a letter to the court, the DJ, through his lawyers, said that the case has affected his healing process. However, the DPP told the court he needs more time to assess the mental status of the DJ and asked for more time before giving a comprehensive response to the letter. According to the DPP, the application for more time is premised on grounds that they were interested in preserving the interest of Evolve. Further, the DPP wishes to understand the motivation and reasons why the family has taken the said position yet the case is of public interest. Senior principal magistrate Benard Ochoi granted the DPP time and asked them to appear in court on November 9 for mention. In his ruling, magistrate Ochoi said he has seen the letter from Evolve to the DPP seeking to withdraw the charge. The court noted that Evolve had addressed the court but his voice was not clear because there was a tube inserted through his throat. The letter to the DPP and court also had a thumb print from Evolve to show that he had signed the letter.
