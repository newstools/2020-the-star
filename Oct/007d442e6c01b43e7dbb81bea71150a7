The gains made in tackling barriers to girls education in the country might be reversed as Covid-19 effects continue ravaging the country, an expert has warned. Speaking to the media on Thursday, ActionAid executive director Susan Otieno said with the closure of schools, girls who are at home have devolved back to labour to support their families. “We had made gains, the communities had made gains but Covid-19 pandemic is here. When schools provided safe havens for girls to focus and shape their lives, the same schools were closed and it is not that every girl can access e-learning,” Otieno said. The economic impact of the pandemic has made many families to view girls as an opportunity to restock economically. Otieno urged the government to think of other social protection measures such as cash transfers for affected families. “Many girls end up getting pregnant and to many families who still view return to school as something not worth pursuing, these girls are not yet back to school,” she said. “Violence has increased at home because you are closed in with a potential perpetrator.” Some are feared to have been forced into early marriages after undergoing female genital mutilation. Those who feel unsafe have been encouraged to send the word ‘HELP’ to 21094, a 24 hour helpline to seek for urgent assistance form the relevant authorities. Data from the World Health Organization shows more than 200 million women and girls have undergone FGM. In Kenya, the practice is still prevalent in 22 counties, with 11 per cent of women aged between 15 to 19 are circumcised compared to more than 20 per cent among those above 30 years. With the effects of the virus, it is feared that President Uhuru Kenyatta's target to end FGM by 2022 might not be achieved unless more effort is put in. Edited by EKibii
