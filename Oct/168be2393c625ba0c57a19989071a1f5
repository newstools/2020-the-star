Yesterday the BBI report was officially launched at Bomas. The intention of BBI is to build a more inclusive society which is why there are proposals for an executive Prime Minister and deputies, for a greater share of revenue for counties, and for half of senators to be women. The BBI team has done an excellent job sifting through suggestions for constitutional reform but, as almost every speaker said yesterday, that does not mean that its proposals are cast in stone. There are legitimate concerns. Is it affordable to give counties 35 percent of all revenue? Will the new judicial Ombudsman make judges subservient to the President? Should county women representatives be retained in the National Assembly? The process of actualising BBI now starts as draft legislation is prepared and then reviewed by parliamentary committees who will seek the views of the public. The BBI process should continue to be inclusive. It was unfortunate that Musalia Mudavadi and DP William Ruto were jeered yesterday while in general speaking positively about BBI. So, as Bishop Oginde said yesterday, let us honour the BBI by allowing wide-ranging and respectful debate. Quote of the day: "The true facts are not always obvious. They often have to be looked for."
