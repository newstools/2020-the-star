Amref Kenya in collaboration with NMS Health department on Thursday held Psychosocial First Aid sessions for staff working at isolation centres and patients being admitted. The zumba dance took place at the Kenya Medical Training College, Nairobi. The aim was to relieve them of stress and depression, heavy workload and separation from their family members and loved ones. The sessions started in June and will end in December. They are done on weekly basis to offer a safe space for healthcare workers, where they can express their psychological issues and learn of their resources.
