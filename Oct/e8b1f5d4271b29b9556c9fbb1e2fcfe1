@Waithaka06 Operators of agrovet businesses in Laikipia county will be vetted to ensure they sell only certified seeds to farmers and do not exploit them. Deputy Governor John Mwaniki said farmers were incurring huge losses owing to exploitation by agrovets. He spoke while flagging off 30 tonnes of maize seeds to 15,000 farmers in Laikipia East subcounty. “Farmers are not able recognise certified seeds at the buying point and they only [know the seeds were bad] when their crops get stunted or the harvests are low. The business people also sell low-quality artificial insemination breeds," Mwaniki said. He urged farmers to adopt modern technology to increase yields. Maize seedlings donated by Bayer East Africa Company in collaboration with the county government will produce higher yields, he said. “These seedlings are of higher quality and a two-kilogramme packet can produce about eight bags of maize. An acre is capable of producing 28 to32 bags of maize," the deputy governor said. The maize, which takes three months to mature, will be planted this month when rains come. Peter Kiburi from the Bayer East Africa Company said the maize variety DK 31 is drought-resistant. “Laikipia West subcounty will have a different variety, DK C9089, for areas with higher rainfall. Farmers there will be able to harvest 40 to 44 bags per acre," Kiburi said. Present at the flagging off at Nanyuki's NCPB depot were Agriculture committee chairman of the Laikipia assembly Simon Kanyutu (Marmanet), Thingithu MCA Stephen Kamau and his Tigithi counterpart Mutahi Muritu.
