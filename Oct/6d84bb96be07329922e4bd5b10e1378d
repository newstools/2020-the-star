The first three berths of the Lapsset project at the Lamu port are expected to be completed in October next year, the national government has said. The berths will cost Sh42 billion. Lapsset corridor project director general Sylvester Kasuku said works were delayed by Covid-19 pasndemic, but they are still on course. The work is 83 per cent complete, he said during an inspection tour of the port on Wednesday. “The first berth is already 100 per cent complete. We are looking forward to having all the three berths completed by October next year,” Kasuku said. Last December, President Uhuru Kenyatta was scheduled to tour Lamu and commission the first berth, but the event was postponed. Interior PS Karanja Kibicho on Wednesday led a team of nine principal secretaries, under the National Development Implementation Technical Committee (NDITC) to inspect the 32 Berth Port in Lamu. Kibicho said the team has so far visited 1,500 national government projects countrywide. He said the Lamu Port project, which was started in 2012, is one of the projects the President is eager to see operational. “We expect between now and next year that the President will come here for the commissioning,” Kibicho said.
