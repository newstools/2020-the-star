A Nairobi court yesterday exempted nurses' union boss Seth Panyako from attending a criminal case where he is accused of creating disturbance and taking part in unlawful assembly at KNH. The case had come up for mention before Milimani principal magistrate Elizabeth Nazushi. Panyako, secretary general of the Kenya National Union of Nurses, sought exemption until his application to bar the DPP from prosecuting him is heard and determined by the High Court. He told the court his application is coming up for hearing on October 22. The magistrate granted his request and exempted him from attending mentions until the final decision by the High Court. In the case, the prosecution alleges Panyako created disturbance in a manner likely to cause a breach of the peace by disrupting services at the Kenyatta National Hospital. Panyako was arrested on October 29, 2018, alongside Joseph Wanyoike and Evans Mwaluko for allegedly inciting nurses at KNH to go on strike. They have since pleaded not guilty and each of them is out on a personal bond of Sh50,000. Panyako was arrested as he arrived at KNH to address striking nurses. The health workers were protesting what they said was the hospital management's refusal to let them join a union of their choice. The nurses said the hospital had blocked them from joining Knun. Stephen Warutere, the Knun branch secretary general at KNH, said nurses were being forced to remain in Kudheiha, which, they said, does not serve their interests. Kudheiha stands for the Kenya Union of Domestic, Hotels, Educational Institutions, Hospitals and Allied Workers.
