The appointment of former Tiaty MP Kamama Asman as a member of the National Social Security Fund board has been revoked. In a Gazette notice dated October 14, Labour CS Simon Chelgui announced the revocation. "In exercise of the powers conferred by section 6 (d) (iii) of the National Social Security Fund Act, as read together with section 51 of the Interpretation and General Provisions Act, the Cabinet Secretary for Labour and Social Protection revokes the appointment ofâ€”Kamama Asman Abongotum," the notice reads. In June, the High Court in Eldoret revoked Kamama's appointment and that of five directors of the North Rift Valley Water Works Development Agency. The six had been appointed in March last year. High Court judge Hellen Omondi ruled the appointments were unconstitutional, violated gender balance and said there had been no competitive recruitment.
