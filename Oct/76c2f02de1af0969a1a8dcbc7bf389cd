Femi One and Sol Generation's Nviiri have released the collabo 'Kipetero Kiyesu'. The song is produced song by Ricco Beatz. Femi One brings out her flawless rap style as she tackles topics such as corruption, single motherhood and patriotism. She says the song is meant to address issues that affect the society and the common mwananchi. "As an artiste I felt the need to address these issues because I have a large platform and so many people looking up to me as they say ‘msanii kioo cha jamii’," she said. "Sio kila saa tunaimba wimbo za anasa. Sometimes as artistes, let’s stand up for something and address it using our art." Nviiri said this being his first collabo with a female artiste, it has opened more chances with others. "It will definitely not be the last since there was good chemistry and vibe. Be ready for a banger and a new sound."
