A West Pokot comedian popularly known us Mulmulwas is expected to plead to the charge of abusing Senator Samuel Poghisio next week after the prosecution on Monday cited errors in the charge sheet. The prosecution wants "some errors" in the file to be corrected and comedian Dennis Kapchok Ruto brought back to a Kibera court next week. "We have directed that some few mistakes be rectified before the plea is taken," the prosecution told the Star. Kapchok faces the charge of cyber harassment contrary to the Computer Misuse and Cybercrime Act. He is accused of abusing Senator Poghisio in his Dennis Kapchok Facebook account - Pokot daily post forum - on September 29. Mulmulwas was arrested in Kapenguria at the weekend and brought to Nairobi. Detectives said they are investigating claims of cyber harassment under the Computer Misuse and Cyber Crime Act over the post he had made against the West Pokot legislator, who is also the leader of the Majority in the Senate. The senator had complained that the post was malicious. Mulmulwas became popular two years ago after Governor John Lonyangapuo referred to him as “kijana fupi, round-Mulmulwas”.  - mwaniki fm
