The fixtures released for the 2021 Kenya Premier League season revealed a daunting start to the campaign by champions Gor Mahia. With a blockbuster opener against Tusker, Gor have started preparations for the new season under the new Brazilian coach Roberto Oliveira. And as confirmed by captain Kenneth Muguna, things are working out as planned with an aim of forming up a working team. Muguna, who has been at the club for four years now and has variously been linked with a move away only to stay put, said on the club official portal that the team is fine so far. “We are creating a bond that will make us operate together as a team. The aim is to find a working formula.” With the proposed league kick-off dates in November, the fixtures are out with the first five matches perceived to be a real litmus test for the team but the captain says focus is on being ready and not on their opponents. “We are not concentrating so much on the fixtures, we are not worried about it at all. We are focused on being ready before the league resumes because I know once we are physically and mentally ready, we can tackle any team on earth,” he added. Muguna says there is only one shortcut to winning trophies: “We are going to try and win all our matches because we know by doing so, we stand a chance of winning trophies at the end of the season.” The club is preparing for continental assignments which will kick off in the last weekend of November as well as the local league competition which has been put forward for November 21.
