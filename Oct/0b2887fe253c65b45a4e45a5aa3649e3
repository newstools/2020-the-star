Youths engaged in Kazi Mtaani in Kwale county will assist public schools in preparing for the reopening. County commissioner Karuku Ngumo said the youths will help provide general cleaning services in schools. The services will include cutting grass, fumigating, desilting choked gutters, arranging desks and sprucing up learning institutions. “We will use our able young men and women to clean classrooms, compounds and ensure a high standard of hygiene is attained,” he said. In Kwale, more than 3,000 youths have benefited from the Kazi Mtaani programme. Ngumo urged headteachers in the county to contact his office, so they can make arrangements on how the cleaning will be carried out. “We are trying to be proactive to save time when schools reopen,” the county commissioner said. Ngumo further urged the Ministry of Education to be clear on the reopening dates, saying most parents in the county are confused. By Monday, the majority of teachers in public schools had reported back, as directed by the Teachers Service Commission.
