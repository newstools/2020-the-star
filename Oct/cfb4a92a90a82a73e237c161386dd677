Quack doctor James Mugo alias Mugo wa Wairimu has been slapped with a Sh1.4 million fine, failure to which he is to spend three years in jail after being found guilty of unlawfully operating a pharmacy business without being registered by the Pharmacy and Poisons Board. In her judgment delivered on Wednesday, Senior Resident Magistrate Martha Nanzushi ruled that the prosecution had proved its case against Wairimu. He was also convicted of operating a medical laboratory without registration and licence by the Kenya Medical Laboratory Practitioners and operating an unregistered medical clinic. Wairimu was also found guilty of practising as an unregistered and unlicensed medic. In 2018 he denied charges of operating a clinic, laboratory, a pharmacy and practising as a nurse without licences from relevant authorities. The nurses union distanced itself from Wairimu who for the second time was exposed operating an illegal clinic in Kayole. The Kenya National Union of Nurses secretary general Seth Panyako said Wairimu did not appear in their register. Wairimu, returned to the headlines a few years after he was charged for allegedly sedating and raping his patients at another unlicensed clinic in Githurai 44 and masquerading as a gynaecologist. Panyako called on the authorities to take stern action against the fake doctor.
