Youth from Dandora on Tuesday held a protest over a stalled stadium in the city. The over 100 youth carried light blue placards written: "President, order the completion of the stadium by December". Standing in front of the office of the Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko, the youths blew whistles as the police stood watch. 'Director General send your team to Dandora', another pink placard read glaring at the photographers that were there to witness the protest. The team was led by Dandora Ward Two Member of County Assembly Silas Matara. They were seeking the attention of Nairobi Metropolitan Services Director-General Mohammed Badi. Concern was raised over the stalled Sh350 million Dandora Stadium despite the contractor having been paid. The stadium should have been completed in July, but work stopped when it was 80 per cent done. Last Thursday, Dandora Four MCA Francis Ngesa sought to know the reason for the delay yet everything - including the allocation of funds - had been put in place. The contractor, M/S Scanjet Construction Limited, left the site in September last year. Since then, about 10 County ExecutiveÂ  Committee members and other officials have been investigated on recommendations of the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority. The PPRA questioned the tendering process and the standard of the work. Scanjet Construction had won the tender to build four stadia at Sh1.03 billion. The job was to be completed in 18 months.
