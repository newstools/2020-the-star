Churchill Show comedian YY has advised men not to send more money to women than they send to their mothers. Speaking on Bonga Na Jalas show, YY asked men to send their mothers three times the amount of money they give to women. "If you are giving a woman money, give your mother three times the amount. When I send a woman one thousand, I send my mother three thousand," he said. "Sometimes I fail to send a woman money not because I donâ€™t have, but because it will not be enough to send my mother when I multiply the amount by three." He said family is the institution that pushes him to work hard. "What makes me wake up so early is because I have a family, that is my mum, sister and brother," YY said. "I started feeding mouths immediately I got into the second year. I would study for one semester and defer for the next four semesters."
