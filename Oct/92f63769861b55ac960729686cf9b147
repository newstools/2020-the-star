Tragedy has struck the family of Lands CS Faridah Karoney after their father was hit by a boda boda rider in Kapsabet. Mzee Edward Kiprotich Karoney, 74, was knocked down while crossing the busy Kapsabet- Eldoret highway on Tuesday and was pronounced dead on arrival at the Kapsabet County Referral Hospital. Mzee Karoney had just parked his vehicle in a shade and was crossing to attend an appointment when a speeding boda boda rider knocked him to the ground. Several politicians, among them Nandi Governor Stephen Sang, went to the hospital to condole with family members. Nandi county police commander Samson Ole Kinne said the matter is being investigated. Mzee Karoney was a prominent tea farmer in Kamobo and Kaptel in Nandi. President Uhuru Kenyatta sent a message of comfort to the family.
