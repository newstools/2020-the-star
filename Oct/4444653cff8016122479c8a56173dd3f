Peter Nduati's record label Pine Creek on Saturday unveild Mugithi artiste Muringi as their new signee at The Nairobi Club. "We realised the vernacular music market is huge and the consumers have spending power, hence the reason we decided to bring Muringi on board," Nduati said. Muringi signed a two-year contract and is set to release her very first album in December. The Gītūndū-born and raised artiste said music has always been part of her life. "I have been doing covers and also been a background vocalist for several artistes. It is a nice collaboration and I believe this is the way to go. A lot of good things are coming your way and I can't wait," she said. "Yes, there are many Mugithi artistes and I believe I am the best, more reason why fans should look out for my music. My first single will be out by next month." She was propelled to stardom when a random one-minute cover of "Ndiari Rūī" (originally done by Wanganangū) got the attention of Inooro FM presenter Jeff Kuria, who shared it. The video went viral, which grew her fan base, exposed her to a wide new audience and marked her rise as a contemporary Mūgithi singer. Her wonderful covers landed on Nduati's hands. He was blown away by the level of talent, skill and understanding of art possessed by the young woman and decided to sign her.
