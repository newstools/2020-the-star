An entrepreneur, teachers and parents in Embu have disagreed on the school reopening. The businessman wants schools reopened as planned but a teachers' representative says they are not ready for the reopening. Kithinji Kiragu, who owns a primary, a secondary, and a tertiary college, supported the school reopening and closing dates as announced by Education CS George Magoha early this week. However, Kenya National Union of Teachers’ Embu branch executive secretary Josphat Kathumi and parents’ association chairman John Kathangu opposed the move. Kiragu said the government has done the right thing to reopen the schools in phases starting with Grade 4, Standard 8 and Form 4. He said the first phase will serve as a pilot because the government will know how to handle the situation once learning resumes fully. However, Kathumi and Kathangu said schools should remain closed until the Covid-19 curve flattens. Kathumi said parents are not ready with school fees and school uniforms. Kathangu said he has visited several schools and there is no social distancing as no extra infrastructures have been built.
