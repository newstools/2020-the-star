Former Kenya Sevens tactician Paul Murunga is the frontrunner for the vacant national Under-20 head coach job. Murunga, who missed out on the Shujaa head coach position recently to Innocent Simiyu, coached the Under-20 side for four years and guided the team to the Youth Olympics in China in 2015. Murunga was an assistant coach to Benjamin Ayimba when Shujaa bagged the Singapore Sevens title in 2016. He was also  part of the team which qualified for the Rio Olympics in the same year. Fourteen applicants have so far applied for the job. The position was made vacant following the elevation of Paul Odera to the Kenya Simbas coach last season. Speaking yesterday, director of rugby, Thomas Odundo, said the names will be forwarded to the National Squads Committee. Thereafter, the shortlisted candidates will be invited for interviews with the winning candidate expected to be announced next month. Odundo did not divulge names of those who have applied for the role with the deadlines having passed on Saturday. Candidates must have a World Rugby Level Two coaching certification in either Sevens or 15's rugby. The union is also looking for a Kenyan resident with a minimum of four years of experience as a rugby coach for a club or a school side with outstanding record. Kenya U-20 side will be seeking to retain Africa crown, which will be used as a yardstick for the Junior Rugby World Trophy for the second year running. The Africa tournament was earlier scheduled for this year but was shelved due to  coronavirus pandemic Odundo said the team will start training in the new year once they get the green-light from the government in strict adherence with the Covid-19 protocols. Odundo also announced that the rest of the Kenya Sevens technical bench will be announced next month.
