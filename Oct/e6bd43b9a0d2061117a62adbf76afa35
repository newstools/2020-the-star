Miracle Baby of Gengetone group Sailors says he is bringing up a baby abandoned on his doorstep. Speaking on a live session with Mpasho.co.ke, the rapper said he has taken up the responsibility of bringing up the child, who is now around seven months old. "I have many kids, four to be precise. Three are mine and one is adopted," he said. "I woke up and found him placed on a basin outside my house. I donâ€™t know the mother but there is a way he resembles me. I am not sure how old he was when he was dropped outside my door." Miracle Baby said he fasted and prayed for a woman and God gave him one. "One day I was walking from the shops and a passing car splashed water at me. So I insulted them. When the window was lowered down I started stammering and apologised as it was a lady in it. We then exchanged numbers and the rest is history." The two have not tied the knot as they are still getting to know each other.
