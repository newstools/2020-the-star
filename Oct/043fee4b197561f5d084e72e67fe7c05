BET nominee Khaligraph Jones did not know about the nomination until a friend notified him of the exciting news. Jones has been nominated for the 2020 BET Awards for Best International Flow. Speaking during an interview with Kamene Goro and Jalas, he said, "I was excited and didn't know I had been nominated until a friend tagged me on a BET post. "I checked and realised it's true. With the time and effort I have been putting, such results are expected. I am always very optimistic in most of my songs, I talk of God's miracles that might happen in the future." Jones added, "I had shared some tweets some years back on things I hope to achieve and people laughed about it. But here we are. Trust the process. I am grateful to God for where I amÂ today. "
