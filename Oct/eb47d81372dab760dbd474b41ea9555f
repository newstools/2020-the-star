The Kenya Revenue Authority has seized liquor and brewing equipment worth millions of shillings from an illegal brewery in Naivasha. Twenty workers at Rift Valley Breweries were arrested during the raid but the owner, a well-known Naivasha businessman, escaped. Tens of illegal KRA stickers and those of other liquor brands were found in the premises and taken away. Naivasha OCPD Samuel Waweru said they were looking for the trader to record a statement. “KRA conducted the raid after a tip-off from the public. They managed to arrest some suspects and recovered fake tax stickers,” he said. Meanwhile, calm has returned to Kikopey after three days of clashes in which a man died and scores of others injured. The clashes over grazing land involved farmers and pastoralists. Gilgil OCPD John Ondit said elders from the warring communities had agreed to resolve their differences. Ondit said more security officers had been dispatched to the area to keep peace and look for those involved in the violence. “We are looking for the two women injured to record statements. We have launched a manhunt for the killers,” he said. Trouble started three days ago when a group of pastoralists drove their animals into several farms in Kiamolo village and attacked two women who tried to block them. The farmers retaliated by slashing some of the animals and driving the others to Gilgil police station as they demanded the arrest of the invaders. Area MP Martha Wangari blamed some chiefs and their assistants for the clashes. Wangari said the issue of grazing land was thorny as  clashes happened every year. “We are happy that calm has returned but the killers should be arrested. The role of some chiefs should be investigated,” she said.  - mwaniki fm
