Kiambu MP Jude Njomo will on Wednesday table a motion compelling the government to pay non-teaching school workers who have not received their pay since March. Speaking at Kiambu Primary School on Tuesday, Njomo said security guards, cleaners and other non-teaching staff in public schools have undergone financial hardship since they have not been paid. “Our non-teaching staff are unable to cope with life since they have not been paid since March and it is the obligation of the government to look to their plight so that they can help in smooth running of schools as the schools do not have money to pay them,” he said. The legislator said private schools have been hard hit and are unable to continue operating since they are unable to pay their teachers and subordinate staff. “Private schools also need help so as to cope with the situation and a few have reopened but have no money to run things smoothly,” Njomo said. Kiambu subcounty director of education Roselyn Litaba said most schools do not have funds. “Some schools were using labour provided by the Kazi Mtaani because they did not have money to pay even their watchmen and as a result workers from the schools were not really motivated to do anything,” Litaba said. Litaba said that the issue of funds may cause a lot of hindrances to maintaining the standards that are required by the Covid-19 guidelines given by the ministry. She said many private schools are on their deathbed as teachers left. Class eight candidates in some of the private schools which have not reopened or are unable to open have moved to public schools.
