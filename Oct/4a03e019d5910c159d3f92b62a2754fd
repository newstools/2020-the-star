 A Meru-based Royal Media reporter was attacked by MP John Mutunga's personal assistant at an event graced by Deputy President William Ruto on Saturday. Mainda Facii of Muuga FM was roughed up and beaten by a man well known to him as he interviewed residents. The residents had asked the reporter to air grievances they wanted the area MP and DP Ruto to address at Urru Stadium in Tigania West, Meru county Facii was recording their views when the PA identified as Jacob Ngeene appeared and demanded the reporter to stop the interviews. He claimed the scribe was coaching residents to make negatives claims against the MP. Facii, who covers Tigania region, has reported the attack to the police. No action had been taken by Sunday. "He found me interviewing some women and held me by my back. He then hit me claiming I was coaching them to say No peu (clear way, a slogan used by EALA MP Mpuru Aburi). The women tried to enlighten him that I was just getting the grievances but in vain. I couldn't imagine I had aired the MP live on Radio the same day in the morning before his agent attacked me," Facii told the Star on Sunday. Meru Press Club chairman David Muchui condemned the attack and called the suspect to surrender before residents take action against him. Muchui said there was an increase in attacks from politicians aimed at intimidating journalists. He said such incidents could derail the constitutional gains for press freedom and freedom of expression. "The journalist fault was recording views that were 'negative' according to the assailant. The political goon who assaulted him is an agent of Tigania West MP. We urge the police to act with speed because it is important for the public to know that journalists operate under a code of ethics and there are clear guidelines for reporting any misconduct and abuse of their mandate," Muchui said.
