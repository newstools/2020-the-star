A murder suspect who set ablaze his wife following a domestic confrontation is being held by homicide detectives in Kericho. Robert Kipkorir Tanui was arrested on Monday night by DCI detectives based in Kericho as he tried to board a matatu to an unknown destination. Tanui is said to have on October 4 set ablaze his 34-year-old wife Emmy Chepkoech Mitei following a domestic quarrel. DCI boss George Kinoti on Tuesday said the 50-year-old suspect at Seanin village of Konoin in Bomet County attacked the victim, a deputy headteacher of a local primary school and whom he had separated with for some time forcing her back to her father's house. "Armed with a container of petrol and a matchbox, the suspect marched into the victim's house, showered the same on her before setting her ablaze and disappeared after locking the door from the outside," Kinoti said. He said neighbours who rushed in response to her screams managed to put out the fire which had extended to the rest of the house, rushing her to the hospital with severe burns which she succumbed to on October 7. "Acting on intelligence, Kericho detectives who were trailing the suspect after establishing he had a hideout within the county, netted him at Kericho-Kisumu road while boarding a matatu to an unknown destination," he said. Kinoti said the suspect is being processed for arraignment.
