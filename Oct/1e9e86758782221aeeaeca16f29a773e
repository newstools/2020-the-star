IoT Accelerator, Telenor Connexion powered by Ericsson is set to provide global connectivity to Wayout's sustainable micro-factories starting in East Africa this year. Wayout has engineered plug-and-play micro-factories for local production of clean, filtered water, with a minimal eco footprint. Powered by solar panels, the micro-factories offer an advanced water purification system. According to the United Nations, 3 in 10 people lack access to safely managed drinking water services. Wayout's local solution eliminates the unnecessary logistics of bottling and transporting pre-packaged glass or plastic bottles. Each module is fully automated and can filter 70,000 liters of water, remove up to eight tons of CO₂ and up to 200,000 plastic bottles every month. The micro-factories are managed by a smartphone application to manage operations, monitor performance, and launch autocleaning. Wayout's local operations depend on reliable global connectivity. Powered by Ericsson IoT Accelerator, Telenor Connexion will deliver the cellular IoT connectivity management services, SIM cards and all necessary agreements with local operators to provide truly global service. "Perfect drinking water should be a human right. Our idea is to make access easy and reliable,” said Ulf Stenerhag, CEO Wayout. “By leveraging spearpoint technology and robust engineering, our connected sustainable micro-factories enable infrastructure solutions and business opportunities for providing perfect drinking water locally, whilst reducing the environmental impact globally,” Ulf added. Kiva Allgood, Head of IoT, Ericsson, said, "Our technology can help solve global challenges and accelerate sustainability. Together with Telenor Connexion and Wayout, we are using our global IoT platform to deliver business and societal value and contribute to the UN's Sustainable Development Goals."
