What people say about Diamond has always given Mama Dangote pressure, his step father has said. Uncle Shamte shared this while recounting how he met Diamond's mother Sandra Kassim in France. "I think insults are the things that make her sad on social media, she feels bad and has blocked so many people, like almost 20,000," he said in an interview with Wasafi TV. Shamte said he and Sandra met in Paris, when she was collecting her bags at the airport. She was with Tiffah (Diamond and Zari's daughter). "The following day, we met at a launch where we were taking photos, and I told her that I follow her on social media a lot," he said. "It took time and she used to insist on love and truth; when you are truthful, you become her best friend."
