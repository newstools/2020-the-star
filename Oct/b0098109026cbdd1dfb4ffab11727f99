@robertomollo3  An elderly man drowned in Muche village, Homa Bay Town constituency after he was swept away by flash floods. Charles Owiti, 73, was crossing River Nyadiel after heavy rains on Saturday afternoon when he drowned. Area assistant chief Andrew Okatch said Owiti left his home for a funeral at Nyajanja village in Kochia in the neighbouring Rangwe constituency but was blocked by the rains near Rodi Kopany shopping centre. The rains were too much and Owiti decided to cancel going to the funeral and instead return home after the downpour subsided. His body was found downstream. “It was unfortunate the Mzee was swept away by floods. Owiti is among the residents who tried to cross the river after the rains subsided,” Okatch said. The administrator said the body was taken to Homa Bay County Teaching and Referral Hospital Mortuary. Officers from Rodi Kopany police post helped to retrieve the body. “Three cattle belonging to two farmers from the same village were also killed after they were swept away by floods,” Okatch said. He said the heavy rains also destroyed crops in the farms. “We’re urging our people to remain vigilant during this rainy season to avoid further loss of life,” he said.   Edited by P.O
