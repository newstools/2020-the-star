Limuru Starlets founder James Kairu is counting on the knowledge gained from a sport development program organised by Betway to improve their performance going forward. The virtual program, hosted at their home turf, was graced by Chris Barnes, a sport scientist at Uefa and Nico Labohm who serves as the technical director at Super Sport United Academy. Starlets, who are Central Region Chapa Dimba na Safaricom finalists, are built on a foundation of teaching young women life skills on how to be agents of change in their own lives and in their respective communities through sports. "We are very honoured as a team to take part in this webinar. We saw what Betway did for the previous guest team and we are grateful that they have decided to extend the opportunity to us. We have worked hard in previous tournaments and matches and we are confident the knowledge and skills we will gain from the webinar will greatly impact our growth in future matches and enable us to scale new heights in football,’’ he said. The subsequent programs are set to highlight the significance of sports science  as well as mentorship opportunity for the participating team. "It’s quite exciting to embark on the second chapter of the Betway Sports Development webinar and even more so with a women’s team. We are aware women’s sports teams do not share as many opportunities as men do and that’s part of the reason we are excited about their involvement. We encourage the Limuru Starlets to shoot for the stars and gather as much as knowledge from our panelists,” said Betway public relations executive, Karen Njerenga.
