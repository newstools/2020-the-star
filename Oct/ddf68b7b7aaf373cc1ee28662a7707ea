The Bungoma county assembly has been closed after top officials tested positive of Covid-19. Two officials are receiving treatment at the Bungoma County Referral Hospital with sources saying they have been on oxygen for the last four days . “They were checked in having tested positive for corona with difficulties in breathing , they have however been responding well to treatment, with both having been put on oxygen," said the source who works at the facility but sought anonymity. Another senior county official is said to have tested positive and has been in self-isolation for close to one week. The assembly was closed after concerns were raised that at least 11 members had been in contact with the official. Speaking to the Star on Tuesday, assembly speaker Emmanuel Situma said that it had been resolved the assembly be shut for at least two weeks to allow every member to carry out the tests. At least three MCAS have already tested positive. Situma further said the assembly will only resume after the advice of health officials and necessary measures being taken. Speaking separately, Bungoma majority leader Joseph Nyongesa wondered why county officials had not gone public with their status and continue to interact with residents. “It is very unfair for leaders to test positive and quietly go to isolation without making it public yet they had interacted with people; this will precipitate the spread ,”Nyongesa said.
