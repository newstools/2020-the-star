Robson Chinhoi of Zimbabwe and Kenya’s David Wakhu got off to a flying start as the fourth leg of the 2020/21 Safari Tour Golf Series teed off at the Par 72 Sigona Golf Club. Chinhoi shared the lead with Wakhu after both fired scintillating rounds of 3 under par 69. “My round of golf today was all good. I begun with a par hole and picked a birdie on Hole 2. This was a good start given the bad run at Vet Lab last week. I bogeyed Hole 3  then parred from Hole 4 to Hole 8. I picked my second birdie in the ninth. Back nine was great,” said Wakhu. “I parred the 10th, 11th and 12th. With my swing and shot game improving by each hole, I birdied the 13th and 14th then parred the15th and birdied from 16th  to 18th hole.” “ I’m chuffed with my performance and will be playing to maintain the tempo as the event wears on.” The duo are one stroke better of Kenyan duo of Great Rift’s Justas Madoya and Edwin Inana Asuza. Chinhoi appears to have mastered Kenyan courses with some impressive low scores since the  Road To Magical Kenya Open 2021 started in Limuru Country Club earlier in the month. The Zimbabwean showed no signs of relenting on his aggressive play. It was a bad day at the office for leading pros Rizwan Charania and Dismas Indiza who had to contend with slow starts. Indiza, who triumphed at Vet Lab last week, played 2 over par 74 to settle for T14. “I struggled quite a bit on my shot game and chips. I will now be compelled to play a good score to make the cut on Round 2,” Indiza said. Charania was also out of the top 10. After skipping Vet Lab leg, Charania shot 7 over par 79 to finish day one on a disappointing T27. The best amateur was Adel Balala of Mombasa on 1 under par and a joint 5th to boot. Notable absentee is Greg Snow who skipped Sigona due to personal reasons. Naomi Wafula played 2 o we par 74 to tie with Indiza, Jacob Okello, Andrew Chelogoi of Eldoret and Matthew Omondo of Bet Lab. Ugandan Philip Kasozi is on TO. Play resumes on Monday.
