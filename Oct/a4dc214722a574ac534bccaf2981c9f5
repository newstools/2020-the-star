According to the officer on duty, the accident occurred at around 5am at Brookside drive in Westlands. "He was knocked from behind by a speeding matatu at around 5:00 am. The victim got minor injuries and he was taken to Aga Khan University Hospital for a checkup," the officer told the Star. Kiss FM presenter Jalang'o during his morning show said he took his colleague Mulee for the medical checkup. Narrating how he learnt of Mulee's accident, Jalas said he was chased by a guy on a boda boda yelling his name before letting him know that it was his colleague who was involved in an accident "So straight back mbio! Upon arriving at the scene Ghost Mulee's car was badly hit and it is a write off," narrated Jalang'o. "His car hit a city clock right on the driver's side. So I just had to take Ghost to the hospital. He has been admitted at the Aga Khan, that is why I was late. Lakini atakuwa sawa." Ghost is currently stable and doing fine. "I’ve done tests after today's accident and I've been cleared by the doctors. I take this opportunity to thank everyone who wished me a quick recovery. God is good all the time," Mulee said.
