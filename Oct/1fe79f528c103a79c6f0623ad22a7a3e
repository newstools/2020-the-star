A new ICT hub at the Voi Public Library in Taita Taveta county will help hundreds of jobless youths access online jobs, MP Johnes Mlowa has said. The NG-CDF-funded centre will serve over 5,000 youths across the subcounty. Beside the hub, Mlolwa launched the Ajira Digital Programme to equip the youth with digital skills. He said the Voi NG-CDF has used over Sh1.3 million to purchase computers for the hub and instal high-speed internet to boost the programme. The programme, he said, will enable youth from the constituency to access online training and tap online job opportunities from both the government and private sector. “There are thousands of online jobs that can be accessed online. This programme will open up a lot of opportunities for jobless people in this area,” the MP said. “The hub shall be a game changer for people who want to do online research and study,” he added. Woman Representative Lydia Haika, who also graced the event, praised the NG-CDF team for setting up the unique hub, noting that it would cut the high cost of accessing cybercafés. Librarian in charge Michael Kazungu urged students to utilise the facility for their learning purposes, noting that more revision materials had been loaded into digital gadgets. During the launch, the two leaders also issued Uwezo Fund cheques worth Sh5 million to over 20 women and youth groups drawn from six wards within Voi Subcounty. They decried the lack of youth groups in applying for the loans, asking more groups to apply for the money. Edited by A.N
