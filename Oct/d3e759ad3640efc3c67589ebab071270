The Kenya Revenue Authority on Friday impounded more than 1,600 cartons of alcoholic products bearing fake excise stamps. This was following a sting operation conducted by the commission in conjunction with the multi-agency team charged with combating illicit trade. In a statement by the new Commissioner for domestic tax Rispah Simiyu, the products valued at Sh12 million, were seized at a Thika-based plant in Kiambu County. The products branded Fiesta Special Ice, were packed in 10-liter bottles. "Earlier in the week, the multi-agency team had received intelligence alert that a six-wheeler lorry was ferrying spirituous drinks affixed with suspected fake excise stamps. The lorry was intercepted and upon verification, it was confirmed that indeed the products were bearing counterfeit excise stamps," the commissioner said. He said the lorry was driven to the factory alleged to be manufacturing the drinks where more casks were seized with counterfeit excise stamps. "A verification exercise was carried out at the factory where it was established that the manufacturer runs two parallel production lines. One of the production lines had KRA excise licenses while the other was concealed in an adjacent building and was operating without an excise license," she said. He said so far the teams have seized the counterfeit products and secured the company as further investigation get underway. "KRA calls upon wholesalers, stockiest and retailers of excisable goods to ensure that the products they are dealing in are affixed with genuine excise stamps. In addition, members of the public are urged to shun consuming counterfeit excise products and report suspicions on the same to the relevant authorities," she said. He said, as a result, the team will continue with the operations countrywide to ensure that illicit trade is eliminated.
