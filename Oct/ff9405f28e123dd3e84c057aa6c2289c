Godwins Agutu who was one of the alleged whistleblowers in the Covid-19 Millionaires expos√© has been charged with several counts of fraud. Godwins Agutu the CEO of Network Action Against Corruption was charged alongside his driver Alex Mutuku and Personal Assistant Ken Kimathi. It is alleged that on September 25 at Hytech Investment Shop along Kombo Munyiri road with intent to defraud falsely presented themselves as KRA employees to Vijay Patel the Proprietor of the shop. They also denied abducting Patel with the intent of confining him. They were charged with a third count of obtaining Sh500,000 from Patel by falsely pretending that they were in a position to assist him to reduce the tax he owes to KRA. Police further alleged that Agutu forged a KRA staff card and a work ticket number for an official government vehicle registration number GKB 070B. Agutu is also accused of stealing a car number plate valued at Sh 7,000. He also denied converting a personal car into a Government vehicle. The prosecution has opposed their release on bail arguing that they are likely to interfere with witnesses if released. "The vehicle the respondents were using purported to be a GK motor vehicle is untrue and the investigators have so far established that the said number plate belongs to the Judiciary a Range Rover and the initial number of the motor vehicle in question is KCV 788Y belonging to view Cape Tours and Car Hire and hence if they are released they are likely to interfere with investigations to unearth how the said GK number plate was obtained and fitted in a civilian motor vehicle," the court was told. The prosecution has asked the court to deny them bail. However, Agutu through his lawyers pleaded with the court to grant him reasonable bail terms. Agutu says he is ready and willing to abide by all conditions set by the court for his release.
