Schools in the country are set to reopen on October 12 for Grade 4, Class 8 and Form 4 students, Education CS George Magoha has announced. In a statement on Tuesday, Magoha said the schools will close on December 23, 2020, for a one week break. This means that they will open schools on January 4, 2021, up to March 19, 2021. Magoha said that KCPE will start on March 22, 2021, and end on March 24, 2021. KCSE exams will start on March 25, 2021, and end on April 16, 2021. Marking of the KCSE exams will be for three weeks from April 19 to May 7, 2021. The CS said all students must adhere to the mandatory use of facemasks and monitoring of body temperatures. "Where there is no running water, the school will use hand sanitiser," the statement from the CS read. "Although physical distancing remains a challenge, it should not be used as a bottleneck excuse to deny any child away from school." Magoha said all teachers should continue offering psychosocial and spiritual support to the students. Final year students will resume classes after the Education CS directed a section of universities and colleges to reopen on October 5 as part of a progressive resumption of learning. The CS said those due to sit examinations in Teachers Training Colleges, as well as TVET institutions, will report on Monday next week. He said the boards of TTCs and TVETS will announce the resumption dates of in-person learning for other classes with priority being accorded to students who are undertaking practical courses. Final year students in all the universities and their constituents colleges will also report on Monday.
