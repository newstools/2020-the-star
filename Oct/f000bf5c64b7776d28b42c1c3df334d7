The ongoing protests in Nigeria have caught the attention of the International Criminal Court. On Thursday, ICC Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said that her office has been closely following the developing events around the current protests in the largest African county. “My office has been closely following the events around the current protests in Nigeria and the reaction of Nigeria’s law enforcement and security agencies,” Bensouda said. She said that any loss of life and injury is concerning. “We have received information alleging crimes and are keeping a close eye on developments, in case violence escalates and any indications arise that Rome Statute crimes may have been committed.” Bensouda has also called for calm in Nigeria. Nigerians have been protesting against the disbanded police unit Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) which led to several deaths and injuries. UN secretary general Antonio Guterres also condemned the killing of innocent protestors who are exercising their rights. Guterres said that police brutality and abuse should stop. African Union Commission Moussa Faki also condemned the ongoing events, calling all political and social actors to reject the use of violence and respect human rights and the rule of law. Faki further urged all parties to prioritise dialogue in order to de-escalate the situation and find concrete and durable reforms.
