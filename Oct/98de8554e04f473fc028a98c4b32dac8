Diamond Platnumz's mother Sandra Kassim has begged her son to get married before she dies. Sandra was speaking in an interview with Wasafi Media, adding that she wishes he gets a responsible wife who can take care of family. "I pray my son respects everyone and helps people," she said. "What I pray most is that my son gets a woman so that he gets married. I want him to marry a woman who takes care of the family. A good wife. I really pray for him to marry before I die." Diamond has in the past been in romantic relationships with Zari Hassan, Hamisa Mobetto, Wema Sepetu and Tanasha Donna. He married Zari and announced he was going to get married to Tanasha, only for both relationships to end in scandals amid infidelity claims.
