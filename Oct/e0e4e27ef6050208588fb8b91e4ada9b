More than 830 girls in Nyandarua may not go back to school after fell they pregnant, a report by county administration shows. Nyandarua Governor Francis Kimemia said the report by the Education executive indicates that these children were impregnated by irresponsible men. Kimemia said in Ol kalou on Saturday that his administration will join hands with the county commissioner to find the culprits and bring them to justice. The culprits, he said, must not be left to walk away scot-free as the teenagers shoulder the burden. Sexual acts with children, he said, amount defilement, hence perpetrators must be arrested and arraigned just like any other criminal and be punished. “We cannot just sit and watch as the cases of child pregnancy escalate without doing anything to secure our children’s future,” he said. He said all the pregnant girls in the county must be assisted to go back to school and continue with their education after they deliver. Kimemia further urged all the governors in the country to deal ruthlessly with men who impregnate school girls and those who supply drugs to the youth. This is the only way to secure the future of counties and the country, he said. That schools have been closed for many months due to Covid-19 pandemic, he said, is not an excuse for irresponsible members of the society to prey on school-going children. Kimemia further urged the residents to continue observing the preventive measures against Covid-19 to keep themselves and their loved ones safe. He regretted that as the number of positive cases in the county appears to be skyrocketing again, most Kenyans take it as a joke and have thrown all caution to the wind. “Those who have not been infected yet can get infected while those who recovered can be infected again. We don’t want a situation where the president might be forced to lock down the country again,” he said.
