Socialite Amberay and Vera Sidika's 'husbae' Brown Mauzo are no longer an item. In a Q&A with her followers on Instagram, while responding to a fan who asked about her relationship with Mauzo, she said "life happens". "He is happy, I am happy," Amberay wrote. "I think I’m ready to f**k the same guy in different hotels in different countries for the rest of my life." Mauzo had earlier confirmed he and Ray were an item. "Love you like a fat kid loves cake," Mauzo said. To which Ray responded, "Thank you for loving me, I love you more, honey." Brown Mauzo is currently dating Vera Sidika. Vera recently announced she is married to Mauzo with a photo of both of them. "I got married to my best friend. I love you so much my Husband @brownmauzo254," she wrote. During her birthday before, Vera also shared on Instagram that she had engaged Mauzo, who also said he had found himself falling deeper and deeper in love with her as his fiancé. "Sometimes, when I think about you, I cannot stop thinking about our future, too. I was right about you all the time. A sweet, loving, caring and responsible lady. All I ever dreamed of," he wrote. She, however, did not reveal when she got married. Neither did she share photos from the alleged wedding.
