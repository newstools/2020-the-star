Ten MPs from the Mt Kenya region held a day-long meeting with former Agriculture CS Mwangi Kiunjuri to discuss 2022 politics. The meeting was held at The Service Party leader's Nanyuki residence. Some legislators, most of whom are allied to Deputy President William Ruto, termed the meeting a 'goat eating event with a friend'. Others said they went to seek Kiunjuri's guidance on politics. Laikipia West MP Patrick Mariru and Nyeri Woman Representative Rahab Mukami said Kiunjuri has over 20 years of political experience and is better positioned to guide them. “The main agenda of the meeting was not about the new TSP Party but seeking advice on the way forward during the next general election,” Mariru, the former Laikipia assembly speaker, said. Mukami said every leader in Mt Kenya region is at liberty to hold meetings with  friends and that is what they went to Nanyuki to do. The legislator, however, said they were still members of Jubilee and they were not planning any coup against the Deputy President. Kiunjuri said he has over 30 sitting MPs who are his close friends and hosting a party for them was normal. The former CS was fired after showing strong support for the DP and even rallying members of Parliament from Mt Kenya region to show their support for Ruto. After he was sacked, he formed The Service Party and is now in active politics as the race to succeed President Uhuru Kenyatta as Mt Kenya region kingpin gains momentum. Kiunjuri is touted as Deputy President Ruto’s running mate in the 2022 presidential race.
