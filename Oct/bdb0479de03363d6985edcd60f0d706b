Kwale governor's wife Christine Mvurya on Saturday urged residents to stop associating cancer with witchcraft. She told residents to go for early cancer screening as one way of cutting the number of deaths caused by the disease. According to the county health records, Kwale recorded over 250 cancer cases this year. "We should go for regular screening to stand a chance of winning this war," Christine said. She spoke in Ukunda while marking the cancer awareness month in Kwale. She was accompanied by Deputy Governor Fatuma Achani and Makueni governor's wife Nazi Kivutha. On Friday the cancer ceremony was graced by the County First Ladies Association members Maria Mbeneka (Laikipia) and Stellah Samboja (Taita Taveta) at Kizibe Primary School in Matuga subcounty. The event was sponsored by the Base Titanium in partnership with the Fanikisha Foundation, Beyond Zero Initiative and the county government. Abigail Kinyua, a breast cancer survivor living in Ukunda, urged the county government and well-wishers to support people battling the disease. She said the treatment is very expensive and only a few can afford the medical expenses.
