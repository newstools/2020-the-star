After dominating the fourth leg of the 2020/21 Safari Tour at Sigona Golf Club, winner David Wakhu is now targeting to dislodge Greg Snow from the top of the log. Wakhu won his first Safari Tour title after a two-year hiatus at Sigona and says this has given him the opportunity to ‘press the reset button’. Snow, despite skipping the round in Sigona leg due to personal reasons, currently leads the Tour log on 194.8 points followed by Indiza on 182.0 points. Thika’s Simon Ngige is third on 178.2 followed by David Wakhu on 158.2 and Erick Ooko on 140.7. Wakhu noted that he is now hungrier for success and looking forward to maintaining the highest level of playing standards as the ‘Road to Kenya Open’ event gains momentum. “My golf has been affected by injuries for the few years and I have not been able to give it my best shot. So winning Sigona leg has restored my confidence to stay focused and target more wins. I want to give it my all and see how it goes,” Wakhu said. He said the victory at Sigona is also a welcome relief after struggling with prolonged heel and elbow injuries. The highest ranked eight Kenyan pros and their two regional counterparts will gain qualification to the Magical Kenya Open 2021 which returns to the European Tour for the umpteenth time. The first four tour events have produced different winners in Greg Snow (Limuru), Robson Chinhoi (Royal) Dismas Indiza (Vet Lab) and Wakhu (Sigona). This year’s Safari Tour is a lot more competitive compared to previous years with the points system being the main difference. This year unlike the previous years, organisers are taking into account the points from the other two seasons as well; 10 percent from Season 1, 20 per cent from season 2 and 70 per cent from 2020/21 season. Outside the Kenyan borders, there will be two other events in Uganda and Rwanda .  TOUR LOG AFTER SIGONA 1. Greg Snow 194.8 2. Dismas Indiza 182.0 3. Simon Ngige  178.2 4. David Wakhu  158.2 5.
