Sofapaka have appointed former skipper George Maelo as their head of security following his decision to retire from football. “Captain Maelo has officially retired from active football. Maelo has finally called it a day from football after 17 years in the game. Maelo joined the club from Police FC in July 2016 and went on to serve the club for four years,” the Kenyan Premier league side confirmed the decision on their official portal. On quitting, Maelo said: “I’m so happy and proud of what God has done to me with my talent. All the years of my career, I didn’t encounter any serious injury and when fully fit. I managed to play a junk of the matches and as a leader, I did my best on and off the pitch for the betterment of the team.” “Football has built me as a person and taught me a lot about life. At Sofapaka, I found a second family where unity and love prevailed. The club forms and holds a huge part of me. The trust from the management and everyone in the team meant a lot. I love Sofapaka family and I wish the team the very best.” On his part, coach John Baraza lauded the defender for his leadership and commitment and wished him well in his future endeavours. “Maelo has been outstanding since he joined us. He came in when we were battling relegation and during our tough times as a team, he did a lot in supporting the club,” Baraza said. “He’s so selfless, hardworking and disciplined. He made work easier for us as a technical bench. He’s definitely headed for greatness in life and as a team, we wish him success. As a way of appreciating his good deeds, the club has appointed Maelo as head of security.” His decision to quit comes just a day after the club confirmed Elli Asieche as the captain for the forthcoming 2020/21 FKF Premier League campaign. He will be assisted by Willis Obayi and new signing Michael Kibwage.
