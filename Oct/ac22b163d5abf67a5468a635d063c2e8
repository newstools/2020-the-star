A man killed himself in Namarambi village of Webuye East constituency after attacking and injuring his wife following an argument. Maurice Natembeya hanged himself after inflicting serious injuries on his wife Caro Natembeya. The woman is recuperating at Webuye hospital. Neighbours told the Star that the middle-aged couple has been having domestic squabbles for a while, with local administrators intervening in vain. Natembeya's brother Martin Kapilo told the Star that the incident happened in the evening when they had gone to their houses to rest. “We were attracted by the screams by our sister-in-law. When we came here we found her in pain as our brother's body hang in his house,” Kapilo said. He said the couple has had problems for some time. In June, he said, Natembeya attacked and injured his wife but he evaded police arrest by hiding in a sugar cane plantation. “I have been advising my brother to stop such bad habits of manhandling and harassing his wife but he has never taken it seriously. See what has happened now. It is a shameful act,” Kapilo said. He said the widow was receiving medication at Webuye County Hospital, where she is being treated for injuries on the neck, head and back. Assistant chief Douglas Wanyonyi condemned the incident. He called on couples to report any cases of violence to administrators. "Committing suicide is not a solution to this. Let us work closely with local administration and solve such matters," he said. The body is lying at Webuye mortuary.
