The Kwale government has allocated Sh307 million to 600 farmers' groups to improve food security. Governor Salim Mvurya said on Friday the money will ensure farming becomes successful and steady growth is achieved. “The funds will support the targeted groups to realise goals of boosting crop growing and other income-generating undertakings," he said. He said Sh127 million already has been disbursed to 365 farming groups. He spoke at Kwale the Cultural Centre in Matuga where he presided over a Farmers’ Field Officers graduation ceremony. About 82 field officers and 22 county faacilitators graduated. The farmers were trained under the National Agricultural and Rural Inclusive Project implemented in 21 counties. They are trained to train farmers. The programme is designed to equip farmers with basic knowledge of how to increase food production and improve livelihoods. In Kwale it focuses on beekeeping, dairy farming and growing tomatoes and green grams. Mvurya said graduates will train other farmers in crop management, livestock keeping and producing high-yield crops at good market prices. The county chief said he had faith in the trained farmers to train others. He warned he would punish lazy agricultural officers whose actions and inaction jeopardise food production. “Last time, farmers were given one-day-old chicks and unfortunately they all died. But with your expertise and knowledge given today, that should not happen again,” the governor said. He said the county had distributed dairy cows and asked officers to ensure they are in good health and produce enough milk. (Edited by V. Graham)
