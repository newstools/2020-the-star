 Women and youth agribusinesses in Kiambu are to benefit from a Sh2 billion Danish and European Union funding. “We have been given money by the EU to uplift Kiambu people in agribusiness. We have realised that agriculture is empowering people financially and that is why we need to help with finances,” Kenya Climate Innovation Centre Chief executive officer Edward Mungai said. Mungai spoke on Thursday during the signing of a memorandum of understanding with Governor James Nyoro. The MoU creates a platform to empower women and youths in agribusiness. Mungai said the KCIC will be looking for innovations and asked funding applicants to submit their ideas for approval within 45 days. A business incubation hub will be established under the five-year programme at the Waruhiu Agriculture Training Centre in Githunguri. The hub will be operational before the end of next month. Nyoro said the county government has prioritised agriculture as the enabler of empowerment and invited investors interested in the achievement of food security. “We have put close to Sh1.2 billion for agriculture in the supplementary budget for consideration by the assembly. "We are also in talks with the Rockefeller Foundation to develop smart market for farm produce trade in Kiambu county,” the governor said. Similar programmes have been rolled out in eight other counties and the county with best innovations will be rewarded.  - mwaniki fm
