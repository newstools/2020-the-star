Kenyan Dismas Indiza believes he has what it takes to seal the deal at the Vet Lab Safari Tour leg which culminates this afternoon. The Mumias long-hitter nevertheless promised not to rest on his laurels. Indiza unlocked his insatiable appetite for success when he led Monday’s round two proceedings by an impressive six strokes. He played a round of 1 over par 73 on Tuesday to set a platform for a battle royale with Zimbabwean Robson Chinhoi on 1 undermost par 215 while Greg Snow is third on 1 over par 217. “Golf is a very unpredictable game. When you think you are at it, something unexpected happens. So it’s a matter of playing safe,” Indiza explained. And asked why he played 1 over on Tuesday, Indiza blamed it on the three bogeys he picked on the 1st, 3rd and 6th. “My driver was my downside today (Tuesday). Putting and chipping wasn’t spot on but again you live to fight another day,” he said. Royal Nairobi Safari Tour winner Chinhoi has had a tendency of starting badly and playing catch up in the latter stages. “I will also be watching Chinhoi tomorrow (today). He is such an unpredictable player,” said Indiza, who savoured sinking four birdies on the 4th, 5th, 16th and 18th before parring the rest. Vet Lab leg hasn’t been that kind to the amateurs as most failed to make the cut. The event is being used as a yardstick to ascertain regional representatives to the European Tour Kenya Open Championship which will be held next year at Karen Country Club. The 2020 Magical Kenya Open was cancelled and as a result, the organisers, Kenya Open Golf Limited (KOGL) started a new season with qualifying scores. They are however taking 10 per cent of 2018-2019 scores and 20 per cent of the 2019-2020 and 70 per cent of 2020-2021 scores to determine Kenya open qualifiers. Play resumes today with the last round. Day 3 Leaderboard 1.
