Nyandarua county will soon sign a memorandum of understanding with the Republic of South Korea in a partnership meant to improve health services. Governor Francis Kimemia on Tuesday said the areas of cooperation will include assistance in equipping the recently-completed ICU ward at J.M. Kariuki Memorial Hospital and equipping of a cancer centre that will be built in collaboration with Kenyatta University Teaching and Referral Hospital. Other areas are equipping of a 200-to-300-bed capacity unit that the county plans to build at J.M. Kariuki Memorial Hospital, a disease control centre at Mirangine and training of medics. “The cancer centre we are building here will be fully equipped and will serve the entire Central Kenya region and beyond,” Kimemia said. The Nyandarua county boss spoke at J.M. Kariuki hospital where he received personal protective equipment donated by South Korean ambassador Yeong Han Choi, who toured the facility. The equipment will boost the war on Covid-19 in Nyandarua, where 78 people —31 women and 47 men — have so far contracted the virus. Some 61 recoveries and two deaths have been registered. Kimemia said South Korea has so far donated two ultrasound machines to the memorial hospital's ICU, with more expected to come in the near future. “Today marks the beginning of our cooperation. Earlier on, we visited the ambassador in his Nairobi office where we agreed on assistance to deal especially with the cancer issue as they have adequate technology. We have formulated the proposal and an MoU will be signed soon,” he said. Kimemia urged residents to continue observing anti-Covid-19 protocols, regretting that despite the recent surge in cases, most residents remain reckless.
