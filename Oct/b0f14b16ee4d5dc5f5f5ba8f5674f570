Gospel singer Smith Mwatia, alias Rufftone, has confirmed his interest in joining politics come 2022. Speaking to Word Is, the Mungu Baba hitmaker said that after being in the music industry for over 20 years, he has realised that it is always good to lead from the front. "There are some things that need to be implemented when one is in that office," he said. "You need to implement some things as a legislator and not a victim because if you are a victim from outside, you are limited. If you are a victim from within, you know where it bites the most and so it is easier to implement. "This is our time as young people to come out and start leading from the front." Rufftone said he has gotten so many invites to vie for a political seat from voters in Nairobi and some from his hometown in Western Kenya. "Iâ€™m really under pressure to vie in the coming elections. I have been praying a lot and I have come up with a decision to go for it," he said. About the position, Rufftone said he has to sit down with his committee and be sure about it. "I will, however, not be vying for MP. In the near future I will announce the position, constituency and the political party that I am in," he said. Rufftone said he is looking for a bracket solution to the challenges facing young people. "I will also focus on empowerment, which will help the young people to have long-term solutions to their grievances." Rufftone and President Uhuru Kenyatta have been friends and even when the singer announced he was marrying Krystal, the President and the First Lady Margaret Kenyatta were glad to sponsor their wedding in July 2014. "I am still a very good friend to the President and Deputy William Ruto," he said. Edited by T Jalio
