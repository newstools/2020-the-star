Bungoma prison has been closed after 118 inmates tested positive for Covid-19 positive. County Health and Sanitation executive Antony Walela declared the correction facility the epicentre of the coronavirus after a 10th of its  inmates tested positive and ordered its closure. The prison has between 900 and 1,000 inmates. Those positive have been secluded for monitoring by public health officers. Walela said five of the prisoners were asymptomatic. "We have closed the correction facility. No inmate or worker will be allowed to enter or leave. We are not allowing them to interact with other people to help minimise spreading Covid-19." The medic said nine of the 118 prisoners were remandees and had been released on bond where they are interacting with families, friends and relatives. "We have dispatched our officers to do contact tracing for the nine remandees who were released from the correction facility on bond. We are sure of arresting and taking them to Webuye Isolation Centre," he said. Walela said five men and three women who had tested positive are already at Webuye Isolation Centre. "So far we have tested 184 people who turned positive. The ministry has said the county is likely to record 520 positive cases," said Walela. "Let's observe all the health protocols; stop shaking hands. The second wave of Covid-19 is likely to be more dangerous," he said and regretted that people have gone back to normal life. He counselled that everybody should observe all Health ministry's anti-coronavirus protocols.  - mwaniki fm
