Manchester United vs Tottenham 04.10.2020 18:30  Manchester United and Tottenham go head to head at Old Trafford in what is expected to be very entertaining game. Jose Mourinho once again faces his old club, but this time out he will have to do it without Korea international Heung-min Son, who suffered an injury in an unlucky draw with Newcastle United. Tottenham are still waiting for Gareth Bale to regain full fitness after a knee injury, while Son is unlikely to play Sunday but Mourinho was unwilling to completely rule the South Korean out. The Reds Devils, on the other hand, came from behind to beat Brighton on the road in their last league fixture. They will aim to keep on climbing the standings. Phil Jones and Axel Tuanzebe are sidelined with injury for the hosts, but Norwegian manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer can count on key players for the Old Trafford outfit. Tottenham seem the superior team in all competitions so far, though United stars are yet to really fire on all cylinders aside from Bruno Fernandes. The variables for this weekend, however, favour United. Spurs will have played Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday while United played Saturday and Tuesday. Son’s absence might tilt the scales from a draw to a United Win.

They have won only two of their previous five fixtures in the competition. Each one of those fixtures had over 1.5 goals, and interestingly, three of the matches saw two plus goals before half-time.  Crystal Palace suffered their first defeat of the season last week against Everton, making it just one clean sheet in 11 Premier League matches. Notably, they have conceded eight of their previous 13 Premier League goals in the first half, including last weekend. At the other end of the pitch, goals don’t tend to come in sets, as Palace have scored over 2.5 in just one of their previous 41 PL fixtures. On the subject of goals, the ‘Eagles’ also finished the last campaign failing to score any in their final four away matches. They look sharper this season though, especially in the early stages, and have scored three goals before the 30th minute so far. Remarkably, that is already just one fewer than their total for this period last season.

Leeds have averaged 55.33% possession from their first three PL matches, additionally being shown fewer yellow cards than their opponents in each of that trio. The ‘Peacocks’ followed up a run of eight home league matches unbeaten from last season by winning their first PL home match after a 16-year hiatus. Their average conceded goals tally across those nine matches is 0.44 per match, while four of Leeds last five league matches played anywhere have seen over 3.5 total goals scored. Manchester City have seen the same ‘Over 3.5’ result in both of their PL matches this season. City were also the top side for this metric last season, with 52.63% of their matches producing over 3.5 total goals. Notably, they averaged 3.53 total goals away from home last season in the PL. If City do win, they usually do it in style, having covered a -1.5 handicap in 21 of their previous 27 Premier League wins. Furthermore, six of their previous eight wins have seen them cover a -3.5 handicap. Of those six victories, five saw them score at least two goals in both halves!
