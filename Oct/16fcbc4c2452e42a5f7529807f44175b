After receiving a major boost of a bus and Sh6 million, National Super League side Shabana FC are seeking to hire an experienced head coach. The club is also looking for a goalkeeping coach, according to the club’s president Jared Nivaton. He said the bus and Sh6 million from President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga will boost the club’s chances of returning to the Kenya Premier League. President Uhuru gave Sh5 million while Raila topped up with Sh1 million at State Lodge in Kisii on October 21. Nivaton thanked President Uhuru and Raila for the donations. The club is also expected to sign a sponsorship deal with Jambo Bet  firm. Nivaton said they have agreed with the firm and they are only waiting to put pen to paper. He said the club has already received a number of applications and the candidates will be interviewed next week. The new coach will replace former defender Vincent Nyaberi who has been in acting capacity since former coach Andrew Kanuli left in a huff while the goalkeeper coach will take over from Joel Atuti who left to join Silibwet FC. “As per FKF requirements, an NSL club must have at least Caf license. We want to fulfil those requirements. We want a coach who can guide the team to the KPL in the 2021/22 season,” noted Nivaton. The club he added will sign six players with Kenya Premier League experience. “We have more than 30 players in camp most of them young. Once we hire the head coach, he will have a free hand in signing players,” added Nivaton. The team is currently training at Cardinal Otunga High School Mosocho. Meanwhile, Shabana, popularly known as Glamour Boys, will play a pre-season friendly against Nicholas Muyoti’s Kakamega Homeboyz at Gusii Stadium on a date to be announced later. Kakamega Homeboyz chairman Cleophas Shimanyula also promised to give Shabana a set of uniforms and five balls after beating AFC Leopards 1-0 to lift Mashujaa Day Cup at Gusii Stadium last weekend.
