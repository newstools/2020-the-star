The Independent Electoral and Boundary Commission wants the CEO position to be separate from that of the accounting officer. In a report which is now before Parliament, the electoral agency recommends that the roles should be delineated and not held by one person. To achieve this, IEBC will have to create a new office which will be performed by the accounting officer leaving out other functions to the CEO. "To separate the roles of the Commission Secretary/CEO from those of the Accounting Officer. This would leave the Secretary/CEO free to attend to matters of the Commission while the other officer (probably to be designated Chief Operations Officer) shall be the Accounting Officer," IEBC said in a report released on Wednesday. The commission currently has a CEO - Marjan Hussein - who has been working in an acting capacity. The High Court temporarily stopped recruitment of a new CEO in June last year, following a petition challenging the process. The position was left vacant after the commission sacked former CEO Ezra Chiloba who had been on suspension since April 2018. Justice Byrum Ongaya barred IEBC from carrying out any interviews of the 10 Â shortlisted candidates from a list of 97 applicants. Meanwhile, the report titled Electoral law Reform Report in Kenya: The IEBC Experience, the commission recommended a series of legal reforms including introduction of a new section to the Leadership and Integrity Act to establish the IEBC as the agency responsible with respect to integrity issues in election matters. IEBC further recommended that that commission should solely be responsible for administering self declaration forms for election purposes. "This amendment would assist in the vetting process of candidates for elective political positions to ensure compliance with the Leadership and Integrity Act and Chapter 6 31 of the Constitution."
