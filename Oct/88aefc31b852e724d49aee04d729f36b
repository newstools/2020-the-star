Gospel musician Size 8 has embarked on a three day fast and prayer over the recent troubles that have rocked her marriage. This comes days after infidelity rumours surfaced against her husband DJ Mo with his alleged side chick coming out with fresh details. DJ Mo has since dismissed the rumours. "Its time to put the full amour of God it is battle time. On my knees I've gone to pray and started a three day fast for my marriage and family I know I shall see the salvation of the Lord in my home," the Mateke hitmaker posted on her Instagram page on Thursday. Margaret Wanyama had shared her alleged intimate chats and moments with DJ Mo with blogger Edgar Obare. While neither confirming nor denying the rumours, Size 8 said: "Only God knows the whole truth and we cannot reverse what has been said." "I've been angry and sad handling things physically but that stage is over." On his Facebook page, DJ Mo shared a photo of himself on Wednesday, which he captioned, "Watu wangu, everything is possible." Fans flocked to the comment section, asking him to comment on the allegations. He responded, saying, "Don't believe what you see yet, soon..." It is also alleged that Size 8 and her two children have been living at a city hotel without her husband.
