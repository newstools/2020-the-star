ODM leader Raila Odinga on Saturday hosted hundreds of elders from the Kikuyu community at his Bondo home in Siaya. The elders and senior politicians from President Uhuru Kenyatta’s Mt Kenya backyard are expected to endorse the former Prime Minister for President in 2020. Raila, who skipped the National prayers at State House to host the elders, took to Twitter on Saturday and posted photos the large crowd that has convened at his home —popularly known as Kango Kajaramogi. In the photos, the elders are dressed in their traditional attire, signifying the importance of the trip. “Muhammad Ali told us “Friendship is the hardest thing in the world to explain. It’s not something you learn in school. But if you haven’t learned the meaning of friendship, you really haven’t learned anything,” Raila posted. “We are seeing what Ali meant as Mama Ida and I host Mt Kenya elders,” he added. In the photos, MP Maina Kamanda and former Gatanga legislator Peter Kenneth are seen leading the team. Raila’s elder brother Oburu Oginga, governors Cyprian Awiti and Kenneth are among the leaders occupying the front row. Last Thursday, the Star exclusively reported that about the meeting –  the first of its kind since Independence. The Luos and the Kikuyus have been the strongest antagonists in most post-Independence elections. However, the two communities worked together at two critical historical moments — at Independence when Jomo Kenyatta became the first president — and in 2002 when Kenyans ended Kanu’s 24-year rule through the election of Mwai Kibaki. After the Bondo meeting, the Luo elders and select political leaders will also be hosted for the second part of the meeting in Nyeri County on October 30.
