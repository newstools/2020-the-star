A commercial court has dismissed a case in which businessman Paul Kobia was challenging closure of his accounts for failing to disclose his source of money. Justice Wilfrida Okwany on Tuesday said Kobia did not discharge the burden of proof so as to have the court grant the orders sought. Kobia sought to have the court allow him access his funds and prevent CBK from closing his accounts. He also sought to have the court declare as unlawful the regulations by CBK requiring full disclosure and proof of sources of income. Kobia cited a letter in which Barclays stated it had ceased offering him investment following a "review of their business". It was that letter that triggered the case in court. But Okwany said Kobia's case lacked merit. She said a look at the letter that triggered the case does not make any reference to CBK regulations as alleged by Kobia.
