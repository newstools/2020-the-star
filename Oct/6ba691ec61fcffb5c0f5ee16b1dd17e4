More than 200,000 washable masks donated by US Marines in Lamu two weeks ago will be distributed to learners who are back in school. The marines are based at Camp Simba, at the Manda Naval Base in Lamu West. The face masks were made in Kenya. Speaking in Lamu town on Friday, county commissioner Irungu Macharia said many parents are not in a position to buy all the Covid-19 gears for their children and the masks will be of great help. They will also enable 100 percent turnout in schools, he said. “The masks will go to our children as they head back to school. We are putting all efforts into ensuring that the learners are safe at school. By pitching in like this, we also want to ensure 100 percent reporting of learners to their schools,” Macharia said. The commissioner urged parents to send their children back to school, saying the government had taken all measures to ensure their safety amid the Covid-19 pandemic. He said Lamu’s response in tackling the virus has been fruitful with the county registering very few positive cases and deaths. Meanwhile, parents in Lamu have urged the national government to improve infrastructure in schools to guarantee their children's safety. Many schools in remote villages have few classrooms, which makes social distancing a challenge. Edited by Josephine M. Mayuya
