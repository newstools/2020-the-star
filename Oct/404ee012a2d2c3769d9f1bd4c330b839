The Garissa county government is renewing its strategy aimed at reducing maternal and infant mortality rates. Health executive Ahmed Omar said among the new approaches is prioritising child spacing to boost the immunity of the mother and the child. Omar said the new strategy has started bearing fruit. "Our antenatal attendance has risen from 75 per cent to 78 per cent. All this has been brought about by teamwork and commitment by our health workers," he added. Omar called for natural child spacing methods that involve counting cycle beads to determine a woman's fertile days. He, however, urged parents to seek the right information that will enable them to make healthy and informed decisions. Amref technical officer Lilian Maroko urged lactating mothers to breastfeed their newborns for at least two years to improve their health and immunity. "Although child spacing is important, it's equally important to breastfeed your child for two years," she said.
