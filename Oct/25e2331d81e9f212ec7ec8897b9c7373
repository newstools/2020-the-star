President Uhuru Kenyatta has convened an extraordinary session of the National and County Governments Co-ordinating Summit to discuss the rising Covid-19 cases. In a statement by State House spokesperson Kanze Dena on Wednesday, she said the session will be held on November 4. "The extraordinary session has been convened in light of the resurgence of Covid-19 infections across our Nation, as exhibited by the fact that Kenya has recorded its highest number of Covid-19 monthly fatalities in October 2020," the statement read. Uhuru urged Kenyans to observe guidelines to curb spread of the virus and hinted at re-establishing the restrictions that had been eased should Kenyans fail to follow guidelines. "By doing so, Kenyans will ensure that our nation does not lose the hard-fought for ground secured in the fight against Covid-19, and also that our nation shall not be compelled to roll-back the easing of the restrictions that Kenyans enjoy today. Uhuru urged Kenyans to continue to wear face masks correctly while in public spaces, apply correct hand hygiene at all times, and adhere with the physical and social distancing guidelines. On Tuesday, Kenya’s Covid-19 positivity rate hit the 20 per cent mark after 836 more people tested positive for the virus out of a sample of 4,076. The country’s caseload as of Tuesday was 50,833.
