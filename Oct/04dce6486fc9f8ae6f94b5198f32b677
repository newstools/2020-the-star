Local and regional pros resume their rivalry this morning in the Road to the Magical Kenya Open at Sigona Golf Club. Among the foreign pros expected to participate in this fourth leg of the Safari Tour Golf Series is Zimbabwean Robson Chinhoi who has been the most impressive foreigner since the start of the 2021 series at Limuru Country Club earlier in October. The Sigona leg also features Paul Chadala of Malawi and Philip Kasozi of Uganda. The foreigners, who are seeking Kenya Open slots for the region, will take on their Kenyan adversaries, among them, Dismas Indiza, Greg Snow, David Wakhu and Rizwan Charania. Indiza recovered from a bad start in the opener to win the Vet Lab leg, beating Chinhoi by two strokes. The Kenyan brigade also includes Erick Ooko, John Wangai, Justus Madoya, and Kopan Timbe. Greg Snow, who finished third at Vet Lab currently leads the series ahead of Simon Ngige and Indiza. The event is being used as a yardstick to ascertain regional representatives to the European Tour Kenya Open Championship which will be held next year at Karen Country Club. The first, second and third legs were held at Limuru County Club, Royal Nairobi and Vet Lab. Organisers of the event, Kenya Open Golf Limited- KOGL, started a new season with qualifying scores after the initial event was cancelled. They are, however, taking 10% of 2018-2019 scores and 20% of the 2019-2020 and 70% of 2020-2021 scores to determine Kenya Open qualifiers. RUNNING TOTAL POINTS AFTER VET LAB 1. Greg Snow  194.8 2.
