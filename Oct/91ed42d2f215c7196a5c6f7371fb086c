Two youths, one masquerading as an Airtel field services engineer, are conning unsuspecting Kenyans out of their cash through crafty means. One of them, who calls himself 'Engineer Evans', is using lies to access people's M-Pesa accounts and withdrawing every coin. He is also leaving his victims broke by obtaining credit from the M-Shwari, Fuliza and KCB M-Pesa accounts. The con artists are operating within Mt Kenya region. Yesterday at Makutano market in Kirinyaga along the Mwea-Embu road, one of them approached a woman who had parked her car near a petrol station. He flashed his 'Airtel staff card' and told her they were checking the network in the area. “I'm Evans, a field services engineer working for Airtel, and we are testing the strength of our network in this area to offer our customers the better services," he reportedly told the woman. He also sought to find out if the victim was using a 2G or 4G Sim card and in the process she gave him her smartphone to check. “In a short moment, he gave me back my handset before they drove off towards Ngurubani town," the victim said. She later realised that she had been conned out of Sh4,400 by the smart criminals in broad daylight. This comes after her M-Pesa account failed to transact Sh1,000 when she was fuelling her car. “On checking, I found the Sh1,000 in my M-Pesa account had been withdrawn and the transaction message deleted. The fraudsters had also borrowed Sh3,400 from Fuliza," she said. The victim had to borrow money from a friend to pay for the fuel. She reported the matter to both Airtel and Safaricom service providers since the money had been transferred to a Safaricom line. She checked True Caller and discovered that the name of the man who had conned her was not Evans but one Brian Ombeta. When she tried to call the number, it was switched off and has remained so up to this moment. The victim appealed to security personnel to apprehend the culprits. Edited by A.N
