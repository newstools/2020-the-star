Persons living with disabilities in Embu have said the Building Bridges Initiative report erodes gains made for them by the 2010 Constitution. For instance, they say, they will no longer be nominated to the Senate, the national and county assemblies if the BBI changes are approved. The group led by Jeff Riua and Anderson Nyaga said their proposals to the Garissa Senator Yusuf Haji-led task force were not included in the report. “As if that was not enough, the committee made some recommendations that if implemented will rob us some of the rights granted to us in the 2010 Constitution,” they said in statement. The group wants a forum so its views can be heard and included in the document before a referendum. “We are calling upon our President Uhuru Kenyatta and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga to come slow on reggae and ensure that our submissions are fully captured in the BBI report,” they said. They demand representation in education, health and gender and youth affairs or else they will reject the document.
