Kenenisa Bekele has withdrawn from the much awaited London Marathon slated for Sunday. Taking to Instagram on Friday, his page said, "An unfortunate calf injury has forced Kenenisa Bekele to withdraw from the London Marathon." Bekele said, "This race was so important to me. My time in Berlin last year gave me great confidence and motivation and I was looking forward to show that again, I have worked so hard for it. I realise many people around the world have been looking forward to this race and I am sorry to disappoint my fans, the organisers and my fellow competitors." After the cancellation of the original race in April due to Covid-19, organisers had pulled together an elite-only event, featuring almost 20 laps of St Jamesâ€™s Park, behind high fences and watched only by a handful of journalists, coaches and event officials.
