Kenya Sevens coach Innocent Simiyu will go for a team of tried and tested backroom staff in his second stint at the helm of Shujaa. The rumour mills have it that the former Kenya Sevens and 15s skipper will revert to the core of his team that did duty between 2016 and 2018. Simiyu was given a free hand to select his management team although he is expected to pick on individuals who are qualified in their specific fields. Simiyu was appointed last month on a two-year contract after emerging top in the interviews conducted by the Kenya Rugby Union. Among those touted for a return to the team are Will Webster, as assistant coach and Eric Ogweno, as team manager . Positions likely to be open are those of the strength and conditioning coach and the physiotherapist. Simiyu officially starts work next week and said said the team will start training early next month once they get the greenlight from the Ministry of Sports, part of the protocols for the various nationals teams preparing for the international assignment in the face of the coronavirus pandemic. The team will then head into a camp organised by the National Olympic Committee of Kenya (NOCK). Simiyu said he will work with players who have been in the set up in the recent past. “It's much easier to work with players who are familiar with your methods, have the experience and are adaptable to various formations,” said Simiyu. However, he bemoaned that Shujaa are behind other countries in terms of training. "Yes we are behind schedule compared to our competitors but with the series not expected to start until some time next year, we have enough time to put our house in order," said Simiyu. On a positive note, Simiyu said most players have been doing gym and skill workouts to keep themselves fit. Shujaa finished 12th overall with 36 points at the close of the 2019/20 season which was cancelled by World Rugby due to the spread of Covid 19 pandemic across the globe.
