The High Court has temporarily suspended the Sh8 million graft case facing Governor Sospeter Ojaamong and eight others. Justice John Onyiego suspended the criminal proceedings on Monday after Ojaamong filed an application accusing the prosecution of witness intimidation. The criminal proceedings have been suspended until October 12, when the court will give further directions. Ojaamong through lawyer James Orengo accuses the prosecution team led by Special prosecutor Taib Ali Taib of witness coaching, evidence tampering and witness threat intimidation. The county chief was in 2018 arraigned in court charged with abuse of office and other corruption related offences. He is accused of unilaterally signing an MoU with Madam R EnterprisesÂ  Ltd in a project for a solid waste management system without due regard to procedural framework governing the management of public finances and projects, leading to loss of Sh8 million. He is charged alongside Madam R and other county officials. The prosecution called 20 witnesses and closed its case on February 20 this year. Ojaamong and his co-accused were subsequently placed on their defence. Ojaamong gave an unsworn statement and informed the court he would be calling his own witnesses. The witness intimidation claims arose when one of his witnesses was on the stand testifying for him.
