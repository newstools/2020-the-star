Council members of the Law Society of Kenya have resolved that suspended LSK CEO Mercy Wambua be allowed to return to work. Through a statement on Monday, the council said the motion to remove the CEO was lost by a two-thirds vote. “This is to therefore communicate the decision of the Council. Kindly note that you are hereby required to resume your duties with immediate effect,” Roseline Adede, Council Member said. The Council had issued a letter on September 14, with the intention to remove her from the office over several grounds. The majority of the Council Members found that the allegations leveled against her did not amount to gross misconduct or incompetence. “Nine out of 13 council members voted against the motion on the removal of CEO in its meeting held on October 16.” After considering Wambua’s oral presentations made during the hearing held on October 6, the Council asked her to go back to work. Other Council Members who voted on her fate include George Omwansa, Bernhard Ngetich, Riziki Emukule, Carolyne Mutheu, Faith Odhiambo, Aluso Ingati, Ndinda Kanyili, and Beth Michoma.
