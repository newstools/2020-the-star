Pope Francis has become the first sitting head of the Catholic Church and sovereign of the Vatican City State to support the same sex law. The Pope on Wednesday called for the passage of civil union laws for same sex couples, departing from the position of the Vatican’s doctrinal office and the pope’s predecessors on the issue. “Homosexuals have a right to be a part of the family. They’re children of God and have a right to a family. Nobody should be thrown out, or be made miserable because of it,” Pope Francis said. Francis had initially supported civil unions for gay couples as an alternative to same sex marriages while serving as archbishop of Buenos Aires. His remarks are expected to arouse debate among the Catholics. “What we have to create is a civil union law. That way they are legally covered…I stood up for that.”
