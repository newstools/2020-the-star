A Labour Court has awarded former PS Lillian Omollo one shilling for unlawful dismissal. Justice Stephen Radido said the removal of Omollo from office in June 2018 was unconstitutional. "Omollo is awarded a nominal Sh 1 for the violation of her right to due process," said Radido. Nominal damages normally refer to a 'small sum of money awarded as damages to someone who has suffered a legal wrong but no actual financial loss'. Last month, Omollo challenged a decision by the High Court that she forfeits Sh33 million to the state. In the case, the Asset Recovery made an application for forfeiture of Sh33 million to the state arguing that the money was from proceeds of crime. Omollo and three of her children further want the court to withdraw all existing freezing orders against their bank accounts pending the hearing of her appeal. She says they never got a fair hearing in the High Court ruling. According to court papers, the court erred by purporting to waive the ARA legal obligation to prove through evidence that their money targeted for forfeiture indeed constituted proceeds of crime. Omollo was charged in 2018 with several counts of fraud in relation to loss of funds at the NYS.
