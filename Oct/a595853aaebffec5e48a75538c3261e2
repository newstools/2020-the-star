Deputy President William Ruto should abandon the 'hustler' slogan and coin another that can unite the country, National Assembly  Majority Chief Whip Emmanuel Wangwe has said. The Navakholo MP said the hustler tag is setting Kenyans against each other and its use should stop for the social well-being of the country. "This hustler narrative does not only apply to the dynasties but it boils down to the haves and the have-nots. This is dangerous because Kenyans will rise against each other," Wangwe said. "In as much as the use of the word started in a small way, it is becoming a total threat to the country's social fabric and peaceful coexistence." Wangwe said the DP cannot be a hustler when he owns a lot of property. Three weeks ago, ODM leader while attending a thanksgiving ceremony for nominated MP Wilson Sossion's daughter said all Kenyans were hustlers. Wangwe said the 41 against one slogan pre-2007 General Election resulted into deaths, destruction of property and displacement of people and such divisive slogans should be avoided by politicians. He said spinning the hustler and dynasties slogans amounts to creating camps among Kenyans for political competition. The use of the word hustler by the DP and politicians allied to him has gained currency in recent months in what is seen as laying ground for 'hustlers' against 'dynasties' in 2022. Wangwe further condemned the violence that was witnessed in Murang'a county, which led to the death of two people during DP Ruto's visit for a church fundraiser on Sunday. "We want police to arrest and charge those behind the violence. We don't want to lose lives again because of recklessness by politicians. Itâ€™s too backwards," he said. Edited by A.N
