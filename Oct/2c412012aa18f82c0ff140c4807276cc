Kenya Rugby Union have floated three different proposals to their affiliates for the return to action in December, subject to approval by the Ministry of Health. The union is mulling starting the league playoffs on December 5 before taking Christmas break between December 26 and January 9. Kenya Cup is planned for January 16, 2021 to April 3 before playoffs from April 10 to May 1. The second option will see the season kicking off with playoffs on January 9 followed by Kenya Cup from January 16 to February 13. Teams are then supposed to take a two-week break to play in the Enterprise pre-quarters before resuming Kenya Cup between March 6 to April 3. The popular Nakuru 10-a-side competition in is slated for April 10, 2021. The league will resume on April 17 to May 22 and break for the Enterprise quarters. The championship qualifiers and finals are slated for June 5 -19 while the Enterprise Cup semis and final will be played in July. The third option will see the Kenya Cup start on January 30 to April 21 while Nakuru 10-a-side and Enterprise Cup pre-quarters will run between April 17 and 24. Championship qualifiers are set for May 1 and 15 with the Enterprise Cup quarters, semis and finals planned to run between May 22 and June 5. The National Sevens circuit will run between July 31 and September 18 followed by the Impala Floodlights between September 25 - October 9. Safari Sevens have been fixed for October 23, 2021. KRU regulation 11.1.1 stipulates that the clubs’ off-season period shall be a minimum of four weeks after the last date of a season and there will be a minimum 14 weeks before the first date of the league commencement. The union said the entire return to play process will follow the guidelines from the Ministry of Sports as advised from time to time. “The guidelines clearly stipulate the progression and the union will guide clubs,” said the statement.
