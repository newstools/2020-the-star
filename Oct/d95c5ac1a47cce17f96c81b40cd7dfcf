Rapper Khaligraph Jones and his wife Georgina are expecting their second-born child. Papa Jones broke the news with a short video on Insta-stories. He then shared a photo holding his wifeâ€™s baby bump. "Omollo has been overworking in every field," he captioned it. Georgina posted a similar pic and wrote, "And for you father of nations, bless your heart in every way possible. You have been my greatest supporter and rock! Together we will have a tale to tell." Then she made it clear that yes, her bump is huge, but she is not carrying twins. "I get that my bump is huge, look at how large the father is, y'all thought I was gonna have a bump the size of a tennis ball?" she asked. Their first-born turned a year old in June.
