The Kenya Railways Corporation on Thursday announced the full resumption of passenger service. The announcement comes a day after it added a train to serve Nairobi and Mombasa. In a statement, managing director Philip Mainga said Kenya Railways will resume intercounty and Suswa services effective Friday. “This is as a result of customers’ request. There have been several stakeholders engagements to see it happen,” he said. The intercounty train will depart Mombasa every morning at 8am and will arrive in Nairobi at 1.42pm. It will then depart Nairobi at 8.15pm and arrive in Mombasa at 2.18am. Both trains will make stopovers at Athi River, Emali, Kibwezi, Mtito Andei, Voi, Miasenyi and Mariakani stations. The express train will be leaving Mombasa at 3.15pm and arrive in Nairobi at 8.14pm. It will then leave at 2.35pm the following day and arrive in Mombasa at 8.14pm.
