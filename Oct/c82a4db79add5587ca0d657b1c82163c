President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM party leader Raila Odinga will unveil the  Building Bridges Initiative to the public on Monday at the Bomas of Kenya. The two received the report on October 21 at the new Kisii State Lodge where they urged Kenyans to carefully read the report in order to enable them to make informed choices. The report continues to arouse debate across the country, different leaders giving their varying opinions about it. Deputy President William Ruto who missed the handover event in Kisii has said the report has to focus on the basic issues affecting Kenyans. He said the report should be people-centered and all-inclusive and must touch on issues such as job generation and poverty eradication rather than leaders and positions. The DP was speaking at Shianda Market in Kakamega after attending a church at the Bumini Parish, St. Leo Church-Shianda, Mumias East. At the same time, Ruto criticized the guidelines issued on public gatherings by the National Security Advisory Committee. He said guidelines will undermine the freedom of worship and blamed the NSAC for using the guidelines to achieve their benefit. “I want to assure you that the government of Kenya will protect and ensure that the freedom of worship is not sabotaged by any person,” Ruto said. Ruto added that “The freedom of worship is enshrined in the Constitution of Kenya. It is not negotiable and you don’t need permission from anybody to worship in any place, we are a God-fearing nation.” On the same day, the president was at PCEA Tumutumu Church in Nyeri County where he attended the centennial celebration of First Kirk-Session and the Ordination of Elders. The celebration worship service was hosted by Rt. Rev. Dr. Julius Guantai Mwamba, the Moderator of the 22nd General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church of East Africa. Uhuru steered clear of BBI talk, saying that was not what he was in the church to talk about, adding that more would be said on the report on Monday.
