The Health ministry has raised the alarm over what it termed as a puzzling pattern of Covid-19 infections in five counties in the last one week. They are Nakuru, Trans Nzoia, Kisumu, Mombasa and Nairobi. These counties had been recording low cases but have suddenly began shooting up, Health CAS Rashid Aman said. Of particular concern is Nakuru, which now stands at six in the number of infections in the national ranking after recording 1,260 cases as at Monday. Nairobi leads with 20,971 cases followed by Mombasa with 2,969, Kiambu with 2,776, Kajiado with 1,981 and Machakos at position five with 1,340 cases. On October 1, for instance, from a sample size of 4,700, Nairobi recorded 58 cases followed by Mombasa (22), Kisumu (20) and Nakuru (13). On October 2, from a sample size of 3,065 Nakuru recorded 75 new cases, the highest figure the county has ever recorded since the pandemic struck, followed by Nairobi with 36 Mombasa (15) and Trans Nzoia (13). On October 3, Nairobi shot up again with 128 cases followed by Kisumu (37), Mombasa (13 )and Kisumu (12). On Sunday, Nairobi recorded 70 cases followed by Nakuru (44), Trans Nzoia (30) while Kisumu and Mombasa recorded 15 cases each. On Monday, Nairobi recorded 18 new infections with Nakuru registering one more case. Meru and Kiambu recorded two and one case on Monday. “The following points to the fact that we are dealing with a pandemic that is uncertain, that the numbers can fluctuate from day to day depending upon how we behave,” the CAS noted. “This is a very mysterious and unique disease whose patterns are still very unclear to those in the medical and scientific profession.” Aman said medical experts from the ministry as well as those from the modeling teams are studying the behavioural patterns of how the virus is moving in the country and will make public the findings once they are completed. In a statement on Monday, Nakuru Governor Lee Kinyanjui expressed the same concern, adding that the positivity rate in the county now stands at 6.7 per cent, which is higher than the national average of 4.6 per cent. The county has 21 patients admitted in isolation facilities with 16 on supplementary oxygen. “While the situation is alarming, we wish to clarify that these numbers do not reflect persons who have developed symptoms of the disease,” the governor said. “The bulk of these numbers are as a result of the random voluntary sampling of perfectly healthy citizens across the county. Most recent data shows that we recorded 44 new cases in the past 24 hours from 314 samples. This is a clear indication the disease is at the community level.” The country recorded 22 more cases, bringing the caseload to 39,449. The new cases were from 595 samples tested in a day. On a positive note, 376 more people recovered from the virus, 360 from home-based care while 16 were discharged from hospital. This brings the total number of patients who have recovered to 27,035. Four more patients succumbed to the virus, raising the number of deaths to 735. Edited by Henry Makori
