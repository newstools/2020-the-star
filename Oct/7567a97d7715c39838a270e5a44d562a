Always fighting with your partner? Worry not, you'll be making sweet love afterwards, says socialite Risper Faith. Engaging her Instagram followers on relationships, she said conflicts are not necessarily a bad thing. "For those of you who are starting, donâ€™t quit because of fighting. It's okay, lol. N/B, sex after a fight is always the best," she said. Speaking from experience, the mother of one said fighting can enhance harmony in the long-term. Risper said in her first year of dating now-husband Brian Muiruri, they fought almost every day. However, the fights petered out because they have learnt to live with each other. "It narrowed down to once a month and nowadays we barely fight. So it's okay to fight to make the love stronger and to understand each other," she said. Edited by T Jalio
