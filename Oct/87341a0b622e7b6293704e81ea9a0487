Some Mwingi pupils showed up on Monday without face masks, a key Covid-19 safety requirement, but schools donated masks. Everyone reporting back is required to wear a mask. Learners were told to wear them on Tuesday and parents were warned to be vigilant. Mwingi Primary said turnout was 85 per cent and lessons had begun. Headteacher Joseph for two weeks teachers have been reporting to schoolÂ  so they are fully prepared. He said ensuring all health protocols is expensive and challenging. "We call upon well-wishers to chip in and extend a helping hand in donation of santiser, masks, soap among other key necessities," he said. He said when schools fully reopen, learning could not resume as normal because there's not enough space more more than 700 pupils. Each classroom is only accommodating 15 pupils now to observe social distancing, he said. (Edited by V. Graham)
