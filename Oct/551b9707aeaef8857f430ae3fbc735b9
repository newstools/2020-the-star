Calls to properly regulate the digital lending platforms in the country have been going on for a long time and this might come to an end if BBI proposals sail through. A section of MPs, including Mathare's Anthony Oluoch and ANC nominated MP Godfrey Osotsi have previously said these platforms have disenfranchised youths and the vulnerable in the society. The BBI Steering Committee in its report which was handed over to President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga on Wednesday at the Kisii State Lodge has highlighted suggestions on digital lending platforms. The committee wants the government to develop regulations targeting the digital lending platforms, saying they are causing poverty. One of the suggestions is to impose high taxation on the sector to diminish its attractiveness. It recommends that the Central Bank of Kenya should strengthen and enforce regulations regarding the amount that an individual can borrow on a platform. The report also suggests that there should be a clear way to establish someone's creditworthiness. To realise an economic revolution, the committee has proposed the development of a 50-year plan that is more political than technocratic. It also suggests that the government should identify and develop markets for Kenya-manufactured goods in neighbouring countries. This comes amid proposed regulations that will empower CBK to oversee the operations of digital financial service providers. The public had until August 11 to submit their views regarding the bill. In a public notice, the National Assembly had asked interested individuals to email views to the clerk. CBK Bill 2020, seeks to curb the steep digital lending rates that have plunged many borrowers into a debt trap as well as predatory lending. The proposal was first introduced in parliament in October last year by nominated MP Gideon Keter.
