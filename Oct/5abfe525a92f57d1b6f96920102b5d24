A Nairobi magistrate has ordered the arrest of a director of a private company for failing to attend court in a case he is accused of attempting to extort Sh10 million from a trader as a pre-condition to help settle a case. The money was allegedly for helping him to settle an alleged assault case by one Dimpple Sumariya to be dismissed. Senior principal magistrate Kennedy Cheruiyot of Milimani law courts issued the arrest warrant against Hirji Ramli Patel, a director with Astrol Aviation Limited, who is facing other counts of extorting Sh10,000 from Pareshkumar Keshhavji Dodhia for down payment as a pre-condition for helping him to settle an alleged assault case by Sunmariya. This followed an application by senior state prosecutor Kennedy Panyako that the accused Patel has jumped bail in the extortion case against him. He applied for a warrant of arrest to be issued against the accused, saying he has failed to attend court twice without permission of the court. The magistrate granted the request and ordered his arrest for failing to comply with his bail terms direction. Patel is out on cash bail of Sh1 million. He has since denied charges of extortion and being in possession of narcotic drugs (cannabis sativa) and being in possession of public stores. He is accused of being in possession of government stores namely one smoke military jacket, one pair of handcuffs , one bullet-proof vest which suspected to have been stolen or unlawfully obtained. The prosecution alleges that on July 17, 2020, at Parklands Road within Westlands sub-county during his arrest, the accused was found to have 27 rolls of cannabis sativa of street value of Sh2,160, which was not in medical preparation form.
