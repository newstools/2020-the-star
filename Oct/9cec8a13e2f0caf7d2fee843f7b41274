Midfielder Kevin de Bruyne has withdrawn from Belgium’s squad for Wednesday’s Nations League game against Iceland with an unspecified injury and returned to his club Manchester City, the Belgian national team said. The 29-year-old was substituted in the second half during Belgium’s 2-1 Nations League defeat by England at Wembley on Sunday. “Kevin de Bruyne has returned to his club. He couldn’t be fit enough to play against Iceland,” the Belgian national team said on Twitter. Manchester City are due to host Arsenal in the Premier League on Saturday. Meanwhile, the Premier League said on Monday that five people had returned positive results in its latest round of Covid-19 tests conducted on players and staff last week. The league said the individuals who had tested positive for the virus would now self-isolate for 10 days. “The Premier League can today confirm that between Monday 5 October and Sunday 11 October, 1,128 players and club staff were tested for Covid-19. Of these, there were five new positive tests,” the Premier League said in a statement. A total of 34 people have tested positive for the novel coronavirus in six rounds of testing since the new campaign began on September 12.
