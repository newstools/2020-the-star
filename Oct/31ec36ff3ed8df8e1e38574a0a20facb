Kenya's top ranked tennis player Junior Angela Okutoyi targets top 100 ranking in the world next year. Okutoyi, who returned to action last weekend during an exhibition match at the Nairobi Club, said she 's glad to be  back as she eyes improved performances heading into 2021. My goal is to move up the rankings and if all goes well and with more tournaments,  I believe I can achieve my target next year," added Okutoyi. Globally, she is ranked 240 on the World Tennis Tour Juniors log and 1033 on the ITF's women's World Tennis Tour. In 2018, she became the youngest player to win the Kenya Open then aged 14 after upsetting experienced three-time former champion Shufaa Changawa 6-1, 7-6 at Nairobi Club. Okutoyi, who is the reigning Africa Junior champion, said with more tennis matches being lined up, she hopes to be in good form at the start of the new year "Now am able to evaluate my form currently and what I need to work on later.  While playing today, I felt a little bit below par strewn with mistakes because of the longer periods we have been at home. I am now training five times a week and I hope to regain my form soon," said Okutoyi, who is the reigning African junior tennis female champion. Okutoyi said she is disappointed that the Youth Olympics will not be be held in 2022 in Dakar, Senegal after International Olympic Committee postponed it to 2026. “It's something I was looking forward to and I am devastated,” added Okutoyi. Coach Francis Rogoi believes Okutoyi is headed for great things if she can get exposure internationally. "This year  has not been a good year in terms of tournaments but we hope 2021 will be better if the situation improves,” added Rogoi.
