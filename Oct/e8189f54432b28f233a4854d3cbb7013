The Cabinet led by President Uhuru Kenyatta on Friday discussed a report on national security. Pictures shared by State House saw the leaders seated as they discussed report on various issues ranging from security, Huduma namba among others. After the meeting, the team was seen tree planting as they toured the camp. In a statement to newsrooms, State House described the report as ground breaking without giving details. Earlier, there was a protocol breach when the President arrivedÂ at the Manyani Airstrip on Friday. As a norm, the President is always received by his deputy whenever they are in the same function but it was different on Friday. When the President arrived for the Cabinet retreat, he was received by Interior CS Fred Matiang'i as his Deputy President William Ruto watched. Uhuru bowed down to Matiang'i before doing the same to Ruto due to the Ministry of Health protocols.
