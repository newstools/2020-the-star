Kenya Sevens' star Collins Injera expects the World 10-a- side tournament in Bermuda this weekend to be more physical as compared to the sevens circuit which he plays regularly. The country's record top try scorer in the shorter version of the game said the transition to 10-a-side rugby will be different from the seven aside game. “ Yes it's going to be different. I believe it will be more physical with limited space but I'm ready to play with some of the best players in the world,” added Injera. The talismanic utility back said the rest of the Kenyan contingent will adapt easily to the style of playing 10-a-side rugby. "Andrew Amonde, Oscar  Ouma and Willy Ambaka will hold their own. They are very physical players and I believe they will add value to the team we are playing for,"  added Injera Injera, who will play alongside Kenya Sevens skipper Amonde, Ambaka, Ouma Ouma and Oscar Dennis as part of Team SFX 10 for the three-week tournament. "Even in the 7s side, we’re used to these kind of physical beasts. So for us, I don’t think it will be as much of a transition as it would have been if it was 15's. Hopefully, we’ll hold our own,” noted Injera. The first round of matches is scheduled for this weekend in Bermuda followed by Round 2, which will  run from October 31 to November 1. The final round will be played at the National Sports Centre on November 7. Sevens teams will take part in the three- week tournament. The format for the series will be adjusted to accommodate the seven franchises. The tournaments over the next two weekends, starting Saturday, will be under  league format with each team playing each other twice across the weekends. The seven confirmed franchises for the event are SFX10 (Cape Town), Asia Pacific Dragons (Singapore), Phoenix (Middle East), London Royals (London), Miami Sun (Florida), Rhinos (Southern California) and Ohio Aviators (Columbus).
