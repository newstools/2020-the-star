Kapsaret MP Oscar Sudi was grilled for hours at the DCI headquarters over mysterious Sh150 million from the National Hospital Insurance Fund. It is alleged that two of Sudi’s cars were bought by money whose trail leads to NHIF accounts. Police say the cash was part of false claims syndicate that has led to the loss of millions at the health insurer. Sources say the two cars were paid for by a lawyer who said the cash came from the sale of land. Police dispute that theory, insisting the cash was from NHIF claim that was meant for patients' treatment in India. Sudi appeared before the Economic Fraud Unit in the morning following summons and left around 5pm. His allies waited for him outside the gate after they were blocked from accompanying him inside. Following the loss of millions at NHIF to corruption, the insurer engaged police to track down suspicious flows of money. The MP claimed innocence in his social media accounts, saying the cash was from a legitimate transaction of sale of property. “I have been grilled in DCI offices from 6am until now 5pm. I have been questioned about a transaction where I sold my property in Eldoret Town to a company that wanted to build a hospital on the said land.” “The transaction between me and the said company was completed after I received the money. They are now alleging that the money was wired from NHIF through the company to me. As a willing seller, I cannot smell the source of money that I received. So far, I have responded to all the questions they were asking. Iendelee namna hiyo.... ,” Sudi said in a Facebook post. The DCI date comes weeks after he was arraigned in Nakuru on accusations of hate speech and incitement.
