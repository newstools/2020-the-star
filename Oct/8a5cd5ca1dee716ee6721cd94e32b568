National Assembly Majority and Minority leaders Amos Kimunya and John Mbadi on Wednesday led the House in the famous 'Jerusalema' dance challenge. The MPs made a two line queue along the corridors of the National Assembly as they cheered and made their own 'choreographed' dance moves. The dance, inspired by Master KG's hit track 'Jerusalema' featuring Nomcebo Zikode, which is currently the most 'charming' song in the world. The official music video has garnered 180 million views since it premiered on YouTube in December 2019. Kimunya and Mbadi excited the MPs with their stylish moves as they danced away to the hit song. Wearing black suits and different ties, the two leaders danced from one corner to the other as the MPs cheered and danced to their own moves. The legislators had been practising for the challenge for at least two days so as to make it perfect and shoot their own version of the challenge. Kimunya said it was necessary for the legislators to be part of the movement calling for diversity in times of distress. The song has been endorsed by presidents and priests becoming the sound of the current Covid-19 pandemic for millions across the globe. Last week, the Jerusalema dance challenge was endorsed by President Cyril Ramaphosa ahead of the countryâ€™s plan to open up. The dance in the country has already featured health workers, construction workers, police officers.
