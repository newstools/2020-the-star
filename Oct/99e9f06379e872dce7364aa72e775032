Lancet Kenya has set up a modern laboratory in Bungoma county to be used for testing various illnesses, including Covid-19. Lancet has partnered with Elgon View Premier Hospital in the initiative. Lancet chief executive officer Dr Ahmed Kalebi said the full-fledged laboratory will reduce delays residents have been experiencing when they go for Covid-19 tests. "Residents can now get their Covid-19 results here instead of waiting for their samples from Kemri in Kisumu," he said. Kalebi said they will also be carrying out other clinical tests that have mostly been lacking in the county and its environs. "Patients in the county are being referred to Eldoret or Nairobi to seek tests that were not available, but now they will get all the required tests here," he added. Kalebi said people who will be tested for Covid-19 at the facility will get their results within 24 hours. The proprietor of Elgon View Premier Hospital, Dr Amin Sheik, said they will be offering affordable services to their clients. "Our clients will get their tests for all ailments here at our facility at affordable rates," Amin assured.  Edited by A.N
