American President Donald Trump told Fox News on Sunday that he no longer has coronavirus and is now “immune” to Covid-19. Trump wants to appear like Superman to boost his ratings in the opinion polls three weeks before the American presidential elections. In fact, denying the reality of Covid hurts him more than helps him. Trump has always been reckless around Covid, refusing to wear masks and ignoring rules for social distancing. He encouraged demonstrations in states where governors introduced lockdowns. Consequently there was a super-spreader event on September 26 at the White House when Trump presented Amy Coney Barratt as his pick for the Supreme Court. When Trump himself was hospitalised for Covid, Biden doubled his lead in the opinion polls. The moral of this story is 'don't mess with Covid'. No-one is immune, not even the President of the United States. Covid is not necessarily fatal but five percent of those aged over 65 years of age  die if infected. Over 200,000 people have died of Covid in the USA. Trump should not minimise the threat from Covid and nor should we in Kenya. Quote of the day: "Life has always treated me well.
