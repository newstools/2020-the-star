The Nyamira Health department has denied claims that a mother who lost her life while delivering died due to negligence. Health CEC Douglas Bosire told journalists on Monday that the patient had complications that led to her death and not that she was neglected. “The patient (Marthar Mogire) had a gestation period of 39 weeks and five days, meaning the delivery date was almost due but not yet." "She had very good signs of normal delivery and at around 6pm she developed complications that needed resuscitation which our doctors tried to do but unfortunately at around 7pm we lost her,” Bosire said in his office in Nyamira town. Bosire termed the incident as unfortunate but commended the health workers for doing a good job. “The patient was being attended to at the time of her demise and so, we cannot lay blame on our health workers since we held talks with the family of the deceased and they were given an explanation of what occurred,” Bosire said. He further noted that a postmortem was done on Sunday morning and it was discovered the patient died of cardiac arrest. Efforts to reach out to the family members were futile. “Following this sudden circumstance we had to sit down with the family and agree on what should be done. We, therefore, conducted a postmortem that revealed the presence of an embolism that might have led to cardiac arrest as the primary course of maternal death. It's regrettable that a life has been lost,” Bosire added. Bosire said the family has been counselled and will get the necessary support from the county government and the department of Health.
