The East African Breweries Limited Board of directors has appointed Ory Okolloh as an independent non-executive director with effect from October 15, 2020. Okolloh served as the Managing Director at philanthropic investment firm, Omidyar Network and Luminate Group in Africa. She also serves on the board of several organizations including the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company, Harvard University’s Centre for African Studies, Stanbic Holdings, and Stanbic Bank Kenya. Okolloh has also worked with Google as the Policy and Strategy Manager for Africa, tasked with persuading governments to adopt an open-internet policy. Last year, the firm posted a 57.34 per cent increase in net profit to Sh11.5 billion, largely driven by a positive macroeconomic environment. However, with bars and night clubs closed during the Covid-19 period,  alcohol sales have been dwindling over the past months. EABL reported a Sh7.2 billion profit after tax in the first half of the financial year, largely boosted by the sale of Senator Keg.
