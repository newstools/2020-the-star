Pregnant learners from Nyeri should be allowed back to school after delivering, Nyeri Governor Mutahi Kahiga has said. He said on Tuesday that about 200 learners who became pregnant after schools were closed to contain the spread of Covid-19 have given birth and many others are still pregnant. Kahiga said newborns should be left in the care of their grandparents as the girls continue with their education. "I call on headteachers to allow them back to school after giving birth so they can fulfil their dreams of having a bright future,” Kahiga said. The governor lashed out at parents for not taking their responsibilities seriously, saying they are partly to blame for the pregnancies. He said it is time the role of teachers was appreciated as many of the girls got pregnant while at home with their parents or guardians. The county boss appealed to parents and teachers to ensure the young parents are not discriminated against but are helped to cope with their new way of life. They should continue enjoying education and their parents' love, Kahiga said. Meanwhile, the Council of Governors (CoG) has decided that Early Childhood Development Education will not resume until it is satisfied that Covid-19 is fully contained. Kahiga, himself the chairman of CoG's Education committee, said nursery schools will only be reopened after they are convinced the children are safe. ECDE is a county function. “I call on parents not to worry but continue staying with their children at home until the disease is fully contained. Even if they miss nursery education, they will go straight to Grade 1,” he said. He said his administration recently gave out Sh100 million bursaries to students. He urged headteachers not to be harsh on parents who are unable to pay full fees. The county chief said some parents are unable to provide for their families because of the harsh economic times occasioned by the Covid-19 crisis.  Edited by F'Orieny
