The Bungoma county government has announced 100 per cent waiver of penalties on land rates. Governor Wycliffe Wangamati directed his officers to waive the rates to enable land and property owners to pay their rates on time and avoid accrued penalties. A circular by Lands and Urban Physical Planning chief officer George Kombo dated October 6 states that they had waived accrued penalties on land rates. "The county government wishes to inform residents and property owners that the governor has granted a 100 per cent waiver on interest and penalties on outstanding land rates owed to the devolved unit," the circular reads. He said the bills and invoices are available at subcounty revenue offices. Kombo warned that the county government would reinstate the penalties and interest for unpaid plot rates and institute administrative and legal mechanisms to recover the arrears in full. Revenue director Ambrose Makokha stated that they are digitising their systems to help minimise corruption. Makokha said through automation of the revenue system, teh county will guarantee channeling of all revenue collected. "With the automation of our system, our officers are able to account for every receipt issued. This has minimised corruption and increased the revenue collected. We have seen tremendous growth in revenue collection since we digitised our operations," he said. Addressing the press in his office, Makokha called on business owners to cooperate with the revenue collection officers by paying their rates on time. "Soon, we will have 100 officers assigned to the revenue department to help us in enforcing the law, so that those who are fond of dodging making payments to the county government are forced to do so," he said.
