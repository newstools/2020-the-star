People living with disability in Kericho county have threatened to walk out of  Jubilee should the party fail to reinstate nominated MP David Sankok to a parliamentary committee. Sankok was last Tuesday removed from the National Cohesion and Equal Opportunity Committee, where he has been serving as a member. On Saturday, the PWDs through their Social Economic Empowerment Organisation said they would not sit back and watch as Sankok is subjected to the "unjustified move". Organisation's patron Geoffrey Bii said Sankok has always supported people with disability in Kenya. National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi approved the removal of Sankok from the team, saying due procedure was followed. “I wish to report to the House that my office is in receipt of a letter dated September 25, 2020, from the Majority Party Whip, notifying that the Jubilee Party has discharged David ole Sankok, MP from the select Committee on National Cohesion and Equal Opportunity, where he has been serving as a member,” Muturi said. “Having perused the documents through which the Jubilee Party transmitted the decision to discharge the said Hon Member, I am satisfied that the process leading to the discharge met the requirements set out in Standing Order 176. Accordingly, the discharge of the said Member takes effect immediately.” The decision is viewed as an extension of the purge targeted MPs allied to Deputy President William Ruto in the House. Sankok has been of late having a cosy relationship with DP Ruto.
