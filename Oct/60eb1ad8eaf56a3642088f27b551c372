An online application form shared on a Facebook page claiming that Quickmart Supermarket is advertising jobs is FAKE. Jobseekers are asked to submit their applications by Friday, October 23, and pay a Sh200 registration fee through the number 0102732231, with the recipient mentioned as a Mrs Maureen Wangare from the HR department. The form also states that the supermarket chain seeks to fill 1,043 positions from internships to senior level. However, Quickmart has distanced themselves from the jobs advert, saying they don’t charge fees for job applications. “We would like to inform our esteemed customers and followers to avoid adverts claiming we are providing job opportunities at a fee. Kindly avoid them at all costs,” said a tweet by the supermarket chain. Facebook Transparency Information for the imposter page shows it was created on March 25, 2019, while that of the legitimate Quickmart Supermarket page was created on July 3, 2015. PesaCheck has previously debunked similar claims that Quickmart is offering jobs at a fee, including one alleging the retailer was seeking to employ over 900 staff, and the other advertising 2800 positions at the supermarket, all of which were false. In both cases, the scammers use Google forms to develop online application forms and regularly update minor details such as hiring dates, the amount of money to be paid as registration fees and the number of job openings among other things. PesaCheck has looked into Google form shared on a Facebook page claiming that Quickmart Supermarket has advertised 1,043 new jobs and finds it to be a HOAX.
