The High Court will in December begin hearing an appeal challenging the conviction of Sirisia MP John Waluke and his business partner Grace Wakhungu over the NCPB maize scam. Justice John Onyiego consolidated the two appeals as they raise similar issues, he said. He granted Waluke seven days to file his amended petition of appeal and 20 days for the Director of Public Prosecutions to file his response. The judge said the matter will be mentioned on November 16 before the Deputy Registrar to confirm that the two are still within the jurisdiction. Waluke was on September 28 granted a cash bail of Sh10 million and a bond of Sh20 million pending hearing and determination of his appeal. Wakhungu, on the other hand, was released on Sh20 million bail. The duo was in June this year convicted of fraud involving Sh313 million in shady maize dealings with the National Cereal and Produce Board. Wakhungu was sentenced to 69 years in jail with an option of shs 1 billion fine and Waluke was handed a 67 year sentence with a shs 1 billion fine. The two have since appealed against their convictions.
