@alalmaurice Parents in Kisumu have been warned against hiding children living with disabilities because of stigmatisation. Activists and a local NGO on Sunday said some parents were locking up their disabled children to 'save the face of the family from the public.' Truevine International programme director Winter Ogacho said discrimination against destitute children must also end. Ogacho was accompanied by the organisation's secretary Sarah Oloo. She attributed the hiding of children to stigma within society. “We must not allow our children to be subjected to suffering. They deserve better living conditions and services,” Ogacho said. The NGO donated food and other supplies to more than 150 people with physical and mental disabilities in Nyalenda slums. The donations included food items, bar soaps, masks, and sanitary towels. Ogacho advised parents to ensure every child gets better education, medical attention and other needs. She also asked the county and national governments to partner with well-wishers to enable people with disabilities to get better services. Nyalenda Young Turks team leader Victor Omondi said the government should focus on empowering the vulnerable community. He said those with disabilities have been ignored despite being among those hard hit by the Covid-19 pandemic. Omondi urged the government and well-wishers support those with disabilities. They need wheelchairs, scooters, walkers, canes, crutches, prosthetic and orthotic devices, he said. “We are working with the National Council for Persons with Disability to champion efficient services to the disabled,” he said. Omondi also cautioned parents who hide children with physical disabilities saying they should be known so they can be helped. “All children should be treated equally and fairly. No one should punish a child because he or she is disabled,” Omondi said.  Edited by P.O
