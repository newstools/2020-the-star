African Games high jump silver medalist Matthew Sawe is optimistic of putting on a show during the Kip Keino Classic on Saturday despite limited time in training due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Sawe, a two-time African champion from 2016 in Durban, South Africa and 2018 in Asaba, Nigeria, says the Covid-19 restrictions prevented him from undertaking intense training but insisted his body is still in tip-top condition. “The good thing about me is that my body adapts quickly. I have been doing light training in the past few days. I know that I will be up to the task when I wake up on Saturday morning,” Sawe said. Sawe is, however, careful not to dismiss other competitors. “I cannot specifically speak on how tight or not the competition will be. That is something that we will only know when we enter the field,” he said. There is minimal time for rest as Sawe’s attention will turn to next year’s World Indoor Championships as well as the 2021 Tokyo Olympics. “I want to give all my best for the Olympics and so my training schedule will begin immediately after Saturday’s event. I will later shift camp to Paris as the two competitions draw closer,” Sawe revealed. As a side note, Sawe bemoaned the many talents in high jump who are wasting away because they lack the patience and discipline required to excel in the sport. “Too many talented athletes think that high jump is simply about jumping. Instead it requires intense training. For example, I went to a training camp in Senegal for three years before I could master the art perfectly,” Sawe said. Sawe, who began as an 800m runner, said he is currently mentoring a young athlete to follow in his footsteps.
