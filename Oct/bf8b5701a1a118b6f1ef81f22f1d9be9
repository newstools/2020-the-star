ODM secretary general Edwin Sifuna has urged IEBC to take action against leaders who use public money to do campaigns ahead of the Msambweni by-elections. Sifuna said some politicians have started to misuse government resources for politics. He said the ODM team won't sit back and watch politicians go unpunished as they violate the law. "It is unconstitutional for people assigned official duties to deviate and do politics," he said. Sifuna spoke on Friday in Ukunda. "People come here using offensive language and they walk out free without being disciplined, " he said. He warned they will take legal action against IEBC if they fail to address their plight. Kwale Senator Issa Boi alleged that some county ward administrators have been seen campaigning contrary to the law. Boi vowed to forward the matter to the national disciplinary committee. "We have concrete evidence that county workers are doing campaigns; let them desist from such behaviour or else they won't be spared, we will report it, " he said. Sifuna's visit was meant to drum up support for ODM's candidate Omar Boga. He also met party MCAs to discuss how to strengthen ODM and conduct a two-day door to door campaign ahead of the Msambweni by-election. On Saturday, campaigns will be conducted in Mkwakwani. The Msambweni by-election is scheduled for December, 15.
