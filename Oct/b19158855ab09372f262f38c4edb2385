The Cabinet led by President Uhuru Kenyatta on Friday discussed a report on national security. In a statement to newsrooms, State House described the report as ground breaking without giving details. The President chaired an extra- ordinary session of Cabinet; during which the Head of State received the Report on the State of National Security, Nationhood and Territorial Integrity. The Session was held at the Kenya Wildlife Service, Field Training School, Manyani, Taita Taveta County. State House said the Report covered a wide range of issues, including national cyber projects, geospatial surveys and airborne geophysical projects. It also touched on the National Integrated Information Management System Programme – Huduma Namba initiative, and the National Security Industrialization Project. The report also addressed a number of other areas of national security concern and strategic national interest. "The vigilance of and interventions by our national security organs are tipped to ensure that Kenya remains a safe and secure nation," the statement read. "...the foundation stone of our country’s quest to build a more prosperous, fair and just nation for all Kenyans." Earlier, there was a protocol breach when the President arrived at the Manyani Airstrip on Friday. As a norm, the President is always received by his deputy whenever they are in the same function but it was different on Friday. When the President arrived for the Cabinet retreat, he was received by Interior CS Fred Matiang'i as his Deputy President William Ruto watched. Uhuru bowed down to Matiang'i before doing the same to Ruto due to the Ministry of Health protocols.
