President Uhuru Kenyatta is this afternoon at State House, Nairobi meeting the entire Parliamentary leadership team. According to a tweet by State House, the team that comprises of House and Committee leaders from both the Senate and National Assembly from across the political divide is discussing the government's development agenda. "The meeting was convened for the Head of State to meet the new Parliamentary leadership teams," read part of the tweet. This comes merely a day after the head of State on Friday held a day-long Cabinet retreat at the  Kilaguni Tsavo resort. The meeting saw discussions about political issues and BBI report that is set for release anytime. The session at state house will also be used to discuss the yet to be released BBI document. Intial reports indicated that the Building Bridges Initiative report would be likely  released as soon as this weekend. The result could be a political showdown pitting Uhuru and ODM boss Raila Odinga on one side against Deputy President William Ruto on the other. The BBI report is expected to change the country’s governance structure, including by the creation of the office of Prime Minister and two deputies.
