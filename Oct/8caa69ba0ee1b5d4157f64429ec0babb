Kenyans from all walks of life on Monday made their way to the Bomas of Kenya as the country prepares to launch its BBI report. With the chilly and rainy weather in Nairobi, many Kenyans were seen making their way to the venue holding umbrellas. Already, musical performances are ongoing with choirs singing the hearts out setting the mood for the event. The State House choir entertained the guests who were already seated and waiting for the President and other government officials to arrive from as early as 7 am. On arrival at the Bomas, Kenyans were handed the report to allow each and every person to read it before commenting on it. Heavily armed security personnel were on guard at the venue as early as Sunday. Kenyans are expected to give their views on the BBI report at Bomas as the guests made their way to the venue. By Sunday, the Bomas of Kenya arena was already prepared with seats marked, lights set up and plan drawn ahead of the Monday fete. The President is expected to lead more than 6,000 invited Kenyans at the Bomas of Kenya in launching the report. Today's formal launch of the BBI report is the beginning of a major political battle tipped to shape the referendum and the 2022 presidential contest. Delegates drawn from the 47 counties converge at the Bomas of Kenya to witness the official unveiling of the report by President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM chief Raila Odinga. Uhuru on Tuesday made a strong case for a referendum to approve changes to the Constitution before the 2022 General Elections during the Mashujaa Day celebrations in Kisii County. Uhuru said the changes would entrench political inclusion, equity in the distribution of opportunities and resources, and end violence every electoral cycle. The President said it would be disastrous to face another election without reforms and warned against “constitutional rigidity”. He asked Kenyans not to shy away from making bold decisions.
