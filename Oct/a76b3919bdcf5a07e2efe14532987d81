Second wave Scientists appear divided on whether Kenya will experience a 'second wave' of Covid-19 infections. Last month, the government warned of a possible 'second wave' should there be public laxity or relaxation of containment measures. However, some studies indicate there is unlikely to be an implosion of infections and fatalities in the future. According to the World Health Organization, the pandemic appears as a single, large outbreak with ups and downs - discounting the idea of a 'second wave.' The latest model on the outbreak in Kenya does not project a 'second wave' but slightly raised infections because of relaxed health measures. It suggests Kenya's curve will follow an exponential smoothing model, which assumes the future will be more or less the same as the (recent) past. "The trends of Covid-19 new cases will...be raised slightly for Egypt and Kenya," says the study - Modelling and Forecasting of Covid-19 New Cases in the Top 10 Infected African Countries - which has not yet been peer-reviewed.  It is displayed in the pre-print platform Medrxiv. The study was conducted three weeks ago with the current trends in Kenya. "Strong appropriate public health and social measures must be instituted on the grounds again," the researchers recommend.
