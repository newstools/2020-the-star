Health CAS Rashid Aman has said that the Industrial Area Remand Prison in Nairobi will not be allowed to receive more remandees from Wednesday following new cases of the virus within the prison. Speaking on Tuesday during the update on the virus in the country, the CAS said that 34 cases out of the 64 in Nairobi in the last 24 hours were from the facility. The CAS said remandees should not be transferred from other facilities to Nairobi Remand Prison to prevent further spread of the virus. "This directive now stops remandees being transferred to that facility until such a time we can contain the situation," Aman said. He added that the remand prison will equally be in a close down mode. Also, the Prisons Department, The Police Service, and the court have been directed to coordinate and determine a framework that will reduce the movement of any person to the facility. The ministry confirmed on Tuesday that 137 new cases of the virus were reported in the last 24 hours.
