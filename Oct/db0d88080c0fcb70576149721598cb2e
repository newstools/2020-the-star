Gospel singer Size 8 has broken her silence about the alleged indiscretions of her husband DJ MO. Taking to her Facebook page, she said whatever has been said about her marriage, she will work on it through prayers. "Whether it is true or not, I don't know, only God knows the whole truth, and we cannot reverse what has been said," she wrote. She added she had been angered and sad handling things physically but that stage is over. Quoting a Bible verse 'Ephesians 6:12', the mother of two said when any of us fight physically, we are bound to fail because the devil is the main enemy, not people. "So no point of bitterness, anger, unforgiveness or fits of rage," she wrote. She will host an online prayer meeting for marriages on Saturday. "Marriage is a very great covenant created by God," she said.
