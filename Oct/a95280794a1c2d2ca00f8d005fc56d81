Ugandan activist and politician Robert Kyagulanyi Ssentamu, popularly known as Bobi Wine,  was arrested after police raided his campaign headquarters in Kamwokya on Wednesday. He posted through his Twitter account on Wednesday that officers broke into his headquarters and took away valuable documents and other items. The musician added that some of his friends who were in the office were injured. “Seeing the hundreds of soldiers and police officers deployed today is evidence that the dictator is so scared of us. We are not giving up. We are not giving in and shall overcome,” He said. Bobi Wine has announced that he will contest for the presidential seat in the next general elections under his National Unity Platform party. He also alleged that some of his followers who were selling NUP branding materials in town were being arrested with reckless abandon. “Instead of weakening us comrades, let these actions strengthen us, and increase our resolve.” Bobi Wine has been arrested several times since he expressed his interest in the top seat.
