Police in Mombasa on Sunday gunned down a  suspect believed to be a member of the 'Chafu' gang. The suspect was killed at the Makao Mema area in Likoni in the operation to targeting the group that has been terrorising residents. Likoni sub-county police commander Jane Munywoki said police had launched a manhunt for the gang after residents complained about their ordeal to the police. “Within an hour of the operation, we dealt with one of them. We are still pursuing the rest,” Munywoki told the Star on phone. Police said one of the gang members was arrested and is undergoing interrogation at Likoni Police Station. She said police have so far recovered one machete and two axes. The operation comes after a man was stabbed on his head near the Mrima area before losing his phone and cash to a group of youths who were brandishing machetes and knives. “I haven't seen any report of anyone who was attacked. They should come forward so that we get more information on the incident,” the police boss said. Following months of relative peace in the area, residents say gangs have been sights in the alleys of late and want authorities to act fast. The gang warfare has left scores of residents dead and others with injuries in the sub-county with drug barons blamed for sustaining the gangs.
