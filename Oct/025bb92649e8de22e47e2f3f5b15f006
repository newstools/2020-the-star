Muslim leaders have called upon politicians to tone down their activities that are polarising the country. Instead, they should shift their focus to economic recovery following the devastating impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. "President Kenyatta has anchored his legacy on the Big Four Agenda and it cannot be achieved or implemented in an atmosphere of political tensions," the leaders said on Thursday. Speaking at the Jamia Mosque in Nairobi, the Supreme Council of Kenya Muslims urged political leaders to refrain from creating a toxic situation. "We are worried that Kenya is slowly and dangerously sliding back to the political animosities that preceded the 2007-08 post-election violence that all Kenyans have never forgotten," Supkem chair Ali Naado said. The leaders called on the government and the security apparatus to render their services in strict accordance to the law. "We must exercise maximum decorum and wisdom and must also refrain from causing unnecessary divisions in our communities for political gain," Naado said. The statement by the religious leaders comes after chaos rocked Kenol in Murang'a on Sunday during a church service which Deputy President William Ruto attended. Two people were killed in the chaos. President Uhuru Kenyatta on September 26 urged religious leaders to speak consistently and openly in condemnation of the vices slowing down Kenya’s progress. He said it is only through the active participation of all Kenyans, including religious leaders, that the country will defeat challenges to the country’s development. “Speak boldly against all the vices that are holding our nation back. Our job of building this nation is a shared responsibility; we are serving the same people. We deliver on the physical wellness of all the citizens, as you nourish their souls and spirit,” the head of state said. Edited by Henry Makori
