As the Kenya Hockey Union awaits direction from the government for action to resume, stakeholders are keen to kick off the season in January. Former Kenya International Kenneth Nyongesa said even if the government clears sports to resume in November, the remaining time won't be enough for teams to prepare. The Butali Warriors defender and a former long serving captain said Kenya should capitalise on the situation to align with the international calendar. He opined that for the remaining time of the year, KHU should organise tournaments to keep the players in shape. "To be honest, I believe we are running out of time for the league to be played this year. People have to first of all return to group training and this requires sufficient time for the players to get back into the rhythm which looks unlikely.  If anything, KHU should arrange for a series to boost the players fitness levels," said the title-winning player. He added, "We have to align ourselves to the international calendar. The African Hockey Federation pushed all their activities to 2021 which we also have to abide by." KCA University and USIU men's coach Wilson Otieno said players need enough time to shade off weight having spent more than half a year idle. "It's obvious that players have added weight and require at least two months to be fully fit" He said it will be proper for the game to return in January, tipping KHU to run the league without interruptions. "January next year will be ideal. If play resumes before the year ends, we will be forced to break for Christmas holidays. We have to take time, start a fresh without interruptions in 2021," he said.
