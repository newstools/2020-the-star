Changamwe FC defeated Golden Boys 1-0 to lift the inaugural Silas Nakoko Etoo Super Cup in Changamwe, Mombasa. After a barren first half, which saw Golden Boys dominate, Changamwe coach rang changes in the second half which bore fruits. In the 67th minute, captain Martin Onyango lifted the ball into the area and striker Jacom Musiri headed home from close range to give Changamwe the deserved lead. Efforts by Golden Boys to seek an equaliser failed as Changamwe’s defence stood firm. In the semifinals, Changamwe thrashed Nyota 5-0 while Golden Boys beat a stubborn Blue Rangers 2-1. Mombasa Deputy Governor William Kingi and Governor Hassan Joho’s advisor Hamisi Mwaguya graced the final which was played at Changamwe Estate grounds. They each promised to give the two finalists a goat each. Winners received a ball, trophy and a goat while the losing finalists went home with a ball and a trophy. Nakoko, who is a youth leader in the area, pledged to continue sponsoring the tournament and supporting youths. “This tournament will be held annually and it will be bigger next time. This time, we used this opportunity to sensitise the people on the Covid-19 pandemic,” he said. He said there is enormous talent in the Coast region which has not been tapped.
