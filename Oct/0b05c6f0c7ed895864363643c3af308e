Transport in Kwale county has been disrupted after Marenje Bridge in Lunga-Lunga subcounty flooded following heavy rains. The bridge links the Tanzania-Lunga-Lunga highway and was under construction. County police commander Joseph Nthenge  the floods followed long hours of rain from Thursday night to Friday morning. Nthenge  said the water then overflowed to an alternative route that was temporarily designed for passage. “Since the bridge is not yet complete there, was a blockage and the water from it flooded the road next to it, disrupting transport activities,” he said. The bridge has some history of being swept away by floods. Last year, a section of it was destroyed by the rains. Nthenge said the area is completely impassable, warning motorists not to risk their lives. “The Ukunda-Lunga-Lunga commuters, kindly find other routes to reach your homes,” he said. He said KeNHA is addressing the issue and normalcy  will resume. The county police boss asked the respective authority to expedite the bridge construction to avert further disasters. Meanwhile, he had advised people living in flooded areas to take precautions and move to high places as rain continues to wreak havoc. He also urged parents to take care of their children to avoid drowning cases.
