The youth in Likoni have urged the Mombasa county administration to complete all stalled projects started by former MP Masoud Mwahima to honour him. Capital Youth Caucus secretary-general Evans Momanyi said the legacy of the MP, who died in August aged 78 after a short illness, ought to be preserved. Momanyi said Mwahima was an exemplary leader who made a huge impact in the community he was serving. “His development track record is unrivalled, both when he served as a mayor and also as an MP,” he said. Mwahima served Likoni for two terms beginning in 2007 and completed several projects. He lost to ODM's Mishi Mboko in 2017. Momanyi urged Governor Hassan Joho to give special attention to Mrima health centre, which was Mwahima’s dream and vision. The centre offers maternal services and is also home to foreign doctors who serve under the umbrella of doctors without borders. Momanyi said the hospital should be revamped and renamed to Mwahima hospital in the MP's memory. The MPs track record, particularly in the education sector is highly regarded. He helped build many schools, some of which bear his name. They include Mwalimu Mwahima Secondary, Tibwani School, Shika Adabu Secondary, Puma Secondary, Bububu Secondary, Likoni Primary, Mweza Secondary, Mtongwe Secondary, Mtongwe School for the Physically Handicapped, Likoni School for the Blind and Mrima Secondary. He also established the Mwahima Stadium, Mwalimu Masudi Mwahima Foundation, Mrima and Mbuta health centres, and built the Likoni fire Station.
