More than 500 people are set to be screened for breast and cervical cancer at Webuye County Hospital in Bungoma county. The three-day drive was organised by Bungoma Woman Representative Catherine Wambilianga and Webuye County Hospital medical staff. The screening started on Wednesday and will end on Friday. Speaking during the official launch of the screening on Wednesday, Webuye County Hospital medical superintendent Simon Kisaka said cancer is treatable if detected early. "Chronic diseases such as cancer are very expensive to manage if screening is delayed. I'm calling on Bungoma residents to use this opportunity to understand their status to avoid late detection," Kisaka said. On Wednesday, 120 people were screened. The manager in the office of the county woman representative, Moses Nabibia, also urged residents to go for screening. "Wambilianga cares a lot and understands what ails our society. That is why she organised to have residents screened," Nabibia said.  Edited by A.N
