National Super League side Vihiga United are in the market shopping for fresh talent to add quality to their squad as they anticipate a return to the top tier. The club is preparing for a play-off against Kisumu All-Stars and a win over the lake-side outfit will earn them an automatic slot in the Football Kenya Federation Premier League next season. Club chairman Kahi Indimuli said the law dictates that they can only bring in new signings after the playoffs and that FKF have offered to extend the transfer window period for the side that will qualify. “FKF needs only those players who participated in National Super League to take part in the play offs,” Indimuli said. Indimuli also confirmed that the squad had already embarked on intensive preparations for the double-header while observing strict Covid-19 regulations. He revealed that Vihiga were initially set to play opponent on October 7 and 11 but the encounter was procrastinated after a spike in coronavirus infections forced the government to extend containment measures indefinitely. FKF are yet to settle on another date. Indimuli commended the players for the unwavering spirit they have displayed so far in the face of financial constraints, adding that such a positive attitude will enable them to prosper. “The county has not received its share from the national government for the last three months and so facilitating the team has become an uphill task,” said Indimuli, adding that, “once the situation improves we are sure our players will be sorted out.”
