Gospel singer Size 8 says she has seen the goodness of the Lord in her marriage. She and DJ Mo have been the talk of the town after he allegedly cheated on her, claims he has dismissed. Speaking during a live prayer session on Saturday, the mother of two preached that although some situations in our lives may seem not to be working, the Bible reminds us that to them who are called to his good purpose, everything happens for their own good. "Sometimes a situation may look like it is going to destroy you but it is here to create you into a better person," she said. Size 8 also prayed for people whose marriages are on the brink of disaster. She encouraged her fans to always remember that God never changes. "Whether you are in a good or bad situation... Jehovah fights our battles." Edited by T Jalio
