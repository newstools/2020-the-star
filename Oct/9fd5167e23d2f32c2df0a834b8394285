 Politicians should use their oratory acumen to inspire and not to incite people to violence, National Irrigation Board director Zainab Chidzuga has said. Chidzuga, who spoke on Sunday at Matuga, said politicians should weigh what they say or else they raise unnecessary tension ahead of the 2022 general elections. “Both the government and the opposition sides are doing things and making comments that disturb the peace and if they won’t stop people will be misled,” the former Kwale Woman Representative said. She said politicians' utterances should should be inspiring and motivating for for the government to realise its Big Four agenda. According to her, it is too early to engage in 2022 election politics. The focus should be on how to serve citizens by coming up with innovative ideas for the improvement of livelihoods. “It is not time to do politics. This is when leaders sit back and share their creativity on ensuring maximum food security, good health and creation of employment opportunities,” Chidzuga said. She at the same time asked residents to be choosy in who they elected to lead them in the coming elections to avoid regrets for the next five years. The NIB director called on everybodyto join President Uhuru Kenyatta in fighting corruption. She in particular said governors should be at the forefront safeguarding county resources. In August Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya cautioned his critics against exploiting ethnic division and using tribalism for personal gain. Mvurya said the county had been invaded by inciters and opportunists and asked locals to be vigilant. “Beware of malicious people who have no agenda but want to take advantage of your vulnerability to divide you on the basis of tribalism,” he said.
