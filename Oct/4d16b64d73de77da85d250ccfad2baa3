AFC Leopards are set to return to training following the release of the 2021 Kenya Premier League fixtures. Leopards’ team manager Tom Juma confirmed that the players have not had any team training session but that was about to change with the release of the fixtures. According to the draft schedule, the league campaign is set to start on November 20. “We were still waiting for the government directive on when we can resume but now that the fixtures have been published, we have little choice but to start our preps,” said Juma. Leopards have improved in leaps and bounds under the watch of former defender Anthony Kimani and are likely to return to the newly refurbished Nyayo Stadium to play beleaguered Western Stima in the opener. “We are very much looking forward to the start of the league. It had been a long time coming and we will be ready when the time finally comes,” said Juma. “We want to start on a positive note to maintain the momentum we had gathered when the season was brought to a close,” the team manager remarked. Juma further confirmed that they were scheduled for a meeting with the club’s executive led by the chairman, Dan Shikanda to finalise on how they would resume training while adhering to the government directives. Last week coach Kimani revealed that the players were keeping fit through gym work to build up their muscles before they start team sessions. Stima meanwhile face an uncertain future following the withdrawal of support from their benefactors Kenya Power.
