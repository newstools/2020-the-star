Muthaiga pro Greg Snow has finally taken over the Safari Tour series opener lead with a one stroke over Mathew Omondi and Robinson Owiti. Snow attributed his good run over the past two days to precision hitting. After struggling on the opening day on Sunday, Snow posted 4 under on Day Two, which has made all the difference. “I feel much better now going into the last round. The game plan is to keep my cool and ensure I hit low scores,” he said. Snow shot a 1 over par 73 round to move to the summit with a gross total of 1 under par 215. He will need to keep his cool into the last round today to begin his 2020/21 Safari Tour campaign on a high. Owiti also shot 1 over par 73 yesterday for level par 216 gross to tie in second place with Vet Lab’s stablemate Omondi. David Wakhu is lying fourth after a round of one over and a cumulative score of 1 over par 217. It was a bad day in the office for Ganeev Giddie, who led the event after the first two rounds, only to dip to sixth place with a disappointing 6 over par 78. A field of 52 players including six amateurs have enlisted to tackle the par 72 Limuru course which is reported to be in excellent condition particularly after the commissioning of an automated irrigation system. The pros include Uganda’s Abbey Bagalana and Rwanda’s Alloys Nsabimana, all gunning for a share of a total prize purse of Sh1,000,000. At stake for the amateurs will be a trophy and some points towards the World Amateur golf ranking. The event is the first in the series that will prepare and qualify golfers for the 2021 Kenya Open which returns to the European Tour for the umpteenth time.
