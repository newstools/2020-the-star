Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago succession race has began in earnest. Tellingly, the front runners include businessman Bundotich Kiprop Buzeki, who was three weeks ago accused by Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi of holding night meetings. The businessman responded sarcastically: “It’s true we hold night and day meetings but they are not secret and Sudi, along with all others, should come and attend to hear what we discuss.” Mandago, a two-term governor, says he will leave a happy man, having completed flagship projects worth more than Sh5 billion. But he is unlikely to quit politics, with speculation rife that he is eyeing the Senate seat currently held by Prof Margaret Kamar. “I contested for the governor seat knowing I will serve for two terms. In 2022 I am ready to leave and maybe vie for any other seat, including that of president,” Mandago said. He is influential not only in Uasin Gishu but in the entire Rift Valley. Buzeki unsuccessfully tried to unseat Mandago in 2017 on a Chama Cha Mashinani ticket after differing with Deputy President William Ruto. He says he will vie for the gubernatorial seat on CCM ticket. Another likely aspirant is Prof Julius Bitok, currently the High Commissioner in Pakistan. Bitok also vied for the seat in 2017 and has kept his political networks alive. Another name being mentioned is that of Caleb Kositany, the Soy MP and  close Ruto ally. But Kositany has not publicly declared his interest in the seat. Jonathan Bii, his rival in Soy, will also be in the race after he quit Kanu to join Jubilee. Bii is a well known political operator in the region with grassroots support. Deputy Governor Daniel Chemno is also expected to be in the race. However, he has yet to declare his interest.  - mwaniki fm
