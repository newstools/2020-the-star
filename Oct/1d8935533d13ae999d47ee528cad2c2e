 Bomet residents have been warned against taking the law into their hands but instead urged to find better ways of solving disputes. High Court judge Roselyn Korir on Monday raised the alarm over rising cases of murder in the region. She said killing is an ungodly act, criminal and culturally considered a curse. “Killing one another is not the solution to the problems affecting us and that is why we have to bring it to an end,” Korir said. Justice Korir was posted to the High Court in Bomet two months ago. Speaking in Bomet, she said she was committed to ending rampant murder cases in the county. She said she was ready to talk to residents in their villages and sensitise them on the threats posed by such actions on families. “It is high time the society is involved in finding a way out of this by organising public participation to chart the way forward. I am ready to spearhead it because shedding blood over a dispute is not only unsocial but traditionally a curse. You cannot benefit out of it but will instead suffer miserably in life,” she said. Statistics from the court’s registry shows there have been 147 recorded murder cases in Bomet between 2017 and 2020. Some 79 cases are still pending. Justice Korir asked the Director of Public Prosecutions to relook into some of the files, saying they might not qualify for murder charges. Most of the cases revolved around land disputes and love gone sour. Barely a week ago, a man from Konoin burnt his wife to death over undisclosed family squabbles. The judge also raised concerns over the rising number of early pregnancies in the county. The county has had 261 cases of teen pregnancies since 2017. Korir wondered whether parents had abdicated their duties or the society had begun "rotting".  Edited by P.O
