DJ Mo’s alleged side chick, Margaret Wanyama, has entered into another relationship. In an Insta-Story she has since deleted, Margaret wrote, “I’m going to try this relationship sh*t one more time. If I cheat again, I'm done.” She revealed her boyfriend when she wished him a happy birthday a few days back. His name is Smoove Papi. This comes after Size 8 declared she has forgiven her husband after cheating allegations. "Most people thought this was the time to bash him and throw his clothes out of the window. I didn't want this thing to destroy him or whatever the devil wanted to do," she said. "I looked at him and said I want to love him the way Christ has loved me. He was shocked, by the way."
