A father in Kongowea, Mombasa county is in distress after his KCSE exam candidate daughter reportedly eloped with an unknown man. Bena Moraa Nyaberi, 19, is a Form 4 candidate and has been missing since September 25. Moraa has a twin sister who has already reported back to school. The father, Steven Nyaberi, said Moraa left home in Kongowea to visit her aunt in Kisauni, Mombasa. She did not arrive at her aunt’s place. After reporting the matter to the police, Nyaberi was told to be patient so that investigations and a search can begin. On October 2, Nyaberi received an automated missed call message from her daughter's line. When she called her back, she only said ‘Likoni’ and the phone went off. “She then later texted me saying her phone had a mouthpiece problem,” Nyaberi said. He texted her back and told her to come back home. She asked him for fare.  That was the last time he heard from her. Nyaberi went back to the police and was told to wait for "further investigations". The police then tracked the phone location to Taita Taveta and identified a man named Edwin Juma.  The tracking is still ongoing. Nyaberi said he was surprised that his daughter would think of eloping as she is "very disciplined and a bright girl in her studies". He wants her to return home so that she can sit her KCSE examination. “It will not matter whether she will pass or fail but from there, she will decide whether she wants to get married because at the moment, she is a candidate,” he said. Nyaberi is also afraid Moraa's being away will affect her twin sister’s performance since it would be hard for her to concentrate on her studies. “Her twin sister might perform poorly because she misses her,” he said. Nyaberi said he is ready to accept her daughter even if she is pregnant. His greatest fear is that the man might decide to take his daughter outside the country.
