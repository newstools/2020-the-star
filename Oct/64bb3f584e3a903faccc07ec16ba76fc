A 30-year-old man was on Saturday morning found lying dead along Entanda road in Nyamira after a night at his lover’s place. Abel Okemwa had on Friday night visited his lover in Entanda Nyangena, Manga subcounty. County commissioner Amos Mariba said the woman's brother and another man are suspected to have attacked and killed Okemwa and later dragged his body away from the house. “At an unknown time on Friday night, it is believed that the [woman's] brother and his friend found Okemwa and his lover inside the house. The duo attacked the deceased using wooden sticks in the head, back and left leg, leading to his death,” Mariba said in a statement. He said the two are suspected to have moved the body from the house to the murram road, 50 metres from the house. Police officers on Saturday morning rescued the woman's brother from irate members of the public who wanted to lynch him. The other man escaped. The body was taken to the Tombe Medicare Hospital mortuary.
