The GSU has adopted a new jungle uniform amid phased changes within the National Police Service. The new uniform was displayed on Thursday at their Magadi Training Camp when Inspector General of police Hilary Mutyambai and other senior officers donned it during an event presided by President Kenyatta. The unit is the latest to adopt the uniform after the general duty officers,  Rapid Deployment Unit, Boarder Patrol Unit and the Critical Infrastructure Protection Unit adopted the Persian blue uniform. Police have been undergoing structural changes since 2018 when the president announced the new reforms that saw more than 24,000 personnel from Administration Police Service join the Kenya Police Service. The other changes included the adoption of a new uniform for different units within the service and digitisation of police services. Earlier on IG Mutyambai called for patience in the phased procurement of new uniforms for police officers. The police boss emphasized that production is based on the availability of resources to accommodate the huge number of officers involved. During a QnA session on Twitter, Mutyambai said the old uniform has not lost its functionality and should therefore be worn by officers who are yet to access the new one. "The previous uniform is still functional and can be used by the officers who are yet to receive the new regalia. The C.O.A will be issued to the officers in question in due time too," he said on Wednesday. The IG said the number of officers currently stands at 64,000 and the earliest all police officers can have the new uniform is 2023. The new blue uniform was officially unveiled in September 2018 by President Uhuru Kenyatta who said it will enhance the visibility of the officers. In February this year, Interior PS Karanja Kibicho said it will take the government at least three years to have all police officers in the new regalia.
