Likoni Subcounty Hospital has been closed for two weeks after a nurse succumbed to Covid-19 while several other cases have been reported. Speaking to the Star on the phone, Kenya Union of Nurses Mombasa Secretary General Peter Maroko, said that the government has not revealed the number of cases of Covid-19 and it relies on information from colleagues who are willing to reveal their status. "Apart from the case of the nurse who succumbed, I have not been informed of any other case because we depend on those members who are ready to declare their status, " Maroko said. In Mombasa county, there are six nurses who have contracted the virus while two in the county have succumbed, he said. "So far we know of six cases but there could be more," Maroko said, adding there was a shortage of PPEs, putting the workers at risk.
