Mandera Governor Ali Roba on Tuesday urged residents to start making bricks to bridge the building materials gap created by the government's decision to close quarries in the county. The government closed the quarries on May 4, 2018, following the killing of non-Somali miners by al Shabaab militants. Roba said residents need to think outside the box and look for better and sustainable way of making building materials. “In order for us to resolve these repetitive challenges of quarry closures, the people of this county must adopt alternative building materials. I urge the public to resort to brick-making as an alternative to quarry stones,” Roba said in Mandera town. Roba further said that bricks are also environment-friendly. “This approach will also help save our hills from getting degraded. We now plead with the national government to continue enforcing the permanent closure of quarries in Mandera county,” he said. The miners' trouble started in December 2014 when suspected al Shabaab militants killed 36 non-Muslim quarry workers in Mandera. A similar attack was carried out in July 2015, when 14 quarry workers were killed by militants in the county. The attack left 20 others seriously injured. In May 2017, two miners were killed in a quarry in Qalengelesa, Mandera South. In May 2018, four miners were killed by militants at a quarry in Shimbir Fatuma, Mandera South subcounty. Following frequent attacks, the government banned quarrying to end the killings of miners by militants targeting non-Somalis. Roba has on numerous occasions urged the government to lift the ban, saying that quarrying is a major economic activity in the area. Edited by A.N
