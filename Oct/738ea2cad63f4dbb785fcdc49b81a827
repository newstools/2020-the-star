Workers unions have expressed their support for the Building Bridges Initiative report. Lead by COTU Sec General Francis Atwoli and his KNUT counterpart Wilson Sossion, the unions said BBI is a wonderful document that needs maximum support. Atwoli said world economies are changing fast and that time has come for the country's leadership to put policies in place to support the young people venture into the digital economy. "Sisi tusitishwe...yes tusitishwe... hii kitu ni muzuri na asubuhi saa nne tutapitisha lakini hatutakubali kutishwa (do not threaten us... this thing is good and by 10am, we will have passed it but we will not agree to be threatened," Atwoli said. He said every parent while educating their children hopes that they will graduate and get better jobs and if the government does not conclusively address the issue of youth employment through the BBI then Kenya will remain stagnant. Atwoli said that going forward mechanisms should be put in place for workers to have a representation in parliament and not through political parties. Every time we have had violence in this country it is the women and children that suffer the most because the elite and those in the political class always flee. "We are saying 2022 is still very far and the discussions on BBI should not be about that time, we should focus on food security and a peaceful co-existence for a prosperous Kenya, "Atwoli said. His sentiments were echoed by Sossion who said the BBI should be reflected upon objectively and open discussions on how to improve the document. "We must close all our ranks and support BBI. If there are gaps there is room for correction as we endeavour to make this country a better place," Sossion said. Sossion said the BBI should provide a platform for all Kenyans to come on board and feel part of the process.
