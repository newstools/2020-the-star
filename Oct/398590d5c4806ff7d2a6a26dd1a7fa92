A woman who allegedly hurled insults at her landlady over rent has been charged with offensive conduct. Caroline Nyangâ€™au was charged with insulting Bilha Momanyi with words that hurt her person on October 10, in Lang'ata area. Nyang'au allegedly claimed that Momanyi was unable to bear children and threatened to stab her with a kitchen knife should she visit her house again to collect rent. She denied the charges before magistrate Philip Mutua and pleaded for lenient bond terms. The police reports showed that Momanyi reported the incident to Nyumba Kumi elders who later took the matter to the police after they failed to bring the two together. Mutua released her on Sh5,000 cash bail and directed the case to be mentioned on November 12.
