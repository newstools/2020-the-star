Outgoing Christ is the Answer Ministries (Citam) Bishop David Oginde has called upon the politicians in the country to be at the forefront in uniting Kenyans. Making his address on Monday at the Bomas of Kenya during the launch of the Building Bridges Initiative, Oginde pleaded with the politicians to allow the current proposals to lay a foundation for the future of the nation. "In this nation, we have a developed a very dangerous tendency of politicising everything even a very important matter as Constitution-making gets shrouded in political intrigues," Oginde said. He asked politicians to allow the current process to objectively lay a foundation for the future of this nation. "The laws you make today will tie your hands and feet tomorrow. The liberties you take away today will imprison you tomorrow,” he said. Oginde said that added that it is unfortunate that the politics of our nation is based on the divide and rule method. "Politicians somehow believe that the only way to succeed is to divide us into a dichotomous category of us versus them yet political interests shifts rapidly,” he said. The bishop said that the political formation in the country has been changing and that it will not be a surprise for Deputy President William Ruto to be on the same side with ODM leader Raila Odinga come the 2022 elections. “In fact, I want to prophesy that it will not be a surprise before 2022 that Dr William Ruto and Hon Raila Odinga will be on the same side.” Oginde used the opportunity to ask both Ruto and Raila antagonizing camps to put aside their differences and harmonize by performing the famous ‘Jerusalema’ dance challenge. “Perhaps it is time for hustlers to pause their hustling for a moment and the reggae dancers pause their dance for a moment and join together in a serious Jerusalema dance for the sake of peace and unity of this nation.”
