US ambassador to Kenya Kyle McCarter has said the world is hopeful it will defeat the coronavirus pandemic and asked Kenyans to follow health regulations to prevent more infections. Kyle said the pandemic should not discourage people from going on with their daily activities as long as they adhere the requirements laid down by the World Health Organization. “We should go on with our daily activities like farming as long as we adhere to social distancing, sanitising and wearing a mask,” he said after visiting capsicum farmers at Kabichbich in West Pokot county. He said he was impressed with how women engaged in farming and promised that his government will give them greenhouses to venture into farming. “We will add more greenhouses so that we can empower women. I am impressed that women in this region are hardworking and dedicated to farming,” he said. In 2018, the US established a greenhouse project to empower women in the region. The Ewan Kiror Women's Group has been engaging in tomato farming but due to challenges occasioned by the coronavirus pandemic, they diverted into capsicum farming. Capsicum has been in high demand lately in a number of hotels and supermarkets. The ambassador together with his wife and Governor John Lonyangapuo also visited Otupo Women's Group in Kapkoris. McCarter applauded the women's poultry project, terming it exemplary. He urged more women to engage in poultry farming. Victoria McCarter commended the women for working hard despite the hardships they encounter in the marginalised county. “Thank you for working hard to support your families. I’m impressed by your commitment and ensuring this project is successful,” she said. Lonyangapuo applauded the US government for empowering women in West Pokot.
