World record holder Eliud Kipchoge was beaten in the London Marathon as Shura Kitata won a thrilling sprint finish to claim an unexpected victory. Four-time winner Kipchoge was the favourite, but fell behind with two laps to go and finished eighth. Kitata pushed ahead of Kenya's Vincent Kipchumba on the home straight to finish in two hours five minutes and 41 seconds. The world had set all eyes on Eliud Kipchoge and Ethiopian Kenenisa Bekele who withdrew the day before due to injury. It was a shock to the world and more so to Kenyans who were watching the race across the country, waiting to see Kipchoge defending his London Marathon title, which did not happen. Kipchoge has won the London Marathon in a record of four times (2015, 2016, 2018, 2019) and was looking to bag his fifth title. Sisay Lemma from Ethiopia became third in 2:05:45closely followed by his counterpart Mosinet Geremew in 2:06:04. Ethiopians dominated the race as Mule Wasihun crossed the tape in 2:06:08 to finish at number five while his counterpart Tamirat Tola become sixth in 2:06:41. Another Kenyan Benson Kipruto became seventh in 2:06:41, followed closely by Kipchoge in seven seconds behind. Earlier in the women's elite London Marathon, Brigid Kosgei from Kenya defended her title. Kosgei, 26, went clear of world champion Ruth Chepngetich after mile 18 and finished in 2:18.58, three minutes and three seconds ahead of American Sara Hall. She was almost five minutes outside her world record set in Chicago last year. "The weather was not good, so we struggled," Kosgei, who earned $30,000 (Â£23,200) in prize money with her win, told BBC Sport. "I struggled up to the moment I finished. "We have not prepared well due to the pandemic. I will be prepared for good results next year." The London Marathon, rescheduled from its traditional April date because of the coronavirus pandemic, is taking place for elite runners only over 19 laps around St James's Park.
