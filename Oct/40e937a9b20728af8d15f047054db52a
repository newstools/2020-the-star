Bongo star Diamonds says he sold his mother's ring to record his first session. Speaking to Grammy.com, Diamond said his family never expected he would get to where he is now. "Penetrating the market and the game was very hard. I was coming up with ways I could get signed," he said. "My mum gave me a gold ring, and I had to sell that to get into the studio to pay for the first session." His first song wasn’t that good, but it led him to his first manager, who paid for his first album. He had his breakthrough with 'Number one' in 2009. "I’d work with different artistes, but Usher would be a dream come true to me," he said. On his collaboration with Alicia Keys on her 'Wasted Energy' song, Diamond said he felt nervous but is grateful.
