 Busia MCAs have approved a motion requiring all the county's 24 vocational training centres to each have a deputy principal. The MCAs unanimously adopted a report by the ECDE and VTC committee that made the recommendation. The report was tabled by committee vice-chairman John Obwogo in a session that was chaired by speaker Bernard Wamalwa. Obwogo said the deputy principal will be a member of the centres' academic boards and shall be appointed by the County Public Service Board. A board member will be removed if he or she misses three consecutive sittings without permission from the chairperson. The MCAs also approved amendments including a requirement that the institutions' board of governors be constituted by the Education executive. The CEC shall ensure the board has representation from youth, persons with disabilities, women, CBOs and faith-based organisations. The membership must not be more than nine. Obwogo said those seeking training in technical courses will be called students and not trainees as has been the case. He said the students should be offered industrial attachment. In the amendments tabled by deputy speaker Lawrence Okaale, a member of the board must be the holder of an “O” level certificate while the board chairman required to have at least a diploma qualification. The board members shall be paid in respect of their services. Remuneration or allowances shall be determined by the County Public Service Board in consultation with the Salaries and Remuneration Commission. MCAs Novena Ndaliro, Linus Asiba, Patrick Obuya and Grace Olita all said it was high time proper governance was instituted in the vocational centres.
