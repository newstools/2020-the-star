Muthaiga pro Greg Snow staged a stunning fight-back on Day 2 of Safari Tour at the Par 72 Royal Nairobi Golf Club course to jointly take the lead with Golf Park’s Eric Ooko. After false start on Day 1,  Snow was back in the groove, moving to the summit from 10th position on Monday. His scintillating play was something akin to what he did in Limuru last week, where he took the lead after the second round and ended up as the winner. Yesterday, Snow played a good round of 3 under par 69 for a gross total of 2 under par 142, which was the day’s best score. Ooko on the other hand, played 2 under 70 to savour the lead with Snow at halfway stage. Ooko was happy with his game but was left to rue the bogey he picked  on the 18th hole. “I lost my dad two months ago and I have been struggling to come to terms with the demise. It has affected my game quite a bit.  Today’s (yesterday) round was fine. I had a good opportunity to play six under but ended up with two under for the day. I didn’t putt well but I’m also glad that I hit 16 greens in regulation which gave me a good chance for birdies. However, things didn’t work out on the 18th hole where I dropped a shot,” Ooko said of his Day Two play. Amateur Mutahi Kibugi of Muthaiga settled for third spot after playing level par on Day One and 1 under yesterday. Mutahi, who played in last year’s European Tour Kenya Open at Karen Golf Club, was the only amateur who made the cut. Amateurs who missed the cut included Taimur Malik, deaf golfer Isaac Makokha, who is also the Kenya Amateur Match Play champion and fast-rising Naomi Wafula. Day One leader CJ Wangai dipped to sixth with a round of 3 over par 75. He is now on level par 144 gross. Yesterday’s round saw 24 out of the 58 make the cut to the next round. Last season’s Safari Tour overall winner, Dismas Indiza who has been struggling since the start of the 2020/21 Tour, was lucky to make the cut after settling for T21 with Abbey Bagaiana, Brian Njoroge and Nelson Simwa of Vet Lab. It was a bad day in the office for Indiza who has only managed high scores of 4 over par 76 on the first day and 3 over par 75 yesterday. He now has an unfamiliar total of 7 over par 151 gross. Among, those who missed the cut yesterday included Ganeev Giddie, who was the Day One leader at Limuru leg, Justus Madoya, Richard Ainley and Ugandan Philip Kasozi,  DAY TWO LEADERBOARD 1.
