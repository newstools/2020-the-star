Sharon Theafrican Muhonja, famously known as Muhonja, has released an emotional song called 'Unataka Nini'. Speaking to Word Is about the song, she said the song expresses what gender-based violence feels like in a relationship. "This experience is relatable over the years and especially this year, when people had to remain indoors after the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic," she said. "I had a very heavy heart when recording this song, especially the second verse, since that is among the things I went through in my relationship. "I had a very abusive partner and I lost myself trying to figure out what I should have done for him to treat me better." Her music inspiration in songwriting is majorly from her own life experiences and sometimes about her close friends.
