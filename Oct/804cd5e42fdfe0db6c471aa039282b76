CNN's business journalist Richard Quest finally tied the knot with his longtime male partner Chris Pepesterny. The popular journalist took to social media to express his joy at having said “I Do” to Chris, sharing a beautiful picture with his lover. Quest captioned the post; "We said ‘I Do’ at the weekend. Happiest day of our lives." The two lovers were forced to postpone their wedding in March but promised to tie the knot before the end of the year. "Today Chris and I were supposed to get married in London. Of course we had to postpone. Sad but necessary. We will marry later in the year, with a bigger party. I wanted to acknowledge how we are all facing such difficult times, in so many different ways. This too shall pass," he said then. The two got engaged in May 2019, after his lover agreed to the journalist’s marriage proposal. The Quest Means Business presenter visited Kenya in October 2018 where he opened up about his sexuality. In a radio, interview Quest said he was unapologetic for calling for the decriminalization of same-sex relationships in Kenya and other parts of the world. "I am going to be advancing an agenda that says there should be at least the decriminalization of same sexual activity. It is straight forward, I am not gonna mess around with that one. That is my belief," he said.
