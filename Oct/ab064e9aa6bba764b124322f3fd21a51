A doctor allegedly found conducting an abortion at a private health facility in Nairobi has been arrested. Jonah Morori of Prestige Health Points Medical Centre was arrested alongside his colleague, three nurses and a girl said to have procured an abortion in Ngara on Thursday. Officers from Pangani arrested the suspects after receiving a tip-off from members of the public. The officers recovered apparatus used to carry out abortions and several foetuses. Two girls found at the facility said they had procured abortions. One had paid Sh12,000 and the other Sh10,000. Upon questioning, Morori said the hospital belongs to a woman and is run by three doctors, including himself. Deputy police boss William Sirego said the six are locked up at Pangani police station. “The men had not produced any documents to prove that they were doctors. They have no registration numbers,” he said. Sirego said the girl arrested alongside the medics will be taken for testing before the suspects are arraigned. Sources told the Star that the hospital has been in operation for several years. Edited by Josephine M. Mayuya
