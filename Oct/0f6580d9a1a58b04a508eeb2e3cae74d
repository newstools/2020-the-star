US-based Kenyan rising star Grace Wacuka has dropped her first single, 'Run Dem', off her upcoming EP, 'The I am Wacuka Project'. Speaking about the song, she said, "Run Dem was written when I felt I was on top of the game and so completely in control. "Since this year has been hard for so many, I thought the song would be a great way to say 'we still got this' to the universe, and for everyone who needs to find a reason to dance." Besides music, Wacuka is a budding movie film actor currently doing her Masters in Acting at Columbia University. She has been featured in several movies, most recently the internationally acclaimed, 'A New Christmas' that premiered at The HBO South Asian International Film Festival in New York.
