An Uasin Gishu MCA who succumbed to Covid-19 last week was buried yesterday. However, Public Health officials however cancelled a public viewing of the body that was to take place at the Uasin Gishu County Assembly yesterday. “We will abide by all the guidelines given to us by the government as we give our leader a befitting send off," said Lenny Chomba, a brother of the deceased. Chomba served Huruma Ward for almost 20 years as councillor and later MCA. More than 10,000 people were expected to attend his funeral service at Huruma grounds in Eldoret. Earlier, the funeral organising committee said in a statement that the service would be brief and all Covid-19 regulations would be followed. “We also expect brief speeches focusing on peace and unity as he always wished,” said a statement from the committee. DP William Ruto was among those expected at the funeral service but his team did not confirm his attendance. Chomba was a close ally of the DP. Chomba died at the Eldoret hospital where he had rushed for treatment. His family confirmed that he had died of Covid-19. His family members and staff and MCAs at the Uasin Gishu assembly have undergone Covid-19 tests. “He served Eldoret and the region with a lot of dedication and we will give him what we equate to a county state funeral in appreciation of his work in Huruma ward and the entire region,” said Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago. Uasin Gishu assembly speaker David Kiplagat suspended sittings for 21 days so that staff and MCAs could go for testing.
