Muthaiga's Greg Snow finally rediscovered his form with the day's best round to move from an unfamiliar joint ninth to second spot on Day Two of Safari Tour season opener at Limuru Country Club. But Snow had to contend with playing second fiddle to Day One joint leader Ganeev Giddie, whose decent round of 1 under par 71 handed him a one stroke advantage over the former. Snow and newly-turned pro Samuel Njoroge were the star attractions though with the best rounds of 4 under par 68 in what turned out to be a dramatic day at the par 72 Limuru course. Snow was overly excited that his good form had handed him a fine chance of starting the season on a high. He was, nevertheless, left to rue some few bad shots particularly on the sixth and seventh of the front nine. “I hit two bad fairway shots on those two holes, but generally my game is fine, and I will be very happy to try and win a couple of events this season,’’ said Snow, who got off with two quick birdies at the first and third holes before tumbling at the sixth and seventh. The back nine was, however, his best in the second round as he was able to make birdies at the 13th, 14th, 15th and the last two holes (17th and 18th). At the 18th, Snow hit his second shot to the right side of the green, chipped onto about three feet, to pick an easy birdie. “The course is playing well as the greens have finally improved compared to last week and in the first round, so am looking forward to try and get some more birdies in the last two rounds’’ added Snow. After sharing the lead with Golf Park’s Jacob Okello and David Wakhu in the opening round, Muthaiga Golf Club’s  Giddie posted one under par 71 for a two-rounds total of under par 141, taking a one shot lead from tournament favourite Snow. On his way to the day’s 71, Giddie made three birdies, one at the front nine and two at the back nine, having also dropped two shots. He will now lead the field of 21 players, who made the second round cut which was decided on seven over par 151. On the other hand, Vet Lab Sports Club’s Robinson Owiti shot two under par 70, to move to third place on 143 having started off with one over par 73 in the opening round. However, one of the three first round leaders, Wakhu, picked a double six at the 13th, having dropped a shot at the 10th and earlier on at the sixth hole. “My putting was not so good today as I missed a number of birdie chances, but not to worry, I will work on my putts and hopefully I should be able to play well in the next two rounds’’ said Wakhu, who managed three birdies for a three-way tie with Vet Lab’s Mathew Omondi and new-comer Samuel Njoroge, who turned professional just a week ago. Njoroge had a fine round of four under par 68 for a two rounds total of level par 144. “I am very excited making cut in my very first tournament, it feels great," said Njoroge, of Kenya Railway Golf Club. "I have been practising as I had qualified to play in the Magical Kenya Open as an amateur but since it was cancelled, I decided to turn professional." He started the day with a birdie at the second hole, eagled the par five-third, birdied the ninth after dropping a shot at the seventh. He later birdied the 10th, 12th and 18th. “This course is a bit challenging compared to Royal but I am happy I started well here, I hope I can replicate this form at Royal,’’ added Njoroge. The other day one leader, Okello, shot four over par 76 to drop to eighth though still with a good chance of making his way back to the top in the remaining two rounds.
