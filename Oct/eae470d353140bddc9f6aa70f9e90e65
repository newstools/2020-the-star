Kanduyi MP Wafula Wamunyinyi has told Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang’ula to forget ever getting back the FORD-K party leadership. Wamunyinyi was addressing mourners in Bungoma town over the weekend during the burial of former Bungoma Municipal mayor Eliud Wanyonyi. He emphasised that the party’s National Executive Council (NEC) made the changes and it should be redeemed to attract more members. "He had enough time but he never rejuvenated the party,” said Wamunyinyi. "We want to help the party. Aspirants will be picked according to their ability to lead,” said Wamunyinyi. He pointed out that Wetang’ula announced a run for the presidency in 2013, 20 17 and now in 2022 but he has never been on the ballot. The legislator said the Bungoma senator has been running for presidency without ever starting the race. “Wetang’ula doesn’t understand Ford Kenya politics, I will convene the National Delegates Congress to teach him a lesson by kicking him out, let him stop campaigning in Bungoma alone,” said the lawmaker. Bungoma Governor Wycliffe Wangamati, Tongaren MP Eseli Simiyu and Wamunyinyi staged a coup in Ford-K to remove Moses Wetang’ula as the party leader, which led to court battles. On Covid-19, Wamunyinyi asked the government to utilise the budget set aside for travelling allowances abroad for MPs, MCAs and different departmental heads. “Plans are underway to open schools but they lack infrastructures. Let the funds that had been set aside for travel be used,” he said. Wamunyinyi said the funds set aside should be used to purchase masks for learners. “There is a new wave of Corona, the last three days it has hit 10 per cent. The money will be used to address them challenges in our schools,” he said.
