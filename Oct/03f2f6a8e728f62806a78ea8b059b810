Former IEBC boss James Oswago on Wednesday told an anti-corruption court that he did not sign an amended contract for the supply of voter kits meant for the March 4, 2013 General Election. Oswago, while being cross-examined by the prosecution, said the only contract he signed was that of December 11, 2012, for the delivery of 30,000 devices but later a board meeting was held and approved an additional 4,600 gadgets. He was, however, not part of the decision to procure more. Oswago is defending himself over accusations of failing to ensure the changes made to the contract awarded to Face Technologies Limited by the IEBC for the supply of Electronic Voter Identification. Tender No. IEBC14/2011-2012 was approved by the agency's tender committee. He and IEBC deputy commissioner Wilson Shollei were in May this year put on their defense after the prosecution called 36 witnesses. The court, however, acquitted Edward Kenga Karisa and Willy Gachanja Kamanga after establishing no case had been made against them. Oswago and Shollei are also accused of using their offices to improperly confer a benefit on Face Technologies Limited by approving payment of Sh1,397,724,925 for the supply of EVIDs without ascertaining that the devices supplied were inspected, accepted and met the technical specifications in the contract. But Oswago maintains that it was not his role to inspect the goods. He also said that he was never made aware when the devices were delivered to the warehouse. “I only became aware of the deliveries when they were being used at Kasarani. When they were delivered in the warehouse, nobody told me these items had been delivered,” he said. Edited by Henry Makori
