Eliud Owalo has launched the ‘hustler’ coordinating team in Siaya County on behalf of Deputy President William Ruto. Owalo said the team will spearhead Ruto’s 2022 presidential agenda. The team consists of youth and women leaders including traders, professionals, opinion leaders drawn from different sectors, elders, the clergy; disability groups, and representatives of other integral stakeholder groups. During the launch on Saturday held in Siaya town, Owalo emphasized that the immediate challenge facing the local community is high levels of unemployment among the youth as well as lack of business opportunities for women. He said that the meeting agreed with Ruto that the creation of political positions for ‘the high and mighty' is an irritating irrelevance for the country at this point in time. Owalo used the opportunity to inform the group about Ruto’s economic empowerment agenda for the region. The team is being led by the chairperson Pamela Ongoma, the vice-chairman of the Luo Council of Elders Tobias Achando and the Supreme Archbishop of the Nomiya Faith Churches Calleb Olali; Academician Dr. Chris Ochieng Ngwae. The members of the team include the micro and small enterprises, youth and women leaders as well as the disadvantaged groups. Over the week, Owalo's team merged with Mcdonald Mariga's team, which were former rivals for the Kibra by-elections. A statement from Eliud Owalo on Wednesday said his team together with Mcdonald Mariga's team held a working session with a multi-faceted team of leaders and decided to consolidate efforts as they support DP William Ruto. “We will now have only one strong and united Kibra’ Hustler- team informed by the amalgamation-working objectively and tirelessly toward Bill Ruto 2022,” Owalo said.
