The government wants to ride on the global recognition of Kenyan athletes to market the country as a preferred tourist destination. Tourism CS Najib Balala said this during a visit to the North Rift Economic Bloc region counties of Uasin Gishu, Nandi, and Elgeyo Marakwet on Saturday where he toured training facilities. “Our athletes make a big name for us overseas whenever they win, especially marathons. That is why we shall put together a team to document all athletes in Kenya since Independence to honour them. We will use these athletes to promote tourism.” The CS further said the ministry is looking into identifying, developing, and marketing the North Rift Economic Bloc counties – Uasin Gishu, Elgeyo Marakwet, Nandi, Trans Nzoia, West Pokot, Turkana, Baringo, and Samburu – as a tourism hub. In order to achieve this, the CS said each county needs to identify two prime products to market. CS Balala was accompanied by Chief Administrative Secretary Joseph Boinnet,  Tourism PS Safina Kwekwe, Wildlife PS Fred Segor and other senior ministry officials. Kwekwe said, “The potential is high. Our duty and privilege is to turn potential to wealth and enrich the livelihoods of the people residing in the Noreb region.” Nandi Governor Stephen Sang said the region has potential for sports tourism, cultural tourism and agritourism. He said he is looking forward to a partnership between the Ministry of Tourism and Noreb to open up the region. The CS promised to engage with the Ministry of Environment to improve the forest road in Kaptagat used by many athletes to train. The CS later launched Sergoit View Gardens, a community-based initiative that is a cycling, hiking, and trekking base camp.
