The Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists’ Union has endorsed the strike by the University Academic Staff Union. The resolution was reached on Wednesday following a meeting between KMPDU and its members (doctor lecturers and post-graduate students) of the University of Nairobi, College of Health Sciences. KMPDU acting secretary general Chibanzi Mwachonda said they agreed that all  members should withdraw their services immediately until the union communicates the next course of action. Also, the registrars in all departments shall withdraw their services from the Kenyatta National Hospital as well as the Mathari National Teaching and Referral Hospital with immediate effect. The union will hold its assembly on Friday, regarding the same situation. The seven-day strike notice that had been issued by Uasu will end on Thursday. Uasu secretary general Constantine Wasonga had said that clinical allowances had been withdrawn and only a few members had been paid their dues. The union accuses the UoN vice chancellor Stephen Kiama of stopping lecturers’ clinical allowances based on a list submitted to him by the Kenyatta National Hospital CEO. Wasonga said although some members had received their allowances, it was unjust to pay selectively. “Some of the academic staff have received reduced allowances while others have been given the whole amount but are not guaranteed of being paid in future,” Wasonga said.
