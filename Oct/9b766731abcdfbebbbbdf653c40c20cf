Singer Nandy and her long-time boyfriend, rapper Billnas, were engaged early this year. Billnas proposed to her on live TV. But since then the two have been rumoured to be on and off. At some point, Nandy was spotted without her ring and fans thought it was over between the two. But the singer has explained that her ring was stolen while she was performing at a campaign rally. "I havenâ€™t worn the ring for some time now because when I was in Tanga for a political campaign, a fan removed it and even removed one of my nails," she said. Billnas said he will give her another ring but this time he will do it in a better way. The two, who were interviewed by Clouds FM, said they use the same passwords on their phones and have no secrets between them.
