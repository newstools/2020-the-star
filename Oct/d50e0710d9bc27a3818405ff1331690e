Kenya Hockey Union (KHU) secretary-general, Wycliffe Ongori has expressed fear that they are likely to cancel the league all together owing to the current Covid-19 situation in the country. He, however, said the union will hold a meeting with stakeholders soon to chart the way forward once the Sports Cabinet Secretary, Amina Mohammed gives the way forward. The league has been on hold since March when all sporting activities were suspended due to coronavirus pandemic. "We hope to sit down with team managers and club presidents to chart the way forward but practically, completing the league is not possible. Players could be involved in competitions like the five-aside tournament just to refresh them." The move could, however,Â  come as a big blow to national teams who were planning to use the league to regain their fitness ahead of the North East Africa qualifiers for the African Cup of Nations. Ongori though hinted that national teams could play in local friendlies. "International matches at this point in time are difficult to organise. All countries are coming from lockdown and some like Ghana and Nigeria have called off their leagues. We will do what is best for the players," he added. The KHU League started on February 29 and was expected to end late next month. By the time the first case was reported in March, the Men's top tier league had not started. However, their women counterparts, Super League in both categories and the men's national league were in action. Ongori is impressed with certain clubs who are doing small group training and is hopeful that national team players will be match-fit and competitive for the Africa show. "I know certain clubs that are doing small group training and I am happy for them because as a sports person, your body needs training. It's the responsibility of every club to assess their players and ensure they are in better shape."
