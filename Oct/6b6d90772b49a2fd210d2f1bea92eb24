Nearly all pupils expected back to Tinganga Model Primary School in Kiambu county reported back on Monday. Standard 8 and Grade 4 pupils reported to school at around 6am. They were screened for high temperatures and allowed to enter classes. Teachers were waiting when the pupils arrived. Samuel Muiruri, the head teacher, said 98 per cent of pupils reported back. For those who did not report, parents confirmed that their children will go to school tomorrow. "Only about four did not report and their parents called to confirm that their children will report since they had travelled," Muiruru said. He said that they are adhering to safety guidelines but they have fewer thermo guns to screen temperature. "I bought three thermo guns with my own money since we were not provided for by the ministry. The school needs like 18 of them since one is supposed to measure more than 20 pupils. In Standard 8, we have 98 pupils and in Grade 4, we have 92," Muiruri said. He said that schools should be provided with face masks to cater for the pupils who do not have. Other head teachers in Kiambu are concerned that it will not be practical to observe social distancing due to classroom shortages. Toilets facilities and water in most schools are also inadequate.
