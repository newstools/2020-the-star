A man put on death row for stabbing his wife to death after she denied him tea will instead serve 30 years imprisonment after winning his appeal. Isaac Mwangi was convicted on January 30, 2017 and sentenced to death for killing Loise Adoyo. Aggrieved by the decision, Mwangi appealed the sentence. Appeal judges Fatuma Sichale, J Mohammed and Sankale ole Kantai ruled that the death sentence is still lawful under the Constitution but the distinction made by the Supreme Court in the case of Francis Karioko Muruatetu is that the mandatory nature of the sentence is unlawful. “The record clearly shows that the learned trial judge did not exercise his discretion in sentencing the appellant as he considered himself bound by the death penalty provided under Section 204 of the Penal Code,” they ruled. The judges also noted that the appellant was a first offender. In his submission,  he admitted to inflicting injuries on his wife and said he was remorseful. “Nevertheless the gravity of offence cannot be understated,” the judges ruled. According to the prosecution, the two had been married for two years. Mwangi sold cabbages in Muthurwa market, Nairobi, while the wife owned a food stall in the same market. On the morning of November 18, 2008  Judith Omusungu found Mwangi and the wife quarreling in the food stall. Mwangi accused her of failing to spend the previous night at home and demanded a cup of tea but she refused. The wife called market security who forcibly removed Mwangi from the stall. Later John Muchoki who owned a neighbouring stall heard a scream. He turned and saw Adoyo falling down as Mwangi ran away. She was rushed to Kenyatta National Hospital where she died. Dr Joseph Njuguna who conducted an autopsy produced a postmortem report indicating that the deceased had a stab wound extending from the upper part of the abdomen to the right side of the chest through the right lung, which had partially collapsed.
