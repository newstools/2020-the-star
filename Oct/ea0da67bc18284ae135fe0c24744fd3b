When the gun-totting al Shabaab men opened fire at Joy In Jesus church in 2013, Satrine Osinya, then two years old, was attending the service with his brother and mother. While shielding her young Satrine, the mother was killed by bullets, one of which went into Satrine’s head. A photo of his elder brother Gift carrying him at Coast General Hospital went viral, drawing sympathy, with many criticising the attack. A week later, the bullet was removed at the Kenyatta National Hospital in a three-hour surgery by Amref personnel. Six years later, Satrin is now 8, healthy and bubbly. He has shrugged off the effects of the attack that saw his mother and five others killed. While celebrating his birthday in May, Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko, who adopted Satrine and his brother, said, “For the six years we have been together, you have brought laughter, hope and joy into our family. "There’s nothing more exciting and satisfying than seeing you grow and turn into such an amazing, smart boy. “As a family, you have been a blessing to us. You continue to amaze us and we will forever treasure the day you came into our lives. Happy 8th birthday, my Son.” Sonko called on students going back to school to draw inspiration from the story of Baby Satrine, who rose from the ruins of a terror attack to academic brilliance. “He should always be an inspiration to our children and students that we can rise from our troubles to live a better life,” he said. Sonko has promised to cater for all his education needs to university level. Satrine graduated from Runda Oak kindergarten in November 2018 and was expecting to complete his grade two studies this year. He aspires to be an engineer when he grows up. The governor called on well-wishers to help those who are financially unable to cater for special needs children. “I know the government is going to release funds but sometimes it’s never enough, so let’s try to help one another,” Sonko said.
