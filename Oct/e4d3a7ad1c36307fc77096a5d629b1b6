Sorrow and grief engulfed Khusinyenye village in Bunyala West Ward during an Inter-denominational service for the six people who perished in Lake Victoria boat tragedy. Those who perished in the tragic accident included one year old Evans Okumu, Evans Oundo (38) and David Muluka( 47). Others were Brigit Wanyama (9) from Buduma in Uganda and Lucy Jomo from Obekai in Teso South. Busia Deputy Governor, Moses Mulomi represented Governor Sospeter Ojaamong at the service. There were seven survivors who also recalled how they escaped death. The County Government of Busia purchased coffins for the six victims and cleared mortuary bills. Mulomi said it was unfortunate to lose many lives in one day noting that the boat capsized due to high tides. "It is also important to have a system of records on the movement of boats or any delays thereof, this will help to detect any mishap in the lake," he said. The DG promised to intervene and have the speedboat that ply the lake be repaired so as to help in case of emergencies, adding that there is also need to escalate emergency rescues.
