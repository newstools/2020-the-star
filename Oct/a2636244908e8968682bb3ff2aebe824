A section of Kwale drug users has decried being sidelined in the Kazi Mtaani employment opportunities. In April, the government rolled out an economic recovery initiative known as the National Hygiene Programme or Kazi Mtaani to cushion youths from the effects of coronavirus. The recovering drug users said corona equally disrupted their income-generating activities as majority were working as beach boys along the Diani beach. The Covid-19 pandemic hit the tourism sector, forcing hotels to close after the number of tourists dwindled. Led by Ahmed Saidi, they said drug addicts have been completely left out of development programmes. According to Saidi, the drug users especially the recovering ones, are not given priority when seeking government jobs. "So many beneficial projects come and go and this particular group is not included, " he said. The county has over 4,500 drug addicts and 800 are on methadone in Kombani and Teens Watch Centre. About 3,480 use drugs by injection method. Saidi said the government should consider hiring at least 30 per cent of the addicts to the Kazi Mtaani. He said by economically empowering them insecurity will drastically go down. More than 13 drug addicts have been beaten almost to death by mobs from March to date, Saidi said. He said unemployment is one of the many challenges driving them to commit criminal activities. “It is so sad that many of us are being alienated by society, forcing some to steal to sustain themselves,” he said. Kibwana Mohammed said people treat them like trash and they live an isolated life. He said they would want to live a decent life but due to neglect, they opt to continue with the drug lifestyle. Sauti Ya Wanawake chairperson Mwanakombo Jarumani urged the county government to set aside development funds specifically for the drug addicts. She said the county should also come up with rules to protect drug users from harm. Edited by Henry Makori
