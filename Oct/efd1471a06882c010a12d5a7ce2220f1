Two boys from different families drowned in a quarry where they were swimming in Ndiru village, Homa Bay Town constituency. Eugene Okoth and Steve Joshua, both aged four, died on Wednesday evening. The minors died in the flooded quarry due to heavy rain that has been pounding the area. The minors are said to have gone swimming. It was reported that they left home in the absence of their parents who were away at work. A resident said they became suspicious when they saw abandoned children’s clothes at the edge of the quarry. They could see the children struggling to find an object to hold on to before they sank in the water. “I started raising the alarm after realising that something was wrong with the children. Unfortunately, we couldn’t manage to rescue them,” a resident said. Kanyach Kachar chief Benard Omuga called police officers from Rodi Kopany police post who took the bodies to Homa Bay County Referral Hospital mortuary. Police arrested some residents for questioning over the deaths. “This is not the first time we are losing children in quarries. Let parents monitor the movement of their children because the quarries are dangerous," Omuga said. Edited by Henry Makori
