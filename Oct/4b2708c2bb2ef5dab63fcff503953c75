Webuye West MP Dan Wanyama has urged the government to set up a police post in Misikhu ward to end insecurity in Mukhe and Sirende areas. Speaking to the press during Mashujaa Day celebrations on Tuesday at Matulo Friends Secondary School, the legislator said a gang of criminals known as Seventeen Brothers has been terrorising residents. "I urge the county commissioner to intervene and help put up a police post within the two areas," he said. Bungoma county commissioner Samuel Kimiti said he would ensure insecurity in Mukhe and Sirende in Misikhu ward is addressed. Wanyama urged school principals not to send away learners whose parents are unable to pay fees. He further said the Ministry of Education should ensure there are adequate desks in schools to allow social distancing. He said no school has received desks from the ministry even after the Cabinet Secretary rolled out the initiative. Edited by A.N
