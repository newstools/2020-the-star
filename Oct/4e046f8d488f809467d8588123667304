Thirteen health workers have tested positive for Covid-19 in Vihiga county, chief officer for Medical Services Arnold Mamadi has said. They are among 67 Covid-19 cases in the county. Mamadi told the Star on phone on Wednesday that information circulating on social media is fake. “We have temporarily closed the health offices on the fourth floor but that should not create anxiety among county residents,” Mamadi said. "We are fumigating the offices to ensure our county residents are safe.” Mamadi said fighting the virus was a collective responsibility for all residents of the county. He urged the public not to panic but to comply with the Covid -19 regulations, saying it was the only way to combat the virus. Mamadi said the county government has been doing mass testing of residents to curb the spread of the virus.
