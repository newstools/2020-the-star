AIPCA church has announced an election date for new leaders, to end wrangles that have been witnessed from 2017. Addressing the media in Nairobi yesterday, a group led by Archbishops Julius Njoroge, Samson Muthuri and Fredrick Wang’ombe, said they want to end the historical fights that have been dividing their followers. Archbishop Julius Njoroge said leadership wrangles have affected the church and the election will end the stalemate. “We want to announce a new beginning, and we are announcing to our followers that we are now united than ever, from now we will have three church services for everyone to feel accommodated in the new peace agreement deal," he said. He said that a group of experts has been working for the new handshake and within three days they will announce a new beginning. “AIPCA church will be united and our followers should respect each leader, the election will determine who among us will be our national leader and the remaining two will support him deliver the church mission,” Archbishop Njoroge said. He added that the church constitution allows the elected leader to serve for five years only. He said whoever will be elected will be giving the directives for followers to have one line of command. The difference between the camps has been huge as the three Archbishops have been working separately. Since their difference emerged in 2017, Archbishop Njoroge has been working from Diocese of Thika while his two counterparts have been working from the church’s traditional headquarters in Bahati, Nairobi. President Uhuru Kenyatta had earlier appointed retired bishops Lawi Imathiu and Peter Njenga of Methodist Church to lead the talks but the process failed. In the flopped conflict resolution process, Njoroge, Wang’ombe and Muthuri had agreed to have the church divided into three main archdioceses headed by each of them. They would also have one of them as the national archbishop.
