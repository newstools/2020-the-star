Bungoma government officials have faulted Senator Moses Wetang'ula after he questioned how Sh213 million Covid-19 funds given to the county was spent. Wetang'ula had last weekend raised the red flag over the use of money disbursed by the national government to Bungoma, saying the county government had failed to account for it. “I have been moving around Bungoma and surprisingly, I don’t see anything that was done with all that money. Not even a single mask,” the senator said. Wetang'ula said every time he questioned the use of public resources in the county, Governor Wycliffe Wangamati attacked him and starts propaganda that he wanted to unseat him. But Health executive Antony Walela and his chief officer Wandili Patrick said the remarks by the Ford Kenya leader were untrue and base on emotions. “No money has been lost because out of the entire amount, only 25 per cent was used in installing quarantine and isolation centres as directed by the national government,” Walela said. Walela and Wandili clarified that the money was a conditional grant and conditions had been set for specific purposes. “We couldn't buy masks or do anything because that was not acceptable,” Wandili said. The duo said it was impossible for any government to purchase masks for all its people because that was not manageable. “Assuming a mask goes for Sh10 and you buy for one million people daily, how do you even manage that?” Wandili asked. He said they weren’t worried because currently auditors from national government were present and will give them a clean bill of health. Wandili further blamed procurement bureaucracies as reason why they had not spent the entire amount. The officials said so far Bungoma county had carried 1,819 tests and only 67 turned positive.
