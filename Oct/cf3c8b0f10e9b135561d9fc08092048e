A Bungoma Kenya Union of Post Primary Education Teachers official has opposed reopening of schools on Monday, saying parents and most learning institutions are not prepared. Bungoma Kuppet executive secretary Augustine Luketelo said the announcement by Education CS George Magoha was ill-timed and the ministry did not do proper consultation. He spoke during the burial ceremony of Rodgers Wakukha in Kimaeti ward, Bumula constituency. In a circular on Tuesday, Magoha announced the phased reopening of schools starting October 12. The CS said schools will Monday be opened for Grade 4, Standard 8 and Form 4 students. Other classes will resume at a later date. The students will open on October 12 for second term until December 23, open again on January 4, 2021, until March 19 for the third term. However, the unionist said the notice given to parents for the reopening was not enough. “Covid-19 has dealt parents a huge blow, the economy has crumbled and they have no school fees,” Luketelo said. He said most schools also required renovations as they had stayed for long without being inhabited. “If the government is sure of reopening schools, let it use the remaining Covid-19 funds to pay school fees for our students,” Luketelo said. He warned principals against expelling students home for fees because parents are poor and cannot afford getting it now. The official further urged parents to enroll their children in technical institutes. “Let them enroll and acquire technical skills because the government has subsidised technical education through provision of Sh30,000 bursary and Sh16,000 pocket money,” the unionist said. All schools closed in March following the outbreak of Covid-19. Edited by A.N
