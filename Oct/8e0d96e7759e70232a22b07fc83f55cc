Women leaders have asked President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga to ensure BBI addresses gender representation in leadership positions in the country. Led by Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu, the women said, for instance, the executive under BBI must embrace the two-thirds principle. They were speaking at Bomas of Kenya on Monday during the launch of the BBI report. Ngilu said the Judiciary should also ensure that the rule is adhered to in their top leadership. She said the current Constitution did not conclusively give guidelines on how the two-thirds rule was to be achieved. "Ten years down the line, a time has come for us to review what has not worked and change it. This is a timely way to bring all Kenyans on board through the BBI," Ngilu said. She said BBI recommendations are timely as they seek to increase resource allocations to the grassroots. "Extra resources to the grassroots by 35 per cent will see Kenya move. With these resources and proper utilisation we can implement the Big 4 Agenda of food security, affordable housing, healthcare and manufacturing while we do away with small handouts from the political class," she said. Her sentiments were echoed by Likoni MP Mishi Mboko who said the report will elevate more women into leadership. Mboko said currently there are 16 nominated Senators but with 47 senators more women will be elected. She said the BBI seeks to introduce a formula to achieve the two-thirds gender rule is achieved. "Let us not be swayed bu insults, mockery or conmanship but read the report and make an informed decision, If we disagree, let us come together and have a healthy discussion," she said. Nyamira MCA Nyakerario Omollo said there should be no manoeuvres and variances while implementing the BBI proposals. She said having a vibrant Youth Commission will play a key role in ensuring that matters affecting the young people are addressed at the national level.
