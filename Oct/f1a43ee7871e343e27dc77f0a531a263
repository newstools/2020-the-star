Investigations have been launched after a suspect who had been arrested and released for assaulting a police officer was found dead in River Nzoia, Kakamega County. Investigations reveal that Dennis Lusava was arrested onÂ October 7, 2020, by officers from Mbururu police post before he was released. The Independent Medico-Legal Unit has joined investigations into the death of the man and says they will push for justice. His arrest prompted a protest at the police station by an angry mob which burnt it down last week. His body was found floating on River Nzoia and taken to Webuye Hospital Mortuary days later. Imlu boss Peter Kiama says they have reasons to believe that the officers at Mbururu police post who arrested and are alleged to have tortured him are responsible for his enforced disappearance while in their custody and to his eventual death. He wants independent investigations of the circumstances behind the arrest, detention, torture, enforced disappearance and death of Dennis in police custody, and expedited arrest and prosecution of officers found culpable. Eighteen suspects were arrested over the torching of the police post.
