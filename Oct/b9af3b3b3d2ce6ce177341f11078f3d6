Persons with disabilities are angry with the BBI report for scrapping special seats meant for them. Nominated Senator Isaac Mwaura on Tuesday said they were preparing a memorandum to be submitted to the Building Bridges Initiative Steering Committee for consideration. “We hope this committee will be formed so that we can officially present our memorandum,” he said. Mwaura, who represents PWDs at the Senate said they were very disappointed with the manner the BBI team drafted the amendments to the Constitution. “We have lost representation in the Senate, National Assembly and county assemblies,” he said after chairing a meeting. The senator termed the BBI report a mockery to PWD’s and special interest groups “The 70 special seats are not for special interest groups. People will compete for them and if you go to the ground, people with disabilities are disadvantaged because of stigma, discrimination and poverty,” he said. The lawmaker said PWDs have lost gains achieved in 2013. “We need to have conversations and give our proposals. This document has taken away all our gains.” During the weekend, Mwaura led persons with disabilities in demanding the return of nominated slots meant for people with disabilities. “Senate should reserve at least five seats for persons with disabilities; 18 seats in National Assembly, four MCAs, one Cabinet secretary, two principal secretaries should be persons with disabilities," he said. Nominated MP David Ole Sankok urged all disabled persons to reject the BBI report until their considerations are incorporated. "BBI has scrapped slots for the nomination of PWDs. We’ll mobilise all persons with disabilities to reject the report," Sankok said.
