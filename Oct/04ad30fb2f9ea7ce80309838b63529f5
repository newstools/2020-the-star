A woman has been charged with stealing Sh70,000 sent to her M-Pesa by mistake. Titiya Bonaya is accused of stealing the money which was sent to her number by Catherine Wathome on July 17 this year. She denied the charge before Kibera senior resident magistrate Charles Mwaniki on Friday. Police investigations show that the complainant contacted Bonaya after she realised she had sent the cash to the wrong number. Bonaya, according to police, confirmed she had received the amount but refused to return the money to the owner. Wathome reported the matter to Capitol Hill police station, leading to the arrest of Bonaya. Mwaniki ordered Bonaya released on Sh100,000 bond or Sh50,000 bail. The case will be mentioned on October 16.
