Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu has been commended for empowering micro, small and medium enterprises. The praise came from Senate Majority leader Samuel Poghisio, who paid a courtesy call on the governor on Tuesday. Poghisio said Ngilu's efforts would create jobs and wealth. The Senate leader was shown some of the apparel and products produced by local entrepreneurs, most of them youths, through the support of the county government. Ngilu said her administration encouraged the production and manufacture of consumables to cut the importation of goods and save foreign exchange. She encouraged other counties to emulate Kitui and create jobs through local production of goods and that way save the country foreign exchange. "The counties have a huge potential to invest in the manufacturing sector and should produce most consumables. We must end the importation of the most basic commodities," she said.  - mwaniki fm
