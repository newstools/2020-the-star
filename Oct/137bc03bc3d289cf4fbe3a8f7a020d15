Kenya Simbas management have embarked on building team ethos ahead of the resumption of activities. “Building a team without ethos is like building a castle on quicksand. Without a foundation, it will all come tumbling down,” said head coach Paul Odera. Odera and his staff have been working on a manual that gives a clear understanding of the team and what it believes in; a Simbas culture. In May this year, the Kenya Rugby Union published what was the genesis of the manual and what it aims to address as well as its circulation. "The idea, which is an amalgamation of the intellectual capacity of the whole management team, first came to Mike Aung and I in 2015. We saw how Namibia and Zimbabwe were operating in the final of the Barthes Cup in Harare and we decided that a manual would be a good start for us to get to Namibia and Zimbabwe’s level,” said Odera. The manual covers strength and conditioning, medical, mental skills, defence, attack, forward play, backline play, general skills, management and will soon include a match officials' section. Odera intends to use the manual for the duration of his tenure as Simbas’ head coach. “However, what is important is that we keep reviewing it constantly so that it evolves and adapts not only to our Kenyan environment but to the international environment as well,” he added. The team has included Simbas ethos as part of the content in the manual. “We considered having the ethos as part of the manual, because a strong culture and values are the foundation of making a team," he said. "The overall goal is to have the manual distributed to all regions in the country as a way of spreading the rugby gospel far and wide. The manual will also be translated into as many local dialects as possible.”
