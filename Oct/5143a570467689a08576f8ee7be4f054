President Uhuru Kenyatta has indicated that no stone will be left unturned in the ongoing investigations regarding the loss of public funds at the Kenya Medical Supplies Authority. The President made the remarks during an interview with France 24 Television on Thursday while on his official visit to France. He said that his administration took action once the story surrounding Kemsa emerged. “We have put in place all the necessary mechanisms, empowered the necessary agencies with full authority to complete their investigations, to make their report public and to prosecute anybody who may have been involved in any kind of misuse. No stone unturned,” Uhuru said. The president added that once the report has been finalized, the public should be informed about the entire issue and not to be issued to a certain individual. His remarks come as the Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji returns files of the probe to the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission for further investigations. The DPP said his office had finalised reviewing files of alleged beneficiaries of the alleged scandal at Kemsa and upon review, it emerged that the scope of the investigations was massive. Several witnesses, entities, and thousands of documents were examined. In a statement on Friday, Haji said that his office received the files containing six names of senior officials at Kemsa from the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission. “The team identified key areas that need to be sufficiently covered by way of further investigations before a final decision can be made,” Haji said. The President had given EACC a period of 21 days to carry out its full investigations to unravel the beneficiaries of the public funds amid the deadly virus. Kemsa has been on highlights for alleged irregular procurement and fraudulent payments that led to the loss of Sh7.8 billion.
