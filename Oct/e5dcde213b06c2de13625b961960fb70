Water shortage has hurt services at Vihiga County Referral Hospital over the last one and a half weeks. The hospital is relying on a 20,000-litre capacity lorry to supply water. Health executive Amos Kutwa said the water supplied by the lorry is not enough to serve the entire facility. “We have got 20,000 litres supply from Maji House, but it’s not enough,” he said. A source told the Star that staff members have threatened to go on strike if water is not provided. The crisis comes at a time when the country is fighting Covid-19 and water is an essential commodity in the war. Kutwa said he has engaged Water executive Inonda Mwanje, who has promised to resolve the problem within the shortest time possible. Water and Sanitation chief officer Clement Manyulu said the shortage was due to a pump breakdown at Lunyerere water supply. “We are optimistic that a lasting solution will be found by December this year.  Four water pumps are being installed at Lunyerere water supply to ensure constant water supply in all parts of the county,” he said in his statement. In the meantime, Manyulu said, they are working on a short-term solution to restore the water supply. Areas affected include Chavakali, Eregi, Viyalo, Mukuli, Mbihi and Mbale township. Edited by A.N
