Content creator and comedian Flaqo Raz' s YouTube Channel has been shut down over a copyright claim. This comes a few weeks after he was awarded by YouTube for having more than 100K subscribers. A message from YouTube explaining the reason his account was deleted read in part, "We’d like to inform you that your channel Flaqo Raz has been terminated because we concluded it was linked to a channel that was disabled for having three or more copyright strikes. "You can find more information by checking the email inbox of your linked account." Taking to Instagram, Flaqo called on fans to report all channels that have his name and content. He explained how exhausting it is to create content for YouTube and that he has had to work hard to make a name for himself. Flaqo's channel was deleted at a time he was about to launch his show on the platform. "At this point, it is exhausting... Please report all channels that are not mine but have my content in it... Boycott," he wrote. "I've worked so hard to be disrespected every damn time, malice. Why...Because I’m just about to launch my show on YouTube, it's maliciously taken down. "Am not dropping the mic btw so if you maliciously want me out of the industry sorry. "We will be back with twice the energy. This war of kicking me out of social media every time is getting a little personal."
