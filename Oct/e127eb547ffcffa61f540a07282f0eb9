Laikipia Woman Representative Cate Waruguru has asked politicians to stop using youths to promote their own political ambitions. Speaking during the Building Bridges launch at Bomas on Monday, Waruguru said many youths have been used and forgotten by politicians during campaigns. "Other than that, the violence that erupts always affects our businesses, "she said. On the BBI, Waruguru noted that it is a great opportunity for the voice of the youth to be heard. ".... because there is no county without us as young people in this republic of Kenya," she said. "BBI conversations should be about patriotism and not 2022 and 2027 politics. We want the government to take care of our youth." President Uhuru Kenyatta and his counterpart ODM leader Raila Odinga have been championing for the report urging Kenyans to read it before commenting on it. The duo is expected to roll out joint BBI rallies to market the report and lobby for national support in the coming days to counter opponents of the report. President Uhuru Kenyatta last week advised boda boda operators to develop a strong saving culture so as to avoid being misused by selfish politicians. "If you donâ€™t respect yourself and depend on handouts you will end up being people who are usable and disposable," the President said. He spoke on Friday at Pumwani Social Hall in Majengo, Nairobi County where he presided over the launch of the Boda Boda Investment Scheme. Uhuru challenged boda boda riders to work hard knowing that it is through hard work that they can prosper.
