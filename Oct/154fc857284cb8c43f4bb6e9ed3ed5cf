Malindi MP Aisha Jumwa has not received any formal notification over the charges against her, her lawyer Jared Magolo has said. Magolo said his client is not aware of the charges as they have yet to receive a summons over the same. “I am just seeing the screenshot flying all over and we are not sure whether it is genuine or fake," he said. The lawyer said the MP is safe from arrest as she is out on court bond. He said the only thing the police can do is to issue a summons and they will make sure she presents herself in court. The lawyer further read malice in the charges whose investigations have been going on for a year. “The charges are politically instigated especially since she has been associating herself with the Tangatanga team," he said. Jumwa is expected to be charged with murder after the fatal shooting of a man during a fracas in October last year. The fracas happened during Ganda by-election in Kilifi county. Jumwa, who will also face assault charges, will be charged alongside his bodyguard Geoffrey Okuto Otieno. According to the Mombasa assistant DPP Alloys Kemo, the charges are after thorough investigations. The man was shot in the shoulder and killed during the chaos and several other people, including police officers, were injured. Jumwa had stormed a meeting organised by Reuben Katana, an ODM candidate in the by-election. Gumbao Jola, 48, died upon arrival at Malindi General Hospital. He was Katana’s uncle. Chaos erupted soon after the MP arrived at the meeting in a convoy of three vehicles, leading to police officers shooting in the air several times. Jumwa had accused Katana of campaigning long after the campaign period had been closed. Katana was at the time hosting more than 500 people at his home. The murder charges come a few months after Jumwa was freed on Sh5 million bond after pleading not guilty to six counts of money laundering, acquiring proceeds of crime, conflict of interest as well as fraud.
