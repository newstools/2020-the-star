Lack of sporting activities due to coronavirus pandemic has negatively affected the fitness levels of many players at the Coast. Titus Kesekwa, technical director of Kenya Handball Federation Coast region, said ladies have been particularly affected and may need to up their training in readiness for the resumption of the Mombasa Handball Super League. "From our observation, we noticed that many of the players have gained weight and are struggling with fitness. Otherwise, their technical nous is still there and we have had a competitive event," Kesekwa said. Kesekwa was speaking over the weekend during the Changamwe Handball Open Tournament at Changamwe Magongo Primary School and Changamwe Social Hall. "After this tournament, our focus now shifts to the league. We hope that players will be physically ready to handle the rigours because the government has somewhat relaxed restrictions on training," Kesekwa said. The two-day tournament, organised by  Kenya Handball Federation, Mombasa branch in collaboration with Changamwe MCA Bernard Ogutu — attracted 16 teams, both men and women. In some of the results posted on Saturday, Mariakani Ladies' Club walloped Coastarian Warriors 13-10 whereas Super Estate and Changamwe Stars were deadlocked at 6-6. After a 6-2 humiliation by Destiny, Senior Lighters made amends with an 8-6 piping of Changamwe Stars. In the men's category, Saints thrashed Black Stars 15-8, Destiny thrashed Little Heroes 3-0 and Mariakani beat Ashton 10-6. Kesekwa noted that some of the outstanding players might soon join bigger clubs and institutions, some of which sent their scouts to the event. "We had scouts from the national beach handball team as well as from the national handball team. I also saw a scout from Kenyatta University and I am sure that some of these players may soon join the institution on sports scholarships," he said.
