Education CS George Magoha has said the state is in no intentions to reclose schools even as the number of Covid-19 infections continues to surge. Speaking on Thursday, the CS downplayed the risk of infection on children and insisted there is no cause for alarm as no panic among learners has been witnessed. Magoha was inspecting the delivery of desks purchased under a Sh1.9 billion tender stimulus package at the Uhuru Gardens Primary School in Nairobi. Basic Education Principal Secretary Belio Kipsang on Wednesday while appearing before the National Assembly Committee on Education revealed that so far 33 teachers, 17 students and four non-teaching staff in 35 schools had so far tested positive of coronavirus. But the CS says has asked the schools to remain calm as the government will work with the Ministry of Health to ensure the learners are safe. Magoha notes that plans to conduct the national examinations KCPE and KCSE remain on course. "We will let you know if we anything changes but as of now, the plan to conduct exams remain as planned," Magoha said. The KCPE exams are set to take place in March, while the KCSE exams are slated between April and May of 2021.
