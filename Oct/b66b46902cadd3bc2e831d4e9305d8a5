The Nairobi Hospital has added four wards dedicated to dealing with Covid-19 patients, following a surge in cases it has been receiving who need admission. In a statement on Wedenesday, the hospital said St Andrew's, St David's, St Francis and the Short Stay Unit will be taken up for management of Covid-19 cases. "We regret the inconvenience this may cause and request your patience..." acting CEO Margaret Sirima said. The hospital board fired Dr Allan Pamba barely six months after his appointment. In a letter dated October 2, board chairman Dr Irungu Ndirangu said Pamba's probation period would not be extended because he had failed to provide a performance improvement plan. The letter read, "Please note that the letter  dated   I01h   September 2020    extending    your probation   period  up  to  12th December 2020 gave you up to 30th  September 2020  to acknowledge   and execute  the performance improvement plan." "Unfortunately,    you  responded   on 29th   September 2020 and  requested  that  the  Board of Directors review your performance in line  with  the Board charter contrary to your letter  of appointment  which clearly states  that the Chairman   of the Board will review  your performance. Your failure  to execute Performance Enhancement    Plan  and the probation extension   letter  implied  your  lack of interest  to continue  working  for The Nairobi  hospital." Irungu said the Board of Management sat on  October 2 and  resolved  not  to confirm Pamba, but  terminate his contract.
