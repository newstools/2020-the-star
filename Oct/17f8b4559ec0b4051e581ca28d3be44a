Four of Gor Mahia’s new signings have been cleared by the international football governing body, Fifa to play for the record Kenyan Premier League winners. Burundian Jules Ulimwengu from Rayon Sports, Tito Okello (Vipers, Uganda), Cameroonian Bertrand Konfor, formerly of Al Mudhabi of Oman and John Macharia, who previously featured for FC Guria Lanchkhuti’s of Georgia—have all been cleared by Fifa to play for Gor. As per Fifa regulations, all transfers of players between countries must go through a process to get an International Transfer Certificate (ITC)— a certificate provided from one national association to another to facilitate the transfer. Midfielder John Macharia is delighted following the latest developments since he is now among the many free players to play for the club. “I am so happy to receive the news that the ITC application process has successfully gone through. It’s a good feeling. My previous club wanted me to go back and so, I wasn’t sure what was in store about my move to Gor.” “This is good for me because it feels good to train with a team knowing well you are free to play in any competitive match. Now, I have to work hard to achieve the best at my new club,” said Macharia on the club’s website. The new players who joined from foreign clubs are now free to be registered at Caf for continental assignments—the registration window opens on October 21.
