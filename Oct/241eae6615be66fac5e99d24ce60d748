Kisii Governor James Ongwae has lauded President Uhuru Kenyatta's handshake with opposition chief Raila Odinga. The governor termed the move a gesture of heroism that had heralded a new dawn of inclusivity and national unity. “That gesture of putting national interests above personal interest demonstrated the true spirit of Mashujaaism (Heroism),” he said. Ongwae spoke during the 11th Mashujaa Day celebrations held at Gusii Stadium in Kisii county. Ongwae also thanked the President's government for injecting billions of shillings to at least 12 projects across Kisii county including the refurbishing of the Gusii stadium. “Let me thank you for this stadium. You know how it looked like when you used to come for political functions, you directed your officers to upgrade it into international standards, we are grateful,” Ongwae said. He said major roads within the Kisii township that which were initially murram roads were tarmacked through the partnership between the national government and the county administration. “Water was a serious problem in the municipality since it was put in 1936 with only six million litres of water per day and now we have 26 million litres of water per day after the Kegati water projected was finished,” he said. Ongwae said that the county was grateful that through the help of the interior CS Fred Matiang'i the county now has a passport centre.
