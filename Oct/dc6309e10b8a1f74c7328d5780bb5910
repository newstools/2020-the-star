The Kwale government plans to hire about 150 nursery school teachers to strengthen early childhood education in the county. Governor Salim Mvurya said the new teachers will plug the shortage of tutors in some of the ECDE centres. The vacancies will be announced by December 31. The county has more than 400 ECDE facilities and 700 teachers on permanent and pensionable terms. The centres are furnished with furniture, swings, water tanks and offer feeding programmes. “We had a bad history on educational matters, the transition and performances were very poor and we were usually ranked from the bottom, something I promised to change,” Mvurya said on Thursday at Vanga in Lunga Lunga constituency. The county chief said thousands of students have benefited through the Elimu Ni Sasa Foundation started with his deputy Fatuma Achani in 2013. The foundation offers bursaries and sponsorships to needy students. Mvurya said no child will be left behind because of school fees as the county allocates Sh400 million for education every year. To date, over 4,000 students in the national schools and 2,000 in universities are on full county sponsorship. Meanwhile, the TIVET department on Tuesday inaugurated a new board of management for the Kwale Teachers Training College under construction at Bang'a in Kinango. The inauguration comes weeks after President Uhuru Kenyatta, Education Cabinet Secretary George Magoha and other senior officials visited the college. Uhuru allocated Sh150 million to help equip the TTC expected to take in students from 2021.
