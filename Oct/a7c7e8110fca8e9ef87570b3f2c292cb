Uganda Airlines yesterday resumed commercial flights from Entebbe, flagging off its first flight from the Entebbe International Airport to Nairobi. The Ugandan airport closed down 6 months ago due to the coronavirus pandemic, leading to suspension of service for the airline. Other destinations the airline will resume operations to include Bujumbura, Dar es Salaam, Juba, Zanzibar and Mombasa. “We have now embarked on our expansion drive that was brought to a halt by the pandemic, we will soon start flying to more African nations,” said Cornwell Muleya, CEO, Uganda Airlines. The airline introduced the Entebbe-Mogadishu airline yesterday as it resumed operations. In its expansion strategy the airline is also expected to bring in two airbus A330 aircraft to its fleet, and will be the first airline in Africa to operate them. This will aid them in their international route expansion as they plan to start flying to UAE, China and the United Kingdom in 2021. Uganda is one of Kenya’s top tourism marketer, according to the Kenya Tourism Board (KTB) currently ranked number one in Africa and number two globally in terms of arrivals into Kenya. In 2019 Kenya received 215,894 visitors from Uganda, a 5.4 per cent increase over the previous year.
