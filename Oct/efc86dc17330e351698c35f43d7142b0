Deputy President William Ruto’s allies in Nyamira have accused Interior CS Fred Matiang’i of disrupting their fundraiser in Kebirigo on Thursday. South Mugirango MP Silvanus Osoro told Matiang’i to “not misuse the police to achieve his desires of being called a super CS”. “He [Matiang’i] should divert the resources to help the needy youths instead of using the resources to fuel helicopters to intimidate us,” Osoro said. MPs Vincent Kemosi (West Mugirango) Joash Nyamoko (North Mugirango) and Shadrack Mose (Kitutu Masaba) also criticised Matiang’i. Mose said the hustler and Tangatanga movements are unstoppable. “No amount of force and intimidation can stop us. We have now realised the true meaning of the handshake. It was not meant to stabilise our country but to sideline other leaders and give a few of them prominence,” he said. Kemosi said the fundraiser for boda boda Saccos was lawfully convened. He condemned county commissioner Amos Marina for sending police to disrupt the meeting. “A replay of this will happen next week. We want to show those who despise us that we are looking forward to empower our fellow hustlers and nothing can stop us; not even the police,” Kemosi said. He said the county commissioner had last week okayed the meeting only to disrupt it. Chief guest DP Ruto condemned the disruption of the meeting on Twitter but promised to attend it next Thursday.
