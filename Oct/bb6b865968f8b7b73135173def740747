Kenya Sevens quartet at the World 10-a-side tournament will have to self isolate after one of their teammates in the SFX franchaise returned a positive test for Covid-19. Collins Injera, Oscar Dennis, skipper Andrew Amonde and Willy Ambaka is part of the SX10 team — a new franchise comprising members of the South African and Kenya 7s national sides. A statement from World Tens Series said: "Round One will continue with six teams and following a period of isolation, we hope to welcome their team back for the second round slated for next weekend." "All the remaining members of the squad tested negative at the same time and since then, they have all re-tested again and have all recorded negative results. However, with the strict protocols in place by both the government of Bermuda and the World Tens Series, all members of the SX10 squad have been self-isolating." "The World Tens Series Management team is in close dialogue with local authorities and, at this stage, if the SFX10 Squad continues to return negative test results, they will be ready to return to play next week for Round Two of the World Tens Series League," added the statement. Amonde was upbeat about the team's chances despite not playing the opening round. "We will have to self isolate but we are relishing  the challenge of playing. We can't wait to play next weekend," said Amonde, adding that playing in the tournament will keep them sharp and ready for the start of the World Sevens Series in March in Vancouver and Los Angeles. “It's been a difficult year without playing the Sevens series since March. We are adjusting to the new normal and this tournament will freshen us and keep us in good shape for the new year," added Amonde.
