Jacob ‘Ghost’ Mulee is the new Harambee Stars head coach after signing a three-year deal. Mulee was this morning officially handed the mandate to man the national team following the exit of his predecessor Francis Kimanzi, who left the team on Tuesday. "I thank the federation for having faith in me to steer the team to seal a place in the next forthcoming Afcon and World Cup. I have been monitoring the performance of the team for a while and I am pleased with the quality which we have," Mulee said. "I watched them play Zambia and I was convinced we have a massive chance to beat Comoros next month." Kimanzi, according to Football Kenya Federation, parted company with the national team alongside his assistant Zedekiah ‘Zico’ Otieno and goalkeeper trainer Lawrence Webo on mutual agreement. Mulee returns to the team for the fifth time and will be tasked with leading the team to secure a place in next year’s Africa Cup of Nations finals. Stars are winless in Pool ‘B’ of the qualifiers and will face Comoros in the next round of qualifiers scheduled for next month.
