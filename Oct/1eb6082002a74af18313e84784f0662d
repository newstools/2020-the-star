The National Museums of Kenya and Google Arts and Culture have collaborated on an online exhibition with stories of folk and cultural superheroes from all 44 Kenyan communities to mark this year's Mashujaa Day. Speaking during the virtual event yesterday, Culture CS Amina Mohamed said heroes and heroines are a source of inspiration to their community. "Shujaa story is a story born of passion and pride. Allow me to pay tribe to the late Masidza Sande Mazda. He, unfortunately, passed away last year." The launch event was held at the National Museum of Kenya’s headquarters. 'Superheroes' is part of the first-ever digital exhibition, titled ‘Utamaduni Wetu: Meet the People of Kenya'. It celebrates Kenya's cultures, beliefs, generations and geography. The exhibition has over 10,000 photos, 130-expert curated exhibits, four expeditions and 60 Google Street Views, offering audiences the opportunity to explore the 61 superheroes from Kenya's 44 communities. NMK director of antiquities Dr Purity Kiura said the museum conserves and manages history for humanity. "We celebrate heroes and they are past and present. What we are doing is celebrating those who have gone before us. They have shaped us as a nation. It is our responsibility to be able to honour them and tell their stories," she said. President Uhuru Kenyatta, in a video message, said, “We must look for our common vision in the dreams of our ancestors. We must seek out their wisdom and preserve their memory. "We must bring them to life in a way that present generations can relate - through technology. "You can begin that journey by visiting the National Museums of Kenya page on the Google Arts and Culture platform to learn the stories of our folk and cultural heroes, relive their experiences and draw the inspiration that you need from them in order to play your part in constructing and exemplifying our national ethos.” Among other keynote speakers were ODM leader Raila Odinga.
