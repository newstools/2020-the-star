A man was found hanging from a tree on his farm on Saturday morning in Getare, Nyamira county, in a suspected case of suicide. Getare assistant chief Charles Oigoro said the body of Ongaro Ongeri, 48, was found by children who were going to the shop. Widow Zipporah Bosibori said her husband left the house at 5am but did not say where he was going. She said her husband had no wrangles with anyone. She said on Friday Ongeri spent the entire day with his family and he did not appear disturbed or stressed. "He did not show any signs of being stressed up. We ate supper and retired to bed at 9pm. But this morning [Saturday], he left very early and did not say where he was going,” she said. Cases of suicide are on the rise in Nyamira and are among the major cause of death in the county. Nyamira county commissioner Amos Mariba said those who abuse drugs and alcohol top the list of suicide cases. “If there are challenges in life, we need to seek help instead of committing suicide,” he said.
