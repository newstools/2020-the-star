Belgut MP Nelson Koech has called on the World Trade Organisation to carry out an audit on how the ongoing process of picking the next director general is conducted. Speaking to the Star on Friday, Koech called for transparency. "Even as the dust settles on the selection of the next director general , cracks are emerging among the world powers over the process as it enters the third and final round," he noted. The finalists for the position announced on October 8 are South Korea’s minister for trade Yoo Myung Hee and Nigeria’s Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, a former finance minister. The winner is due to be confirmed by a November 7 deadline. Whoever is picked among the two will be the first female boss for WTO. Koech said, "With the exit of CS Amina Mohamed , the diplomatic tiff has been heightened with Japan’s relations with South Korea continuing to be frosty." He claimed the process of eliminating candidates was opaque, adding that popular candidates, such as Mohamed, were eliminated. "It’s about a system of rules that govern the multilateral trading system allowing it to function optimally . It can not be subject to doubts," Koech said. Richard Tongi who is the Vice Chairman of Defense and Foreign Relations in the National Assembly said there is need to make the process as transparent as possible. "If the claims that have been reported in the international press are true then the international community should investigate the matter to the core. International community is all about transparency and that we want to see," Tongi told the Star on the phone.
