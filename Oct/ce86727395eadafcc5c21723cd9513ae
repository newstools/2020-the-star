Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) has introduced a web based anonymous reporting system that allows citizens to report tax evasion schemes and corruption related malpractices at their convenience.  The system provides full anonymity to the informer as it auto generate identity that an informer uses to log in and not only report, but also follow up on the progress of their report (or whistle). Prior to this, Kenyan citizens would provide information through emails, phone calls and walk- ins. However, while there were a number of complaints received the process was long, tedious, and cumbersome; and did not allow for anonymity, and efficiency.  Every year, the authority looses millions in revenue due to tax evasion. The new initiative will mean that all tax evasion and corruption related loopholes are sealed and revenue is not lost through unscrupulous members of the public. The iWhistle reporting system is aligned to the KRAâ€™s seventh corporate plan on enhancing revenue mobilization through robust intelligence collection and risk profiling.  There is incentive for members of the public who report tax evasion such as failure to pay taxes to the Authority by individuals, organizations, companies, manufacturers including income tax, Pay as You Earn (PAYE), Value Added Tax, Income Tax, Excise Duty and Import Duty. Reports on tax fraud such as when an individual or business entity willfully and intentionally falsifies information on a tax return in order to limit the amount of tax liability will also be rewarded.  Now, both staff and members of the public can report violations such as like tax evasion, bribery, fraud, and conflict of interest, abuse of office, concealment and diversion of good. To do this all you have to do is go to the website at iWhistle.kra.go.ke and follow the instruction manual.
