@robertomollo3 Property worth more than Sh3 million was destroyed by a storm at the Jua Kali market in Homa Bay town during a downpour on Thursday night. Some 42 artisans and six families suffered the brunt of the storm that left their assets and livelihoods in ruins. Strong winds blew off shades and stores used for keeping tools, ready furniture and raw materials. On Friday, Mathew Odindo, chairman of the artisans, said many people lost their raw materials through destruction. Thieves also took advantage of the storm. “The incident occurred when we had gone home. Some people with long hands invaded the scene and stole workshop tools and raw materials,” Odindo said. He said the incident caused massive losses. “We call on both the national and county government to intervene and help us,” Odindo added. Victims, led by Michael Okoth, decried the loss saying some of them will no longer continue with their normal activities. “I lost property worth Sh350,000 in this incident. It is a serious loss to us,” Okoth said. Elsewhere, six families spent the night in the cold after the storm wrecked their house on Shauri Yako estate in the same town. Their valuables were destroyed after the storm blew off their roofs. Arujo location senior chief Bob Lang’o said no one suffered injuries. He said they reported the matter to the authorities. “The storm has caused grave damage and the families currently need help from well-wishers,” Lang’o said. The storm also destroyed a water intake built on the estate near Lake Victoria. The intake was constructed by Lake Victoria South Water Works.
