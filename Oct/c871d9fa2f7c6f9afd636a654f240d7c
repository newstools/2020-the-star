Golf Park’s David Wakhu tied at the top with two others on Day 3 of the 2020 Safari Tour Series at the par 72 Sigona Golf Club course yesterday. This was despite making a double bogey at the par five-ninth after blocking his tee shot followed by three putts and another bogey at the par three-11th for one under par 71 for the day. He tied with Day 2 leader Edwin Mudanyi and another Golf Park’s player Eric Ooko on two under par 214 going into today’s final round. “I have never been so nervous like today. I just didn’t know why and it made me three putts some holes that I had a chances of scoring like the 11th hole,” said Wakhu, who will now be in the last flight with Mudanyi and Ooko as they battle it out for the cash prize of Sh150,000 plus some points. Mudanyi played a bogey-free front nine that included two birdies at the fourth and sixth, though the back nine was not that impressive as he made bogeys at the 13th, 16th and 18th with only a two at the 14th to level the course and stay at the top though in the company of Ooko and Wakhu. “I started well with a clean nine for a start but made a number of bad putts at the back nine that would have given me a fine low score for the day. I didn’t deserve the two over on the back nine but I will try and keep cool in tomorrow’s final round and try and make as many birdies. A five under would be most welcome,” said Mudanyi. Ooko on the other hand, putted par three 11th and dropped a shot on the other short hole (three) after hitting the edge of the green where the ball rolled out. He missed the par to drop his first hole of the day. “My game at the moment is very solid though sometimes I am losing concentration. I am looking forward to a good game with Wakhu and Mudanyi,” said Ooko, who birdied the second and the eighth and the 10th and 15th on the back nine. Three others tied on one over par 217 with two of them Brian Njoroge and Zimbabwe’s Robson Chinhoi having shot one over par 73 and senior pro Dismas Indiza posted two over par 74. For the three amateurs, who made the second round cut, Nyali’s Adel Balala stayed on course despite a three over par 75 to tie for 14th place on six over par 222 while the going was tough for Naomi Wafula as she posted eight over par though she remained ahead of former amateur match-play champion Paul Muchangi of Limuru. The event ends today with golfers fighting for a share of the Sh2million prize money up for grabs. The series has been to Limuru, Sigona, Vet Lab and Royal Nairobi Golf Club. Kenya Open Golf Limited are expected to release the remaining rounds of the calendar soon. Safari Tour is the official Road to Magical Kenya Open where Kenya has a quota of 8 players with two more coming form the region.   ROUND 3 LEADERBOARD; T1. Eric Ooko 73, 71, 70= 214 T1.
