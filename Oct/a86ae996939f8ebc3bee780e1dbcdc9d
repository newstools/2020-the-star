President Uhuru Kenyatta on Sunday discussed the regional peace and security with his Egyptian counterpart Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi. While on his way from France, the President made a stopover in Egypt and paid a courtesy call to Al-Sisi. The two leaders also discussed a number of subjects of mutual interest between Kenya and Egypt including trade and Africa's response to the novel coronavirus. Kenya is a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council after beating Djibouti for the African slot in June. Last month, the president reiterated that Kenya will lead the counter-terrorism efforts in Eastern Africa. The head of state told the global community that this will be achieved through partnership with regional governments and partners. Uhuru said Kenya will leverage on its membership in the UN Security Council to contribute more to global peace and security. "Kenya aims to provide leadership in the Horn of Africa by exploring and implementing diplomatic measures in counter-terrorism financing and to work with partners in the broader spectrum of efforts within counter-terrorism, as well as to stem other forms of transnational organized crime," the President said. "Through Kenyaâ€™s non-permanent member seat at the United Nations Security Council, Kenya further aims to contribute to global peace and security, with the ultimate goal being the attainment of sustainable development for the year 2021-2022."
