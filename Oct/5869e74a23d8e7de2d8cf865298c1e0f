Food and non-food donations targeting vulnerable widows were recently handed over at NYS headquarters, Nairobi. Gender CAS Rachel Shebesh presided. During testimonials, Thabitha Charles said, “Today is my 29th year as a widow. I was left with eight children, with all my husband’s property taken away after his burial. "It has been a real struggle bringing up my family. I call upon the government to protect widows as most are denied the right to property inheritance by family members despite it being a collective effort.” Come Together Widows and Orphans Organisation founder Diana Kamande said, “Don’t use your widowhood as a gown. Stand up, step up and go to work.”
