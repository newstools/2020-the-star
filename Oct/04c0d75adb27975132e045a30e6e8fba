Two months on, CCTV footage of Monicah Atieno’s movements in Nairobi’s CBD have not led police to her whereabouts and reunion with desperate parents. The footage was retrieved by police investigators from a building on Moi Avenue but it led nowhere. Monicah, 13, went missing on August 6. She was with her dad, Joseph Kokoh, and they were preparing to leave Nairobi to return to their home in Mombasa that day. They had been stuck in Nairobi for four months because the Covid-19 hotspot was under movement restrictions. When the restrictions were lifted, it was time to return to the Coast and the rest of their family. At the CBD, Kokoh briefly left his daughter at a friend's shop while he visited a cyber cafe. His friend said his daughter left to find him but they never connected. When he returned to the shop, his daughter was gone. Every day since then has been anguish. The disappearance was recorded under OB number 102/07/08/2020 at Central police station. Kokoh  has reached out to almost every media house in the city to highlight the case of his missing daughter. No response. Speaking to the Star on Monday during a follow-up interview, Kokoh said police apparently have not made any progress nor updated him on what steps have been taken to find her. He said he supplied all information regarding the circumstances of the disappearance. Police said all procedures have been followed in efforts to find the girl. “I’m a very frustrated father. Even after supplying everything to the Central police station, nothing seem to have happened at all in the investigation," he said. Kokoh said his friends where his daughter had last been seen have recorded statements with police. “I supplied them with the list of those I considered suspects. They recorded statements but after that, nothing has moved an inch,” he claimed. Kokoh insists his daughter is being held against her will by persons unknown. (Edited by V. Graham)
