Police have seized 191 rolls of bhang worth Sh65, 000 in Kwale county. The bhang was seized at Mteza along the Lutsangani-Mbuguni road in Matuga. County police commander Joseph Nthenge said the marijuana was being transported to an unknown location on a motorbike. The officers had launched an operation against drugs trafficking before they intercepted the bhang. “The person carrying it panicked when he came across police officers and managed to escape in a nearby thicket,” he said. Both bhang and the bike were taken to Kwale police station. Police have launched a manhunt for the escapee. The incident comes some months after police burnt 15 sacks of Miraa worth Sh100, 000. The drug was recovered in Lunga-Lunga and damaged for violating the ban against the selling of Miraa due to Covid-19 restrictions. The county police boss asked the locals to stem up the fight against drug trafficking.
