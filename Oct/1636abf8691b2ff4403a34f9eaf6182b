Eight days after the Chief Justice David Maraga issued an advisory to dissolve the parliament, he has now invited speakers of both the houses to grace a function at the Judiciary precincts. Maraga has advised President Uhuru Kenyatta to dissolve Parliament for failing to enact legislation required to implement the two-thirds gender rule. In a letter dated September 29, Maraga invites Speakers Justin Muturi (National Assembly) and Ken Lusaka (Senate), to grace the Presentation of the State of the Judiciary and the Administration of Justice Report on November 27, 2020. With this, Maraga still anticipates that the same report will be remitted to the National Assembly and Senate for debate. The advisory has drawn criticism from parliamentarians and even the speakers themselves. The High Court has suspended the implementation of the advisory by Chief Justice David Maraga to the President to dissolve Parliament. Judge James Makau on Tuesday issued the orders and further directed that the file to be forwarded immediately to the CJ for purposes of constituting a panel of judges to hear the petition and if possible be given the same bench with the other two petitions. In the case filed by the National Assembly and Senate, they argue that the decision by Maraga is a grave error and a misapprehension of the provisions of the law. They argue that if Parliament was to be dissolved now then no current Bills generated by the executive from the State or through private member Bills can pass and or be enacted into law. Parliament further says that the IEBC currently has only three commissioners against the quorum of 5 prescribed under the Act.
