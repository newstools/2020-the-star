The National Treasury has released Sh52.2 billion which is to be distributed to all the 47 county governments. Treasury CS Ukur Yatani said on Tuesday that the amount is the equitable share for the months of July and August 2020. Yatani said that the County Allocation of Revenue Bill 2020 took long to be approved by Parliament following a stalemate in the Senate regarding the third criteria for revenue allocation. “This meant that there was no legal instrument enabling the transfer of funds to County Governments for FY 2020/2021 pursuant to article 219 of the Constitution,” Yatani said. The CS said it is regrettable that the matter of disbursements to counties took long, thereby affecting service delivery at the county level. County governments have been urged to give priority to the settlement of pending bills. At the same time, the CS has remained positive that the Senate and the National Assembly will find a permanent solution to this matter to avoid such unfortunate stalemate in the future. President Uhuru Kenyatta signed into law the 2020/2021 County Revenue Allocation Bill on the 8 October 2020 paving way for the disbursement of exchequer funds to the counties. The president signed the bill into law this morning at State House, Nairobi which was presented to him by the Speaker of the Senate Ken Lusaka. The new law allocates a sum of Sh369.87 billion in the current fiscal year to Counties and includes Sh316.5 billion of Equitable Share and Sh13.73 billion in Government of Kenya Conditional Grants.
