Defensive midfielder Collins Sichenje and goalkeeper Benjamin Ochan have extended their stay at AFC Leopards. Sichenje put pen to paper on a new one-year deal at the Den as did the Uganda shot-stopper. The 19-year-old midfield enforcer has emerged as one of the most exciting players to watch in the Kenyan Premier League with eye-catching performances. Sichenje joined Ingwe  in September 2019 from Green Commandos after spending his formative years at the famous Kakamega High School. The lanky teenager said on the club portal that he is looking forward to another exciting season and wants to help the team bag the elusive league title. “My target this season is, together with my teammates, help the team lift the league title. Personally, I want to be among the best performers in the league as well. I also want to urge our fans not to relent on their support,” he said. Meanwhile, Ochan who joined Ingwe in July 2019 from Zambian side Kabwe Warriors,  said that he was looking forward to another successful campaign with Ingwe and urged fans to continue supporting the team. “I feel Ingwe inside me and I am happy to be part of this family. It is good to be in here and I am looking forward to being the best keeper in the league and also help my team win the Football Kenya Federation Premier League,” he said. Commenting on Ochan’s contract extension, head coach Anthony Kimani said: “The contract renewal is a big boost to the team as he is a very important member of the squad and arguably the best keeper in the league at the moment. This brings continuity and consistency in the team, an important factor as we push to better our performance.” “He also brings leadership, stability and guidance in the dressing room and he will complement our captain,” he added. Ingwe will start their 2021 season with a home match against Western Stima on November 21.
