The World Bank, in partnership with West Pokot government, has distributed 124 refrigerators to health facilities in the county for storage of vaccines. They are meant to cut the trips residents have been making to hospitals in search of vaccines to immunise their children. Speaking on Monday after flagging off the refrigerators' distribution, Governor John Lonyangapuo said the initiative under Transforming Health System will boost immunisation coverage to reduce child mortality. The fridges will be powered using solar energy. “The programme targets rural facilities which have not been connected to the national energy grid," he said. Lonyangapuo said lack of such equipment had contributed to many children not being immunised. “In this era of devolution, Kenyans should not be walking long distances in search of health services. They need to get help near their homes,” he said. Mother Mary Chepleke from Masol said her first three daughters were not immunised as she was unable to walk long distances to health facilities. “I'm happy that health services have been brought near us and my younger children will be immunised,” she said.
