A magistrate's court has allowed the prosecution to question one of the accused persons charged with defrauding Wajir county of Sh26 million, on a statement he recorded regarding the case. Lawyer Sam Nyaberi, representing Jeff Mworia, had objected to the prosecution cross-examining his client because of how the statement was obtained. The information contained in the statement was recorded in the course of investigations when Mworia was considered a witness and not a suspect. But in a brief ruling, magistrate Teresia Murigi said the prosecution cannot be confined to questions addressed during examination in chief. She agreed with the state that cross-examination cannot be limited. Mworia, alongside Ahmed Sahal Omar and Daudi Abdullahi, were placed on their defence in June this year after the court found they have a case to answer. The three are currently defending themselves. Omar, Abdullahi, and Mworia are accused of having withdrawn the money in question from Kenya Commercial Bank, Wajir branch, on October 9, 2018. Abdullahi is facing a separate count of abuse of office and failure to manage public property. It is said that between October 5 and October 9, 2018, within Wajir County, Abdullahi used his office to confer a benefit of Sh26.1 million to Mworia by unlawfully authorising him as a sole signatory of the County Government of Wajir imprest account. The accused were arraigned in November, 2018, and charged with conspiring to defraud the county government of Sh26 million. Hearing will proceed on October 22.
