Vihiga Queens' coach Alex Alumira has called for collective responsibility from stakeholders to grow women's football. Alumira said clubs, Football Kenya Federation FKF, the government and corporates must work together and source for funds to help develop structures to provide a conducive environment for players. He said by each sector playing its part, the biggest beneficiary will be the player. Nick Mwendwa was re-elected for a second term as the FKF president last week and is expected to spearhead the expansion of the girls' game that is currently on an upward trajectory. Kenya has more than 10 professional players. "The biggest impediment is cash and this is where concerted efforts from all those involved in management of football in the country have to join forces including friends of football. Corporates are key and it is the role of the federation and government to lure them while clubs will do their job," noted the three-time title winning coach. Alumira  also remarked that a clear structure consistent with the men's game should be established. "The men's team has the under-15 and under 20 side. Sometimes you hear there's the U15 and U20 in women but I think this should be made clear  for the sake of the players.  It will make a player work hard knowing that he can be drafted in a certain group. The talent is there because many of our players are now playing professional football." Alumira further said the laws governing sports funds have to be tightened for the kitty to be used correctly. "The government has to be strict with legislation governing sports funds."
