Angry villagers on Thursday set on fire a police post in Likuyani sub-county to protest the absence of a suspect who had been arrested. The OCS in charge of Mbururu police post was injured on the head by the villages in the fight that erupted between the officers and villagers. He was treated at Matunda sub-county hospital and discharged. Six other officers attached to the station lost their personal effects and equipment during the incident that took place at 11am. Witnesses said a man was arrested on Wednesday evening by officers for allegedly assaulting one of them and a commotion ensued between the suspect and the officers who booked him at the police post. Western regional police commander Perris Muthoni said the suspect's mother went to Matunda police station and demanded to know the whereabouts of her son. "The OCS asked her to accompany him to the Mbururu police post to find out the position but she declined. When the OCS arrived at the post, he found a charged crowd that heard none of his pleas," Muthoni said. "The villagers then engaged the officers in a fight, throwing stones at them before setting the post on fire and fleeing. The OCS was injured but he is in stable condition," she said. The police boss said that the suspect had been released on Wednesday evening on a police bond pending filling of a P3 form by the assaulted officer. She said that the officers lost all their personal effects and some equipment but declined to confirm whether the fire arms were also burnt during the fracas. "We are appealing to the public to volunteer information on the whereabouts of the suspect who went into hiding after release from police custody," she said.
