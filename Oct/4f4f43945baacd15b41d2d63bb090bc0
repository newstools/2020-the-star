Mwananchi Credit Limited has dismissed allegations Vera Sidika used her Range Rover to secure a loan from them. This is after an employee who claims to work at the financial institution breached privacy and data laws by alleging this to blogger Edgar Obare. The employee claimed Vera took a loan to finance her Nyali Spa and Beauty Parlour. The news of this forced Mwananchi Credit to point out that their clientâ€™s data and information is treated with utmost care. In a press statement dated Friday, they said, "We are responding to the allegations on social media that media personality Vera Sidika came to procure a loan from our entity. "The facts are as follows: Our client loan accounts details remain confidential between ourselves and the clients. "That said, we wish to categorically state that media personality Vera Sidika is currently not and has never been in the list of our clients." The institution went ahead to note that even if she were, there is nothing wrong with any Kenyan securing a loan from any financial institution. "All of us, at one point or another, need some kind of financing to grow from one level to another," it said. "It is wrong to try to insinuate that someone taking a loan is necessarily a bad thing. We should stop stigmatising loans. Responsible loans are very critical for growth."
