Long queues were witnessed outside Gusii Stadium early Tuesday morning as Kenyans turned up in large numbers for the 57th Mashujaa Day celebrations. Security was intensified at Gusii Stadium as Kenyans thronged the venue to celebrate Mashujaa Day. There were long queues by 9.30 am as crack units from the General Service Unitsscreened those entering the stadium. Not even journalists were spared in the checks. Sniffer dogs were used and all luggage was screened at three separate gates entering the stadium. Today’s Mashujaa Day celebrations are to be held in strict compliance with the Health ministry’s Covic-19 containment protocols. Kisii County Governor James Ongwae has urged those who would miss out to follow the proceedings from ten screens in the stadium periphery. "The strict sittings are due to Covid-19, we hope our people would be very understanding," said Ongwae. Deputy President William Ruto has already flown into Kisii School where he was welcomed by Kisii Deputy Governor Joash Maangi. Only about 4,000 people will be allowed into the Gusii Stadium in the invite-only event. President Uhuru Kenyatta is expected to arrive at the stadium at around 10.40 am to lead the state in celebrations. Anyone entering the stadium was required to wear a mask and wash hands or sanitise. The Mashujaa Day fete is the first national holiday to be marked publicly since the Coronavirus was first reported in the country in March. Photos by Angwenyi Gichana.
