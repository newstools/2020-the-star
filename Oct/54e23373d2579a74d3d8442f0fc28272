The county government of Vihiga is exploring ways of ensuring residents apply for state funds to accelerate development. Governor Wilber Ottichilo said he would like to see better uptake of Uwezo, women's and youth funds. Ottichilo said he will incorporate state officials within the county to help mobilise youths to apply for the funds. "I am also going to work with our MCAs to help us reach the huge number of youths in remote areas to come on board for this fund to end poverty among themselves," he said. He said other counties have utilised the funds and absorption is 80-90 per cent whereas in Vihiga absorption is still below 50 per cent. “This fund is here for you and we need you to come in large numbers to make use of it,” Ottichilo told the youth. The governor told the Star on the phone he was concerned over escalating poverty among the youth in Vihiga. “With the rate at which graduates are flooding the job market and the shrinking job opportunities globally, youngsters need to think out of the box and become innovative,” Ottichilo said. However, some of the youths reached by the Star said terms and conditions for the funds are hard to fulfill. Edited by Henry Makori
