The Nakuru county government has formed a task force to come up with solutions to the challenges that have for years faced Lake Naivasha. Some of the problems include increased cases of illegal fishing, the use of undersize nets, seining, night fishing and an increase in the number of minors in the lake. County Agriculture chief officer Enos Amuyunzu said on Thursday the task force has already started its operations. The team is expected to come up with a report by December. “The main objective of the task force is to meet other stakeholders, identify the current challenges and seek a way of resolving them,” he said. Amuyunzu said they were working with the Kenya Maritime Authority (KMA) to address issues of safety and rising cases of boat accidents. “This is meant to reduce boat accidents, enhance safety and security, manage fisheries resources and improve compliance by vessels engaged in fishing and tourism,” he said. Lake Naivasha Boat Owners Association chairman David Kilo welcomed the arrival of KMA officers and Kenya Coast Guards, terming the move long overdue. “The current challenges facing the lake include safety and security, and we are confident that the Kenya Coast Guards and KMA officers will fully address this,” he said. On the rise in water levels, Kilo said poisonous waste from nearby estates and flower farms easily end up in the lake. “The lake ecosystem has been adversely affected by the flooding of the farms and informal settlements and this will have serious implications in the future,” he said.
