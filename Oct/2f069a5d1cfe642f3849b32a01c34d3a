Locally-based Harambee Stars players are set to hit camp on Sunday ahead of a friendly match against Zambia scheduled for next week at the Moi Stadium, Kasarani. Coach Francis Kimanzi on Monday named a 34-man provisional squad for the match meant to gauge the preparedness of the team for the two-legged Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Comoros next month. The players, most of whom have been out of competitive football from the time the government suspended sporting activities in a move aimed at containing the spread of coronavirus, are expected to reside at Safari Park hotel.  Earlier, there were fears that Stars may give the qualifiers a wide berth after football was ranked a high risk contact sport when Sports Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohamed announced resumption to sporting activities guidelines. However, Amina offered to help Harambee Stars honour their assignments.
