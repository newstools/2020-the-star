Kikuyu benga musicians will host a Mugiithi event at Clinton Hotel in Kikuyu on October 17. The event is a celebration of the reopening of the entertainment industry. Samido will headline the concert at the new hotel in a weekend of fun, food, drinks and music as Kenyan entertainment joints spring back to life. Speaking to Word Is, Senate Chief Whip Irungu Kangâ€™ata, who will be the chief guest, said he is looking forward to the event. "I will go and render moral support to the artistes on the said night," he said.
