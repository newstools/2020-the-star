MPs on Thursday started vetting of 14 personas nominated by President Uhuru Kenyatta as envoys. The National Assembly Defense and Foreign Relations Committee chaired by Kajiado South MP Katoo ole Metito vetted five nominees. They included John Tipis (Cabberra), Benson Ogutu (Moscow), Immaculate Wambua (Ottawa), Catherine Mwangi (Pretoria) and Martin Kimani (United Nations, New York). There was drama when MPs took on Kimani for listing President Kenyatta as his referee, knowing very well that he cannot be reached to testify on the nominee's suitability. MPs claimed that was a plot by the BBI joint secretary to intimidate them. Mandera North MP Abdullah Bashir questioned what informed the listing of the President as a referee, knowing very well he is not only the appointing authority but also the Head of State. Kimani who was part of the team which delivered the BBI report apologised to MPs. “I thought they (referees) are people who know my character and in particular to this assignment. I commit to providing another name,” Kimani said. On Friday, the committee will vet Jean Kamau (Adis Ababa), Lindsay Kiptiness (Bangkok), Tom Amolo (Berlin), Daniel Wambura (Bujumbura) and Stella Munyi (Harare). The exercise will end on Saturday when Samuel Nandwa (Juba), Ngewa Mukala (Khartoum), Joshua Gatimu (Tehran), Tabu Irina (Tokyo) and Jean Kimani (UN Habitat, Nairobi) will appear before the panel.
