Shining Hope for Communities Chief Executive Officer Kennedy Odede has called on Non-Governmental Organisations to avoid entering into informal agreements with their funders and partners. Speaking during an online session dubbed Equal Footing: The Future of Partnerships that brought together over 200 participants across the world, Odede said there is need for the partners to strike a win-win agreement so that all parties can be comfortable. “All the partners should have a say at the decision table. There should be dignity among the partners,” he said. While noting that funders of African NGOs mainly come from the West, Odede said there is need for respect. “It is good to give an opportunity to people who know local problems. There is a stereotype that Africans are corrupt and they are not creative. Decisions are made from London, New York or Washington DC. It is time for local communities to avoid saying yes to every decision that has been made. Local organisations have solutions to local issues,” he reiterated. Odede cited SHOFCO’s partnership with Give Directly during coronavirus period where the two organisations partnered to support the most vulnerable people in Kenyan slums. “Our partnership with Give Directly was out of necessity. Give directly had the machinery and we had the people. We used our local network and so far we have reached 35, 000 vulnerable people,” he said. Odede added that established NGOs in Africa should start supporting upcoming ones. SHOFCO is a grassroots movement that catalyzes large-scale transformation in urban slums by providing critical services for all, community advocacy platforms, and education and leadership development for women and girls.
