Police in Mwea East have launched investigations into two crimes that happened on Friday. The first involved a 22-year-old student who was lynched in Mugamba Ciura village after he allegedly hacked his 45-year-old uncle to death using a panga. Area police boss Luka Chebet said the uncle was possibly killed over an action movie. Michael Chomba, a resident, said the suspect, Francis Mwai, a form four student at a local secondary school in Mwea, is alleged to have been abusing  hard drugs. Elsewhere, a man suspected to have been a bodaboda thief was on Friday killed in Mwea  and his body set ablaze by a group of more than 300 bodaboda riders alleged to be from Kutus and Kagio. The incident happened few hours after he was rescued by police from the wrath of the angry residents, who wanted to lynch him. He was later taken to Kimbimbi sub-county hospital in Mwea for treatment but would later be ejected from the hospital by the angry riders who then proceeded to kill him and burn his body. The remains of all the deceased have been taken to Kerugoya County Referral Hospital morgue. Chebet pleaded with the public to be law abiding by channeling all their security related concerns to the relevant  crime investigative agencies.
