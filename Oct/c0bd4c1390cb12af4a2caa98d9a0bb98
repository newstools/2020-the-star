A Â plastic bags dealer was arrested in Bungoma during a crackdown by the National Environment Management Authority. The crackdown was led by Nema director John Maniafu with officers from Bungoma police station. Investigations showed that Lucy Njeri of Ludacy cosmetics shop in Bungoma town has been smuggling the banned items from Uganda and disbursing to small business operators. The government on March 17, 2017, banned the use and importation of plastic bags. Maniafu said Njeri would be arraigned on Monday. He said during the search they got 67 packets each containing 200 pieces of banned plastic bags. "This bale will be used in court as an exhibit. I have done enough investigations until I have got you. You have been disturbing me," he said. Maniafu police will work with Nema to ensure all plastic bags brokers are arrested and arraigned. He warned those running bakeries without official documents from Nema that their days were numbered. "People are still using plastic bags to package bread, mandazi and water melons on streets. Continue packaging at your own risk," he said. He called on Bungoma residents to plant trees for environmental conservation and stop cultivating along river banks. On the Covid-19 pandemic, Maniafu warned residents against throwing their used face masks in public places and instead dispose of them properly. Edited by Henry Makori
