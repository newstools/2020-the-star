The US Embassy has donated 153,000 reusable face masks to Uasin Gishu county to support the fight against spiking Covid-19 cases. Needy Grade 4 and Standard 8 learners who reported back to school early this month will benefit from the donations. US Ambassador Kyle McCarter delivered the consignment on Tuesday. It was received by Kapseret deputy county commissioner Joseph Satia and Health executive Everlyne Rotich. McCarter said the US government will continue to help the counties in every way possible as they continue to tackle the pandemic. He said there was a need to increase testing so that those found with the disease could be attended to on time to save lives. “We don’t want our people to die; we want them to survive the disease and this will be achieved if the number of people tested increases,” he added. McCarter said they will take more support to counties because they are closer to the people at the grassroots. “We now want to work with the county governments that are smaller, better, more efficient, more sensitive and more effective,” he said. Saita said the county committee will sit to decide how the donated masks will reach the very vulnerable students. “This is a good gesture from the US Embassy. The masks have come at the right time considering that not all students currently in school have masks, which exposes them to the danger of being infected with coronavirus,” Saita said. By Monday, Uasin Gishu had confirmed 1,354 Covid-19 cases, with 459 currently active. Rotich said 1,331 confirmed cases were from local transmissions and 23 were imported. The cases were from sampling and testing done by the county, Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital and private facilities.
