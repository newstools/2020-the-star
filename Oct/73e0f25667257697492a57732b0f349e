Film director Wanuri Kahiu has signed on to direct Paramount’s feature adaptation of the novel 'On the Come Up' by Angie Thomas. Angie is the author of one of the New York Times Bestselling film, 'The Hate U Give'. The story centres around Bri, 16, the daughter of an underground hip hop legend who died right before he hit big. Now she aspires to become one of the greatest rappers of all time but faces great odds. She pours her frustration into her first song, which goes viral for all the wrong reasons. Wanuri announced the news on Twitter, saying, "New project alert: It’s bigger than hip hop! I’m attached to direct a film based on the book 'On The Come Up'."
