The 'Americanah' mini-series adaptation by Lupita Nyong'o and Danai Gurira has been cancelled by HBO Max due to corona. Variety reported that the show has been dropped by streamer HBO Max after scheduling delays brought about by Covid-19 concerns forced Nyong'o to exit the project. The show was set to begin production earlier this year but the pandemic pushed the show's production date back, ultimately conflicting with shooting schedules for Nyong'o's other projects, Variety said. The movie is based on a book by the same title by award-winning Nigerian author Chimamanda Adichie. In 2019, Americanah earned a straight-to-series order from HBO Max. It follows a Nigerian woman named Ifemelu (which was to be played by Nyong'o) as she travels to America. "Americanah' has been a passion project for me since I read Chimamanda's beautiful novel in 2013," she said when it was announced.
