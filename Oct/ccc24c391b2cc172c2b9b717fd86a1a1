The Kenya Revenue Authority has intercepted concealed heroin and bhang that were being smuggled through an international courier service provider at JKIA. The heroin originated from Juba, South Sudan and was destined to Cambodia whereas the bhang had originated from Kasese in Uganda and was destined to France. Both consignments were separately intercepted after they were detected while passing through the non-intrusive scanners. The heroin was concealed in the buttons of dresses in the consignment while the bhang was wrapped in a black polythene paper concealed in an inner pocket of a Kitenge cloth. Both consignments were seized after seizure notices were issued and placed in the custody of the Anti-Narcotics Unit. Smuggling and importation of prohibited goods is an offence under the East African Community Customs Management Act 2004. A week ago, Heroin stashed in buttons of clothes were confiscated at JKIA en route from Juba and Entebbe to Cambodia and France respectively. An intelligence-led operationÂ saw the confiscation of unestablished amounts of the powdery substance before a search was conducted. Heroin makes the brain produce feel-good dopamine but after the tolerance is acquired a higher dose is needed to function. The drug has become cheaper, purer and more easily available. Users often take it as part of a cocktail of other drugs, often at parties.
