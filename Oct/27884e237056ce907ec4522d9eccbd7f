Japan vs Cameroon 09.10.2020 15:00 Playing for the first time in nearly ten months, Japan will hope to continue their impressive undefeated record against African teams. Additionally, they have never lost a H2H match, Winning three and drawing in one, whilst keeping a clean sheet on each occasion with the last encounter being a decade ago. Samurai Blues are yet to lose any of their last nine matches winning seven and drawing in two, with six of those wins finishing with a clean sheet. Eight of the nine matches saw the HT result replicated at FT, with the winner keeping a HT clean sheet in each game. Along similar lines, six of Japan’s last seven international friendlies have seen only one or neither team score. Cameroon have also assembled a strong-looking squad as their manager Toni Conceição looks to fine-tune his team ahead of their double-header against Mozambique next month. Cameroon’s tryst with draws extends in their record vs Asian sides. However, nine of their last 11 friendlies have seen a winner with the last two being stalemates! Seven of those nine win/loss results have come via a single-goal margin however, with three winning goals arriving beyond the 75th minute. Each of the two nations have looked strong at the back in their recent outings and so this could well be a game where defences will be on top.
