Gospel singer Ruth Matete's father Abel Amunga is officially a grandpa after the singer welcomed her firstborn daughter Toluwa last week. Speaking to Word Is on Friday, Abel advised his daughter is to be close to her baby. Having raised Ruth from a tender age, Abel said he made it through the hand of God. "Despite the challenges, Ruth is still strong and healthy, and she still has a future ahead of her," he said. "Now that she was widowed at a very tender age, she should learn just how she and I have been close to each other and so she should be close to her baby and make her her closest friend. "She should focus on her baby and if any other day, God will want to open a door for another marriage, that should not be a point of concern right now," he said.
