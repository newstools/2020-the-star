ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi on Tuesday met the Kenya National Council of Elders leadership led by its patron Captain Kungu Muigai. The meeting came on the same day the elders met Deputy President William Ruto at his Karen office. Other council leaders Mudavadi met were Phares Rutere, treasurer Ahmed Sef, deputy chairman Major John Seii, Philip Masinde and Sam Mumbi. He met 26 members of the council. Muigai is President Uhuru Kenyatta's cousin. Taking to Twitter, Mudavadi said, "We discussed the challenges of this country at length where I urged the elders that although they should be non-aligned in matters politics, they should be firmly aligned against corruption, impunity, tribalism and divisive politics." Recently, Muigai hit out at a section of Kikuyu elders who attended a meeting at Raila Odinga’s home in Bondo. He cautioned against supporting any political grouping. In early October, Muigai said elders should focus on uniting various political groupings to ensure a united country. “As elders, we don’t engage in petty politics. Our position is that all politicians are our children. If you are a father, and you find your two boys fighting, will you pick on one and continue whipping?” he asked. On Monday, President Uhuru Kenyatta urged Kenyans to shun tribalism. During the unveiling of the BBI report at the Bomas of Kenya on Monday, Uhuru said all Kenyans have been guilty of being tribal. “The fact of the matter is we are a tribal society and we want to run from that. Let us not cheat one another. I will also admit that I have been part and parcel of the negative politics. “That is why we must address the issue of inclusivity so that every single community will feel they are part and parcel of this country,” the President said. Uhuru explained the genesis of BBI and how his coming together with Raila was inspired by a need to ensure future generations enjoyed a stable, united and prosperous Kenya.
