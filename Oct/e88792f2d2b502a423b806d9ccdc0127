Residents of Old Kijabe in Maai Mahiu Ward in Naivasha have called upon the government to repeat the subdivision of their lands. The say the way the Nakuru County Government plans to expand the size of rural roads will affect their facilities at their homes. A resident, David Ng'ang'a, says facilities such as houses, animal sheds, fences, and toilets among others at different homes will be demolished. "The government officials came and placed bacons where the road will extend to, and we realised that some of us will be left with small portions of lands and lose a lot of facilities" he said. Wainaina says the village is occupied by more than 1,000 people. He spoke at a public baraza called by locals at Old Kijabe Town on Saturday, where locals wrote a petition letter to Governor Lee Kinyanjui and lands CS Faridah Karoney. "We are calling upon our governor and Lands CS to intervene in the issue. Some of us might be left with small portions of lands, and getting title deeds for them will be very tricky," said Hannah Wanjiku, a resident. Another resident, Samuel Wainaina, said some of them were resettled in those lands by defunct Nakuru County Council in 1960s. However, some says they had bought lands from first owners, adding that roads had been demarcated, but now those roads have been redesigned, the move that has shocked them and left them in confusion.
