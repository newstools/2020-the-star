In these unprecedented times, a show of unity and togetherness is incredibly important and as we continue to live in our new normal, it is vital that we celebrate those moments. Recently the Chinese government has partnered with the Kenyan Union of Journalists to celebrate both our artists, and our art, and they are giving creatives an opportunity to celebrate their community. This year as the opening of high-level meeting of the UN General Assembly commemorates its 75th anniversary, the Chinese embassy in Kenya has launched a photography/digital work contest, with a theme that looks at the various civilizations and exchanges and asks artists to reaffirm their collective commitment to multilateralism. The contest is open to both Kenyan citizens and Chinese nationals living in Kenya and wants to look at the cultural exchanges between people as well as harmonious stories about people in different nations. They also ask for stories that highlight groups working in solidarity to combat COVID-19 with pieces that reflect the china and Africa friendship being prioritized. People who are interested in entering the competition have until November 15th and can send in their photography, with the contest also accepting digital works such as posters, cartoons, animation or videos, not lasting more than five minutes. Prizes include a camera worth Ksh100,000-120,000, for the first prize winner, a laptop worth Ksh60,000-80,000. for the second prize winners, a smart phone worth Ksh40,000-50,000. for the third prize winners and a smart phone worth Ksh20,000-30,000 for the finalists.
