Deputy President William Ruto has extended his 'hustler' ideological brand to the Kenyan creative industry. The Deputy President on Wednesday announced his recent collaboration with singer Wilson Abubakar Radido, alias Willy Paul to support young creatives in the country. Willy Paul met the DP in his Karen home in Nairobi where they agreed to partner to promote the growth and development of the industry. "During an engagement with Wilson Abubakar Radido, popularly known as Willy Paul of the popular hit song “Sitolia”. We agreed to partner in our journey to make the creative economy flourish, Karen, Nairobi County," Ruto said via Twitter. "We are investing in the dreams of young people through creative arts with the appreciation that music, dance, drama, and more can promote positive and powerful economic and social transformation in our society." Ruto has used his ideological brand (hustler) to provoke a radical conversation about poverty. A bitter rivalry erupted when after President Uhuru Kenyatta directed Sh100 million be set aside to cushion artistes from the economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic. The bone of contention lied in the definition of who is an artiste. This then opened the fund to be accessed by not just the musicians and actors but by other creatives who are artistes, like painters, graphic designers, animators and photographers
