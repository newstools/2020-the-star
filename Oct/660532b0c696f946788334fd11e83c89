Diani police officers on Friday dismissed a meeting organised by Msambweni MP aspirant Feisal Bader at Ukunda showground in Kwale. The rally was expected to be attended by close allies of Deputy President William Ruto. They were to have a closed-door meeting at Diani Reef Beach Resort before addressing the public at the showground. Former Mombasa Senator Hassan Omar, former Machakos Senator Johnson Muthama, former Kakamega Boni Khalwale and Kikuyu MP Kimani Ichung'wah were to preside over the meeting. But police in full riot gear stormed the venue and dispersed the gathering. Bader is preparing for the December 15 by-election after the seat fell vacant following the death of Suleiman Dori in March from cancer. In the morning, police had mounted roadblocks in and out of Diani to prevent any convoy from heading towards the venue. They were led by subcounty police commander Nehemiah Bitok. “The meeting has been postponed to a further date, your leaders will tell you what to do. Meanwhile, go home,” he said. Early this week the National Security Advisory Committee prohibited public gatherings not certified by the local police. On Thursday police stormed Ruto’s planned fundraiser in Nyamira county and dispersed members of the public. Bader said he respected the police orders but he will not be intimidated from supporting the DP. “Let me remind Kenyans, whoever was my uncle’s best is also my family ally and we will be there for them,” he said. Bader is related to Dori and wants to carry on his legacy. Edited by JMM
