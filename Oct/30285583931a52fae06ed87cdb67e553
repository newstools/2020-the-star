This is equivalent to a 10.3% positivity rate against the required five per cent needed to be sustained over a period of at least two weeks as a measure of the virus being contained. The ministry had warned of a possible second wave following a rising number of cases in the past couple of days. The Ministry of Health in a statement confirmed 583 of the new cases were Kenyans while 21 were foreigners. Cumulative tests so far stand at  601,623. From the  cases, 400 are males and 204 females.

Out of this, 56 were discharged from the home-based care programme while 32 were from various health facilities. Another 10 patients succumbed to the disease, bringing the country's fatalities to 797.

Meanwhile, the ministry of health has announced plans to conduct random sampling in schools to establish the rate of infection in the institutions. While making the announcement via Twitter, Acting Director General Patrick Amoth said returning to stricter restrictions is definitely an option as was stated by President Uhuru Kenyatta. "We have put a surveillance system in place to monitor for any increased cases especially in schools. We also plan to do random sampling in schools to be able to establish the rate of infection in schools if at all," he said. "Should we witness a surge, then that will be our final option for the good of the country."
