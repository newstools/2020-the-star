Former Kenya Cup champions Nakuru RFC are set to sign nine players during this transfer window. Head coach Felix Oloo said they are keen to beef up after missing out on the playoffs for the 2019-2020 season. The 2013 /2014 champions finished seventh on the log with 41 points —two points behind cross-town rivals Menengai Oilers for the final play-off position. Oloo said they hope to bolster the tight five as his side chase a place in the playoffs once the new season kicks off subject to Ministry of Sport guidelines on resumption of contact sports. "The key for us will be in the forwards.  As you know, the game of 15s is won upfront and those who give good quality set of forwards win matches,"  he added. Oloo, who doubles up as the Kenya Lionesses coach, could not divulge the players  the club is eyeing  but was bullish about the team's chances for the new season. “The fans will be excited with the calibre of players joining the side and it will be a statement of intent of our ambitions for the new season once it starts, ” he said. Oloo said he will tweak their tactical approach in the new season. “We may make some adjustments to our t approach to some matches,” added Oloo.  This will be Oloo's second full season at the helm and the tactician believes the side is quickly adapting to his methods. “Last year was a transitional year and we had our ups and downs. The team is now settled and with the additional signings coming our way, we will be better than last time,” added Oloo.
