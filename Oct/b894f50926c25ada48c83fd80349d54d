Kemsa has released Sh40 million worth of medical stocks to 138 facilities in Kisumu county. The beneficiaries comprise 19 hospitals and rural health facilities. The disbursement will increased availability of essential medicine to improve healthcare services. The consignment procured from Kemsa will be delivered to the doorstep of all the health facilities in Kisumu. Acting CEO Edward Njoroge said with the scale-up of Universal Health Coverage to all the 47 counties, Kisumu orders for HPT’s were received in the warehouse and were scheduled to be dispatched on October 6.  However, distribution is still ongoing. Njoroge noted that the authority remains fully committed to improving the quality of healthcare for all Kenyans.  He said this is by enabling counties to procure quality HPT’s at an affordable cost through economies of scale. Governors on September 8 resolved to procure medical supplies from sources other than Kemsa. The resolution was made at an extraordinary Council of Governors meeting, at a time graft claims were reported at the agency. Kemsa  is under probe over corruption claims in its procurement of Covid-19 supplies. Njoroge, however, said they will continue to enter into strategic partnerships with all the county governments to deliver quality and affordable health services to the citizens. He confirmed that 43 counties have so far received their orders under the second round of UHC. "Kemsa is delighted to serve Kenyans as guided by its mandate to ensure that county governments access quality HPT’s at the right time and in the right quantities," he said. Njoroge at the same time urged the counties to fulfill their commitment to ensure an uninterrupted supply of medical commodities. “The success of healthcare service delivery in the country hinges to a great extent on the presence of an enabling environment, an environment that is marked by the will and commitment of all health stakeholders," said Njoroge.
