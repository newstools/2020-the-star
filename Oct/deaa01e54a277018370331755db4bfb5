Anerlisa Muigai has hinted she is not in good terms with her Tanzanian celebrity husband Ben Pol. The Keroche heiress took to social media to speak about her relationship with the Tanzanian singer after he went live. "Somebody called me, asking if I was aware 'my husband' was live, talking things she couldn’t understand, she even sent me screenshots," she wrote. "Unfortunately, I never got to watch but it makes it clear that we are not in good terms. I am a person who likes to protect my image and all I know is that I like being respected and any husband should do the same to their wife." This comes barely two weeks after their wedding photos surfaced online. Anerlisa unfollowed Ben Pol in August, a few months after they had their private wedding. They also deleted each other’s pictures on Instagram.
