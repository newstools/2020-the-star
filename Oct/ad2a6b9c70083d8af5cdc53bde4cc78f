Despite four bogeys on both nines, Golf Park’s David Wakhu racked up his second career Safari Tour victory at the par 72 Sigona Golf Club course. The soft-spoken pro made his big comeback to the summit incidentally on a day foreign pros struggled with play. With rounds of 69, 74, 71, and 73, the Golf Park man wrapped up his four-day campaign with a gross total of 1 under par 287. He beat his Golf Park stablemate Eric Ooko, Dismas Indiza and Edwin Mudanyi by three strokes to lift the coveted Sigona trophy. Wakhu, who picked Sh150,000 for the win, was the overnight leader on penultimate day along with Ooko and Mudanyi. This was Wakhu’s first Safari Tour win since Nyali 2018. “I’m happy. The win couldn’t have come at a better time when I was struggling with heel and elbow issues. All in all, the result has restored the much needed confidence and given me the strength to focus more on big events as we prepare for the Kenya Open,” Wakhu said. He shot one over yesterday despite dropping shots on the 5th, 6th, 7th and 16th. “It’s been a tough outing through and through. The bogeys looked quite scary as the last round wore on. Luckily, my closest opponents also struggled,” Waku added. Edwin Mudanyi, a younger sibling of Muthaiga’s Nelson was on course for great things but stumbled with a round of 4 over par 76 to settle for second place. Ooko, who was also a penultimate round leader, was left to rue a 5 over he posted on the back nine after playing level par in the front nine. “Today (yesterday), there are no excuses. I just struggled in the second nine with a 5 over and this is what cost me the top award. I had a double bogey on the par three 14th and dropped another two shots on the par four 16th and the 17th. The birdie I picked on the 18th helped to keep me in second position,” Ooko said. It was a bad day in the office for foreign pros. Zimbabwean Robson Chinhoi who has given Kenyans a run for their money in the recent events found himself in an unfamiliar 11th spot after a closing round of 7 over par 79 in the four days 72 hole stroke-play competition. Chinhoi, who was the victor at Royal Nairobi a fortnight ago finished 69 ,75, 73 ,79 for a total of 16 over par 296 gross. Philip Kasozi of Uganda wrapped up his campaign in 21st position with scores of  73, 78, 76, 77  for a gross total of 16 over par 304. Paul Chidale of Malawi came 24th with +21. Adel Balala of Mombasa, who tied with Rizwan Charania in the 18th position, was the leading amateur player with 12 over par 300. Naomi Wafula was second placed amateur in the 23rd spot. Wafula also made history by becoming the first lady golfer to make a Safari Tour cut.
