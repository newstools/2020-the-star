The Busia government has installed a Sh15 million oxygen plant at the county referral hospital. The project, funded by the World Bank through the Kenya Devolution Support Programme, will supply oxygen to theatres, wards and the accident and emergency unit. Oxygen will also be supplied to the maternity and newborn units once they are completed. The plant will also help in refilling cylinders from subcounty hospitals. The installation is in line with Governor Sospeter Ojaamong's agenda of improving services. Chief officer for Health and Sanitation Isaac Omeri said the plant will benefit patients with critical conditions, including newborns who require oxygen supplementation and those admitted to the intensive care units. “The plant has the capacity to produce oxygen to supply the entire referral hospital. We have piped all sections that require oxygen, among them wards, theatres and maternity,” Dr Omeri said. Omeri spoke at the health offices in Busia town. He observed that the unit will reduce the cost of purchasing oxygen from companies that have been supplying the facility. Busia County Referral Hospital spends about 40 cylinders of oxygen, translating into Sh240,000 monthly. “We have been using oxygen cylinders purchased from manufacturers, with one cylinder ranging from Sh4,000 to Sh6,000 and only serving one or two patients,”  he added. “The consumption of oxygen in other public health facilities within Busia county, especially Kocholia, Alupe and Port Victoria subcounty referral hospitals that operate theatres, is also very high.”
