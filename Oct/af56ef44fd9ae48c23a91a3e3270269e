About 3,000 Migori county workers have threatened to go on strike over delayed payment of September salaries. Through the county branch of Kenya County Government Workers Union, the group said they expected their salary on October 5 but it has yet to be paid. On October 9, union general secretary Rob Duba wrote to Margret Nyakang’o, Controller of Budget, to demand payment. He accused Nyakang’o of refusing to approve salaries, which amount to 56 per cent of county budget on recurrent expenditure. “The unprecedented delay has caused great pain and aguish amongst the employees as their NHIF remittance is not up to date rendering them unable to access healthcare,” Duba said. He said any further delays would lead to industrial action. On Monday, county union officials led by chairman Charles Opiyo and secretary general Peter Jaoko said they were ready to embark of the strike and paralyse the entire county in case of further delay. “We have schools reopening from Monday and most parents are stranded. Some have already got notice of rent payment in their homes, which is not acceptable,” Opiyo said. But Migori County Secretary Christopher Rusana downplayed the delay, saying it was caused by slow pace of government to release funds to counties. “Migori has never delayed payment of salaries even when the country was thinking of locking down devolved units. What we have is an hiccup, which will not end in a strike as the salaries will be paid soon,” he said. Edited by Henry Makori
