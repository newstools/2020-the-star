Farmers from Kilifi have been urged to use certified seeds to increase production and ensure food security. Bayer East African Limited sales manager John Kanyigi noted that most farmers end up with low yields because they use low quality seeds. He spoke during an event on Wednesday when he distributed free seeds to farmers in the county. He said a 2kg bag of seeds would cost Sh500 on the market. Other counties benefiting from the seeds are Kwale, Tana River, Machakos Makueni, Kitui, Meru and Tharaka Nithi. The seed initiative is meant to help small-scale farmers increase their yield. â€œI know we could have opted to give you money, but with the seeds, you will harvest more bags of maize and when you sell, you will smile all the way to the bank," Kanyigi said. He said the variety the company supplied matures within 90 days and can survive in moderate rainfall areas. The consignment of 80 tonnes of seeds was flagged off during the event witnessed by Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi, Agriculture executive Lusiana Sanzua and chief officer Fredrick Kaingu. Kingi thanked the company for its efforts to mitigate famine in the county. He said that before devolution, the county was mostly relying on food donations from the national government and NGOs. This has, however, changed as the county has been encouraging farmers to produce more food. He said the seed donations will go a long way in dealing with food insecurity. Kingi further said that the county was negotiating with the national government so that farmers could be given opportunities in the Galana Kulalu project.
