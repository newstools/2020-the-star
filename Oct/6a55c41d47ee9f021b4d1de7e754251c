The National Police Service Commission has approved recruitment of 5,000 police constables and 150 cadets. This follows requests by Inspector General of Police Hillary Mutyambai for additional officers into the service. The request was granted during a full commission meeting on Thursday attended by all commissioners, Interior PS Karanja Kibicho as well as the Directorate of Criminal Investigation boss George Kinoti. The police force has been facing an acute staff shortage as there has been no recruitment in the last two years. It is estimated about 3,000 police officers had left the service in three years. However, the latest recruitment number is still a far cry from the 10,000 the state has been hiring in past years. The commission was expected to set the minimum requirements for prospective recruits and appoint officers to supervise the exercise during the crucial meeting. The NPSC is expected to publish the recruitment calendar by mid-October, to pave the way for the exercise in November.
