Women facing discrimination due to their HIV status will get free legal representation by Fida. This follows a deal signed by the HIV Tribunal and women lawyers organisation Fida on Thursday. Under the agreement, female victims of HIV discrimination will receive psychosocial support and economic empowerment. Beneficiaries will include girls denied access to school based on their status. Women and girls subjected to HIV testing without their consent and results released without their consent will also benefit. "This partnership will also help fasten the justice train for victims of HIV stigmatisation before the tribunal," tribunal chair Helen Namisi said. Most of the victims of discrimination lack legal representation as they cannot afford it. Often, they have to rely on pro bono lawyers, but there are not many to handle cases. This forces them to represent themselves before the seven-member tribunal. Namisi said the women get so emotional because they have to come before seven strangers and retell a traumatic experience. And in most cases, they have to face the person who violated their rights. She said the most difficult part is that immediately they finish recounting their ordeal and walk out of the tribunal, they do not have anyone who can give them professional psychological counseling. The memorandum signed on Thursday means Fida's lawyers will offer legal representation, coaching for self-representation and draft pleadings for them. "Quite a number before the tribunal are women from poor backgrounds who might not be able to access professional counselling or a lawyer. This partnership will bridge that gap," Fida executive director Ann Ireri said. Edited by Henry Makori
