Most West Pokot residents don't bother to wear face masks to protect against Covid-19, though cases are rising nationwide and in West Pokot. West Pokot recorded its first case in late July but in the last two weeks the county has recorded more than 20 cases. Residents and medics have attributed the sharp increase to more public meetings organised by politicians, who give residents a tiny bit of money to attend. “Politicians are organising functions without consideration of the risks to which they are exposing their people. We fear these gathering might have lead to the spread of the virus,” one resident said. Speaking at Chepareria, Health CEC Jackson Yaralima said residents haven’t observed the Covid-19 protocols. He condemned politicians for not observing the Covid-19 regulations, saying they are worsening the situation. “We need to avoid blame games, everybody should wear a mask. Politicians should also stop public gatherings, he said. A number of government officials are in intensive care units across the country as the county government grapples with setting up an ICU at Kapenguria Referral Hospital. Yaralima urged security officers to enforce wearing of masks since residents had relaxed. “People are mingling freely and they have forgotten that Covid is real and is here with us,” he said. Yaralima said schools are open and asked school heads to help all learners to wear masks and frequently wash their hands with soap and water. He said the 300-patient ICU centre at Aramaget is almost operational. He said some of the coronavirus patients from West Pokot have had to be admitted to ICU centres in other counties. (Edited by V.
