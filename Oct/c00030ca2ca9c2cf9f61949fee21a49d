The UNHCR has urged the government to support mental health programmes for refugees and internally displaced persons to reduce suicide attempts. The UN refugee agency also wants the state to include refugees in its Covid-19 recovery plans, saying most of them who depend on the informal sector to earn a living, have lost their jobs. Presently, cash and food transfers across all refugee camps have been reduced by between 10 and 30 per cent, with the World Food Programme cutting rations by 40 per cent. In a statement on Tuesday, the refugee agency said the rising economic and food insecurity has fuelled a mental health crisis in camps in Kenya, causing a rise in suicide attempts among refugees. "They are also anxious about their health and that of their families, not knowing when the pandemic will end and how they can really protect themselves. They see a lack of solutions and lack hope in the future," the UNHCR said. It added, "If we don’t address their well-being now in a holistic way, the effects may be irreversible and can last for generations." In Dadaab, for instance, mental health experts say the number of attempted suicides is surging. Psychosocial consultations have also jumped by more than 50 per cent since last year. "We are witnessing a dramatic deterioration in the mental health of camp residents. In Dagahaley, one of the three Dadaab refugee camps, psychological consultations have risen from 505 to 766 over a period of one year," Doctors Without Borders said. In the same camp, five people have reportedly died by suicide in the past two months. Kenya is among the top refugee host countries in Africa. It hosts about 489,000 refugees and 18,500 stateless persons. About 50 per cent of the refugees reside in the Dadaab camp in Garissa county. Another 40 per cent are in Kakuma in Turkana and 16 per cent are in urban areas, mainly Nairobi.  Edited by A.N
