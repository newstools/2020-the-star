Defending champion Brigid Kosgei is the 2020 women's London Marathon winner. She crossed the line in 2:18:58. This year's marathon does not have thousands of charity runners and even more people cheering them on from the pavements. Instead, the only sign of the race happening in the capital is a barricade of screens, snaking around St James's Park. ODM leader Raila Odinga was among the first to send Kosgei a congratulatory message on Sunday. He took to Twitter to say, "What an outstanding run, congratulations Brigid Kosgei on successfully defending your title and winning the #LondonMarathon. You have lived up to the strong Kenyan tradition in distance running. Keep going and keep inspiring. Hongera!" More follows...
