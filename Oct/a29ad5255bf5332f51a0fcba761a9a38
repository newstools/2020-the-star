Residents of Binyiny village in Kipkelion East are living in fear after an elephant strayed from Mau Forest into the area. The jumbo struck in the wee hours of Saturday morning. Kenya Wildlife Service officers used a chopper to drive the animal back to the forest. The exercise took six hours. However, residents are still in fear that the jumbo might return to the area. Kericho county commissioner Kamau Karugo confirmed the incident to the Star on the phone. “All what I know is that one elephant strayed from Mau West Forest to Binyiny village in Kipkelion East,” he said. Kamau said no injuries or destruction of crops were reported. He praised residents for reporting the incident to KWS officials.
