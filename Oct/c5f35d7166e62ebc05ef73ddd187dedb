@robertomollo3 Sittings at the Homa Bay assembly have been suspended for two weeks after one MCA tested positive for Covid-19. The male MCA tested positive when he was on a visit to Kisumu. He is currently isolated as he gets treatment at a Covid-19 facility in Kisumu. Following the confirmation, the assembly suspended all sittings to enable all 40 members to get tested. Other staff at the county assembly will also be tested for the virus to minimise the spread. Assembly Majority leader John Kiasa said all MCAs and staff members will have to undergo a mandatory test. “The county assembly is working with the Health department to ensure all MCAs and staffers are tested for the virus. We’ll resume normal sittings once we get an assurance that we are safe,” Kiasa said. Health surveillance officers have already taken samples from the wife and children of the MCA who tested positive. Homa Bay county currently has 12 active cases of Covid-19 under home-based care. More than 70 people have contracted the disease in the county since its outbreak in Kenya. Health executive Richard Muga said 19 others are admitted in various isolation centres including Kandiege, Pala Koguta, Pala Masogo and Nyagoro. Muga said more people are turning positive because of their casual approach towards the set protocols for containing the virus. “It is dangerous to disobey the guidelines put by the government to contain the virus. The spread of the disease is now community-based so everybody must take personal responsibility to protect themselves and their neighbours,” Muga said. Deputy Governor Hamilton Orata assured the public that the Homa Bay government is doing all it can to help contain the virus. “We’re encouraging residents to comply with the guidelines given by the Ministry of Health,” Orata said.
