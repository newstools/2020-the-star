 A Kiambu leaders' forum has urged President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto to unite Jubilee members and end the wrangles in the ruling party. The leaders said it is disheartening that problems in Jubilee are perpetuated by some Mt Kenya party members. “It is sad that people from Mt Kenya are fighting each other. The President, who is also the party leader, and his deputy should unite and bring their people together to avoid violence,” forum member Felix Kamiri said at Kirigiti on Monday. Kamiri condemned the death of two people on Sunday at Kenol in Murang'a county during a church function attended by Ruto. Scores of other people were injured. The DP blamed the violence on top government officials. “The people who disrupted this church event are top government officials employed by President Uhuru Kenyatta and me. They work under us. Going forward, this will not happen again,” Ruto told the African Independent Pentecostal Church of Africa faithful. Rose Waithaka regretted during the Monday meeting that politics had taken centre stage and feared the escalation of violence if the top leaders do not unite. The forum was disappointed with elected leaders in Kiambu, accusing them of neglecting issues that matter to the electorate. “Our leaders have kept mum on our needs and the country is being thrown into campaign mode, yet the general election is in 2022,” Machenga Gicharu said. He said Building Bridges Initiative is an important matter yet leaders had not sensitised the electorate on what it entails. “The BBI and the constitutional amendment are matters we should be discussing as they are crucial for all Kenyans. Our leaders are yet to come to us so that people can be sensitised on the matter,” Gicharu said. The forum also urged members of the County Assembly to ensure development in their areas and stop political fights. Edited by A.N
