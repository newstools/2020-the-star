Malindi MP Aisha Jumwa and her aide Geoffrey Otieno will have to spend their Mashujaa Holiday in custody after the court remanded them for three more days. Jumwa and Otieno were to answer to murder charges on Monday but did not as they had not undergone a mental assessment. Judge Njoki Mwangi directed the MP and her aide be remanded at the Port police before they are presented for mental assessment at the Coast general hospital on Wednesday. On the earlier bond terms, Mwangi said the bond issued at the lower court was an anticipatory bond therefore not applicable in the current case. Mombasa assistant DPP Alloys Kemo had earlier told the court not grant Jumwa and her aide bond since they had ignored the summons. Kemo said Jumwa and her co-suspect had been issued with a summon to present themselves for mental assessment but failed to do so. Jumwa is accused of fatally injuring Gumbao Jola, who was shot dead during Ganda Ward in Malindi Constituency in 2019. The Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions last week okayed a murder charge against Jumwa over the killing of Ngumbao. The ODPP's Mombasa Regional Head Alloys Kemo had approved murder and assault charges against Jumwa and Geoffrey Okuto Otieno over the fatal shooting of the man and injury of several people during the poll. The man was shot in the shoulder and killed during the chaos and several other people, including police officers, were injured. Jumwa had stormed a meeting organised by Reuben Katana, an ODM candidate in the by-election. Ngumbao Jola, 48, died upon arrival at Malindi General Hospital. He was Katanaâ€™s uncle.
