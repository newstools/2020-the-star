Barely two weeks after Kitui chief of staff Chrispus Ileli bolted out of Governor Charity Ngilu’s administration, Education executive David Kivoto is following suit. During an interview in Mwingi town on Thursday, the CEC said he presented his resignation letter to Ngilu on October 19 and the governor welcomed his intention to leave. Kivoto will, however, be in office until mid-November. He cited frustrations during his term as the main reason for the decision. "I have decided to hang up my boots as far as serving in Governor Ngilu’s administration is concerned. I have endured untold frustration during my stint as CECM,” he said on Thursday. Kivoto has for more than a year been using his personal car for official duties after his official vehicle was grounded. Ngilu is now remaining with four CEMs out of the nine she appointed in 2017. Those still in office are Jacob Kakundi (Lands and Infrastructure), Benard Katungi (Treasury) and Koki Musau (Sports).
