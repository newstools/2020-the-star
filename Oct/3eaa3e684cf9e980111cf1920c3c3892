A man arrested on suspicion of slashing his neighbour's head with a panga over disconnected power was on Thursday charged at a Makadara law court. James Mwaura is accused of attacking Leonard Kipkui on September 18 at Mbotela estate, Makadara subcounty, Nairobi. He denied the charges before Makadara senior principal magistrate Angelo Kithinji. Kipkirui is reported to have arrived home from work in the evening, when he received a call and walked out of the house. As he was speaking, Mwaura confronted him and accused him of disconnecting electricity to his house. Kipkirui pleaded with him to be calm, telling him he had just arrived from work and knew nothing about the allegations. The suspect then returned to his house and left Kipkurui who continued with his call. He then suddenly felt Â a slap from a metal bar which landed on his right side of the face and he felt down. While still writhing in pain on the ground, Mwaura took a panga and cut his head. Kipkirui became unconscious. The suspect then left and locked himself in his house. Kipkurui was saved by a neighbour who came out after hearing him groaning in pain. He administered first aid on him and rushed him to Mama Lucy Hospital, where he was treated and discharged. Mwaura was arrested and taken to Makongeni police station. Kithinji directed the matter to be heard on March 18, while the accused was freed on a cash bail of Sh20,000.
