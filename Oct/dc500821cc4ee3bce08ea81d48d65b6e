Mabati Rolling Mills Limited (MRM), a member of the Safal Group, has launched the SAFBUILD Manufacturing Plant at its Athi River facility. MRM’s SAFBUILD brings to the market a new way of building quality steel framed buildings using custom designed Proprietary Software. The cold formed high strength frames are fully factory-produced ready for quick erection and assembly at site. The plant has a capacity to supply both domestic and regional markets in a range of standard buildings and custom designed solutions. “SAFBUILD and SAFDESIGN now provides us world class technology in Pre-Engineered Steel Building solutions which allows us to deliver buildings to clients within very tight timelines”  said Andrew Heycott, CEO Mabati Rolling Mills. “We believe this innovative investment will revolutionize the way modular Steel buildings are constructed. This will further support the Government’s ‘Big Four’ agenda, further contribute to the competitiveness of Kenya’s manufacturing and agricultural sectors and help to ensure greater compliance to building standards” Speaking during the commissioning ceremony, the SAFBUILD Business Head, Manish Garg, was confident that many projects across commercial, agricultural, industrial and social sectors will benefit from the solution. “Since commissioning we have produced and supplied several projects to satisfied clients and we have many more in the pipeline under current design and production. The buildings are made fit-for-purpose to exacting designs and are environmentally sustainable” added Garg. Kenya and indeed the East African Region remains on a trajectory of rapid urbanization and infrastructure development. There is increased demand for more sustainable buildings that deliver greater efficiency and for more efficient construction methods to provide durability.
