Independent candidate Faisal Bader has been cleared and handed a certificate by the IEBC for the forthcoming Msambweni by-elections. Bader was given the certificate after submitting his nomination papers for approval on Thursday in Kwale. At least 11 candidates are expected to be cleared by IEBC to contest for the Msambweni parliamentary seat. Four people are independent candidates, while seven are from various political parties. Candidates with political parties are scheduled to be cleared on Friday. In the morning, Mariam Sharlet was the first to be cleared as an independent. Bader will now face ODM and Wiper candidates in the by-election slated for December 15 if they meet IEBC requirements. In his speech after clearance, Bader urged Msambweni residents to vote peacefully. "Let's observe peace and conduct fair by-elections, " he said. He also called his rivals to join him, saying it was a waste of time competing with him, adding he will "emerge a winner even before dusk". Bader who has the support of Deputy President William Ruto confirmed that he was ready for the battle. Lunga-Lunga and Kinango MPs Khatib Mwashetani and Benjamin Tayari are also backing Bader. Recently, Governor Salim Mvurya and his deputy Fatuma Achani declared their support. Bader will be at Sawa Sawa grounds in Msambweni to launch his first political rally. Former Mombasa Senator Hassan Omar, Machakos Johnston Muthama and Tangatanga-affiliated delegates from Nairobi are expected at the meeting. The seat fell vacant after the late MP Suleiman Dori died in March while undergoing treatment at Aga Khan Hospital in Mombasa.
