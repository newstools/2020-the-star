National team captain Constant Wakhura wants coach Fidelis Kimanzi to maintain the squad that featured in last year's Olympic qualifiers in South Africa. Wakhura, who also skippers defending champions Butali Warriors,  said the team is a blend of youth and experience hence has a bright future. Kimanzi was appointed in March but has had no time to fine-tune his charges due to coronavirus pandemic with the regional African Cup of Nations qualifiers set for  January 2021 in Nairobi. Kimanzi took over from coach Meshack Senge, who served the team for close to a decade. Senge doubles up as Strathmore University Gladiators and Scorpions coach. "To be honest the team that represented the country last year has what it takes to deliver. "We had a lot of talented rookies who gained valuable experience from the trip and I expect them to punch above their weight in the upcoming assignment. "I believe for continuity sake, we have to stick with the same players although the coach has the final decision." At the same time, he urged the Kenya Hockey Union to engage the the Sports Ministry to allow  teams to resume training. "The likes of  Gor Mahia  and national basketball team are back in training ahead of their respective continental assignments and I think the same olive branch should be extended to hockey," he noted He added: "It would be ideal to be back on the pitch early next month. The union has to reach a consensus with the ministry faster because we are already behind schedule.We have neither had training nor stick work for the past seven months or so." Kenya men's team face Burundi, Libya, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda and Seychelles. while their women counterparts square it out with Egypt, Burundi, Libya, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda and Seychelles.
