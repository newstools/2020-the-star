Mombasa county officials have said the recent ranking of counties by Infotrak Research and Consulting was not fair. The research firm on Wednesday ranked Mombasa among the poor performing counties in the health sector. The devolved unit was ranked position 45 out 47 counties, with a score of 44.9 per cent. But public health communications officer Richard Chacha said the county has always prioritised health services and the results are not a true reflection of what is on the ground. “When it comes to health, we performed well. The ranking was not fair because during the Covid-19 pandemic, we were the top county to introduce many things including sanitation booths and mobilisation of ventilators,” Chacha said. County communications officer Mudathir Ahmed added, “I do not know the criteria they used during the ranking because our hospitals have the best services.” According to Infotrak, the ranking of the counties was done based on the performance after 37,000 respondents in the 47 counties were interviewed.
