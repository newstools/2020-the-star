Edwin Inana Asuza moved to the summit on Day Two of Safari Tour Golf Series contrary to expectations. With rounds of 2 under par 70 on Sunday and level par 72 on Monday, Inana savoured a one stroke lead as play reached halfway stage at the par 72 Sigona Golf Club course. Three players Dismas Indiza, Samuel Njoroge and David Wakhu settled for T2 with a cumulative total of 1 under par 143. Three more, Robson Chinhoi of Zimbabwe, Brian Njoroge and Eric Ooko are on level par 144. Naomi Wafula, on T8 is the best placed amateur. A total of 22 players including Wafula made the cut while nine more, including Railways Alfred Nandwa, failed. Wafula has been on top form this week after a 74 and 71 yesterday. Wafula said: “Safari Tour is going well at Sigona. I scored +2 from the men’s tee box and played with pro Robson. Level par on Round 2 wasn’t that bad.” Indiza and Rizwan Charania played the day’s best round of 3 under par. Charania said: “I made some poor swings on Day One leading to a couple of double bogeys and bogeys mainly between holes 7 and 12. Today (yesterday), I was good on my tee shots.” The 2020/21 Safari Tour, the only pro golf tour in East Africa, teed off at Limuru Country Club earlier in the month where Greg Snow swept the ground with all his opponents. On the second week of the month, Zimbabwe man Robson Chinhoi staged a stunning penultimate day fightback to emerge the victor at the Royal Nairobi Golf Club with a cumulative total of 9 under which flabbergasted all and sundry. Indiza who had a bad start in the first two legs was untouchable at Vet Lab where he vanquished Chinhoi by two strokes after a penultimate round of 5 under. Action resumes Tuesday morning.
