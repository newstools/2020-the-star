Kiss FM presenters Jalang'o and Chito Ndhlovu say many women are single and at home because their fathers never approved of their lovers. Noting how important it is to have a great relationship with your future parents-in-law, Jalas urged men to always make sure they win them over. The two were speaking on the morning Kiss yesterday. Chito, however, urged people to grab their lovers and run away with them, just like in fairytale stories. "No you don't seek approval from her family but blessings, and you should take your woman and leave if they don't approve of your relationship," Chito said. "I mean, the AG doesn't ask for your parent's approval." Countering his colleague, Jalas said, "You know you are one of the few lucky people who had a good relationship with your mum and father-in-law," Jalas said. Chito said, "I have a fantastic relationship with my in-laws. Our relationship is about love, respect and fellowship. "I do call my mum-in-law, we vibe stories and all, my dad-in-law would call to tell me there's something he wants us to do and we do!" Chito was sitting in for Kamene, who hosts The Morning Kiss with Jalang'o. The station has been generous to its viewers with the "Kisses of Kindness" project, in which the two presenters shower listeners with gifts.
