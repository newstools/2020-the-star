NTV investigative reporter Dennis Okari aired an expose on Mugo wa Wairimu, a quack doctor who unlawfully operated a clinic and a pharmacy. On Wednesday, Mugo was sentenced to three years in jail if he fails to pay a Sh.1.4 million fine. Reacting to the courtâ€™s decision, Okari wrote on his social media accounts; "I investigated this quack doctor Mugo wa Wairimu for nearly three months back in 2018. I painfully watched his deranged activities and what he did to women in his clinic, finally justice has been served." Mugo was charged with unlawfully operating an unregistered pharmacy and operating a medical laboratory without a licence from the Kenya Medical Laboratory Practitioners. He was also charged with practising as an unregistered nurse.
