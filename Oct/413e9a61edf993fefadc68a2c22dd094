In Kisii yesterday President Uhuru Kenyatta called for radical constitutional reform to end the winner-takes-all politics that continually divides Kenya. He was speaking ahead of the imminent release of the BBI proposals for structural change in Kenya. Reportedly the key change in the BBI is the creation of a Prime Minister and deputy Prime Ministers. The original Bomas draft constitution wanted an executive Prime Minister elected by MPs with a ceremonial president. The PM would be the person who could mobilise the most support in Parliament. He could therefore come from any party or any region and would need to keep as many people as possible happy. It was felt that that would end the winner-takes-all mentality of the imperial presidency. The BBI reportedly proposes that the Prime Minister will be recommended by the National Assembly but will be appointed by the President who will still retain many executive powers. That raises the question of whether the BBI proposal will be radical enough. Perhaps we need to revisit the Bomas idea of a purely ceremonial President and an executive PM who is the real leader of the country. Quote of the day: "Good wishes alone will not ensure peace."
