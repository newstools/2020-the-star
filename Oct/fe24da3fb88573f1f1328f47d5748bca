The government has declared Saturday a public holiday to be marked through prayer and community work. Interior CS Fred Matiang'i in a statement announced October 10 as Huduma Day in the exercise of the powers conferred by Cap 110 of the Public Holidays Act. Matiang'i said the day should be observed through national prayers that will highlight service and volunteerism to the community. "Kenyans are encouragedÂ to participate in the prayers and promote national unity, social justice, cohesion and sustainable development in their communities for the benefit of present and future generations," he said. This comes a day after President Uhuru Kenyatta declared a national prayer weekend from Friday to Sunday. The communication from State House spokesperson Kanze Dena said Kenyans are encouraged to pray for the country in their usual places of worship in compliance with Covid-19 containment protocols. On Saturday, the president will convene an inter-faith national prayer service at State House, Nairobi starting at 10 am. "The interfaith prayer service will be broadcast live to the entire country on all leading television, radio, and digital media platforms," Kanze said. This will be the second national prayer in the country since the virus struck the nation on March 13, 2020.
