@robertomollo3 Homa Bay police arrested three suspects on Monday morning for allegedly trafficking 2,145 rolls of bhang hidden in mitumba in a matatu. Police said the bhang, which gave off a distinctive odour, was being transported to Kisumu. The matatu driver and two women were arrested near Kabunde airstrip in Homa Bay town. The women are reported to have boarded the vehicle at Ratang’a trading centre. The vehicle was already carrying passengers from Sori town in Migori county before it reached Ratang’a along Sori-Rodi Kopany road. Speaking to journalists at Homa Bay police station, subcounty DCI officer Monica Berege said the bhang was sealed with second-hand clothes. “The driver is saying the narcotic was loaded without his knowledge. But the smell could make someone realised the luggage was bhang,” Berege said. “We are still interrogating them. The bhang will be used as evidence before it is destroyed upon completion of the legal process,” she added. “Let residents engage in other economic activities that don't expose them to conflict with the law," she said. The suspects were detained at Homa Bay police station pending arraignment. (Edited by V. Graham)
