Singer Kambua has said she found out she was pregnant with her firstborn, Nathaniel, while on holiday with her husband Jackson Mathu. In an interview with The Play House, Kambua said, "I was always sleepy and always bloated." She even thought of complaining to the management of the hotel about their food. "When I came back home the bloating continued and I wondered kwani chakula yangu pia ina shida? I took a test and it came out positive." Kambua said she was excited. "I had a mixture of happiness and fear because I was anxious since being pregnant is one thing and carrying it is another thing," she said. "I then decided to keep away from social media for a while as it was a sacred time for me." Kambua said she wanted to focus on being a pregnant woman and did not want to commercialise the experience. "By the time baby came, I knew I could not be distracted. I appreciate that people around me kept it under wraps," she said. Kambua said motherhood has been tough as sometimes she does not know what she was doing. "He is such a ball of energy. The child is a constant reminder that God is a generous giver." Kambua's son turned one in August. She is expecting her second child. Kambua is also promoting her thanksgiving song called Neema.
