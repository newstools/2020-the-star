Sigona’s John Wangai believes his strong start to the Safari Tour Series Royal Nairobi Golf Club leg is a sign of great moments ahead. Wangai fired 3 over par 69 to take a one shot lead over his Thika Greens’ counterpart Kopan Timbe. Timbe oozed confidence from his first tee shot, returning a score of 2 over par 70. “I have a feeling that the week will be good. The essence will be hit the fairways a lot more. I was striking the ball really well today (yesterday) though I struggled quite a bit off the tees. My putting was on point which is what helped me get some good scores,” said Wangai. Two players Robson Chini and Nsambimana Alloys played 1 under par 71 to finish joint third. Like in Limuru, Greg Snow had another false start with a round of 1 over par 73 which sunk him to joint 10th. The four-day stableford competition resumes today and will end on Thursday. Following the cancellation of the 2020 Magical Kenya Open, organisers are starting a new season with qualifying scores. In the new format, the organisers, Kenya Open Golf Limited (KOGL) confirmed they will take 10 percent of 2018-2019 scores and 20percent of the 2019-2020 and 70 percent of 2020-2021 scores. Those who qualified last season still have some points going into the new season. The Safari Tour has traditionally served as a yardstick to ascertain regional qualifiers for the prestigious European Tour Kenya Open. Besides qualification, pros will use the event to sharpen their skills in time for the big stage next year. The Magical Kenya Open returned to the emblematic European Tour series for the umpteenth time this year but the event was pushed to 2021 due to Covid-19 pandemic restrictions. Vet Lab will host the next round from October 17-21.
