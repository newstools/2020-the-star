Desert locust swarms from Ethiopia and Somalia could cross to Northern Kenya in November, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization has said. FAO's latest update said wind-blown swarm migration from Yemen could again plague Kenya. “As winds from the north become established over the Horn of Africa, there will be an increased threat of swarm migration from Yemen, northeast Ethiopia and northern Somalia south to eastern Ethiopia and central Somalia in October. They could extend to northern Kenya in November,” the FAO locust watch said. FAO said the situation is worrisome and could deteriorate during October because of recent breeding. Ground and aerial controls continue in the Horn of Africa and Yemen. Last month, Agriculture Pprincipal Secretary Hamadi Boga said the country will remain vigilant in case of another locust invasion. He said the government and FAO are cooperating and prepared. Hamisi Williams, FAO deputy country representative, said depite the reduction of swarms in Kenya, the coming short rains may contribute to another invasion. An invasion depends on what happens in Ethiopia, northern  Somalia and in Yemen. He said the swarms that came to Kenya in December 2019 were not born and bred here, but blown by the wind. “Southerly winds come again in late November-December. If there are still swarms out there in Ethiopia and Yemen, we can't rule out the wind bringing them back. "So we are not saying it is going to be there, but we are not saying it is not going to be there. We have to be cautious and always be prepared," Hamisi said. The update showed substantial hatching and hopper band formation has caused numerous immature swarms to form in northeast Ethiopia. “An increasing number of swarms has been reported in northern Somalia, including cross-border movements between northwest Somalia and eastern Ethiopia,” the FAO said.
