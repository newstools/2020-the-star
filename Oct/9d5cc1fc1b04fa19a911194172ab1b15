Kenya Association of Music Producers CEO Clifford Wefwafwa has died after being taken ill on Sunday night. In a statement, Kamp said, “It’s with deep sorrow that we announce the demise of Wefwafwa. He was unwell and in hospital. Let’s keep his family and friends in our prayers.” Wefwafwa joined Kamp in September 2014, having gained wide experience in management and extensively been exposed to business development. He has been instrumental in developing an organisational strategy to align Kamp policies with the best practices in management. This has helped in generating a more informed decision-making culture that subscribes to transparency and good governance practices. He previously held other senior positions in other top organisations within Kenya before joining Kamp.
