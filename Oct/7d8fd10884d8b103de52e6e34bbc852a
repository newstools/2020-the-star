Author Ruth Mueni recently launched her first book, 'A Journey of Faith and Hope', at Deliverance Church, Zimmerman. The book is about her journey to success from a tea girl to a successful banker. In the book, she recounts her experiences, both good and bad, that have built her resilience, defined her character and made her a better person in society. The books are available at Mizizi online store and the retail price is Sh699. "Every progress has a process, no pain, no gain. Don't frustrate the process lest you fail to see the fruits," Ruth said.
