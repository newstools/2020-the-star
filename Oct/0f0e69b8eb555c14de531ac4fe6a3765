Residents from Kisumu's Kondele area on Thursday turned out in large numbers to welcome President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga. Dancing to different tunes of music the crowds lined up at the Kondele roundabout as they awaited the President to address them. "We are happy with what we have been witnessing in Kisumu since handshake and we want to thank the president for that," said Mary Auma one of the locals. The residents drummed up support for the BBI saying they are fully behind the initiative and will support it in its totality. Leaders from the Nyanza region are currently at the Yacht Club in Kisumu in a meeting with Uhuru and Raila. The leaders include the four governors from Nyanza counties, senators, women representatives, MPs, deputy governor, the Kisumu County Assembly Speaker and MCAs. The meeting is a consultative forum giving the President an opportunity to meet with the leaders. The main agenda is still yet to be known however BBI is expected to feature part of the discussions in the meeting. The President is later expected to inspect ongoing development projects financed by the national government in Kisumu. The projects to be inspected include the Sh3 billion refurbished Kisumu port, the Jomo Kenyatta International Stadium in Mamboleo ASK Grounds and the ongoing construction of Uhuru Business Park.
