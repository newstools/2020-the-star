Kenya Scouts Association will gift scouts’ families with donations worth Sh15 million for taking lead in creating awareness on Covid 19 in their communities. The programme dubbed ‘A bag of hope’ is targeting 10,000 families countrywide and will gift each family with a bag containing food, sanitary towels, soaps and face masks. Speaking at Oloishobor Primary School in Kibiku, Kajiado County on Monday, KSA  international commissioner Anthony Gitonga said the movements’ aim is to award scouts who have participated in the KSA Covid-19 response programme. “We want to recognise our own local Mashujaa today who have not been properly recognised in the past and have offered different services to the communities,” said Gitonga. KSA Covid-19 response programme was launched in July, 2020, to empower young people in the movement to pass awareness on Covid-19 to the surrounding communities. Gitonga said the move was informed by the continuous spread of the coronavirus. Some 200 families in Kajiado West received their donation. The exercise is targeting 2,000 families in Kajiado county and the lower region of South Rift. Gitonga urged parents to encourage their children to join the scouts’ movement, which focuses on instilling good morals to the young people, by addressing indiscipline, corruption and terrorism. “We want to instill the necessary values to the young people in the scouting program so that we can empower them,” said Gitonga.
