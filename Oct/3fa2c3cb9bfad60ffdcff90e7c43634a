The government has kicked off plans to expand the Rironi – Nakuru – Mau Summit Highway  into a four-lane dual carriageway. Its construction will be done by a French construction company, and overseen by the Kenya National Highways Authority (Kenha) through a public-private partnership model. While in France on a state visit, President Uhuru Kenyatta witnessed the signing of commercial agreements for the 233km  project between the Ministry of Transport, through the Kenha, and the French VINCI Consortium. Transport CS James Macharia said in a statement that the expansion seeks to reduce the high levels of congestion that have plagued the highway in recent years. "These have been brought about by higher traffic volumes, which have been driven by rapid economic growth not only in Kenya but also in neighbouring countries. Congestion on this road has been further exacerbated by the rapid expansion of many towns along its economic corridor," Macharia said. He further said, "This project, which involves a capital outlay of Sh160 billion, will be implemented under a Public Private Partnership (PPP) financing model where the concessionaire will design, finance, build, operate, and maintain the road for a period of time, and thereafter transfer it back to the Government." According to Macharia, the government intends to further expand the highway into a six-lane dual carriageway at its busy sections. "The Rironi – Nakuru – Mai Mahiu Road forms a vital part of the most important transport corridor in Kenya, the Northern Corridor, which originates in Mombasa and terminates in Malaba," he said.
