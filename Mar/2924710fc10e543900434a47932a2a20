Mathare Member of Parliament Anthony Oluoch wants all the mobile money lending platforms in the country to be investigated. The MP said there are more than 50 money lending platforms which have turned more than 19 million Kenyans to borrowers. "40 per cent who have multiple loans from 6 of 10 mobile lending apps according to the survey by KNBS," he said. He said the majority of Kenyans have been lured to unnecessary borrowing and vicious cycle of expensive loans by raising the limits upon payment of the initial loan. Oluoch added that the mobile lending apps do not disclose their full lending terms, which appears cheap to Kenyans. "Non-disclosure of full lending terms making it easy for Kenyans, especially jobless youth to borrow for betting or to pay previous loans instead of investments," the MP said. He added that "digital borrowing has become a social menace responsible for s suicide, divorce, family breakup and increased listing of loan defaulters". Oluoch said the mobile loan lending platforms are expensive due to their short term loan repayment period, high facilitation fee charged and transaction charges. The legislature said that these mobile platforms are charging exploitative interest rates ranging from 19.1 per cent instead of the recommended rate of 13 per cent by the Central Bank of Kenya. According to the MP, mobile lending platforms have not been recognised as money lenders under regulations and supervision by the CBK. Oluoch said the absence of proper regulations on these platforms has led them to infringe on their clients' rights by exposing their personal contacts to friends. He has petitioned the National Assembly through its Department of Finance and National Planning to probe these platforms from lending unregulated money. He also wants CBK in conjunction with the Communication Authority of Kenya to investigate and audit the operations of the digital money lending platforms.
