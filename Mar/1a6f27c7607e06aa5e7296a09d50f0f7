Health CS Mutahi Kagwe has asked people living in Nairobi to stop travelling to upcountry. "We would like to urge those in Nairobi to stay in Nairobi.. those living in upcountry to avoid travelling to Nairobi..." he said. Addressing the media on Monday, Kagwe said people living upcountry are the elderly and might contract the disease. "Statistics show most elderly people in Kenya live in rural areas. This kind of movement messed up Italy. The elderly are more vulnerable," he said. Kagwe announced that Kenya has recorded eight more coronavirus cases putting the country's total number to 50. The CS said Nairobi now leads with37 confirmed Covid-19 cases followed by Kilifi (6), Mombasa (4), Kajiado, Kwale and Kitui with one each. Tracing of contacts for this 50 is ongoing. Out of the 50 cases, 26 are male and 24 female. During the presser, Kagwe directed boda boda operators to wear face masks and carry only one passenger amid efforts to contain the spread of Covid-19. He said the move is among the new intervention measures being put in place to allow continuity of livelihoods. Kagwe noted that the current trend of spread of the Covid-19 has been established to be through community transmission and not imported. Kagwe said 231 people have been discharged after the 14-day incubation period.
