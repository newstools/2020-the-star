Congolese Rhumba maestro Koffi Olomide has apologised to his Kenyan fans three years after he was barred from performing and deported. Koffi ignited a public uproar in July 2016 after kicking one of his dancers moments after landing in Kenya. The singer was due to perform during his third tour of Kenya. A gig he was due to play at in Zambia was also cancelled over the incident. In an online video, Olomide has owned up to his mistakes, saying he is very sorry for what he did and promising it will never happen again. He went ahead to thank the Kenyan government for allowing him to come back to Kenya after the incident three years back. “Jambo Kenya, this is Grand Mopao, Koffi Olomide, first I apologise, and sincerely I’m sorry for what I did wrong," he said. "Everybody affected by what I did, I apologised. I want to say thank you to the government of Kenya because the government endorsed me to come back to the country. I missed Kenya so much, the country of my life. I miss you Kenya so much. "Soon I will be in the country to meet my fans one by one for selfies, and we will announce the date for the coming back for the King of Africa in Kenya. I sincerely apologise for what I did wrong." He went on to thank his lawyer Prof George, adding, "I will be happy to talk with the media and then we announce the show of coming back. I love you and respect.” This was not the first time Koffi has clashed with the authorities. In 2019, he was barred from performing in South Africa following public outcry. In 2018, he was arrested in Zambia after he allegedly assaulted a photographer. In 2012, he was given a three-month suspended sentence after assaulting his producer.
