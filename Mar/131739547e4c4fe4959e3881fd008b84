A 35-year-old man from Tiaty, Baringo county, was arraigned in Kabarnet for allegedly torturing and killing his late brother’s 13-year-old son. Amoni Kamengo appeared before magistrate Viena Amboko on Tuesday for murdering Amoru Kemel in Kaghow village, Churo Amaya ward on March 18. “The suspect shall be remanded at Kabarnet police station for 14 days to allow police complete their investigation,” Amboko ruled. She ordered the suspect to be escorted to the county referral hospital to have wounds on his right hand dressed. The case shall be mentioned on April 6. After suspension of proceedings owing to the Covid-19 threat, courts are open for capital offences. Kamengo reportedly used heavy sticks to brutally beat up the boy until he became unconscious. He reportedly castrated him, tied the boy on a tree in the hot semi-arid sun for hours to wail and die slowly of hunger and thirst. “We bumped on him doing the animosity in a quiet bush but it was too late. We attempted to rescue the boy but the man turned wild and threatened to kill anyone trying to approach,” a resident said. After the boy died, Kamengo carried his body further into a thick bush and buried him in a hole dug by an anti-bear. Magistrate Amboko ordered police to exhume the body and present it for a postmortem. Police officers  from Tangulbei arrested Kamengo on March 20 and took him to Ng'inyang police station before he was presented in court. Sources told the Star the man inherited his elder brother's four widows including the mother of the boy. He already had two wives. “His late rich brother left behind hundreds of cows, sheep and goats.The slain boy had requested for his share of his father's wealth before the heavily built man lost his temper, pursued and killed him,” a local administrator said. The boy was not in a school as the man had forced him to remain at home to look after livestock. Before police arrested the suspect, angry residents were plotting to lynch him. Edited by Henry Makori
