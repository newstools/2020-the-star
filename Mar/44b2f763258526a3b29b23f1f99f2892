Chief Justice David Maraga has suspended the mentioning of cases for people in remand for 30 days due to coronavirus. Maraga on Tuesday said new dates for the cases to be affected by the orders will be communicated later. The CJ directed all court registries to accept the filing of all pleadings regarding the time-bound cases. National Council on the Administration of Justice had earlier announced that it will scale down operations in courts for two weeks to stop the spread of the virus. The council said prisoners and remandees will not be arraigned for a period of two weeks. On Monday, Maraga had announced that courts will not hear or mention existing criminal and civil cases and appeals for the next two weeks. New arrests will also be dealt with in police stations except for serious crimes. The CJ said all criminal and civil cases stood suspended in the wake of COVID-19. “The Judiciary will forthwith scale down court activities throughout the country over the next two weeks effective tomorrow, March 16, 2020, in order to allow further consultations and design appropriate measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus,” said Maraga. All execution proceedings are also suspended during the period. During the two weeks, Maraga said, prisoners and remandees will not be presented to the court. He ordered magistrate courts to review bail terms for those in remand. Maraga also directed judges in all stations to review deserving cases already identified by prison authorities in the meantime and issue appropriate revision orders in an effort to decongest the prisons. Health CS Mutahi Kagwe on Tuesday confirmed the fourth case of coronavirus in the country.
