Nairobi Basketball Association (NBA) will conduct a two-day Tom Munyama Foundation basketball coaching clinic next week at Strathmore University courts. Fixtures secretary Caleb Osewe said the exercise is meant to help upcoming coaches and prepare them for the season ahead. All the teams have been asked to send two participants and confirm entry two days earlier. He said the function will be handled by Fiba Africa coaches instructor Ronny Owino, national team coach Cliff Owuor and former national women’s coach Evelyne Kedogo. In a related development, Owino who is also the NBA chairman announced that more women’s teams will participate in the provincial league this year. He said new women team have expressed interest to join the show this year and as a result, it will be expanded to accommodate them.  “We will have 16 women’s teams in the league this year. Many have expressed interest in joining and we do not want to let them down,” he said. Owino disclosed this after he was elected for another four-year term as the NBA boss over the weekend.
