Police Officer Zaddock Ochuka who shot Daniel Mburu at Mama Lucy Hospital last month has been charged with murder. Ochuka denied the plea of murder before Justice Stella Mutuku at Milimani Law Courts. The judge directed his lawyer to file a formal application for bail. He will be remanded at Industrial Area. His lawyer has told the Makadara Chief Magistrate that he was had granted a police bond of Sh 1 Million that they have already paid. But Justice Mutuku ruled that the said bond does not apply to the murder case. The case will be heard on September 22,23 and 24 before Justice James Wakiaga. Sarah Wangari whose son was shot said no mother should bury her child adding that it is worse when he is murdered in cold blood. Sarah paused, wiped the tears gushing out of her eyes using a dark handkerchief she held tightly in his hands. "You donâ€™t become a widow, not an orphan, there is no name for that kind of pain. I was Mama Daddy, but now, I am just Sarah Wangari."
