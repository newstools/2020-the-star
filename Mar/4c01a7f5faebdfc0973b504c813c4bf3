Gaspo hope last season’s goal-scoring drought will be a thing of the past after acquiring the services of Harambee Starlets forward Mercy Airo. Airo finished second in the ‘Golden Boot’ race in the last season. Coach Isaac Maluki also hopes rookie Rhoda Nafula will become one of the revelations of the season. “If you look at last season’s table, we were runners up with the least conceded goals but the number of goals we scored were wanting. We corrected that during the transfer season and we are sure that will no longer be a problem,” Maluki said. “We have signed three very experienced forwards thus— Diana Acera, Airo and Liseche. But we are banking on the 19-year-old left-footed Nafula whose future is promising. She is a true talent.” Liseche was signed from Kibera Soccer Queens and is tasked to fill Harambee Starlets’ midfielder Corazone Aquino’s boots. Aquino signed a deal with the Portuguese side, Atletico Ouriense. Acera is back to the club after a three-year stint with Mathare United. Apart from the experienced players, Gaspo have beefed up their squad by signing Doris Onyango, Treezer Manyala and Quinter Okwayo who returns to the club from a six-month loan spell at Spedag. Gaspo, who were set to play Premier league newbies Ulinzi Starlets on March 7, will not grace their weekend match because they have three players in the national team camp. They are goalkeeper Judith Osimbo, Sheryl Angach and Mercy Airo.
