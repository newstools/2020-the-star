The Ministry of Health is still waiting for test results for a patient admitted in an isolation ward at Aga Khan Hospital in Kisumu after developing coronavirus-like symptoms. The caucasian man who had come from the United Kingdom on March 7 was driven to the hospital on Tuesday around 6pm. Governor Anyang' Nyong'o on Wednesday confirmed the patient is under quarantine. “The specimen has been sent to Nairobi and we are waiting for the results." Nyong'o noted that the county government and security personnel have traced the man's family and told them to self-quarantine. Earlier, hospital medical director Patrick Eshiwani had confirmed to the media that the patient was admitted at the facility and was being monitored. He had been isolated as a precautionary measure.
