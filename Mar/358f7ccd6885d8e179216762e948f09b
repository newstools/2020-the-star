Four FKF Women Premier League matches have been lined up for this weekend. The match pitting Makolanders and Mathare United open Zone A games while  Nakuru West Queens' match against Oserian Ladies at the Afraha Stadium at 1 pm will highlight  Zone B  fixtures. Eldoret Falcons, who play Sep Oyugis at Nyahera Pri. School, are banking on their new signings to power them to victory. The team will, however, miss the services of defender Dorcus Shiveka and midfielder Janet Bundi who are with Starlets in Turkey for the Turkish Women's Cup. Falcon's coach Joshua Ariko is positive the rest of the squad will step up. Even though they are not familiar with their opponents, they are keen to get all the three points "Though we will be without  our key players who are with the national team, the team still has the killer instinct in front of goal." Madi Wahira, Jacqueline Inzofu and Jackeline Jepletin are all set for their debut. They have proved in training that they are ready and I urge them to capitalise on the situation and deliver the points. Elsewhere, newbies Nakuru West Queens host Oserian Ladies at Afraha Stadium, Nakuru. Kisumu All Starlets will be at their home turf of Moi Stadium to battle with Trans Nzoia Falcons.
