Over 50 legislators drawn from the National Assembly and Senate now want Deputy President William Ruto to resign for allegedly disrespecting President Uhuru Kenyatta. The legislators further accused the DP of declaring war against established State institutions and constitutional commissions. “The Deputy President has blatantly disobeyed his principal and in this regard, in our view, it constitutes gross misconduct and an act of insubordination,” the legislators said in a statement read by Baringo Women Representative Gladwell Cheruiyot. In his opening remarks, Nominated MP Maina Kamanda pointed out that MPs from various parties signed the statement. "This is not a statement by ODM, ANC, Jubilee, Wiper or Kanu. It is a statement by members of both Houses,” he explained. Cheruiyot, read the first part of the statement while the remainder was done by Kathiani MP Robert Mbui. Also at the press conference at a Nairobi hotel were legislators Ayub Savula, Kanini Kega, Godfrey Osotsi, Fatuma Gedi, James Orengo, James Nyikal, John Mbadi, Millie Odhiambo, Ephraim Maina, Otiende Amollo and Gladys Wanga among others. Mbui said the authority and respect of the government have been subverted by the integrity issues facing the Deputy President. “William Ruto must shape up or ship out. He needs time and undivided attention to pursue the only thing and ambition that makes sense and has meaning in his life-dream and campaign for the 2022 presidential election,” he said.
