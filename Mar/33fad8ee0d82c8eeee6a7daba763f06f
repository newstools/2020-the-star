Zuri Awards recently held an event at Villa Rosa Kempiski to recognise and support unsung women heroes in our communities. It feted women dedicated to creating positive change through work in their communities, inspiring other women through exceptional displays of leadership or rising against all odds and being courageous in the face of adversity. The key focus of Zuri is the Sustainable Development Goal 5, which focuses on gender equality. Among those in attendance were Public Service CAS Rachel ShebeshÂ and Nyeri Deputy Governor Caroline Karugu.
