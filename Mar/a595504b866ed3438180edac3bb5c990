Meru-Nanyuki motorists have praised the Kenya National Highways Authority for erecting speed bumps or rumble strips on the busy highway near Gitoro Pastoral Conference Centre. They say the rumble strips built weeks ago have slowed down speeding motorists. Residents were alarmed about speeding. They said Kenha's move was long overdue since those crossing the road always found it difficult because of speeding vehicles. “Although we have two bumps - one at Gitoro Primary School and another close to Makutano Shopping Centre - some motorists accelerate in between causing a lot of fear among other road users,” John Mwirigi said. He said the place needed another bump to make motorists slow down since the area is near many learning institutions such as the Meru National Polytechnic, Gitoro Primary School and Meru Saleem Academy, among others. There is also a diversion to Kinoru Stadium and Kinoru Primary and Secondary schools. The bumps will give those wanting to access the facilities ample time to cross, Mwirigi said. “It will now be safer for our children when they reopen schools unlike before when parents had to accompany them to help them cross the road safely,” he said. Motorists are appealing to the authority to mount a road sign to indicate the bumps ahead so those visiting the region for the first time can take notice in good time. The section falls within the highway that is earmarked for the construction of a dual carriageway to help ease traffic jams in Meru town. edited by peter obuya
