Employees and contractors in the tourism industry should use the courts to solve disputes with employers, Kwale Tourism county executive Nasib Nyahi has said. Nyahi warned the workers against taking matters into their hands because it is against the law. “Regardless of who the offender is, proper channels must be used to solve disputes because creating unrest is unconstitutional," he said. Nyahi's remarks come two days after Mash Cleaners unloaded a lorry full of waste in front of Leopard Beach Resort and SPA in protest over unsettled bills. The tourism chief said workers should initiate peace talks before moving to the next step. He spoke to the Star on Sunday at Mvindeni. The official said disgruntled workers should consult his office rather than condemn the government unfairly. "We offer services daily. Why don't you take advantage of it so that we assist each other in addressing the menace instead of people lamenting on the streets," Nyahi said . He said it is wise to have both parties on the table while trying to find a suitable agreement. Nyahi confirmed that efforts to hold meetings with some of the hotel managers are ongoing. He said the county government will do what it takes to protect the rights of both investors and the workforce. (edited by O. Owino)
