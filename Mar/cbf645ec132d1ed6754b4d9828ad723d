The Council of Governors on Saturday condemned the excessive force used by police during the implementation of the nationwide curfew. CoG chairman Wycliffe Oparanya said governors support of President Uhuru Kenyatta's 7pm to 5am curfew to limit the spread of the coronavirus. “What we witnessed yesterday at the start of the curfew at the Likoni Ferry in Mombasa county was despicable,” Oparanya said. He is also the governor of Kakamega. He said police were in total disregard of the social distancing rules by hoarding people together. “The police in total disregard of the social distancing rules crowding people together like animals, exposing these Kenyans to possible infection and spread of the coronavirus," Oparanya said. He has called upon the Police Inspector General Hillary Mutayambai to train the police on implementing the curfew humanely and ensuring they do not violate basic human rights. “The police abused and violated members of the public and the media by hitting, kicking and tear-gassing them. Some women were even lying on the ground vomiting,” Oparanya added. The chairman asked the Ministry of Health to work with other ministries to ensure workers are released by 4pm in order to return homes before curfew hours. The governor also urged Kenyans to observe the curfew. The curfew went into effect countywide on Friday at 7pm, ending Saturday at 5am. Many leaders have condemned the police for using excessive force. The Law Society of Kenya has urged Interior CS Fred Matiang'i  to resign over the due of excessive force and widespread brutality. It said the  National Police Service has no right to use corporal punishment in implementing the curfew. (Edited  by V. Graham)
