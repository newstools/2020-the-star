Church leaders have accused politicians of hijacking the Building Bridges Initiative meetings. The clerics under the National Council of Churches of Kenya, the Evangelical Alliance of Kenya and the National Congress of the Pentecostal Churches said they wanted their views heard. They said politicians have campaigned for the BBI with a lot of energy and used a lot of resources towards it, without giving the church a chance to give their views. Pastor Charles Chege, who represented NCCK secretary general Chris Kinyanjui at the meeting, said church leaders were shocked by how the BBI issues were being handled. "Our politicians have done a lot of work. They have held rallies but have failed to recognise the role of the church in constitution making," Chege said. "We have views and opinions, and we also listen to our members' proposals and ideas. Where will all these be captured?" Kiambu assembly speaker Stephen Ndichu said they invited constitutional lawyer Tom Michuki to enlighten pastors on what BBI articles entailed. They spoke at Jumuia Conference and Country Home on Monday when the NCCK, EAK and NCPC invited all their pastors to attend lessons on the BBI. Also present was Kiambu Governor James Nyoro. The county chief said Kenyans should be allowed to give their views on the laws they would want. But Limuru MP Peter Mwathi denied that politicians had hijacked the BBI meetings and sidelined the church. The Limuru lawmaker said politicians are quick to give reactions towards an issue of national importance, and that is why they are seen in BBI matters. "The church has shown us the way and we urge the government to reach out to university students, youths, women and enlighten them about the BBI," the MP said. Mwathi praised the clerics for coming up with the forum, saying many pastors who did not have an idea what the document entails now have some information. He spoke at Limuru Model Primary School.
