Tanasha Donna says it has not been easy after breaking up with Diamond Platnumz. In an interactive Insta-Live session, Tanasha said she will be sharing her story soon, highlighting what transpired before she decided to walk away. Her long-awaited answer came after she had tried to avoid answering the question of whether she and Chibu were still together. “I know a lot of your guys wanna know about what went down in my relationship and my personal life," she said. "This is not something I’m ready to come out with in public just as yet. It's something very personal and everybody has their own timing of coming out with their own stories. "When I’m ready I will talk about it. And in the next few weeks, I will tell a bit of my story in a magazine that I’m on the cover of because I see everybody wants to know what happened.”
