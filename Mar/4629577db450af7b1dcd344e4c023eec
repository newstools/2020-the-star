Huawei Kenya launched their new entrant into the Kenyan market, the Y6s, which was first announced in January this year. The device is an upgrade to last year’s Y6 Prime which featured the fake leather back cover. The back this time is made of plastic and is split into two with the upper part featuring a glossy finish while the lower part has a matte finish. The device carries a number of features from its predecessor. Features such as the single 13MP rear camera and 8MP front camera have been retained. The 6.09″ inch screen, the 3020mAh battery and Android 9 Pie have also been retained. This time round, you get a more powerful processor, more RAM, from 2GB of RAM to 3GB of RAM and from 32GB of on-board storage to 64GB of on-board storage together with an updated design. The back has a newly designed camera style from what we saw on the Y6 2019. There’s a large, round bezel that houses the camera lens and also a separate LED flash. The fingerprint sensor is also at the back. Remember the predecessor did not come with a fingerprint sensor so this is quite impressive. The phone is available in two colors, Orchid Blue and Starry Black and will be available in retail stores shelves on March 4th. Consumers who make the pre-orders will get a gift hamper worth Sh 1000. The device will be selling at sh.14,000
