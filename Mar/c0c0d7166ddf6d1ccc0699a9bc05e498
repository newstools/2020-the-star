President Uhuru Kenyatta has warned Somalia to desist from provoking Kenya. This comes a day after Mandera residents were forced to flee after fierce clashes erupted between Somalia troops and Jubaland forces in Bulla Hawa. Heavy gunfire and explosions coupled with black smoke could be seen emanating in Bulla Hawa in Somalia which borders Mandera town.   "...cease and desist from the unwarranted provocations and focus on managing your internal affairs." Uhuru said Somalia should manage the affairs for the welfare of its people by defeating terrorism and advancing the cause of peace, security and stability in the region. "The baseless accusations and invalid allegations made by Somalia that Kenya is interfering with Somalia’s internal affairs are part of a growing and persistent pattern of ill intent to use Kenya as a scapegoat," he said. "....and a tool to justify challenges in Somalia for political reasons. Kenya will not accept to be used in that manner." Uhuru asked Somalia to stop the smear campaign and commit the energy to deliver leadership and prosperity to its people. "Kenya has paid a heavy price and continues to make notable investments to peace and security in Somalia.  Kenya therefore joins calls by the United Nations and other regional and international partners urging Somalia to urgently and exhaustively seek broad political consensus," he said.
