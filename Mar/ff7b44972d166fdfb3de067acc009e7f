A man collapsed and died after coughing for some time in a Makueni bus on Sunday. According to a police report, the driver Charles Mburu reported that upon arriving at Taleh Hotel along Mombasa road, one passenger Fredrick Mwakima 30, began coughing. "He collapsed and passed on. Public officers in Kibwezi are making arrangements to remove the body and fumigate the bus," the report noted. It is not clear what killed him but coughing has been listed as a symptom of viral infections including coronavirus. Kenya has already confirmed 15 coronavirus cases, with the government putting strict measures to curb its spread. A post-mortem will be done on the man to ascertain the death.
