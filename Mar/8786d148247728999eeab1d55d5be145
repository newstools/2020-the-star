The government has said the woman who committed suicide at the Kenya Industrial Training Centre in Nakuru was not related to Covid-19. Health CS Mutahi Kagwe on Friday said the South African woman died under circumstances not related to the disease. "This is a police case and a matter under investigation. We have so far informed authorities in South Africa through our foreign affairs ministry," he said. On Friday, it was reported that the woman who was under quarantine at Kenya Industrial Training Institute (KITI) had died. Nakuru County Executive for Heath Dr Kariuki Gichuhi said the woman was found in her room on Friday morning with initial police investigations pointing to suicide. Gichuhi said the name of the woman has been withheld until her next of kin are informed. "The lady jetted into the country on March 25 from a country with confirmed cases of Covid-19," Gichuhi said. The lady was taken to KITI centre following the national government's directive that all inbound passengers to Kenya undergo mandatory 14-day quarantine to avert the spread of the disease. "We regret to announce that one of the persons who was under quarantine at the KITI quarantine centre has passed away," Gichuhi said in a statement.
