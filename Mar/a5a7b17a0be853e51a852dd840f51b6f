Hosts Mombasa Sports Club-A are back top after thrashing Memon Sports Club by 113 runs in the NCBA Bank Cup T20. This was MSC’s seventh win in eight matches and they are now tied on points with Pakistan Cricket Club who occupied the top spot for hours after maintaining their 100 per cent record with a win over Mombasa Sports Club ‘B’ side at Coast Gymkhana on Sunday. Batting first, MSC posted a challenging total of 199 for six, courtesy  of a fantastic 93 by Shukan Mehta and useful contributions from Puru Sharma (42), Thabith Mohammed (18) and Zahirabbas Khaku (17). The MSC bowlers then took wickets at regular intervals to restrict visitors to only 86 for six despite Essak Kasmani’s rear-guard effort of unbeaten 38. Sharma (2 for 10) and Sahil Chirag (2 for 9) swung the match in MSC’s favour from the onset. Sharma removed opener Yusuf Musani (1) before he added on Bashir Kadernani (6) to leave Memon 21 for 2. With the board at 42 for 4, Chirag dismissed Abdulrahim Dadani before adding on Abdulrahim Harunani with only six having been added. At 48 for six, the comeback was virtually impossible and even Kasmani’s 28 couldn’t make much headway as the target became a tall order. “I think it was a reasonably good inning. Getting a start was foremost and having done that, I should have gotten to 100 but that’s the nature of cricket. The team is in a very good position and I am happy about that. We are all looking at ending on a good show and improving with each game,” said Mehta. In other matches, Cutchi Leva beat Jefferys Sports Club by seven wickets.
