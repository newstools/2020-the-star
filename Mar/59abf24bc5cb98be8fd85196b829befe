More than 70 doctors in Nandi on Tuesday said they would go on strike from March 18 after a failed meeting with the county government. Kenya Medical Practitioner’s Union officials announced in Kapsabet town that a strike notice they had issued to the county government on January 20 had expired. Patients seeking services from physicians and specialists should seek treatment elsewhere, they said. KMPDU advisory committee official Dr David Atela said he Nandi government had indicated willingness to implement a CBA they had registered in court. There was confusion when KMPDU officials visited the county offices for a scheduled meeting in the boardroom with the government, only to find there was no one to meet them. They claimed senior county officials had been instructed not to meet and discuss the CBA The strike will paralyse health services in many facilities. Kapsabet County Referral will be hurt by the strike as most specialists are based there. Addressing doctors at the Kapsabet hospital on Tuesday, Atela said the county had deliberately ignored the CBA. “None of the agreed points has ever been implemented, no doctor has ever been promoted and even specialists continue to earn the lowest salary scale of a medical officer." He asked all doctors not to report to from March 18until the county fully implement the CBA. Delays in their monthly salaries for the last two years, lack of comprehensive health insurance and payment of indemnity as stipulated in the CBA were some of the issues for the strike. Stagnation in a single job group was demoralising, doctors said. “Doctors have patiently been waiting for the implementation of their promotions, working under serious economic challenges for a long time,” Dr Atela added.
