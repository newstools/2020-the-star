The government will soon float a tender for construction of the Muhoroni-Mamboleo road. The road links Kisumu, Nandi and neighbouring counties. Muhoroni MP Onyango Koyoo said on Sunday the tender will ensure the road is constructed with feeder roads in Miwani, Ahero-Miwani, Ahero-Ombaka. The road will boost the economy of the region, the lawmaker said. He spoke during the disbursement of Sh12.5 million bursaries to university and college students in Chemelil. Some 1,411 students benefited. Leaders and residents have been demanding that the road, which is in a sorry state, be repaired. The 36km C674 road was built in 1997 under President Daniel Moi’s regime. The road is dotted with potholes, despite the government saying it had allocated money for its reconstruction. Motorists have been complaining of huge losses incurred while repairing their damaged vehicles. Kajulu MCA Roy Samo said the road needs to be urgently tarmacked as it affects businesses, schools and services at public health facilities in the region. In 2018, President Uhuru Kenyatta during a tour of Kisumu and Siaya counties announced the tender for construction of the road had been awarded. Samo questioned where the money allegedly allocated for the construction by the national government went. “We feel seriously disillusioned by the national and county governments. The tear and wear on this road is so massive that we can’t take it anymore,” he said. He told the government to explain why the road, which is crucial for the region’s economic growth, had been abandoned. “Its dilapidated state has killed businesses between Luo and Nandi communities that used to thrive many years ago,” Samo said. The MCA also said the Guba bridge is about to collapse, putting the lives of residents and motorists at risk. “Residents have been forced to repair a section of the bridge to enable them cross.” Edited by A.
