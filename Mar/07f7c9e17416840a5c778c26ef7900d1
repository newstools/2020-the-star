Kakamega Homeboyz have opposed any move by the Football Kenya Federation to end the league pre-maturely if the current state of coronavirus in the country persists. FKF CEO Barry Otieno was recently quoted as saying the league could end pre-maturely with winners being determined by the current table standing. Otieno is on record saying if the scourge will not be managed in time, they will have no alternative but make a declaration for champions in line with Caf timelines for submission of the league champions. Team manager Boniface Imbenzi termed the move not only unwise but also unfair. He said everyone is aware of the coronavirus and understands that it is a global pandemic which is a concern for every stakeholder right from Fifa down to grassroots administrative units. “It’s regrettable this is happening when teams were highly motivated during this home stretch with everyone fighting to finish the league in a better position. At this point, you will agree with me that the league is not only competitive but more attractive,” he added. “We pray that a solution be found immediately and things return to normalcy soonest. As a club, we have treated all the directives from the government with the seriousness they deserve including closing the camp and releasing all the players,” said Imbenzi. He added: “The scourge struck while we were enjoying great form and I am worried this could interrupt our rhythm.” “On the other hand, it has given us an opportunity to properly analyse our performance. It is also an opportunity for the injured players to recover and return to action when fresh and ready,” Imbenzi said. The team manager revealed that about five key players have been undergoing treatment after picking injuries and they are making good progress. Kakamega Homeboyz are currently placed second on the log with 47 points—seven points adrift defending champions Gor Mahia who have played one match more.
