The Kisii County secondary school Term One Games get underway today at Cardinal Otunga High School Mosocho with Nduru Boys declaring themselves favourites to lift the 15's rugby title. Nduru head coach and principal J.J Masime yesterday said: “We are favourites in 15's. There is no doubt about that. However, we expect stiff competition from Kisii School and hosts Cardinal Otunga.” He added: “We want to give it the best shot. I have told the boys not to be afraid of the big names. They must believe in themselves if they want to win the title.” Last year, Nduru's 7's team reached the semis during the Nyanza region championships and yesterday, Masime challenged his charges to emulate last year's team. Nduru start their campaign against Rioma Secondary in a match Masime expects opposition. He, however, said tomorrow's game against Kisii School will not be easy because it will determine who tops the pool. In other matches today, hosts Cardinal Otunga face Maiga with Nyamagwa Boys playing Itierio Boys. Kisii School will start their campaign against Nyamagwa Boys with Itierio tackling Maiga. In the day's last game, Kisii School hopes to seal a semi-final place when they play Rioma. In Sevens, champions Kisii School, St Joseph's Nyabigena and Cardinal Otunga are favourites. Kisii School opens their title defence against Nyabisase while Cardinal Otunga will play debutants Igonga. The highlight of the day will be a game between hosts Cardinal Otunga and Nyabigena. In other games, Rianyanchabera will play Nyasore as Sameta High face Moi Gesusu. Nyabisase will collide with Ndonyo from Etago in another encounter.
