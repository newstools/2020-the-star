The NMS team has been tasked with streamlining urban renewal housing projects in Pangani and Jevanjee whose contracts were awarded in 2018 but are yet to kick off. The new team was also tasked with actualizing the Nairobi City Railway Master Plan that seeks to create and redevelop 425 acres around the Nairobi Central Railway Station with the aim of creating a world-class multi-model in the Central Business District. The Badi-lead team was also charged with ensuring that garbage was collected effectively and efficiently to restore Nairobi's Green City Under the Sun status. NMS was also directed to crack down on illegal dumpsites and ensure that industries and restaurants did not discharge effluent into rivers. In 100 days, the team is expected to gazette the legal solid waste dumpsites for both public and private solid waste collectors. In the same timeline, the NMS will be expected to come up with strategies of equitable water distribution under the rationing programme.
