A Shanzu court has ordered a case against two sons of a Mombasa politician accused of stealing Sh50 million to proceed in May. Senior principal magistrate David Odhiambo directed that the criminal case against Sheikh Ali Yassir and Abdalla Salim, sons of politician Mohammed Bajaber, be heard on May 6. The magistrate directed the prosecution to serve the defense team with all documents they intend to use as evidence during trial. The duo was jointly charged alongside Joseph Munyao with stealing from Mombasa Cement Company. According to police reports, the accused persons diverted funds meant to help needy children. They were charged that on December 19, 2019 in Nyali subcounty being agents of Mombasa Cement Company stoleÂ  $500,000 which had been entrusted to them to deliver to Mohamed Amur. They were further accused of trafficking 234 grams of cannabis with a market value of Sh46,000 found on them in Kileleshwa, Nairobi, during their arrest. The suspects pleaded not guilty and are out on Sh10 million bond while Munyao was released on Sh7 million bond. The magistrate's directions came after the defense accused the prosecution of intentionally delaying the matter. Defense lawyer Adala Boaz told the court the state had no evidence against the accused and had been taking them around. "The prosecution keeps saying they have more evidence to give to us and so far we have not received any. We seek that we use the evidence at hand and lock out anything else that is not in the inventory," he said. But state counsel Erick Masila told the court they had already served the defense with the statements and were ready to proceed to hearing.
