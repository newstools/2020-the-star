More than 100,000 small-scale tea farmers have been trained in good farming practices to improve soil fertility and crop yield. Kanja Thuku, Kenya Tea Development Agency, Head Field Services and Logistics said the farmers have been trained through the Farmer Field Schools (FFS) setups in different tea growing areas nationwide. He said KTDA has 4,300 Farmer Field Schools where 107,000 smallholder tea farmers have undergone training. Thuku spoke on Saturday during the graduation of 86 tea farmers under the FFS programme at Chinga Tea Factory in Othaya, Nyeri county. He said tea farmers are trained in groups over a period of 12 months. “The training is organised around the farmers’ schedules with a view of ensuring their normal farm activities are not interfered with,” Thuku said. The programme also covers other diverse areas of training such as health and sanitation, kitchen gardens to improve nutrition and food security. Farmers are also encouraged to cultivate other crops that supplement their incomes. The programme was started in 2006 to help smallholder tea farmers improve farming methods and yields. Thuku explained that the curriculum includes modules on integrated soil management, harvest- and post-harvest management, eco-system conservation, composting techniques, replanting and rejuvenation and agronomic management that is important for improvement of yield. Due to the training,he said, farmers have recorded better yields which has occasioned the high amounts of green leaf delivered as witnessed in January 2020. “I commend KTDA for the FFS initiative that aims to impart small-scale tea farmers with the knowledge to improve their farming practices, the programme has significantly contributed to improving farmers’ expertise in producing quality and quantity green leaf,” Othaya MP Gichuki Mugambi said. “I have been encouraged to see that through the programme, farmers are also learning to diversify to other income generating activities.”
