The court will no longer compel Embakasi East MP Babu Owino to settle DJ Evolve’s hospital bill, though he has been charged with attempted murder. Justice Luka Kimaru on Tuesday directed that Babu can only help settle DJ Evolve's hospital bill as a moral obligation, contrary to the lower court's order. The MP has denied attempting to murder the DJ. "The accused person should continue paying the hospital bill as a moral duty to him, not as a court order ... if he fails to pay it is up to him and his God," Justice Kimaru said. The court reduced Babu's bail from Sh10 million to Sh5 million with an alternative of Sh10 million bond. Kimaru considered that there were no compelling reasons to deny the legislator bail or bond. “The court agrees with the applicant that the prosecution did not provide evidence to report its assertion that there were compelling reasons not to release the applicant." The court heard that the MP has so far deposited Sh4.4 million as bail. He is required to pay Sh600,000 to secure his freedom. Babu had sought a review of the bail terms issued by chief magistrate Francis Andayi, arguing it was too high. The prosecution, however, sought to have his bail cancelled saying the lower court had erred in its decision to have him released from custody. The legislator has been charged with the attempted murder of Felix Odhiambo, commonly known as DJ Evolve. The MP also wanted the court to stop the DPP from commenting on his case, an order the court declined to issue. Andayi had directed Babu to deposit Sh2.5 million to be freed and pay the remaining cash in instalments. In the application filed at the Milimani law courts, Babu said he would struggle to meet the remaining instalments as directed. “I have partially complied with the terms as set out and thus I am out on bail but I know that I will have to struggle to meet the remaining instalments as directed and thus would also appreciate an alternative of a bond,” Babu said.
