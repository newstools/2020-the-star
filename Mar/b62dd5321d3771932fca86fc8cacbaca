A patient who had been suspected to be infected by the coronavirus has died. The unidentified patient died in an isolation ward at the MP Shah hospital. Government spokesman Cyrus Oguna said the patient whose details are yet to be known had been suspected to be infected with the virus but upon testing the patient tested negative. According to Oguna, the country is yet to record any positive case despite the scare. The said patient died on Saturday night. "Last evening, one suspected case (now deceased), was investigated at MP Shah hospital but turned negative on testing for COVID-19," Oguna said. Oguna said the government is also investigating how the patient's details were leaked to the public. "The Ministry of Health will continue to respond to any alerts as they are reported through the various establish channels and through designated officers, who at the moment are myself, the Cabinet Secretary for Health or their appointed agents," he said. Health CS Mutahi Kagwe had earlier announced that meetings, conferences and events of international nature had been banned to reduce the risk of coronavirus infections. The CS said the ban will last for 30 days. Mbagathi Hospital Infectious Diseases Unit is ready for any coronavirus case and the government has involved the county governments to watch out.
