 Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho on Monday ordered the closure of salons and barbershops in an escalation of strict measures to curb the spread of coronavirus. Joho had already ordered the closure of the Kongowea market, bars and night clubs in the coastal county. The governor called for a total lockdown of the region to curb the spread of the coronavirus, which has already been reported in neighbouring Kwale and Kilifi counties. Several people from Kilifi county, who are suspected to have contracted the disease, are admitted in different facilities within Mombasa. On Monday, the Mombasa County Emergency Response Committee on Covid-19, which is co-chaired by Joho and county commissioner Gilbert Kitiyo, resolved to have all salons and barbershops closed with immediate effect. “We are closing down all salons and barbershops with immediate effect and people should abide by national and county government directives,” Joho said. He directed all private hospitals to set up isolation wards for Covid-19 patients saying the county was anticipating a spike in the number of suspected cases. Joho’s administration, which has been grappling with how to deal with the huge masses at the Likoni crossing channel after the outbreak of Covid-19, said ferry users will be required to cover their mouths and noses while aboard the ferry. Commuters are currently being forced to wash their hands before boarding the ferries. “The following measures have to be observed by ferry users; hand washing and use of handkerchief or a piece of cloth for covering mouth and nose,” Joho said. He continued, “Anyone with flu-like signs and symptoms should not board the ferry. They should seek health services from the nearest hospitals.” The county government has further directed all matatus, tuk tuks, boda bodas and hawkers to be moved away from the parking stations around the ferry to create space for crowd management.  edited by peter obuya
