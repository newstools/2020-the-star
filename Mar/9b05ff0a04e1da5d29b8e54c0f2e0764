Two-time East Africa Junior champion Agnes Jebet successfully defended her Maria Soti cross country title and immediately declared she is ready for the Africa Cross set for Lome, Togo next month. “I have promised the country and myself that I will bring gold from Togo. I came here as part of my training — speed work and endurance — before hitting residential camp (in Kigari) in two weeks,” said Jebet. The Form Three student at Kimwogo Secondary School defended the title after timing 20:40.3 ahead of Mercy Cherop (21:04.2), who is also in the national junior team and Jackline Cherop (21:13.6). Naomi  Kemboi, who finished fourth in 21:19.4 is in the under 18 team just like Sheilah Chebiwott (21:24.3) while Marion Cheruiyot, who will also compete in 5km under 18 race, was sixth in 21:26.5. Meanwhile, national junior cross country champion Samuel Chebolei left hushed voices among those present after scaling to give the big boys a run for their money and nearly caused an upset as he finished second in 24:03.7, behind Nicholas Kimeli (23:57.4) while Charles Kakuri (24:10.8), Wesley Kimutai (24:16.3), Edwin Kimutai (24:21.6) and Mathew Kimeli (24:28.7) closed the top six rankings. “It was not easy but I did my best. I want to run well locally as I head to Togo,” said Chebolei, who competed for Nyanza during the national trials despite coming from Elgeyo Marakwet County. Running her first race in 2020, former world cross country champion Irene Cheptai won the women’s title. “My focus is to cut into the Kenyan team for the 2020 Olympic Games. This was my first race this year and I want to run my best for the rest of the season,” said Cheptai. She won the 8km senior women's title in 27:26.2 ahead of reigning Boston Half Marathon winner Brilliant Jepkorir (27:34.7) and Monica Chirchir completing the podium positions in 27:45.04.
