President Yoweri Museveni has suspended all public transport for 14 days in the wake of Covid-19. This is according to the Daily Monitor website. Private vehicles will continue to operate, but ferry only three passengers at a time. Uganda had earlier on Wednesday confirmed five new coronavirus cases - including an eight-month-old baby whose father recently travelled back from Kisumu, Kenya. This brings the number of cases to 14. "The child is in hospital here in Iganga.., she is under isolation. But then she has to be cared for," the ministry said. "...the father of the child had travelled to a neighboring country. We want this information gathered to get a comprehensive situation." The Ministry of Health said a 57-year-old Ugandan male and a businessman in Adjumani who tested positive for COVID-19 had not travelled anywhere outside the country. Another person who tested positive was a 63-year-old who travelled from Germany and two Chinese nationals. During a press statement on Wednesday, the Health ministry said they have listed 574 travelers from Dubai, UAE (within the past 14 days) .
