Neighbouring Kipsigis, Abagusii, Maasai and Luo communities have resolved to work together to end animosities that result in frequent fights. The resolutions were arrived at during a peace meeting in Sotik, Bomet county. It brought together security officers, clergymen, national government administrators and deputy county commissioners from four neighbouring subcounties. They agreed that leaders suspected to have incited their people against other communities will be individually held liable for their actions. Issues that prompted the meeting included insecurity and cross-border cattle theft. "We have noted with concern some leaders from these communities disregard the need for peace by using statements that ignite tensions. Security officers must deal with them harshly," they said in their declarations. They said insecurity has reduced in the recent past because of regular peace and sensitisation meetings among the youth. "We need to address idleness among the youth, who are vulnerable, hence being misused by politicians to cause unnecessary conflicts and mayhem in their regions," said Jonathan Bii, the Tenwek community programme director. Addressing the press after the meeting, Borabu deputy county commissioner Michael Lesimam called for more public barazas to counter the propaganda that causes intercommunity flareups. "There are emerging issues in society that are raising the possibility of conflicts among various ethnic groups. We need to come up with ways of dealing with them as we understand their effects on our peaceful coexistence, hence our decision to plan for these stakeholder forums," he said. On the ongoing building bridges initiative (BBI) discussion, the group said it should "address to the letter the objects it was created for".
