A nun and her 10 family members have been quarantined for 14 days in their house in Kiugwani village, Makueni county. The nun arrived in the country from Spain, where she is a student, on March 18. She was in the company of another nun based in Machakos. On arrival at the airport, the nun was received by her father, mother and two sisters. She went home and stayed in the same house with 10 family members. A team of police officers and medics went to the village after receiving a report from the area chief that the nun had been staying with the family members. Police said they would keep an eye on the family in case of any movements. The nun arrived a few days after a directive by Health CS Mutahi Kagwe that anyone arriving from overseas should self-isolate for two weeks. Kagwe said the government had already traced 626 people who came into contact with those who tested positive for coronavirus. Edited by A. Ndung'u
