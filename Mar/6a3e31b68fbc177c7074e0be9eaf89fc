Kenyan athletes who wish to attend international events will have to wait for the next one month. This was after Athletics Kenya suspended their clearance amidÂ coronavirus outbreak. So far the disease has killed over 4000 people and infected thousands globally. The AK announced on Thursday that it took the decision following the government's directive as a way of preventing citizens from the virus. AK said the move is meant to safeguard the athletes and consequently the country from the virus. They asked athletes to cancel their travel arrangements for the next one month pending further communication. The government banned all the international gatherings in the country. The announcement comes as countries worldwide continue putting more measures to curb the virus from spreading further. Some of the major tournaments in European nations have been cancelled while some have been played behind closed doors because of coronavirus fears. On Wednesday night, Paris Saint-Germain hosted Borussia Dortmund during the last 16 Champions League which was played behind closed doors.
