The family of a farmer in Uasin Gishu County who was allegedly struck and killed by a speeding vehicle driven by a police officer wants DCI to investigate. Emily Kipruto, the widow of Samuel Kipruto, 42, said they reported the matter at the Soy ad Moi's Bridge police stations but the officers' colleagues frustrated them. the accident occurred last Sunday. Witnesses said the driver was trying to overtake another vehicle but he would have collided with an oncoming vehicle, so he swerved off the road and struck the man on the footpath. The witnesses, who declined to be named, said the victim was walking from Matunda trading centre and heading home next to Moi Barracks along the Eldoret-Kitale highway at 8pm when the accident occurred. He died at once, they said. “We have tried to seek for justice at Soy and Moi’s Bridge police stations over the death of our kin through a road accident by an overspeeding vehicle driven by a police officer but our efforts have not born fruit," widow Kipruto said. "His colleagues have been placing roadblocks on our way in their efforts to cover up the matter,” she said. She said her husband was bringing food for supper when her sister-in-law rushed to inform them about the accident. “I rushed to the scene only to find a crowd milling around my husband's body as we waited for Soy police to arrive," Kipruto said. “The police ordered us to load the body into a Landcruiser to be transported to Moi Teaching and referral mortuary,” Victor Korir said. Uasin Gishu deputy police commander Zacheaus Ngeno said they have opened inquiry file "to establish the circumstances under which he met his death on that fateful night." (Editd by V. Graham)
