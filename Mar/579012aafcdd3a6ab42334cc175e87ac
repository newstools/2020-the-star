Maweni residents in Waa location in Kwale county Friday protested against an infestation of deadly snakes. The residents said several people have died from frequent attacks by the reptiles. In the latest case, a 27-year-old man died last month after a cobra bit him. He succumbed to the snakebite on the way to the hospital. It was the third case reported recently. The villagers said they are living in fear as the poisonous snakes are out of control. Halfan Mwalimu said they are no longer safe because snakes are preying on them. "We feel insecure because the venomous snakes are hunting us," he said. Mwalimu said children are more vulnerable to attacks as they pass through snakes-infested paths. Mwanahalima Shee whose husband was killed by a cobra said black mambas, green mambas and pythons are most common. She said the dangerous vipers originate from Maweni forest next to Coast Calcium Company. The residents have asked the Kenya Wildlife Service to find ways of containing the snakes. “We are incapable of fighting snakes. KWS kindly intervene,” Shee said. The residents also demanded compensation for the victims of snakebites. Suleiman Mwamgute said hospitals with antivenins are very far off from them. Mwamgute said they have to walk long distances to get help. He asked the county government to bring the services closer. (edited by O. Owino)
