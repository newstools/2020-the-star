Turkana Donkey owners support the closure of Kenya's four Konkey abattoirs, saying economically vital beasts of burden must be saved. Led by their association chairman Joseph Lomodei, they thanked the government for considering their pleas to close abattoirs. They said many donkeys have been stolen and slaughtered, their meat and hides exported to China for traditional medicine and cosmetics. Agriculture and Livestock CS Peter Munya on February 24 banned the slaughter of donkeys in the country, following numerous complaints and protests from associations of donkey owners. Donkeys are vital to the economy as beasts of burden but they have been disappearing at an alarming rate. Munya immediately revoked the license of Silzah abattoir in Turkana county and others. They were given a month’s notice to convert their slaughterhouses to handle cattle, sheep, goats and chicken. Lomodei said donkey slaughter business had led to rampant thefts since 2016. “The stolen donkeys are never recovered and owners who attempt to visit the Silzah abattoir in Lodwar are denied access,” Longodei said. Julius Nangole, a community representative from Napetet village in Lodwar, said the government should ensure that those who had sold donkeys to the Silzah abattoir are paid before the slaughterhouse closes. Nangole said they had taken two petitions to the county assembly and another to the national government. The county is yet to conclude the discussions of the petition. He alleged that the Silzah abattoir is still operating despite the government order revoking licenses for donkey slaughterhouses, but given them 30 days to convert to conventional livestock and poultry abattoirs (Editedby V.
