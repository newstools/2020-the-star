Health CS Mutahi Kagwe has said no one will receive favours and be released from mandatory quarantine because of their status in society. The CS said, "If that was the case, I would start with my sister's daughter... I have friends with children in mandatory quarantine." Kagwe on Sunday said Kenya has a chance to break the cycle and flatten the curve of Covid-19 spread by following rules of social distancing and observing quarantine rules. This is in addition to washing hands properly and observing high standards of hygiene. He also said anyone, including powerful individuals, will be arrested for spreading fake news about the number of Covid-19 cases in the country. "If we don't do this, we will see people coming up with all sorts of statements," Kagwe said. Kenya is likely to be able to start manufacturing Personal Protective Equipment materials from next week. CS Kagwe said the country is accumulating materials. "If we experience a shortage, it won't be because we didn't do everything we could," Kagwe. He said at least 1,000 more medical workers could be hired soon. Kagwe also said the World Bank has donated 250 ventilators. Trade PS Betty Maina said the government is working with the textile sector to start manufacturing personal protective equipment (PPE). There are four new cases of Covid-19, Kagwe has said. They are one Kenyan and three foreigners from US, Cameroon and Burkina Faso. A total of 69 samples were analysed in the last 24 hours. Tracing of contacts for the 42 confirmed cases is ongoing. The total number of close contacts the government isÂ  monitoring stands at 1,426. Out of this number, 215 have been discharged after completing the mandatory 14-day follow up period. Medical teams are monitoring 919 close contacts with 18 individuals admitted at Mbagathi Hospital awaiting test results. To date, the government has tested 877 persons for Covid-19.
