An AP officer who allegedly shot dead a hero boda boda rider — who rushed a child to hospital — was on Thursday charged with murder. Zadock Ochuka Ayieko was arraigned before Justice Stella Mutuku and denied the charge. It was alleged that on February 18 at Mama Lucy Hospital he shot and killed Daniel Mburu, 27, over a parking dispute. Ayieko’s lawyer Nick Omari told the court that his client was granted Sh1 million bond by a Makadara court on Friday last week but police refused to release him even after he paid. The court heard he AP had been in custody for 17 days after police asked for time to complete investigations. On Friday the magistrate granted Ayieko bail but police refused to release him. Makadara chief magistrate Henson Nyaga granted his release on bail pending his court appearance. However, Justice Mutuku ruled the bond issued in Makadara did not apply to the murder case since what was before the magistrate was a miscellaneous application and not a charge. The judge directed the defence lawyer to file a formal application for bail and serve the DPP. Then they will get a date and argue the application. The murder case will be heard on September 22, 23 and 24 before Justice James Wakiaga. The prosecution will call 22 witnesses to testify. Ayieko was ordered remanded at Industrial Area Prison. Aburu had saved a child from drowning and rushed her to the hospital. He was allegedly shot during a confrontation in the hospital parking lot. The issue apparently was whether he had the right to park there. Mburu's mother Sarah Wangari said no mother should bury her child, adding that it was worse when he was murdered in cold blood. "You don’t become a widow, not an orphan. There is no name for that kind of pain. I was Mama Daddy, but now I am just Sarah Wangari," she said. Edited by Henry Makori
