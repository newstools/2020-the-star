Two leaders and the Kisii Eye Hospital have partnered to offer support to a mother and her seven children who have a rare eye condition. Kisii Eye Hospital proprietor Dan Kiage told Star at least four of the children and the mother may require corrective eye surgery. “After tests, we confirmed at least four severe cases that may require surgery. We are still doing assessments so that we can help improve their vision,” Kiage said. Kiage said while the corrective surgery may not give a 100 per cent positive results, it will significantly boost their vision. The Star highlighted the plight of the family from Riamo, Bomachoge Chache in Kisii county. At the same time, Area MP Alfa Miruka and County Woman Representative Janet Ongera said they will help the family's livelihood. Miruka has started to build the Dorca Moraa and her children a new house.  He will also buy them a cow. Ongera said she will be monitoring the family's health and facilitate them to get medical help. She will also facilitate the children to get admission to proper schools once they finish treatment. “I was touched after reading the story in the Star. It is surprising to note that even the local administration has never registered the cases anywhere,” Ongera said on the phone. Already Ongera's staff have been supplying  Morara with food supplies besides helping them reach the hospital. Kisii trader AM Tailor promised to equip their new house with furniture. The family's eye condition began in early 2007  when Morara got married. Her children were all born with eye defects, sparking concern. Her husband temporarily kicked her out the home, accusing her of bringing a curse to the family. With some funding, she says, the children can be helped to realise their potential. “They love to go to school, they even hide to go to the nearby schools which lack specialist teachers,” she says.
