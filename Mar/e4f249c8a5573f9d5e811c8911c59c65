The Lamu government has shut down all salons and barbershops in efforts to combat the coronavirus disease. The notice was issued on Monday afternoon by the Department of Public Health and has since been adhered to 100 per cent. By Tuesday morning, none of the premises was open. The move is aimed at enforcing social distancing as a way of curbing the outbreak of spread of Covid-19. Lamu has more than 300 salons and barbershops distributed across Lamu town, Mpeketoni, Hindi, Mokowe and Witu. Speaking in Lamu town on Tuesday, Public Health promotion officer Ahmed Muhsin said they were doing all they can to keep Lamu free from the disease as infections steadily rise across the country. Suspected cases have been confirmed in neighbouring Mombasa, Kilifi and Kwale counties. Muhsin said the nature of the business requires them to be close to and touch their clients when attending to them, hence it is impossible to keep the one-metre social distance. He said all owners have since been served with notices requiring them to suspend their services with immediate effect. Muhsin warned that those who don’t comply will be arrested and charged under the Public Health Act. The affected traders said the move was a blow as it had interfered with their only source of livelihood. Lincoln Matu who owns a barbershop in Lamu town asked how they would survive without working. “Let them give us some money - even loans - to survive on because they just made us close down our only source of livelihood. Let us not die from hunger because we are fighting coronavirus,” Matu said. Salon operator Maggie Waithera urged the county government to allow them at least one week to prepare and save money. “We don’t have any money. This kind of business doesn’t really leave you with savings," she said. Edited by R.Wamochie
