The Law Society of Kenya wants DCI George Kinoti to expeditiously investigate the killing of lawyer Hilary Obilo. LSK West Kenya branch members condemned the brutal killing of Obilo and demanded a thorough probe. “We want the DCI to ensure the criminals are arrested and charged,” Kisumu chapter chairperson Joan Neto said. Neto called on Kisumu and Kakamega DCI bosses to work together to apprehend those behind the murder. “The vehicle belonging to Obilo was found in Kisumu. A suspect led police to where they had hidden it,” she said at a press briefing on Wednesday. David Otieno said they are shocked and disappointed about the killing, adding it amounts to intimidation. “The government has the responsibility to protect the lives of citizens and their property,” he said. Sources said the lawyer was handling a sensitive case. Obilo succumbed to injuries at the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital in Eldoret on March 6. He had been carjacked and sustained serious head injuries. His attackers made away with his car and mobile phone. Otieno demanded justice for all lawyers who have died in the line of duty. “We will not rest until the suspects are brought to book," he said Obilo adds to a number of lawyers, including Willie Kimani, murdered in the line of duty.
