@Alicewangechi About 1,000 drivers applied for new-generation smart driving licences last weekend from the National Transport and Safety Authority in Murang'a. The authority pitched camp at the county headquarters on Saturday and Sunday to help drivers who have not yet applied for the new licences. NTSA deputy director and head of licensing Hared Adan said the authority has been organising outreach programmes for drivers where it does not have offices. Adan said the nearest NTSA office is in Thika, Kiambu county, which made it difficult for drivers, especially matatu drivers, to apply for the licences. “Because of the distance we decided to spend the weekend in Murang’a to reach as many drivers as possible,” he said. He said most drivers work from Monday to Friday and rest on the weekend when they have time to apply. “That way, we are able to fast-track the conversion from the old driving licence to the new with a July 1 deadline," he said. Those who miss the deadline will no longer be able to renew their licences through e-citizen. Adan said similar outreach has been carried out in Nyandarua and more will be organised in other counties. The new licence has a point system that will provide all the details of the driver, including blood type, and of their traffic offences. “If a driver has had traffic violations, NTSA will be able to capture that and deduct points,” he said. Murang’a Woman Representative Sabina Chege said consultations have been held with the authority to consider opening an office in Murang’a town. “We asked them to come to Murang’a because some drivers are always on the road and do not get time to apply," she said. NTSA rolled out the new-generation licences in April 2018.  (Edited by V. Graham)
