Africa Nazarene University is the first academic institution to suspend learning as a precautionary measure following the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in the country on Friday. It announced the closure of its two campuses effective Monday. In a letter to students, vice-chancellor Stanely Bhebhe says, "The contact trace of the confirmed case includes Ongata Rongai." Nazarene's main campus is located in Ongata Rongai. Also closed is its campus in the Nairobi central business district. "After careful consideration and analysis of the situation, the university has taken a cautionary decision to suspend on-campus classes effective Monday, March 16," the letter reads. Distance learning classes will, however, continue. All boarding students have been instructed to check out of hostels on Saturday, March 14.  The letter dated March 13 adds, "No unauthorised person will be allowed entry into the university after Monday." Other learning institutions based in Ongata Rongai and its environs have yet to issue any directive affecting their operations. They include the Multimedia University of Kenya, Cooperative University, the Kenya School of Law and the Catholic University of Eastern Africa. Riara University has only suspended its graduation ceremony that was set for March 19. Vice-chancellor Robert Gateru, in a letter, says, "The Riara University senate in its special sitting today (March 13) made a decision to postpone the fourth graduation ceremony… until further notice."
