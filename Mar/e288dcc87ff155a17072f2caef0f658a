Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua has urged the elderly to avoid unnecessary movement. This follows statistics recorded in China indicate that the elderly are more vulnerable. "Naomba wazee wetu ambao ni zaidi ya niaka 70 au 75 tukae nyumbani na tusitembelewe na watu wengi (The elderly aged 70 and above should stay at home and avoid receiving visitors), Mutua said. The governor made his remarks on Wednesday during a press conference convened by the Council of Governors to address county preparedness to handle the situation. He said the chances of old people recovering from the virus once infected are lower compared to the youth. The governor said all the 47 counties are well prepared to carry out testing and that they are only waiting for approval from the government. He lauded the president for putting rogue business people on notice by hiking commodity prices. Mutua said Machakos traders risk losing their licences if they are caught increasing the price of essential goods and products which are in high demand at this time. The country has so far confirmed seven cases of coronavirus. Speaking to the media on Wednesday, Kagwe said the first two cases related to these three are a couple that traveled from Spain on March 4 through Dubai arriving in Kenya on March 5. The third case is a Burundian national who had traveled from Dubai arriving on March 17.
