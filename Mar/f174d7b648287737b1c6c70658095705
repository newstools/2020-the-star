Legendary golfer Elisha Kasuku has singled out Greg Snow as the country’s sure bet for Magical Kenya Open presented by Absa. Kasuku reckons that Snow’s current form will come in handy when the crème de la crème of European Tour returns to Kenya for the prestigious event. Despite winning five out of 11 events in the 2019/2020 Safari Tour, Greg emerged third behind champion Dismas Indiza and Simon Ngige. “Snow has been consistent over the past year and also played in the Sunshine Tour. He went to Swazi Open and should be in great form. He has international experience over and above his participation in the Safari Tour,” Kasuku, who is the only local pro to grace the senior British Open, said. Kasuku also heaped praise on Sigona resident professional CJ Wangai whom he believes has been in great form. “Wangai has been playing really well but had an accident, so we will see how it goes,” added Kasuku. Snow won Safari Tour rounds at Nyali, Sigona, Muthaiga, Thika Greens and Karen. Snow, Ngige and Indiza will lead the home brigade in the event which was upgraded from the Challenge Tour to the main Tour. Snow’s determination is there for all to see and the one thing which drives him the most is the opportunity to become Kenya’s first golfer on the world stage. Snow became the youngest player to represent his country in 2006 at the age of just 16, and he went on to study at the University of Texas in the US as a result of a golf scholarship. Snow is hoping that a good finish can secure him some more starts on the European Tour.
