Mandera Governor Ali Roba and his deputy Mohamed Arai have both taken a 30 per cent pay cut, the proceeds to help fight the coronavirus. President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto each have taken an 80 per cent pay cut. Speaking to the press in Mandera town, Roba said even though the county has not recorded any cases of Covid-19, they are prepared through a comprehensive and multifaceted approach. The governor said the county had formed a multi-agency task force chaired by his deputy Arai. His administration has temporarily trimmed the salaries of some officials for use against the pandemic, Roba said. The cuts will take effect from April 1 to June 30. “To complement the goodwill gesture of President Uhuru Kenyatta and his appeal for a voluntary contribution towards Covid-19 intervention, Mandera Executive met today (Sunday) and approve the decision,” the statement reads. “Staff in the job group T will take a 20 per cent pay cut, job group S 15 per cent, Job group R 10 per cent. All other cadres are advised to sign voluntary contributions from their basic salaries. A further advisory will be issued at the end of June,” he said. Mandera North and Mandera East subcounties will use the Mandera County Referral Hospital as isolation centres while Lafey and Mandera South have Elwak Referral. Banisa and Mandera West subcounties will use Takaba subcounty headquarters while Kotulo will use the new subcounty offices for isolation in case a case is reported, Roba said. On Tuesday last week, the governor said the county government has introduced a special duty allowance for doctors and nurses screening people for Covid-19. He the allowance is meant to both help and motivate health workers. Edited by R.Wamochie
