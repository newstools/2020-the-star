Independent Policing Oversight Authority has documented 210 cases of extrajudicial killings in the last 15 months. Chairperson Anne Makori says the cases involve people dying in police custody, executions in broad daylight and forced disappearances. Makori told Senate Justice Legal Affairs and Human Rights Committee that the authority has completed investigations into 110 cases. Of these, 75 are currently before courts, 34 are pending at ODPP and 20 files are set to be submitted to ODPP. She adds that there been six convictions over the period with three being sentenced to death. Makori appeared before the Nandi Senator Samson Cherargei led committee alongside five human rights groups over the rising cases of extrajudicial killings and forced disappearances. She says police officers blatant failure by police to report killings as required in law, failure by NPS to implement its recommendations and meager resources, including the shortage of investigators have hampered the authority's work. The NGO, Amnesty International, IMLU, social and justice centers called for the formation of a commission of inquiry to probe cases of police executions. They said the cases are on the rise especially in slums and informal settlements where youths aged between 14 and 30 are killed nearly on a daily basis. The groups say the rogue officers are operating with impunity, arresting civilians and draining them in torture rooms before executing them. "They are threatening communities. Families whose kin are killed are asked to pay for bullets that killed the. It is sad, " Social Justice coordinator Wilfred Olal said. IMLU execute director Peter Kiama said they have documented close to 1000 cases of police killings and forced disappearances between 2015 and 2019.
