Health CS Mutahi Kagwe has announced that Kenya has recorded eight more coronavirus cases putting the country's total number to 50. The CS said Nairobi now leads with 37 confirmed Covid-19 cases followed by Kilifi (6), Mombasa (4), Kajiado, Kwale and Kitui with one each. Tracing of contacts for this 50 is ongoing. Out of the 50 cases, 26 are male and 24 female. "From the 2,050 people in mandatory quarantine, we have in the last 24 hours tested 172 samples, 84 samples have so far been analyzed and have received confirmation of 1 person who has tested positive for coronavirus," Kagwe said. The CS urged those living in Nairobi to stop going upcountry during this period since a majority of the elderly people live there. Among other interventions put in place is an advisory for Nairobians to cease travelling to upcountry during this period. Employers have also been asked to release employees at 4 pm, to allow them to travel to their homes before the curfew time. More than 720,000 people have been infected across the world and around 34,000 have died from coronavirus. The government announced on Sunday that at least 1,000 medics will be hired in the next week to handle the rising number of coronavirus infection. The new medics include nurses, clinical officers, lab technologists and doctors, among others.
