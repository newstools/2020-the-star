Meru county government has started fumigating public places to contain the Covid-19 outbreak. The fumigation began on Monday at Meru main stage towards the Gakoromone market. Gakoromone is the biggest market in the county. North Imenti public health officer Samuel Muchere said, "Fumigation alone will not help fight the virus. People should practise personal hygiene among other precautions." He said if traders fail to observe the directives, the county will close the market. Governor Kiraitu Murungi has cancelled market days to avoid crowding. Kiraitu said stadiums, recreational parks and other social spaces will remain closed for 30 days. On Monday, Chief of Staff Gideon Kimathi told revenue officers not to collect revenue on market days where people are not heeding the directives by the governor. He spoke at Ntharene market – the county's biggest banana market. The market was closed and traders sent away. Meanwhile, Isiolo county commissioner Herman Shambi has banned the sale and consumption of miraa to contain the spread of the virus. Shambi said police will deal with anyone who defies the orders. He spoke after chairing the Covid-19 Emergency Response Team meeting on Monday. “I also caution parents against allowing their children to go out playing in groups as this exposes them to the risk of contracting the virus." He said this is not a holiday season and parents must take the responsibility of confining their children at homes. Shambi also ordered the closure of bars. He also directed that funerals limit attendance to 15. Edited by R.Wamochie
