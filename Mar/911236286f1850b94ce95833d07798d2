South African Airways (SAA) said on Friday that it would immediately suspend all intercontinental flights until May 31 in response to a government travel ban aimed at stopping the spread of the coronavirus outbreak. SAA flies to the United States, Britain, Germany, Australia and Brazil on its intercontinental routes. SAA said earlier this week that it had cancelled 162 international and regional flights until the end of this month due to low demand and restrictions linked to coronavirus. Kenya Airways on Wednesday suspended its flights on four routes in the wake of coronavirus. In a statement, the national carrier said it has suspended flights to Bangkok, Djibouti, Mogadishu and Khartoum.
