Bandari centre-half Brian Otieno has outlined the role played by veteran Congolese defender Felly Mulumba in grooming him and his teammate Bernard Odhiambo to man the heart of the defence at the club before he left. Mulumba ended his five-year stint with the coastal side early last month after landing a lucrative deal with Zimbabwean champions Platinum FC,Â  leaving the two stocky hard-men to shoulder the central defensive roles. Otieno revealed that Mulumba instilled confidence, discipline and the ability to instruct the other defenders and players during the years they played alongside him. Odhiambo, a sibling to former Harambee Stars assistant skipper David 'Calabar' Odhiambo, had the privilege to partner with Mulumba since 2017 while Otieno has rubbed shoulders with him for the past two years. Bandari have since secured maximum points in all their four league matches played from the time the former skipper Mulumba left. "The two of us enjoyed playing with him at the heart of the defence. When Odhiambo was injured, I partnered him and learnt a lot especially in tackling and positioning. We also gained from his leadership skills and I am happy we have fully filled the void he left, " he said Otieno, who joined Bandari from Nzoia Sugar in November 2018, in the meantime, credited their recent run to teamwork spirit. Bandari have found new lease of life under Twahir Muhiddin who took over the reigns in January after his predecessor Bernard Mwalala was fired over the team's dismal run in the league.
