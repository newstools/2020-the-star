Boda boda operators have been ordered to wear face masks amid efforts to contain the spread of Covid-19. Health CS Mutahi Kagwe on Monday said the move is among the new intervention measures being put in place to allow continuity of livelihoods. He said the current trend of spread of the Covid-19 has been established to be through community transmission and not imported. "All boda bodas going forward will have to put on face masks. You can imagine how many passengers they interact with in a single day, we need to save our youth who have invested heavily in this business," he said. Kagwe said the ministry has put mechanisms in place to ensure the face-masks are distributed across the country to be accessed by the boda bodas. He said police have been instructed to enforce the directive immediately. The CS on Monday announced Kenya has reported eight new cases of the disease in the last 24 hours raising the total number in the country to 50 confirmed cases. According to Kagwe, some 172 samples had been tested out of which 84 samples were analysed. "We have embarked on tracing of the close contacts of the 50 confirmed cases. So far we have managed to trace 1,474 contacts and some 1,211 contacts are being monitored," he said. Kagwe said 231 people have been discharged after the 14-day incubation period. So far Nairobi is still leading with a total of 37 cases, followed by Kilifi with six, Mombasa has four while Kajiado, Kwale and Kitui counties each have one case. Among other interventions put in place is an advisory for Nairobians to cease travelling to upcountry during this period. Employers have also been asked to release employees at 4 pm, to allow them to travel to their homes before the curfew time.
