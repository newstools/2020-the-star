If you are a youngster or a party animal, you might have to shelve your clubbing from today. This was after the government banned social gatherings to contain coronavirus. The virus, which emanated from China's Wuhan, has killed more than 5,000 people and infected thousands. To avoid being infected, going to clubs will have to be stopped. Nairobi has over 4,000 licensed club establishments. In entertainment clubs, the dance floor is always full of ravers waving their arms while others sit on cosy sofas watching big TV screens. The music played ranges from old school, Bongo to Blues. Clubs tend to have more single members than married ones. Some clubs restrict their membership. The purpose of these clubs is split between general social interaction and taking part in the events themselves. These clubs allow people interested in an activity or subject to congregate and interact with one another. Apart from entertainment joints, other common examples include book clubs, movie clubs, hiking clubs, sports clubs and dance clubs. On Friday, the government suspended all visits to prisons for the next 30 days. Public gatherings, church crusades, games and even inter-school events have also been suspended. Public gatherings, including the Building Bridges Initiative rally, which was to be held in Nakuru country on March 21, will also be put on hold. Health CS Mutahi Kagwe further urged people with a cough or are sneezing and have a fever to stay at home. All public transport providers have been directed to provide hand sanitisers.
