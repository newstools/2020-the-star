The fight against Covid-19 has intensified in Kwale county, with the number of bodaboda riders set to be reduced by half. Speaking on Thursday at Baraza Park during the county response committee meeting in Matuga constituency, Bodaboda chairman Juma Gamtoni said the move will help to effectively respond to the government directive of limiting movement. Gamtoni said the majority of them do not meet the standard operating requirements and are underage, hence posing a great threat to the campaign against the disease. They are the ones targetted in the reduction push. "If some can ignore simple driving rules, do you think they can follow safety and precaution measures?" he asked, adding that they would be risking their lives and those of their clients. Gamtoni suggested the motorbike drivers be eliminated on the basis of age, licences and compliance with government orders. He said because of the 7pm-5 am curfew that starts on Friday, there is no need to have many people on the road. The riders will have to carry sanitiser and one passenger only. By Thursday, the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in Kenya had risen to 31, with one death and one recovery reported. Matuga OCPD Francis Nguli said police officers will be deployed in pick-up and drop-off points to enforce law and order. Meanwhile, Kwale leaders have united to fight Covid-19. Matuga MP Kasim Tandaza has offered to fuel vehicles for five days to run a sensitisation exercise and distributed 20 water tanks to promote handwashing. The Kwale government, on the other hand, is continuing with fumigation of critical areas. The security team, led by county commissioner Karuku Ngumo, has been enhanced as they walk around to monitor the situation. Ngumo urged residents to cooperate. "This war is not just for the government but all of us. In order to win the fight, we must join forces and do what is required," he said.
