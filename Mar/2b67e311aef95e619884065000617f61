The family of a 48-year-old man is demanding justice after he was allegedly assaulted by police officers on the first day of the curfew and later succumbed to injuries in Msambweni Subcounty Referral Hospital. The deceased, Hamisi Juma Idi Mwadungudu, was allegedly beaten on Friday evening by police officers at Mkunazini area in Likoni, Mombasa county on his way home some minutes after the curfew started. Last Wednesday, President Uhuru Kenyatta issued a 7pm-5 am curfew to heighten the fight against Covid-19. According to his cousin Hidaya Fweda, a former Ng’ombeni MCA, the police attacked him while on a motorcycle and hit his hand. He accidentally landed on one of the erected road beacons. “They whipped him on the back. He lost control of the motorcycle and hit a road barrier before falling,” Fweda said. Two police officers allegedly kept on clobbering him. The man managed to gather some strength, picked his boda boda and rode off. Fweda said Iddi was rushed to Mwahima Hospital in Likoni where he was treated and discharged but asked to seek further medical examination. The deceased was later taken to Kwale hospital early Saturday morning, where he was admitted. “The X-ray results showed that Mwadungudu’s organs were okay but some fluid had formed around them. That is why he was hospitalised,” the former MCA said. The former MCA said in the evening his cousin’s condition deteriorated and he was referred to Msambweni hospital where he passed on Sunday morning. The matter was reported at Inuka police station in Ujamaa. Likoni deputy county commissioner  said he is not aware of the incident. Likoni police boss Jane Munyole was reluctant to speak to the Star about the matter. “Wait, I will call you later,” she said. Mwadungudu was a former police officer, according to Fweda. He has left a widow and four children, two boys and two girls. His body was taken to the Coast General Hospital for a postmortem.
