The biggest barrier to succeeding in the war on drug abuse is that we don't fight the vice from the roots. With the current state of the economy and lack of jobs in the country, students in secondary and tertiary institutions are faced with the dilemma of completing their education to stay unemployed or start money-making ventures while still in school. This is a lot of pressure for a young person just starting to make their own decisions for their future. But with proper life skills lessons at an early stage, these youth can manage this pressure much better hence avoiding getting into drugs and their trafficking. But teachers nowadays 'utilise' the free or PE lessons to extend their class for better academic grades not realising the importance of life skills to youth. If the learners are taught religiously like other lessons, these skills will help them deal with inevitable pressure as they progress.  Kisumu
