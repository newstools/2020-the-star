Disgraced producer Harvey Weinstein has been sentenced to 23 years in prison for rape and sexual assault. Weinstein was found guilty in a trial in New York last month, finalising a dramatic fall from grace for one of Hollywood's most powerful figures. The 67-year-old appeared in court on Wednesday in a wheelchair. Weinstein's lawyers had appealed for leniency, insisting that even the minimum sentence of five years could be a "life sentence" for him.
