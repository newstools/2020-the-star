The commissioning of two major Lamu jetties has been suspended indefinitely because of the coronavirus disease. Renovation of the Sh48 million Manda Airport Jetty and the Sh35 million Lamu Mangrove Terminal is complete. Their commissioning was set for this week. The two and Mokowe Customs and Mtangawanda jetties have been under renovation for the past year for Sh760 million. Jetties are a crucial element of the county's transport system as they are the main entry and exit points for passengers and cargo coming to Lamu town and the entire archipelago. Lack of consistent maintenance as required to keep them in good shape has left them unsound. Speaking in Lamu on Tuesday, Public Works chief structural engineer Hillary Nyaanga said the new date for commissioning of the two jetties will be communicated. Nyaanga said there is a need to wait until the outbreak is contained before launching the projects. “Our initial plan had been to commission the two jetties this week but as the country is dealing with Covid-19, we have suspended our plans till further notice." Renovation of the two other jetties is underway, he said. Mokowe Customs is 50 per cent complete and  Mtangawanda at 70 per cent. The Mokowe customs jetty is the largest in the region, its renovation cost Sh599 million. It will be ready next year in August with the new design including an alternative ramp for the disabled, a waiting bay and a fuel station. The Mtangawanda jetty which is being revamped at Sh78 million is set to be completed by May. The jetty was in bad condition that in August 2018, a corroded pontoon detached from its piles and floated away. A pontoon is a floatable heavy metal device connected to jetties and used as a landing site for boarding and alighting from boats.
