Diamond Platnumz’s ex Lulu Diva has released an EP called ‘Foursome’, a title that has gotten fans talking. Diva came to the attention of Kenyan fans when she was accused of cheating with Diamond while Tanasha was pregnant. She and the WCB boss have never responded to the claims. Talking about the EP, Diva said she named it ‘Foursome’ to create buzz around the release. "I wanted to attract people with the name, meaning I have collaborated with three men and myself, making that four. Another person may call it foursome to mean that the EP has four songs," she said. Diva has featured Kenyan award-winning rapper Khaligraph Jones, Uganda’s Eddy Kenzo and Tanzania’s FidQ. "I think Khaligraph is the biggest rapper in East Africa, meaning working with him right now is the best thing to reach the Kenyan market," she said.
