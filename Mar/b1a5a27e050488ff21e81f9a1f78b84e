Youths have been challenged to seize the opportunities presented by the government to improve their standards of living. Lizzie Wanyoike, the founder and director of Nairobi Institute of Business Studies, told the youth, especially graduates, to apply for state funds such as the Uwezo, Youth Enterprise Fund and the Women Enterprise Fund to establish and grow their businesses. She spoke at Deliverance Church in Juja, Kiambu county, during a business empowerment summit. Others who addressed the meeting were Kelvin Majau of Urithi Treasury and Jeremy Karemeri of Broad Boarders Housing Cooperative Society. “Most of the youth in the country are grappling with joblessness because most of them believe they will only make it in life through employment. I’m challenging our youth to look beyond employment and become entrepreneurial". "The state has availed funds which if well spent can unchain our youth from the shackles of unemployment,” Wanyoike said. She added that most of the youths in the country are creative, innovative and well-versed with relevant technology yet they are still jobless due to lack of seed capital. “A big percentage of our youth has already undergone training at universities, colleges or technical institutions. However not all will end up in the white-collar jobs and that’s why I’m appealing to them to use the state funds as seed capital to initiate their own ventures that will help them improve their livelihoods,” she said. Majau, who’s also the Tushia Global Holdings MD, told the youth to commercialise their talents. “Again be brave and don’t fear to knock doors and look for resources. Talk and meet with people and get ideas because resources come from people. This way, you will be part of the transformation in the country,” Majau said. Similar sentiments were echoed by Karemeri and pastor Herbert Mbaka of Deliverance Church in Juja.
