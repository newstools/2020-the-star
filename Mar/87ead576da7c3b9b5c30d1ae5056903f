Churches across Nairobi held services even as the government advised against large gatherings as part of preventive measures against coronavirus. At the Holy Family Basilica, Catholic faithful gathered for a holy mass albeit with preventive measures. “We don't want to exterminate an important spiritual exercise. We feel that there is still a need to bring people together,” church administrator Simon Kamomoe said. Kamomoe said online service cannot replace a church service. “People can do other prayers at home but they cannot have the Holy Mass at home. They can only have it in church with a priest. It is the most important part of worship where we harvest grace and blessings as a church and individuals,” Kamomoe said. At the Jubilee Christian Centre in Parklands church services went on as usual. A security official said that the first service had been conducted in the morning. Although the Star team was barred from accessing the compound, worshippers could be seen milling out of the church in numbers. This was the same situation at Maximum Miracle Centre and the Lord Our Righteousness in the Central Business District and Mukuru Kayaba, respectively. “The only way to overcome this pandemic is through repentance and prayer. That is why we have come as a church to stand in the gap for our country Kenya,” Boniface Kyalo of the Lord Our Righteousness said. The Star team was barred from accessing Maximum Miracle Centre – headed by Pastor Pius Muiru – but church services were in full gear as late as 2 pm. Other churches, such as All Saints Cathedral, Christ is the Answer Ministries and City Lighters, resorted to online services to reach out to their congregants.
