The Nairobi government has intensified the war on the coronavirus disease through fumigation across the city. The next stop will be Eastleigh. Public Health department officials will camp at General Waruinge Street at 11 am on Saturday to start the exercise before proceeding to Eastleigh 1st Avenue. Health executive Hitan Majevdia has appealed to residents to allow the officers access to different critical areas so the exercise can be a success. The department has partnered with the Ministry of Health. "We are upscaling the fumigation exercise in the city. The exercise will continue until all the high-risk areas in the county are covered," he said. In addition, the county has urged the members of the public to continue adhering to the instruction from the Ministry of Health on prevention and control and support government initiatives put in place to curb the virus. The exercise was initiated last week after the Ministry of Health donated 700 litres of chemicals (chlorine). This week, the officers sprayed Wakulima, famously known as Marikiti; Muthurwa and City markets. County health deputy director Wilson Langat said the exercise will be taking place in the morning hours to avoid intense interruption of business. In the CBD, they have covered Aga Khan Walk, General Post Office (GPO) and public resting areas around Hilton Hotel and the National Archives building. Others are Kencom Bus Stage, Jeevanjee Gardens, Hakati Road, Tom Mboya Stage, Ronald Ngala Street and Mfangano Lane. At the same time, the county is educating residents in different wards on the prevention measures. Data from the office of the Health executive office indicate that at least 675 health workers from 200 facilities have been trained in preventive measures against Covid-19. By last Friday, 3,000 community volunteers had also been trained. The health workers and volunteers have taken charge of sensitisation programmes in the wards. (Edited by F'Orieny)
