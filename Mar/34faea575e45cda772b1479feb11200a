The court has reduced bail from Sh1 million to Sh200,000 each for four people charged alongside former Sports CS Rashid Echesa in the fake Sh39 billion military firearms tender. They are Daniele Otieno, Clifford Onyango, Kennedy Mboya and Chrispin Oduor. On Monday, they had asked the court to review their bond, which was set at Sh3 million and alternative cash bail of Sh1 million was too high. Magistrate Kennedy Cheruiyot reviewed it to Sh1.5 million bond or Sh200,000 bail each. In his ruling, Cheruiyot noted that only Echesa has been able to secure bail. The court further said that from the records, two of the accused persons had deposited bond to court, but they were lower that the amount set. The case will be mentioned on Wednesday next week when the court will hear an application in which Echesa is seeking the release of a Range Rover and two guns. In a certificate of urgency on Tuesday, Echesa, through lawyer Brian Khaemba, sought court orders compelling the officers to return the car, firearms and 104 bullets. Echesa was arrested on February 13 and charged with several counts of fraud. He was charged with his four co-accused.  The former CS was freed on February 17. On Monday, DCI officers raided Echesa’s Nairobi home following a search warrant granted by a court in relation to another case in which he is accused of illegally transferring the ownership of vehicles belonging to his late friend. They seized five cars. Khaemba argued that from the particulars of the tender case charges, there is no indication that the vehicle or the firearms were used to commit the alleged crime. Echesa said confiscation of his guns has greatly subjected him to serious security risks and challenges, given his position as the immediate former Cabinet Secretary for Culture and Sports. Cheruiyot certified the application by Echesa as urgent and gave the prosecution seven days to respond. The application will be heard on March 11.
