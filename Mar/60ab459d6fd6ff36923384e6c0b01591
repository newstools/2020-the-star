Kenyatta National Hospital has opened its first telemedicine technology centre for coronavirus detection, a first of it's kind in Africa. "Very soon we are going to have major operations being done in Kenya by our own doctors rather than taking patients overseas," Health CS Mutahi Kagwe said. "Instead of sending radiologists to different counties we can have CT scans interpreted here." Addressing the media on Sunday during the launch, Kagwe said the government is  doing everything possible to train the nurses, doctors and clinical officers. "I want to assure you that the government is going to ensure that you are protected and you are trained for protection…” he said. The chairman of KNH, Nicholas Gumbo, said this was the first such centre in Africa. "...our country is leaving nothing to chance in confronting Covid-19. The whole world has never had this experience before," Gumbo said. As at 10am, March 22, 2020, there were 1,198 confirmed cases 0f the coronavirus in 42 African countries, including 37 fatalities. On Saturday, government spokesman Cyrus Oguna said random screening of Kenyans will continue as Kenya seeks to contain the spread of the coronavirus. Oguna said markets and other high risk areas have successfully been fumigated.
