The Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions has issued guidelines on how cases will be handled in the next 14 days. DPP Noordin Haji said only murder, robbery with violence, sexual offences, terrorism, serious drug trafficking and human trafficking will be taken to court by his office during this period. This comes after President Uhuru Kenyatta on Sunday announced that three coronavirus cases had been confirmed in the country. Haji asked officers in charge of stations to contact ODDP regional heads and in their absence heads of counties in case of serious offences. “Prosecution of cases are suspended for the next 14 days except for serious cases. I urge the staff dealing with serious cases to take necessary precautions,” he said. The DPP also asked employees to use hand sanitisers and gloves, especially when handling exhibits. Haji also directed that data on cases by police in stations be submitted to the deputy director-in-charge on a weekly basis. Suspects released on bail, police bond or notice to attend court, he said, will be given a date to attend court in two weeks' time, which may be extended if the situation persists. “The dates will be spread out to ensure the workload does not pile up in one day,” he said. “Police officers are to take contact details of all suspects to inform them of any changes in the date of reporting to court”. On Sunday, Chief Justice David Maraga said all active criminal and civil cases will be suspended for two weeks. The CJ said that prisoners and remandees will not be brought to court and new arrests except serious ones will be dealt with at police stations. Judges and magistrates will review bail terms for those in remands and there will be no open court appearances by judicial officers. Edited by A. Ndung'u
