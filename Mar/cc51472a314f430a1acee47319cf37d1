The US—Africa Business Summit which was scheduled for Marrakech, Morocco between June 9-12 this year has been postponed. This is as a result of the evolving nature of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, the Corporate Council on Africa (CCA) and the government of Morocco have jointly said. “Our priority at CCA in response to COVID-19 is to help ensure the health and safety of our staff, members, attendees and stakeholders, "said Florizelle Liser, President and CEO, Corporate Council on Africa. "We apologize for any inconvenience caused by this decision and look forward to welcoming you to the Summit in Morocco at a later date,”she added. Liser said CCA will continue to monitor the situation as it evolves, urging everyone to stay safe and informed during this time. The government of Morocco has said it remains committed to partnering with CCA to host the Summit in Morocco, and together with CCA , it is currently exploring new dates for the 13th U.S.-Africa Business Summit which will be announced as soon as possible. The ongoing pandemic highlights the importance of strong health systems, emergency preparedness and collaboration among governments, multilateral institutions, civil society, and the private sector in an increasingly globalized economy, a joint statement released on Thursday states. “CCA is dedicated to continuing to work with its partners to identify strategies and solutions to mitigate the health implications of infectious diseases such as COVID-19, recognizing that the foundation of any prosperous society is a healthy population,” the statement reads in part. CCA said it recognizes the social and economic impact of COVID-19 on business, trade and investment, and is committed to helping its members, partners and key stakeholders navigate the outcomes of the pandemic.
