We want this information gathered to get a comprehensive situation." The Ministry of Health said a 57-year-old Ugandan male and a businessman in Adjumani who tested positive for COVID-19 had not travelled anywhere outside the country. Another person who tested positive was a 63-year-old who travelled from Germany and two Chinese nationals.
