Busia county may not realise development if the electorate continues voting out leaders every five years, Governor Sospeter Ojaamong has said. Voters need to be patient and exercise the principle of political continuity to realise development, the county chief said on Tuesday. Voting out leaders every five years leaves projects incomplete and leads to waste of resources. The governor spoke when giving out 40 dairy cows to groups in Chakol North Ward in Teso South constituency. The project by the county government envisions increasing milk production in the county. Ojaamong said it was important for voters to give leaders they trust time to execute their development agenda. “Experiments have spoiled politics. Give a leader at least 10 years. I served for two terms as Member of Parliament and now serving a similar number of terms as governor,” Ojaamong said. The county chief is among very few leaders in the county who have been reelected. Ojaamong was first elected Amagoro MP in 2002 on the ODM party ticket before he successfully defended the position in 2007. He vied for governor on the same party ticket in 2013 and elbowed out his Teso South competitor Vincent Sidai. He sailed through the ballot again in 2017 to serve his second and last term. In the 2017 General Election in Busia, only two out of the seven MPs returned to Parliament: John Bunyasi (Nambale, ANC) and Matayos’s Geoffrey Odanga (ODM). At the county assembly, only seven out of the 35 MCAs were reelected.
