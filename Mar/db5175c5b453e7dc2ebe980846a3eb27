Inadequate parental guidance is the breeding ground for the rising indiscipline cases among the youth in Kwale county, a lobby group has said. Samba Sports Youth Agenda is now asking parents to be responsible for their children who engage in crime, and not to blame it on unemployment. Project officer Ali Mabavu said many youths have become drug addicts and recruited into gangs due to poor upbringing. Speaking in an interview in Ukunda, Mabavu said youngsters coming from disciplined backgrounds cannot be easily lured to join criminal groups because they have goals to focus on, and shoulders to cry on in times of pain and stress. “Family backgrounds contribute a lot to a child’s behaviour. When poorly nurtured, they lead wayward lives,” he said. Mabavu said most children are likely to imitate their parents’ behaviour as they grow up. “A son who normally sees his father chewing miraa and smoking with friends will automatically think that is the kind of life people should have,” he said. The official added that lack of discipline is the doorway to immorality and other vices. He said by practising good behaviour teens will adopt such virtues and lead responsible lives. The official said controlling adolescents would be easier, considering that the adolescence stage is the turning point where they are most vulnerable. Meanwhile, Mabavu said Samba Sports in partnership with Jamii Action Center organization have started a campaign to shape positive narrative across ethnic and cultural diversities. He said the programme is mainly focused on educating youth on how to be resilient on temptations of violent reactions and overcoming them. Mabavu said they are also offering guidance and counseling sessions for people who have been psychologically challenged due to gruesome life experiences.
