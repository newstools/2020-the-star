Malkia Strikers’ middle blocker Trizah Atuka says her recovery is way ahead of time and she hopes to resume training by June this year. She has, however, ruled out the 2020 Tokyo Olympics in July, saying she will not be ready. “ I need to catch up with the rest of my teammates in terms of fitness as I start court rehabilitation and a month will not be enough to make the cut for the Olympic Games,” she added. The Kenya Pipeline player missed the African Olympic qualifying tournament in Cameroon in January after suffering a knee injury in November last year. Kenya qualified for the games after beating Nigeria, Egypt, Uganda and hosts Cameroon in a round-robin qualifier to bag the sole ticket to the Tokyo 2020 Games. Doctors had indicated that it will take nine months for her to start to heal from the surgery. Atuka was part of the squad that participated in the All Africa Games, which they won after beating Cameroon last September in Rabat, Morocco.
