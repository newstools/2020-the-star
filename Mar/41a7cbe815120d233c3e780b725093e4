@Waithaka06 Medics in Laikipia are investigating four people suspected of contracting Covid-19. Governor Ndiritu Muriithi said the four are believed to have travelled from foreign countries. The governor urged residents to observe the guidelines provided by the Health ministry which include washing hands, staying at home, and avoiding crowded places. “It is madness and suicide to choose laxity and the government will be very strict in enforcement. You can blame, insult, express indignation but Covid-19 does not care. You get infected and you could die,” Muriithi said. He spoke to journalists at his Nanyuki town office on Wednesday. Muriithi said that people can protect themselves and their loved ones if they follow the guidelines. Laikipia county commissioner Daniel Nyameti announced that all food kiosks, miraa and muguka selling points have been banned. “All bars and lodgings in the county should close immediately. Food joints should only take takeaway orders,” Nyameti said. Nyameti noted that some bars were operating illegally to serve their regular customers. He warned that action will be taken against them. The administrator also announced that no church will open as from this weekend. He advised church ministers to conduct their services online or through radio stations. (edited by o. owino)
