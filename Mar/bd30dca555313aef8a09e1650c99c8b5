Maina Kageni says he lied to his current boss about his previous monthly salary. Speaking during his morning breakfast show, 'Chanuka' segment, which he hosts alongside Mwalimu Kingangi, Maina said, "Patrick (Radio Africa boss) approached me and asked me how much I was being paid at Nation media. I told him Sh180,000, yet I was being paid Sh60,000." Maina said that after that, he ran and resigned officially. Patrick, who was determined to give him a job, offered to pay him a whooping Sh380,000, and that is how Maina became part of Radio Africa. "To top on that, he gave me a salary of two months and a leave to go and relax. I had never touched such money," Maina said. Narrating his experience, Mwalimu said for him, all he wanted was a job and the amount he would be paid did not matter much at the time. "It is now that I know that it is important to know your value. People take you for how you present yourself," Maina said. Maina is currently among the highest-paid radio personalities.
