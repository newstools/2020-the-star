A teacher at Sigor Primary School in Bomet was on Friday arrested, while the head teacher is being sought for proceeding with classes despite President Uhuru Kenyatta's order closing schools over coronavirus. County education director Indiatsi Mabale said the head teacher, Gideon Kilel, went into hiding after information went out that officers were searching for him. "We cannot have some few people doing the opposite of what the head of state has said...they must face the full force of the law," said Mabale. County commissioner Geoffrey Omoding also confirmed that police officers were looking for the sub county's education director Johnstone Mogusu in connection with the incident. Omoding said the officer is in charge of education matters and should have taken action. "He is the one to blame...apart from failing in his a mandate, he has also put the lives of the pupils at great risk now that the country is trying hard to combat the pandemic," Omoding said. Reached for a comment, Chepalungu deputy county commissioner Wafula Barasa said he was not aware of any school operating within the subcounty during this period. "We are not aware of any school operating in our area and if there is any we are going to arrest all those responsible. As far as we are concerned, all pupils and students are supposed to be at home during this time," he said. "There is nothing of urgency that can warrant a school head to recall pupils back to school, because we are all joining in the fight against coronavirus." Bomet county commissioner Geoffrey Omoding warned stern action will be taken against those responsible. Edited by Henry Makori
