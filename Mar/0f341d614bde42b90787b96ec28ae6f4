For many teams in the Kenyan Premier League, nothing is more daunting like a trip down the coast to face Bandari. That is not so for Kariobangi Sharks who have enjoyed some memorable results in Mombasa against the dockers. Sharks face Bandari in a KPL round 23-match on Saturday, seeking to replicate the 2017 season by completing a double over the dockers. That season was the first time Sharks visited Bandari in the league and also the only time they have left the Mbaraki Stadium with points. Winger James Mazembe is, however, confident that Sharks have what it takes to grab their second win at the coastal city. “We have been improving tremendously in the previous weeks. In the month of February, we haven’t lost a match and I believe we will do well this weekend. We just have to keep the focus and concentration up there.” “We know the stats aren’t good but that is history and what is important is that we focus on this match and treat it with all the seriousness and passion. They are just a place above us and we can reduce that gap on Saturday,” he said on the club’s portal. That last victory came on September 17, 2017 courtesy of a second-half strike by Masoud Juma which saw the game end 1-0 as Sharks went on to finish third on their debut top-flight campaign. Now in their fourth season in the KPL, Sharks have shown signs of becoming a mid-table outfit especially considering their policy of blooding youngsters while selling off their best players. However, after a slow start to the 2020  season, William Muluya’s youthful side have recovered well and was unbeaten in February—a kind of form they would want to maintain against Bandari.
