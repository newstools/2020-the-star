Barekeiywo girls and Kipsombe Boys will be hoping to reap big when they tackle top schools at the Rift Valley Secondary Schools Sports Association games set for next week in Kapsabet, Nandi County. The two schools dominated Uasin Gishu County championships in handball and rugby. Barekeiywo defeated Mumetet Secondary 11-06 to storm the regional championships where 14 counties will be battling for a single slot to the national championships to be hosted at the same venue a week later. Head coach Alexander Ruto said they want to play at the finals at the region in one of the most competitive schools' championships. “Last year, we lost at the county quarter-finals to Plateau Girls but this time we want to play in the final and book a slot to the national show. Winning at the region is tougher than at the nationals,” said Ruto. In rugby, Kipsombe will represent the county in both the 7's and 15's versions of the game. The school returns to the regional after missing last year’s title defence. “Our target is to play at the national championships. Winning a double at the county championships shows we are well prepared for the regional championships,” said coach Timothy Natembeya.
