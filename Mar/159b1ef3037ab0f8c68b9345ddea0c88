Seven months after the death of seven people in Hell's Gate National Park in Naivasha, KWS has yet to open the killer gorge. This has reduced the number of visitors to the park by more than 30 per cent. On September 1 last year, six family members and their local tour guide drowned while touring the gorge in the park, leading to its closure as Kenya Wildlife Service addressed the issue of safety. The bodies of the seven, who included two children, were found 30km from the gorge following flash floods that also left a trail of destruction. Kenya Wildlife Service Central Rift assistant director Dickson Ritan said they expect the gorge to be reopened in a month after all the safety measures were put in place. “Despite the closure of the gorge, the park is still popular as we have rock climbing, horse and bicycle riding and camping around the park that are very popular,” he said. Ritan said among the safety measures addressed included escape routes, early warning systems and sirens to warn visitors in advance. “We are also training all the tour guides on how to study weather patterns as the last incident was caused by floods after rains that pounded nearby areas,” he said. According to a junior worker who is not authorised to speak to the press, the closure of the gorge has hurt them. He said they were targeting the World Rally Championship to increase visitors to the park that is located 25km from Naivasha town. “We have seen a drop in revenue and visitors and we hope this will change once its reopened,” he said. Maasai community leader Jackson ole Senchu said due to the closure of the gorge, close to 80 tour guides and traders had lost their jobs. He, however, said the community fully supported the ongoing safety measures adding that the death of the seven had left them shaken. “Among those who lost their jobs were men and women involved in selling traditional wares to tourists," he said.
