It is 25 years in jail for a man found guilty of robbery with violence. Makadara chief magistrate Heston Nyaga found Joseph Ombati guilty of robbing Anthony Kinuthia of his  Toyota Wish vehicle valued at Sh1.2 million, Sh 4,600 and a mobile phone worth Sh18,000. He committed the offence on June 1, 2015, alongside Arthur Mungai, who is now deceased, and others who were not before court. Ombati was, however, acquitted of a gang-rape charge. “In my opinion, the accused person needs to be sentenced for retribution. Additionally, this also needs to go out as a warning to his accomplices and generally other members of the public who engage in such unlawful activities,” Nyaga said. His sentence starts on June 10, 2015, when he was put in custody. Ombati had pleaded not guilty but the prosecution presented seven witnesses to prove its case. The court heard that on the material day at about 5:30pm, Kinuthia had gone to drop a friend when they were accosted by armed thugs. They handcuffed him and forced him on the back seat of the car. They took his phone, wallet and belt as Mungai took control of the car and drove towards Kangundo Road. Ombati then ordered him to give his M-Pesa pin. Kinuthia and his friend were later left with four of the gunmen as Ombati drove off with Mungai. The two were led to a bushy area where Kinuthia was ordered to stand in the middle of a raging river as his friend was led several meters away. She was also robbed of her mobile phone worth Sh32,000, Sh 780 before she was gang-raped by two men. They were later released and ordered to walk towards a certain direction. After walking for some while, they sought help to call the police and reported the matter. Ombati and Mungai were later arrested in possession of the car.
