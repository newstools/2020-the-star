A longstanding legal battle pitting health workers in Kisumu against the county government has been referred for mediation. The Employment and Labour Relations Court in Kisumu on Monday gave the Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentist Union and Kisumu county two weeks to resolve the matter out of court. The KMPDU, through Nyanza branch secretary Lameck Omweri, had accused Governor Anyang' Nyong'o's administration of lacking the commitment to implement the collective bargaining agreement that was signed last year. The CBA ended a doctors strike that started on September 11. On Monday, KMPDU national secretary general Ouma Oluga, alongside other unionists, appeared in court and accused the county, through their lawyer, of failing to respond to some grievances raised in 2016. Judge Justice Nderi Nduma ordered the county secretary to appear in court with an agreement report. The case will be mentioned on March 16. About 1,900 health workers had demanded clearance of salary arrears, immediate remittance of deductions not submitted to relevant agencies, backdated promotions to rightful job groups, comprehensive National Health Insurance Fund cover and release of all doctors qualified for study leave. A statement on October 4 by the union expressed their dissatisfaction with the county, accusing it of ignoring their demands. "As at now, there is no money in the worker's accounts. We, thus, advise the workers to stay away from workplaces until all salaries are paid," the statement read. However, this tune changed a week later, with county spokesperson Aloice Ager confirming that all dues had been paid. "The workers should consult their banks," he said. The medics ended their strike. "A decision has been reached that the current strike is suspended and members are advised to return to work at 8 am on Wednesday, October 16," said a union statement that ordered members to resume duty.
