Parliament is currently considering a tea Bill to end the woes facing farmers countrywide, ANC nominated MP Godfrey Osotsi said. The Bill aims to root out cartels who have dominated the subsector at the expense of farmers. The motion was introduced in the House by Kericho Senator Aoron Cheruyoit. The motion comes after the county assembly of Vihiga passed a similar motion to protect tea farmers. Assembly agricultural committee chair Peter Alukutsa said tea was the only cash crop in Vihiga. "Therefore, there is an urgent need for the country to develop proper laws that will protect it from jungle business people who will cripple it as they did to the cane sector," he said. Osotsi told the Star KTDA should be restructured to effectively serve tea farmers. He accused the agency of massive corruption arising from conflict of interest among its directors and managers countrywide. He added that mismanagement of factories affiliated to KTDA had contributed heavily to the decline of the tea subsector in the country leaving farmers groaning  in poverty. Some farmers have resorted to uprooting their bushes citing poor income. “The tea subsector is already in its death bed. We need to establish a reserve fund to ensure minimum guaranteed returns for farmers who suffer from low bonuses,” the lawmaker said on phone. He said there was a need to eliminate corruption at tea buying centers where clerks interfere with weighing scales to benefit brokers. He urged the government to liaise with other top tea producers to regulate the supply of the crop in the world market to achieve better export prices and benefit farmers. Osotsi urged the agriculture committee of the National Assembly to come up with regulations that will eliminate cartels in the tea industry.
