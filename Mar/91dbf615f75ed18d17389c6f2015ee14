Kakamega Homeboyz players will be forced to forfeit half of their monthly salaries in line with the club’s pay-cut plans from next month. Homeboyz chairman Cleophas Shimanyula announced that the club had opted to revise their remuneration program thanks to the coronavirus pandemic which has halted sporting activities in the country and beyond. Shimanyula revealed that both the management and the players gave the decision a clean bill of health. He, however, said that the players will receive their March salaries in full. Homeboyz are the first club plying their trade in the Kenyan Premier League to effect a pay-cut on their players “We will pay their March salaries in full but from next month, they will be receiving half of it. It was a tough decision to make considering that they are not benefiting from the allowances we give them while on duty. They are inactive at the moment and it a decision we arrived at after having a word with them. The pandemic has wreaked havoc not only to players but to businesses but we remain optimistic that the dust will settle soon. Once normalcy returns, they will continue earning their full salaries,” he said While the players will be the most hit by the decision, the club’s supportive staff will be pocketing their full salaries according to Shimanyula. However, they will not be spared in case the country plunges into total lockdown. “Our support staff, who report to work daily,  will still earn their salaries in full. We have more than 700 staff operating our matatu business and will not be affected by the pay cut unless we head to a total lockdown,” added the businessman.
