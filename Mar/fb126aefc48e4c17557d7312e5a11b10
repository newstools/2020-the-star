A suspected fraudster who has been conning Kenyans by impersonating Vihiga Governor Wilber Ottichilo on social media has been arrested with over Sh150,000. Ambrose Mutinda's latest M-Pesa balance shows he collected over Sh150,000 from members of the public using the governor's fake accounts. Mutinda told detectives he had been using the governor’s prominence to obtain money from the public. Vihiga county commissioner Ochillo Oyugi said Mutinda, who has been fleecing vulnerable Kenyans in the guise of 'Ottichilo Loans', was arrested on Monday in Machakos county by detectives from Vihiga. Oyugi told the Star Mutinda was a water vendor in Masii and was nabbed a few minutes after withdrawing money from a nearby M-Pesa shop. “Detectives in Vihiga have been tracing him for months but the suspect was also playing smart," he said. Last December 12, Governor Ottichilo had raised a concern that individuals were using his fake social media platforms to rob vulnerable members of the county. “The county government of Vihiga treats cases of mistreatment, extortion and exploitation of its public with a lot of seriousness," he said.
