Malkia Strikers team manager Alfred Chedotum envisages a bright future for volleyball in the country if of the Kenya Volleyball Federation is anything to go by. Subject to availability of funds, the federation is set to hold regional training camps for the under 20 and under 18 players, boys and girls, over the April holidays. Chedotum said the players, mostly from high school, have already been identified.Â  18 players from each category drawn from all the regions will undergo rigorous training and thereafter act as a feeder program for the various league clubs and eventually, the national teams. He said as much as attention is currently on preparations for the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games, despite the coronavirus threat, the next course of action is ensuring Kenya has a talent pool to depend on in the near future. According to Chedotum, only a few schools offer sports scholarships with Cheptil and St. Augustine's Secondary schools in the Rift Valley leading the way. However, Lugulu, Bishop Sulumeti, Kwanthanze and Cheptil have produced players to clubs and the national teams in the past. The official believes the establishment of youth volleyball will be a major boost, especially to the men's national team, which continue to fair dismally at both the continental and international levels. "We have a program for the junior sides this holiday. They will undergo thorough training regionally. It is a project we believe will be deep-rooted. The Under 20 structures will bring cohesion and continuity to make Kenya world-beaters. However, as a federation, we lack the assets. There are no public gymnasia while the YMCA Shauri Moyo facility is small and congested." "The under 18 beach games previously was purely for schools and the two boys from Namwela and Lelmokwo won gold for us. The girls though did not perform well but all is not lost. The early signs are encouraging and the federation endeavours to support the growth of the sport."
