Ford Kenya party leader Moses Wetang’ula has urged the government to cushion Kenyan traders from the devastations of coronavirus. Wetang’ula said the virus has hurt businesses that rely on exported or imported products following the cancellation of many flights globally. "Most traders in Kenya do not shop online. They have to literally travel to Asian countries like China, and with the virus, they have been forced to halt their business, hence [the need for] government intervention," he told the media. The Bungoma senator cautioned that most traders could face bankruptcy and their businesses could collapse if no measures are put in place to protect them. "I'm asking President Uhuru Kenyatta, as the country goes to the next budget cycle, to take austerity measures to cushion traders from possible collapse and bankruptcy," he said. He noted that people are afraid of travelling, international meetings and events have been cancelled and airlines grounded. Wetang'ula appealed to the government to set aside a substantial amount of money to cushion small-scale traders and some crucial companies that depend on Chinese products. He said Kenya Airways, which has routes and stopovers in the Eastern part of the world in countries such as Bangkok and China, could lay off many staffers if not protected. (Edited by F'Orieny)
