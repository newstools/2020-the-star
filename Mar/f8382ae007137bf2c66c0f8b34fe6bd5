The Rugby Africa competition has been postponed due to the coronavirus outbreak. Kenya Simbas, who finished runners up to Zimbabwe last year, were due to open their campaign against Morocco on May 30. A 40-man provisional side named by coach Paul Odera started training early this month in readiness for the event. The Kenya Lionesses were due to face Madagascar as a curtain-raiser for the match. "The Executive Committee has taken this decision based on the recommendations from the Medical Committee and in consultation with World Rugby," read a statement in part.  The decision will be reviewed in a month’s time at the next Executive Committee Meeting. Last week, Rugby Africa postponed the season’s kick-off tournament, the U20 Barthés Trophy which was due April 19 in Nairobi. Rugby Africa had already taken extensive precautions for its staff in the past week by banning international travel. Rugby Africa President Khaled Babbou stated: “In light of the on-going Coronavirus epidemic, the health of players, fans, officials, staff and volunteers are our top priority. This is an unprecedented and uncertain situation which is evolving fast. Therefore, we will put our calendar on hold until we have a clearer overview of the situation in Africa." He added: "We see it as our responsibility as a governing sports body to show good citizenship and lead by example to undertake any necessary steps to support the health guidelines and authorities. All of our daily lives are affected by drastic changes, but we must act responsibly. Each of us at our own level must do our part to eradicate the spread of this virus,” he added
