K24’s Betty Kyallo is counting losses after she was forced by the Covid-19 pandemic to close her salon, Flair. The posh beauty parlour located in Kilimani was closed on Monday after Health CS Mutahi Kagwe directed that people stay home and observe social distancing. This is to curb the spread of the coronavirus. Betty informed her fans and clients of the decision by posting a notice. She further said, “I have decided to suspend services at Flair and it is because I completely understand the danger we all are in and I appreciate that we all have a responsibility, as much as we are all going be affected. I cannot even imagine how it will be without opening the salon.” She also highlighted the importance of isolation in reducing the spread of Covid-19. The screen siren said, “There is a bigger responsibility, we need to look at and appreciate the clients. We hope this thing goes away soon. But most importantly, we should stay safe. Stay at home.” She continued, “Do the right thing. It is rough. This thing is bigger than us. We need our health. It is bigger than the money we can get from our businesses.” Betty and all the private corporations in Kenya have one prayer to the government. “I hope the government is going to support businesses and people who rely on day-to-day casual jobs to make a living,” she said. "I pray they can look into this like other countries have done because it is important not to forget that people make a living every day. They make money every day 500 bob, 200 bobs, 1,000 bob to feed their family." She hoped the government is also going to consider that traders are not making any money, so there is no money to pay rent and tax. "Therefore, I pray there is a bigger plan by the government to help businesses and also help the people who rely on day-to-day movement to make a living. They need to think about us more than ever. Right now.”
