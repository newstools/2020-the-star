A senior al Shabaab commander who coordinated Lamu's Manda Bay attack on January 5 has been killed in an American military airstrike, according to VoA. VoA quoted US Africa Command (Africom) spokesman Chris Karns confirming that Bashir Mohamed Mahamoud, alias Bashir Qoorgaab, was killed in the February 22 airstrike along with his wife. The precision strikes occurred at Saakow, Middle Jubba region town. The militant was known as one of al Shabaab's most battle-hardened commanders, who led three of its units. He was in charge of planning and directing attacks along the Lamu county border. The US had placed a Sh500 million bounty on his head, the second-highest after the Sh600 million placed for the terror group's leader, Ahmed Diriye Abu Ubaidah. The Africom spokesman told VoA that Bashir commanded three al Shabaab units, "two of which are in Kenya, including the notorious Jaysh Ayman unit in the area of Manda Bay". Manda Bay hosts a Kenyan military base used by US forces. Bashir is believed to have been in charge of the Islamist group's Manda Bay attack that claimed the life of a US soldier and two military contractors. The militants also destroyed six aircraft. “This is progress,” Karns told VoA, adding that “removal of threats, like this terrorist, makes Africans and Americans a bit safer and sends a strong message to a common enemy whose ambition is to export violence and do serious harm to African partners, Americans, and international partners.” Africom has carried out 24 attacks against al Shabaab this year, VoA said.
