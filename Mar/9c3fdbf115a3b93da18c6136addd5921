City Hall has announced a plan to waive all mortuary fees for the next seven days. County Executive for Health Hitan Majevdia on Tuesday said members of the public have until March 31 to collect the bodies of their loved ones. He said this includes bodies that are at City Mortuary, Mbagathi and any other hospital managed by the county. He said those collecting the bodies will not be charged irrespective of any penalties and other charges that they might have been expected to pay. "We are aware that there are some bodies that have court cases. Those are the only bodies we expect to remain in the facilities for preservation. For the others, we want to tell members of the public that they have until March 31 which is exactly seven days from now to collect the bodies,” he said. Majevdia said the county will be compelled to dispose bodies which will not have been claimed through legal means. He said the move is part of City Hall’s efforts to prevent the spread of the Covid-19 virus. He said collection of the bodies will be restricted to immediate family members in accordance with the directive on social distancing. Majevdia said they will continue to monitor gatherings in funerals to ensure crowding is minimised within public burial sites. So far the county is in the process of fumigating public places including open-air markets and bus stops. Gikomba, City Market and Muthurwa are among the markets that have been fumigated. The CEC said City Inspectorate officers are closely monitoring city bars and restaurants to ensure they comply with the directive to only offer take away services.
