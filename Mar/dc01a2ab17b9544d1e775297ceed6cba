Embakasi East MP Paul Ongili alias Babu Owino is in court seeking to stop his arrest and prosecution over a complaint made against him in 2015. The complaint was filed by Bernard Ogijo at Kileleshwa and Central police stations on February 2, 2015. However, he does not disclose in his suit papers particulars of the complaint against him. The MP says Ogijo withdrew the complaint without any intervention and attempts to revive the same would be in bad faith and calculated to malign him. Following his recent prosecution over a shooting at a city club, he says, Ogijo has revived the complaint and is using police to harass him. He says that's malicious and the court should intervene and stop his arrest pending the hearing of his application “The pressure to have the applicant prosecuted in the backdrop of the withdrawal and extortionist demands are clearly malicious abuse of the criminal justice system which should not only be frowned upon but also curtailed at the earliest instance,” Owino says. The MP complains that Ogijo has been writing to various state agencies demanding his arrest and prosecution. Owino is already facing attempted murder charge which was preferred against him on January 20. He denied the attempted murder of Felix Odhiambo commonly known as DJ Evolve at B-club in Nairobi. He has also been charged with behaving in a disorderly manner while carrying a firearm. The MP is said to have become disorderly while carrying a pistol and firing one round of ammunition intending to kill the DJ. He is out on bail. Edited by Henry Makori
