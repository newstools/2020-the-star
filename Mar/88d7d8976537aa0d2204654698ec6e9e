Engineer Rashid Salim, the general manager for engineering services at KPA, is now the acting MD at the parastalal. A day-long board meeting on Friday chaired by KPA board chairman Joseph Kibwana and attended by the transport PS, Solomon Kitungu, and other board members resolved to have Salim appointed in an acting capacity. Salim, who was appointed at KPA on September 1, 1982, as a marine engineer trainee, has risen through the ranks and was the head of marine engineering before his appointment as GM. The meeting which begun early morning hours, went up to past 6pm. Kibwana confirmed to the Star that Salim is now the acting MD but they shall advertise the position as soon as possible so that they appoint a substantive MD. "We have just come from the board meeting, he is a long-serving member at KPA, he has 38 years of experience and knows his job," said Kibwana. This follows the resignation of embattled KPA MD Daniel Manduku through a letter to Transport CS James Macharia, on Thursday. Manduku was facing several graft charges but was yet to be charged in a court of law.
