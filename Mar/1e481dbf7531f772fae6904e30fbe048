The Communication Authority of Kenya on Wednesday launched the 2020 Kuza Awards, which will be the fourth edition of the annual event. The awards seek to recognise excellence in broadcasting in Kenya. “The theme for the Kuza Awards 2020 is Preserving Our Heritage through broadcasting: Kenya a heritage of splendour,” said CA Director General, Mercy Wanjau during the launch. The Kuza Awards are broadly categorized into the regulatory award, people’s choice award and patriotic award. Through the People’s Choice Awards, audiences will participate and vote, at no cost, for their preferred station via mobile SMS survey shortcode 15601 at a date to be communicated. Two categories were also introduced to the awards, namely copyright and patriotism. The Copyright Award category will fete broadcasters adhering to copyright obligations as provided for in their license conditions. “Only media houses that have complied with industry regulations or requirements such as copyright and royalties will be recognized,” Wanjau said. The awards seek to continue promoting consumer feedback and audience participation in recognizing broadcasters who have demonstrated excellence in their broadcasts.
