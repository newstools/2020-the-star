National Assembly Minority Leader John Mbadi was booed by a section of leaders and mourners when he tried to accuse the Office of Deputy President of corruption and several other criminality acts. Mbadi had said that Deputy President William Ruto's office is hosting criminals. "It's such shame for the second-highest position in Kenya to hide criminals," he said. The Suba South MP said that the office is entitled to be served with dignity and honour as per the Constitution. On hearing the remarks, a section of the leaders ordered him to stop as the crowd booed. Vanga MCA Yusuph Mbwana had proceeded to physically stop Mbadi but the other leaders intervened. Mbwana said the MP was disrespecting Dori's family. "We are here to bury our friend not condemning each other, " he said. Governor Salim Mvurya said burial areas were not conducive places for politics. He condemned the act and advised his colleagues to practice politics in other time. "We have come for burial then let's concentrate on it," said Mvurya. His Kilifi counterpart Amason Kingi also warned leaders against practising politics. He said Dori and his family had a right to be respected.
