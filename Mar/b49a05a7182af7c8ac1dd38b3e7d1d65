Coronavirus is not China virus,Â Chinese ambassador to Kenya Wu Peng has said. Speaking to CGTN news on Tuesday, envoy Wu said coronavirus was not a 'China disease'. The disease has so far killed over 3200 peopled with over 90,000 confirmed cases globally. "Coronavirus is not China virus, just as Ebola is not an Africa virus. Virus do not respect nation, and religion," he said. "Discrimination and prejudice at this crucial time can only do harm to the global battle." Wu said the outbreak has greatly affected the Chinese economy but is optimistic that it will be stronger than before once the outbreak is over. "I believe the strong resilience and potential of the Chinese economy cannot be underestimated," Ambassador Wu said. The ambassador said Africa will be largely affected if China takes a longer time to resume its production. "If China does not resume production as early as possible, I think definitely Africa's economy can be affected," he said. China remains the most hit country by the virus since it was reported first in its Wuhan province in December 2019. Kenya Airways suspended its flights to China due to the virus. Six countries have confirmed the virus in Africa. These include Morocco, Algeria, Nigeria, Tunisia, Egypt and Senegal.
