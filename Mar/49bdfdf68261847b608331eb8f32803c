A few minutes to 7pm on Friday, all shops in Mwingi town were closed as the president’s curfew directive came into force. Only dogs and donkeys would be seen on the streets as everyone retreated to their homes. The Thika-Garissa highway in Mwingi, which is the stopover for passengers travelling to and from Nairobi, was also clear. However, boda boda rider Mutemi Musili said the curfew will lead to high levels of poverty. “We normally close our businesses at 11pm but we are forced to go home before 7pm with the little we make during the day," he said. The rider also said since Covid -19 was announced in Kenya, business has not been the same as most people stay home. “We hope this pandemic ends soon so  we can go back to our businesses without any limitations." The boda operator said the curfew will not help curb the spread of the pandemic. “The rush and confusion caused by this Covid-19 curfew might cause more cases as people are rushing to avoid the police and end up forgetting to maintain social distance or other preventive measures." Hotel owner Mwangangi Kitoo closed his hotel, which used to operate 24-7s,  at 6pm ahead of the curfew. “I had to close early to enable my workers to go home in time and not to be caught at the wrong side of the law," he said.
