Gor Mahia have once again secured the Mashemeji Derby bragging rights after beating AFC Leopards 1-0 at the Moi Stadium, Kasarani. Boniface Omondi netted the sole goal in the first half in a match attended by President Uhuru Kenyatta. Leopards were on the prowl from the onset, pressing Gor into their own half but could not find their way past the watertight defence. National U-20 playmaker Austin Odhiambo was a thorn in the flesh of Gor defence with his terrific runs which saw the duo of Geoffrey Ochieng and Jackson Owusu keep close tabs on him. Leopards paid the price of flapping clear cut chances when Omondi netted the opener in the 27th minute after the defence failed to clear Clifton Mihesoâ€™s corner kick. The goal proved the turning point for Gor, who managed to squeeze a handful of shots but Benjamin Ochan was equal to the task between the posts. Leopards introduced Boniface Mukhekhe for Jaffari Owiti after the restart while Gor responded by bringing in Samuel Onyango for Miheso a few minutes later. The impact of the fresh legs was evident as both teams stepped up their build-ups with Leopards registering more shots on target. Elvis Rupia would have restored parity for Leopards in the 70th minute after being put through by Odhiambo but the former Nzoia Sugarman who had the goalkeeper to beat shot wide. Minutes later, Francis Manoah watched his long-range sway inches off the target as Ingwe pressed the gas pedal in search for an equaliser. Sensing danger, Gor threw in Juma Balinya for the weary Nicholas Kipkirui and would later summon the Defence minded Ernest Wendo for the Omondi. Gor nearly doubled the lead in the 81st minute through Balinya but his shot was blocked by Collins Shivachi, who had retreated to the goal line after Ochan had advanced to block the initial shot by Lawrence Juma.
