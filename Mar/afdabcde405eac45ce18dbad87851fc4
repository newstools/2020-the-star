The government has been urged to reduce fuel prices to help cushion citizens from rising fares. Kenya Boda boda,Tuk-tuk and Taxi Workers Union secretary general Cynthia Wanyonyi said owners of public service vehicles have been forced to increase fares as they are required to carry half the number of passengers they used to. The increase in fares is also due to the extra money needed to buy hand sanitisers and soap for passengers. Wanyonyi said if fuel prices are not reduced then Kenyans will continue to suffer as they will be forced to pay high fares. "I would request the government to reduce fuel prices. If they do it will reduce the load carried by the ordinary mwananchi," she said on the phone. In Mombasa, for instance, residents are now paying Sh50 in routes where they paid Sh30 before the new social distancing regulations. Matatu saccos have already introduced new fare lists. "This is a temporary fare list to all matatus due to coronavirus. Make sure the matatus carry eight passengers only and should not carry any cargo. Make sure you keep your matatu clean and safe," a statement by one sacco reads. Wanyonyi said most bada boda operators have not yet complied with the directive to provide hand sanitiser. "The few boda boda operators I have spoken to say that they cannot afford the hand sanitisers. You will get a 500ml bottle goes for Sh800, a boda boda rider cannot afford that," she said.
