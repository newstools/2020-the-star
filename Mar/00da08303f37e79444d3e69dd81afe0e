The Ministry of Education will prepare a national database for all students who have graduated from Technical Training Institutions by June. Chief Administrative Secretary Zachary Kinuthia on Saturday said details of the graduates will be supplied to the ministry by their principals. The details will include their names, courses done, addresses, phone numbers and others. “We will keep the details as the President continues to negotiate with the world for export of labour, we can get people with the required skills with ease,” he said in Nyeri town. He said earlier, President Uhuru Kenyatta had negotiated with Canada and Romania and agreed to have artisans work there. The country received an offer to export 6,000 workers but could only manage to get 2,000 artisans. Kenya has a shortage of skilled people who are in high demand in other countries, Kinuthia said. He said this is why the government has provided incentives to ensure students who don't join colleges and universities join TTIs. The institutions charge a maximum of Sh56,400 following a government directive. “Any other technical institute charging beyond that is engaging in a criminal enterprise." The government has been paying Sh30,000 for any student who enrols in a TTI while the Higher Education Loans Board covers the deficit and provides upkeep. The loans board gives the learners as much as  to Sh 40,000. The CAS spoke at Dedan Kimathi University during the closing of a two-day Drama and Film Festivalon Friday and Saturday. Over 40 training institutions from Mt Kenya region participated in the festivals including national polytechnics, Vocational Training Centers, private colleges and TTIs. Edited by R.Wamochie
