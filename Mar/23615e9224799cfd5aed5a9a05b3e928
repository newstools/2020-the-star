Saumu said she is grateful to God for all his blessings. "The day I became a mother was the most magical in my life. My princess, your birthday will always be a very special day to me. On this day, I wish that every day of our lives brings new happiness for you.  Have a wonderful birthday, my baby doll mama loves you always," she said. "Happy Women’s day to all the beauty out there. Keep shining.” Saumu announced she was pregnant through her Instagram page when reminiscing how she spent her Valentine’s Day. She told  Word Is earlier that Anwar is happy and excited about the pregnancy.  The two were best friends before they officially started dating. They first met in Mombasa while Saumu was on holiday and Senator Anwar was there for work. They then became friends and later close confidants as Anwar encouraged her to start some development and empowerment projects. “I appreciate him because he’s my support system. He always advises me not to entertain negativity,” Saumu said. Saumu was earlier on dating Ben Gatu but separated after he became violent.
