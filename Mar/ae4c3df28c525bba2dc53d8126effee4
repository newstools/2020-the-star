Former Anglican Church of Kenya Katakwa diocese Bishop Zacchaeus Epusi has been quarantined. The cleric is said to have arrived in the country on Saturday from London. The UK where Epusi had travelled by Tuesday had recorded 335 coronavirus deaths, with 6,650 infections. Busia county medical services director Janerose Ambuchi confirmed the cleric’s quarantine. “Our health officials have examined him. If he tests positive he will be put under treatment. We expect to send samples to the Kenya Medical Research Institute for further analysis,” she said on the phone. Epusi is said to have attended a church service at the ACK church in Amagoro on Sunday. The government at the time the first case of coronavirus was reported in Kenya, directed that all Kenyans who had travelled out of the country be isolated and examined before being allowed to interact with members of the public. On March 13, the government banned all social gatherings, including church and mosque prayers. Health CS Mutahi Kagwe said all inter-school events and conferences be called off with immediate effect. But despite the order, some churches conducted service on Sunday although some maintained that their members observed social distancing. A person is supposed to be one metre away from another. Ambuchi said the decision to quarantine the cleric should not send panic among Busia county residents, saying they were follow Health Ministry guidelines. “Coronavirus can be controlled. People need to wash their hands with clean water and soap. They should avoid social gatherings and anyone with signs associated with the disease should seek medical attention,” she said. Kocholya Level 4 Hospital head Brian Matsisa said five medical personnel had been assigned to examine the cleric. He called on members of the public to strictly observe health guidelines to avoid being infected. Edited by Henry Makori
