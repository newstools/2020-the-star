Kakamega hospitals will waive mortuary bills so families can pick bodies of their loved ones and bury them as quickly as possible. Governor Wycliffe Oparanya said the move was part of new measures to allow hospitals to put up isolation wards in preparation for the coronavirus outbreak. He said the county was working to put up the wards in all its 13 subcounty hospitals. The governor said Kakamega hospitals will waive mortuary bills so families can pick bodies of their loved ones and bury them as quickly as possible. Families with bodies of loved ones in the mortuaries have been asked to pick them up. "We are not going to take any body to our mortuaries," Oparanya said in an address at the county headquarters on Monday. He said the county government will instead facilitate the affected families to dispose of bodies as quickly as possible. All the ECD Centres and polytechnics will be closed, the governor said. The governor urged all businesses and all offices within the county to have proper handwashing places. He said he will engage religious leaders on the way forward regarding Sunday services and the measures that need to be in place to ensure everyone is not exposed to danger. All open market centres in the county have also been closed with immediate effect. Oparanya also directed matatu operators to ensure they have sanitisers in their vehicles.
