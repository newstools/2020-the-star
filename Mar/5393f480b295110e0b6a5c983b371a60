Lamu ward representatives will move into their new Sh214 million county assembly building by July. The facility is in Mokowe town on the mainland.  All the MCAs will be accommodated as well as the public interested in the proceedings. The construction started in 2016. The older assembly located on Lamu island is smaller, stuffy and does not have a  public gallery. Assembly clerk Wanyoike Mboche said the new building is specially designed to accommodate the 32 MCAs. The public gallery will hold more than 100 people. The facility has 32 offices for the MCAs. “All we are doing now is furnishing, equipping and planting flowers. By May we should be done so that the MCAs occupy it before the end of July,” Mboche said. At the old building, MCAs had to park their vehicles on the mainland and cross over to Lamu Island on boats. Vehicles are banned in the Lamu Old Town which is a Unesco world heritage site. The new assembly has ample parking space. Deputy Speaker Paul Kimani said the limited space and stuffiness at the old assembly hindered effective service delivery. The MCAs said the location of the new building will save them the expenses of shuttling to and from the island to attend sessions. Majority of the MCAs come from mainland Mpeketoni, Witu, Mokowe and Hindi. They commute daily. Edited by R.Wamochie
