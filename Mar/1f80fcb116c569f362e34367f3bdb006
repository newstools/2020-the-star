Kenya Handball Federation defending champions Nairobi Water are banking on their experience to retain the national league title. The team, however, has its work cut out according to coach Jack Habert. Water top the log with 16 points from eight matches. Both National Cereals and Produce Board and Kenya Defence Forces, famously known as Ulinzi Sharks, are only two points behind, leaving the tactician worried. Nairobi Water are the 2018 East and Central Africa champions and contribute the bulk of the national team. The coach admitted that the pressure is real with six games left, largely due to the rich vein of form that NCPB and Sharks are enjoying. Habert said the team needs to challenge themselves by training harder so as to maintain their unbeaten status with the view to keep the title, adding that experience will be key. "To be honest, we feel the pressure as a team. Cereals and KDF have performed beyond expectations this season but we are not concerned. We knew it will be a strenuous task but we want to slow down the pressure by assuming we are competing amongst ourselves," noted the tactician. "We have been in this situation previously and hopefully the experience will work in our favour. The intention is to collect maximum points and experience will only be meaningful to the team if they can rise above all odds against us. "
