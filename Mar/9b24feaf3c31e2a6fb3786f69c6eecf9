The BBI wave has captured most parts of the country attracting both praise and criticism in equal measure. Deputy President William Ruto is BBI's biggest detractor despite his boss President Uhuru Kenyatta being the initiator with his handshake buddy ODM leader Raila Odinga. This makes the DP is an enemy from the inside. The BBI caravan has branded their progression 'Nobody can stop reggae'. Then there comes the DP to discredit the phrase with claims of Kenya being a sober country that does not associate itself with reggae music and bhang. Politically, this was a big shot at the opponents but reggae fans feel disregarded by someone who wants to lead the country in the future. Ruto missed a mark with that remark in an attempt to hit at Raila and his BBI caravan. As much as we would not appreciate a leader who sits on the fence, the DP should have made a less personal remark. Maseno University
