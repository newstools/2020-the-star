Three people who arrived in the country from Europe at the weekend have self-isolated for 14 days in Nandi county. Europe has been hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic. A senior official at the Nandi government who requested not to be named said the three had not shown any signs of sickness but had decided to isolate themselves. “They landed from Europe and because of the widespread public appeal, they opted for self-quarantine in the village,” the official said. President Uhuru Kenyatta on Sunday announced three cases of coronavirus had been confirmed. Meanwhile, open air markets were ordered closed.  Governor Stephen Sang said open air markets are high-risk areas for the spread of the virus. He further said the county government had two ambulances on standby to evacuate any suspected cases of coronavirus. Deputy President William Ruto on Friday commissioned 10 new ambulances. Of that number, two were allocated to handle suspected coronavirus cases. Two hospitals - Kapsabet County Referral Hospital and Nandi Hills Subcounty Hospital – have set aside units to handle coronavirus patients. Health executive Ruth Koech said health workers have been trained on how to handle coronavirus emergencies. Edited by A. Ndung'u
