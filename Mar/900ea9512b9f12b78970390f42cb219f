Interior PS Karanja Kibicho has directed chiefs and their assistants to ensure there are no weddings and birthday parties as the country moves to contain spread of Covid-19. Addressing the media on Sunday, Kibicho said disco matangas should also be suspended. "Administration officers are hereby directed to ensure that there will be no gatherings in churches, mosques and if the order is defied arrests will be made," he said. "Weddings and merry go rounds will also not be allowed. Funerals should be attended by people not exceeding 15. Failure to ensure compliance will attract strict disciplinary measures." Health CS Mutahi Kagwe said police will conduct patrols to ensure that measures are put in place. "We cannot have a policeman for every person. This is where citizen responsibility is key to the success of this," he said. Kenya has eight new cases of Covid-19. This brings the total cases to 15. "All the eight came through JKIA between March 4 and 17. They have been isolated at various facilities," Kagwe said on Sunday.
