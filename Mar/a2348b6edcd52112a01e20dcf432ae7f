Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua has banned boda bodas and tuk tuks in a bid to contain the spread of coronavirus in the county. "No Boda Bodas, Maruti or Tuktuks will be allowed to operate for the next two weeks. Social distance cannot be achieved while still riding," he said. "Social distancing is critical if we are to avoid infection. There is no way a bodaboda rider is safe from being infected by a sick passenger and thereafter infecting hundreds." Via Twitter on Monday, Mutua said that to compensate and cushion them for the prevailing situation he will waiver all tax charges for the rest of the calendar year (until December 31st, 2020). Mutua also banned Miraa dens, Muguka dens and pool playing areas. "No groupings of more than three people allowed anywhere. My staff to work in shifts. This is applicable to non-essential services," he said. "Chief officers to develop work shift schedules by end of today. No office meetings. All staff and departmental meetings to be conducted virtually, using the internet and social media." Mutua noted that all markets in Machakos will be sanitized and fumigated. "Market days have been banned to reduce movement from one town to another. Wananchi urged to be home and indoors by 7 pm every day," he said. To protect the elderly, Mutua said  Machakos residents above 65 years to restrict movement, stay home and avoid mixing with young people and children. He noted that the directives will be reviewed from time to time and maybe eased depending on the current National and county situation.
