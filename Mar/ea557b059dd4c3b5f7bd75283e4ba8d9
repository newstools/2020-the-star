Health CS Mutahi Kagwe has said Kenya is likely to be able to start manufacturing Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) materials from next week. He said the country is accumulating materials. "If we experience a shortage, it won't be because we didn't do everything we could," Kagwe said on Sunday during his daily briefing on the Covid-19 situation. He also said at least 1,000 more employees will be hired soon. Kagwe also said the World Bank has donated 250 ventilators. Trade PS Betty Maina said the government is working with the textile sector to start manufacturing PPE. There are four new cases of Covid-19, Kagwe has said.
