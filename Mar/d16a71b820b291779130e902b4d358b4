Wazito and National U23 Emerging Stars versatile midfielder Teddy Osok can't wait to make his return next month after recovering from a nasty knee injury. Osok went under the knife last year after tearing his meniscus. He, however, received good news recently after the medics gave him the green light to kick the ball from next month. The former Gor Mahia youth player, who made his national U20 Rising Stars debut in 2016, revealed that he had begun light training this month and it was just a matter of time before he joins the rest in training. Even as he inches closer to the pitch, Osok has his family and Wazito to thank for their support during his stay on the sideline. "The doctor cleared me to resume light training this month and I have been comfortably running. He assured me that I will be ready for selection from next month and I am looking forward to it." He added: "I have been 'loading' with the rest and I feel fit to play again. It has been tough from being wheeled to the theatre to point of healing and rehabilitation but I thank my family and Wazito for their support." In the meantime, Osok is not scared of the competition for playing time at Wazito. The league returnees boast of arguably the best crop of midfielders but Osok banks on his experience to get Stewart Hall's nod ahead of the rest. The former Sofapaka man will have to break a sweat in muscling out for a position with the trio of Anthony Njeru, David Oswe and Amos Asembeka who all play at his preferred role. "I have featured for big clubs in the country where I got playing time ahead of players deemed as big boys. I have played at the international level, thus I feel I have gained the experience to warrant me playing time at Wazito. I, however, have to prove it to the technical bench once I return," he said.
