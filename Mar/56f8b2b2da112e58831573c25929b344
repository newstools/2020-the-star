Nyandarua county commissioner Boaz Cherutich has warned persons holding fake allotment letters for colonial villages land that they will be prosecuted. Cherutich decried interference by grabbers in the planning, surveying and titling of the 27 colonial villages in the county. He asked the Directorate of Criminal Investigations to arrest and prosecute anyone who will show up with fake documents to claim the pieces of land. “The technical committee will be here on Tuesday, March 10 for a head count, and everyone has to stand next to their plot to be identified and his documents authenticated for title deeds to be issued,” he said. The county commissioner spoke during a public baraza at Gwa Kiongo town on Friday where he addressed issues raised by the allottees. He warned government officials against interfering with the exercise, noting that they risked prosecution and loss of their jobs. “These plots were issued to us in 1995 but the county officials then allocated the plots to their family members. Several interventions by the administrators then led to more problems and there are so many genuine people who have been left out of the list,” said one of the squatters James Kariuki. Another squatter, Josephine Muthoni, whose parent Samuel Kironji had received the largest share of the plots, decried missing names on the list of those to be issued with title deeds. “We have been here since birth. We are shocked that plot 164 is missing on the list. Did the President direct the committee to give us titles or grab our land?” she posed. County lands registrar Charles Ayienda warned residents against paying conmen for allotment and titling, saying the process was free and open for all.
