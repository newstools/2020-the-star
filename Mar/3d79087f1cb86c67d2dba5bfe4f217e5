The Kenya Revenue Authority has appealed to taxpayers to access its services through their online portal. The authority said the move is in line with its protective measures to contain the spread of the disease. In a statement to newsrooms, the taxman said this will minimize congestion at KRA Tax Service Offices. "All Domestic Taxes Services can be accessed through https://itax.kra.go.ke/KRA-Portal/ while Customs related services can be accessed through the Integrated Customs Management System (iCMS)," the statement read. KRA also encourages taxpayers to make all transactions through mobile money in order to avoid the risk of transmission through the physical handling of money. The Authority said it has installed hand sanitizers at all Tax Service Offices and will ensure that all premises are regularly cleaned and disinfected. The coronavirus has rapidly spread across the globe with cases soaring across 143 countries and claiming more than 6,500 lives in only four months.
