Ikolomani MP Bernard Shinali has denied he is under investigation by the DCI for receiving cash from Tullow Oil Company. A section of the media reported on Friday that Shinali, Turkana Governor Josephat Nanok and his West Pokot counterpart John Lunyangapwo and one Isaac Makimei Gitau were under investigation by the DCI for receiving Sh45 million from the oil company. But on Saturday, Shinali denied ever sharing cash with the three. The MP said he had never set foot in Turkana since he was born and termed the report hogwash. "I am not aware that I'm being investigated by the DCI over any corruption related case. I have called the DCI to find out what investigations were ongoing against me and he said he was equally unaware of any," the legislator told the Star on the phone. "I read political mischief in such reports and I want details of these allegations, failing which I will take legal action," the legislator said. "They should be telling me that gold miners have given me money if anything and not fuel. Some of us have spent a fortune to build our reputation and cannot allow anybody to play around with it." But Nanok on Sunday said he was entitled to transacting business like any other Kenyan and that he was not corrupt. He said he was aware of the EACC investigation. "While the law bars me from doing business with the county government due to conflict of interest, nothing prevents me from engaging in lawful private businesses with other companies," the governor said. Some of the transactions that investigative agencies are probing include how Tai Enterprises Limited, a construction company that has bagged hundreds of government tenders. The investigation also seeks to unearth if the county boss was given money paid to Tai Enterprises by Tullow Oil.
