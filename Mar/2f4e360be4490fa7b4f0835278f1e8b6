Strathmore University have been handed a boost after the return to training of two senior players. Rashid Ingwela and Kevin Obunga bring experience to the side as the students hope to go top of the table with a quartet of fixtures to play this weekend in the Kenya Handball Federation (KHF) men's league. The students take on Thika and the University of Nairobi Saturday before facing  Buccaneers and Mt. Kenya University Thika on Sunday. Strathmore have 26 points and are placed fifth. they will dislodge NCPB from top spot should they win all their matches. NCPB, who have 30 points, are not in action. Coach Peter Mwathi was confident of bagging maximum points but had his reservations over the  MKU and Buccaneers matches. "Of course we want to have a perfect weekend with total points but it will be tough against MKU and Buccaneers.  Buccaneers are former university students and when they meet their peer,  they will try to be resistant but we hope our game plan will work in our favour," said the tactician. "We have no injury concerns. It is good to have the duo back. Ingwela, a left-back, is a national team player and right back Obunga has his own qualities which will come in handy for the team." Elsewhere, UON play St.Paul's University SPU and Black Mamba as the Technical University of Kenya  TUK entertain Kenyatta University and MKU Thika. KU will also come up against Gunners and SPU. Generation and Administration Police will test themselves against SPU as well.
