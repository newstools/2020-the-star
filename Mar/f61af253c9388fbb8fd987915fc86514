Deputy President William Ruto said on Saturday that police must use firmness, civility and restraint in enforcing the curfew. He was responding to numerous images on social media of police beating, whipping, kicking, tear-gassing and abusing people who were still out after the curfew - and some before curfew. Some were trying to get home. Everyone must obey the curfew, the Deputy President said. "Law enforcers must at act firmly but with restraint and civility," he said on his Twitter account. He said the coronavirus pandemic is serious and therefore measures to curb it from spreading should be also taken seriously. “Fellow citizens, the corona pandemic is serious, very serious. The Government of Kenya curfew (partial lockdown) is meant to curtail movement so as to reduce spread of virus,” Ruto said. The DP's remarks come as pressure mounts on Interior CS Fred Matiang’i and Police IG Hilarry Mutyambai to rein in police excesses. The Law Society of Kenya asked the Interior CS to resign after viral videos and photos showed police using excessive force on people who were out during the curfew hours. Some were trying to get home but matatus had stopped running. The Kenya National Commission on Human Rights called for the immediate prosecution of all officers who violated human rights in enforcing the curfew. Police and GSU patrolled the streets to ensure people were in their houses from 7pm to 5am as directed by President Uhuru Kenyatta. People using the Likoni Ferry Crossing Channel were rounded up, roughed up and ordered to lie down. This violated the Ministry of Health directive to Kenyans to observe distancing in order to curb spread of the virus. (Edited by V. Graham)
