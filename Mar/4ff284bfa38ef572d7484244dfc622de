Narc Kenya party chairperson Martha Karua has called upon the government to introduce short-term measures focusing on the informal settlements as Kenya moves to contain the spread of coronavirus. “Government should come up with an urgent short-term plan to provide water and sanitation to the informal settlements,” Karua said. She said that the government should also come up with a viable plan for housing for the vulnerable. In a statement, Karua said the government should institute measures that will rescue the vulnerable groups in the society from hunger as well as those whose jobs have been affected by the measures in place. Karua said there is a need to have long term plans to rectify the effects that COVID-19 will have to the market. “We suggest that our market which no doubt provide essential services be decongested and re-open even if this entails temporarily re-location, provided with infrastructure for hygiene standards necessary,” Karua said. She has lauded the steps taken by the government to ensure that more Kenyans are not infected by the pandemic virus. Karua has urged the Interior Ministry and the office of the Inspector General of Police to to issue clear and equivocal guidelines to the police that all citizens are together in fighting COVID-19 and that they should not perceive them as their enemies. “We must all stand in solidarity with one another, supporting on another and treating one another with dignity and respect, in adherence to our laws in order to defeat our common enemy,” Narc K leader said. She also said the ministry of Agriculture to up its effort of eradicating the desert locusts which she said if not attended properly might have devastating consequences.
