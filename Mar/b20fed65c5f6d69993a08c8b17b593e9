Just why did the allies of President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga fail to declare their plan to impeach DP William Ruto when they addressed a press conference at Serena Hotel on Wednesday? Well, an MP who was aware of the plans disclosed that the legislators, drawn from NASA, Jubilee, ANC and Wiper parties, had planned to announce the date they would table an ouster motion against the DP. But moments to the press briefing, a call came from the house in the hill forcing the legislators to drop the plan and instead issue a warning to the country’s second in command to respect the President. A nominated female ODM MCA in a cosmopolitan county has been telling anyone and everyone who cares to listen how she has secured a nomination slot in the National Assembly in the next parliament. She has been bragging that she will leave the 'county assembly that does not much her education status. Those in the know say the MCA is a spouse of a senior ODM party official who is also said to have influenced her nomination to the county assembly in 2017. Sources disclosed that the official also nominated two of her relatives to two county assemblies in the coastal region. The recent return of some renegades to the ODM party seems to have sparked panic among some serving legislators in Nyanza region. An MP whose competitor returned to the outfit has suddenly pitched camped in his constituency after months of avoiding the area. The residents had taken to the social media accusing him of abandoning them despite voting for him overwhelmingly. But since his competitor made about-turn, he has been frequenting the constituency, spending long with his electorates and launching National Government Constituency Development- funded projects. Last weekend, he assured the constituents that he will be visiting them every weekend to monitor the progress of the implementation of the projects.
