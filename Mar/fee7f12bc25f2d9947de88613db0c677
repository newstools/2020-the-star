A form three student at Sigalame High School Busia County has died after he sustained a serious head injury during a Secondary School Term One games match on Friday. Eliakim Oundo, 17, was injured during a play-off match against Nambale Boys. Coach Lawrence Alando said the student, who was injured during a tackle, succumbed to the injury despite all efforts to save his life. “After we realised that the injury was serious, we got into the ambulance and rushed him to Busia County Referral Hospital. Here, the scans revealed that there was internal bleeding in the head and because they didn’t have the capacity to handle such, we were referred to Bungoma Life Care Hospital,” the coach said. In Bungoma, the coach confirmed that more tests were conducted and he was taken in the Intensive Care Unit (UCI). “The scans revealed that Oundo had more bleeding in the brain and because of that the hospital could not deal with the situation, we were asked to take him to Eldoret’s Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital (MTRH). But because of some logistical challenges, I had to go back to Busia to prepare on how he could be transferred to MTRH. Unfortunately, he succumbed at midnight,” Alando said.
