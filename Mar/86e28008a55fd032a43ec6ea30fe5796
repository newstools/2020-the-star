A 26-year-old boda boda rider was killed after being electrocuted by a high voltage cable in Nyali on Thursday night near Mbugoni police post. Nyali subcounty police commander Daniel  Masaba said the man died on the spot. The cable broke and hit a car before electrocuting the rider. “The body was taken to Coast General Hospital Mortuary waiting for a postmortem,” Masaba said. The body remained at the scene for over three hours before KPLC technicians disconnected power. Masaba said it was dangerous to remove the body until the technicians switched off the power. “The power cable remained on the body and it was raining. We could not touch him because the current was still flowing” Masaba said. Police are investigating the incident. In November a 46-year-old man was electrocuted in Likoni, Mombasa, while harvesting coconut.
