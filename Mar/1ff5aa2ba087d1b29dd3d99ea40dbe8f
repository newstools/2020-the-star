The Mavoko Water and Sewerage Company has received government backing in their tussle with Export Processing Zones Authority for the control of water supply in Mavoko. Eastern regional commissioner Isaiah Nakoru directed that Mavwasco takes over the management of water and sewerage services from EPZA. Nakoru said they had received complaints from Mavoko residents that there was water scarcity in the area. Residents have struggled to get clean water for almost a year after EPZA cut water supply to the region. Nakoru said the services should be supervised by Mavwasco as they look for a permanent solution. The two agencies have disagreed over the sewer line and water management despite a court ruling in favour of the EPZA. The directive by Nakoru was given after the agencies met on Thursday. “No resident should suffer for lack of water because of the struggle for power by the two agencies,” Nakoru said. EPZA will still supervise water supply within the zone while Mavwasco will handle the rest of Mavoko constituency. Nakoru also ordered that strict measures be taken against polluters of River Athi. Machakos county executive for Water and Sanitation Naomi Mutie said the two agencies will iron out their difference so Mavoko residents can access clean water. Mutie also warned residents against dumping into River Athi. Legal action will be taken against offenders, she said. Mavwasco managing director Michael Mangeli said that the company has already begun constructing its own sewer line in Mavoko. Mangeli said EPZA had no claim to ownership of the sewer line since it was constructed by the national government and the World Bank funds. But PZA board chairman Paul Gicheru said even though they had power from the court, they are ready to dialogue with Mavwasco officials. (edited by O. Owino)
