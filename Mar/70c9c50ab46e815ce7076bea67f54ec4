Boda boda rider who knocked down a pedestrian along John Osogo road on Friday got a reprieve after Makadara court freed him on a Sh 10,000 cash bail. Alvin Odhiambo is accused of knocking down Gladys Njeri on March 18 while riding dangerously in Dandora, Kamukunji subcounty. Njeri sustained injuries on both hands and she was rushed to Mama Lucy Hospital where she was treated and discharged. On Friday prosecutor David Kanyua sought to detain Odhiambo in police custody for 14 days pending investigations. In an affidavit, Kanyua told Makadara senior resident magistrate Lewis Gatheru that he needs time to trace the motorcycle as Odhiambo has hidden it. "Your honour, the respondent is a flight risk and if released, he might disappear. I am also yet to record the witness statement and filing the victim's p3 form," he said. Gatheru ordered the suspect to pay a cash bail of Sh10, 000. The magistrate said it was not necessary to detain Odhiambo for two weeks. The case will be mentioned on April 24.
