Kisii Deputy Governor Joash Maangi recorded a statement with police on Monday denying he had assaulted a maid at his Ogembo residence. Police summoned him after a complaint by two female maids, one filing a formal complaint with police in Kisii. She claimed Maangi injured her eye on Christmas Eve. The other maid is yet to file a report, county police commander Jebel Munene said. "We are aware they are two but only one has filed a complaint with us. We are still awaiting the other to come forward," he said. Speaking outside Kisii Central Police Station after recording aÂ  statement on the alleged assault, Maangi termed the accusation a "gross fabrication and a political witch-hunt by detractors who are bent bring me down". "This is all hogwash," the deputy governor said. Maangi was accompanied by lawyers Sylivanus Osro, Kerosi Ondieki, Philemon Ochwang and Gideon Nyambati. They all rejected the assault accusations.
