A glance at Nairobi, Mombasa and Kisumu's popular markets shows a worrying sight as they continue to choke in mountains of garbage and filth. The tonnes of garbage poses a serious health risk as some of the foodstuffs being loaded and unloaded as well as being displayed for sale are in dirty surroundings increasing the likelihood of a spread in diseases. Some of the markets with poor sanitation are Marikiti, Muthurwa, Kangemi, Kongowea and Kibuye.
