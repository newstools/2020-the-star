President Uhuru Kenyatta on Sunday led other leaders in participating in the fifth edition of the Beyond Zero half marathon. Uhuru and other dignitaries managed a 2.6km race before he was received by the First lady on the finish line. Uhuru dawned at the Nyayo National stadium in blue jeans and white t-shirt in the company of other politicians to support the First lady Margaret Kenyatta who is behind the drive. Nairobi governor Mike Sonko, his Machakos counterpart Alfred Mutua and Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka were present. Sports CS Amina Mohamed accompanied by Mutahi Kagwe-Health, Betty Maina-Trade and Education PS Belio Kipsang also participated. First lady Margaret Kenyatta did not, however, take part in the race. The event saw a heavy traffic snarl-up after several roads were closed. This included Mombasa road, Lusaka, Aerodrome, Bunyala, Haile Selassie, Kenyatta Avenue, University Way and Waiyaki Way. Statehouse said this yearâ€™s edition will continue to support the advocacy around nine critical health areas affecting Kenyans. "The intervention areas include zero maternal deaths, zero child deaths, a healthy lifestyle for the elderly, zero new HIV infections and zero child marriages," Statehouse wrote on its twitter page. Others are zero Female Genital Mutilation (FGM), early screening for cancer, inclusion of persons with disability and better nutrition for all children.
