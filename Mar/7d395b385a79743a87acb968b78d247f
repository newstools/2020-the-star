Team Kenya are eyeing an improved performance in the Euro/Africa zone Fed Cup e Group III slated for Lithuania in June. Kenya lost all its matches in Ulcinj, Montenegro last year, succumbing 3-0 to Morocco, Egypt and Ireland to miss out on qualification to  Group Two. The provisional squad features Angela Okutoyi, Rosehilda Asumwa, Shufaa Changawa, Cynthia Cheruto and Faith Nyabera and will be finalised in May before departure to the tournament. The team started training early this month but have taken a break due to the government directive that all sports activities be postponed due to the coronavirus outbreak. Players selected played in various Future tennis tournaments late last year and early this year in readiness for the competition. They face a  stern test against the likes of Montenegro, Cyprus, Iceland, Ireland, Norway, Cyprus, Albania and South Africa among other nations. Only two teams will be promoted to Group Two. At the same time, Kenya will be seeking to host the Euro- Africa Davis Cup Group III event following their failure to qualify for the playoffs after losing to Indonesia early this month in Jakarta. The event will either be held in June or September. Countries expected for the event are Rwanda, Nigeria, Benin, Cameroon, Mozambique and Namibia. Egypt has also expressed an interest in hosting the week-long tournament. Tennis Kenya (TK) administrator, Nancy Nduku, said several local tournaments have to be postponed due to to the coronavirus pandemic. "We had a couple of junior tournaments and ITF events which we were going to host but we will play them later in the year if the calendar allows.” The Karen Open will now most likely be played later in the year. On the continental front, the Africa Junior Championship Under- 14 tournament slated for Madagascar and the U-16 event scheduled for Togo have been postponed.
