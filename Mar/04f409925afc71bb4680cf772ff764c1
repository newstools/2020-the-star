Meru town residents have decried increased accidents on the steep stretch from Mwendantu to the township. They said there have been many accidents at the junction at Kanyuru stream where Mwendantu Road joins Meru town, a few metres from Kathita River where there is a sharp corner. Kinoti Riungi urged Governor Kiraitu Murungi’s administration to seek alternative places for vendors and bodaboda riders who risk their lives selling goods and waiting for clients along the road. He cited a Wednesday evening accident in which a woman was injured, among many other crashes where people have been killed after drivers lost control of their matatus and trucks and veered off the road. A truck rammed into a lorry on Wednesday but the driver took control of the vehicle before anyone was killed. Antony Murithi asked the Kenya Urban Road Authority to instal bumps on the road. "Were it not for screams by pedestrians and passersby, the accident could have caused many deaths. The walk paths are always busy especially during evening hours," he said. In September last year, two people were killed and nine others injured after a driver lost control of a matatu and crashed into an oncoming Toyota Probox then veered off the road before hitting bodaboda riders and pedestrians. The matatu, with passengers, entered the deep trench in Kanyuru stream. The accident happened near Riverland on the Makutano-Meru town-Nkubu highway. County police commander Patrick Lumumba called for caution. Edited by R.Wamochie
