Kenyans should prepare to dig deeper into their pockets to pay for public transport. "Fare will certainly go up because the cost of doing business is high," Matatu Owners Association chairperson Simon Kimutai said on Friday. He was reacting to Health CS Mutahi Kagwe's directive ordering PSV operators to carry less passengers in the fight against the coronavirus. He noted that 14 seater matatus should carry eight passengers only and 25 seater PSVS should carry 15 passengers. But speaking to the Star on the phone, Kimutai said CS Kagwe should tell PSV owners how to deal with the situation. "He should tell us how to recoup by having less passengers in public transport vehicles. We will have to do the total of 14 passengers and divide by the remaining," he said. Earlier, Kagwe asked Kenyans to be vigilant and adhere to government advice. "... if you look at figures from countries, you will find that 14 days from the first time of a patient, there is always a surge," he said. "It is better for us to prepare for the worst and any eventuality. This is exactly what we have been doing so that in any eventuality we can offer support." Kagwe said the worst thing Kenya can do is fabricate stories and say things that are not true. "We will take every measure to ensure your safety but you too must take responsibility," he said. Kagwe said they are prepared for the worst case scenario. "...but we hope we never get there. We will do what we can but at the end of the day individuals must prepare themselves for the worst," he said.
