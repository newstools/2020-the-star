Motocross has been added to the Nandi 4x4 Conservation Challenge ahead of the 4th edition set for Easter Holiday from April 10-13. The three-day event has attracted over 50 cars that will roar in Tulon Farm, Nandi County. The event is an off-road motorsport/motocross competition, where participants go through selected tough-to-navigate spots. The hotspots are perfectly selected to offer a requisite level of complexity in terms of terrain as well as offer fans panoramic views of the skyline and other tourism attractions. Event’s organizer, Basil Maiyo, said the aim of the show is to conserve the environment and exuded confidence the event will be a huge success going by the registration pace. He said the introduction of motocross is to give an opportunity to other motorcycle riders who want to experience the terrain of Nandi. Last year, the event attracted over 1,500 spectators, 40 cars and 8000 trees were planted. “This year, we want to make it bigger and better. So far 20 cars have confirmed participation,” he added.
