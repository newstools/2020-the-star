A lawyer alleged to have colluded with a woman to kill a Belgian was on Monday ordered to be mentally assessed before he formally takes the plea. John Hari Gakinya, who appeared before Justice Daniel Ogembo, is said to have plotted with Lucy Waithera to kill Dysseller Mireille. The Belgian has been missing since June last year. Waithera, Mireille's friend, was arraigned a fortnight ago in connection with her disappearance. Gakinya is expected to answer to the murder charge tomorrow (Wednesday) when the court will have received his mental assessment report. The lawyer and Waithera are suspected to have killed Dysseller Mireille Lesoipa alias Leila with others not in court at an unknown place between December 11, 2018, and July 2019. The Belgian arrived in Kenya more than 30 years ago to marry her Samburu lover. Waithera is said to have forged her will and a death certificate claiming that she died at MP Shah Hospital.  But the hospital denied admitting anybody by that name. Police sources said Waithera befriended Mireille when she moved to Nakuru from Samburu in 2018. The Belgian disappeared a few months later. Waithera came up with a death certificate indicating that her friend had died of HIV and Aids. The death certificate was fake. The suspect told the police that her friend was cremated but the law enforcers established that that never happened. Waithera is said to have furnished the missing person's advocates, Hari Gakinya and Company Advocates, with death certificate No 1600281 showing that Mireille died on July 15, 2019, at MP Shah Hospital, Nairobi. The certificate was used to file succession cause No 40/2019 at the High Court in Nakuru in respect of the missing person’s estate. The suspect was named as a beneficiary. Waithera has been in custody since February 3 when she was arrested in connection with Mirielle's disappearance. The Belgian lived in Nakuru's Blankets estate.
