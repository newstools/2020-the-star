A popular US television host Steve Harvey is looking for a Kenyan painter Collins Omondi. Omondi, who is using pencils to draw pictures had posted on his twitter account a portrait image of Steve Harvey. Harvey is an American comedian, businessman and entertainer. He hosts the famous Steve Harvey Show, Family Feud, Celebrity Family Feud, the Miss Universe competition and  Fox's New Year's Eve. "Complete! Pencil drawing of @IAmSteveHarvey. Will be a real boost to my hustle if you have this in your gallery. Waiting with bated breath," Omondi posted. He had sought to attract Harvey's attention and if he will boost his work. After many retweets,  the media personality responded to Omondi adding that he would receive the painting in Bostwana. "Now I’m looking for you it would be my honor to have this .... what size is it and I’ll be in Joburgh and Botswana soon let’s hook up then." Omondi was overwhelmed by Harvey's response and pleaded for him to visit  Kenya to receive his pictures instead of Botswana. "Thank you so much Steve, and God bless you and expand you!! I am actually in Nairobi, Kenya not so far from Jo'Burg or Botswana. If possible, I would be proud to invite you over to Kenya for a Safari to experience #MagicalKenya as I present this portrait! How do I reach you?"
