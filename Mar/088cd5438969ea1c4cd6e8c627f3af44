Kenyan tourism and hospitality industry players are anticipating losses running into millions in the wake of the deadly corona virus. The virus which started in China has spread to other countries with more than 96,000 cases globally and 3,300 deaths. The epidemic has seen a ban of flights to and from the biggest tourists’ source markets of Asia and Europe. Italy, one of the biggest source market for the country's tourism sector with chartered planes landing twice in Mombasa, has been the hardest hit European country with cases of the virus being reported in Verona and Milan. This year's International Tourism Bourse (ITB) in Berlin, the World's leading travel trade show has been postponed. “The hospitality Industry will definitely suffer but we want the government through the relevant bodies to ensure that we remain safe and secure,” said Hasnain Noorani, Kenya Coast Working Group Chairman and CEO PrideInn Hotels. Yesterday, Kenya Association of Hotel Keepers and Caterers yesterday said it is seeking to establish how its members can respond to the crisis should a case be reported in any of the establishments in the country. CEO Mike Macharia has since called on hoteliers to evaluate the overall impact of the virus on to their businesses to help craft post crisis strategies.
