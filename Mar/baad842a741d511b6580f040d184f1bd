Kenyan referees have welcomed Fifa’s directive in regard to Football Kenya Federation (FKF) elections. The refs expressed concerns that disobeying the directive could bring disastrous consequences to the country and affect them. Former Fifa referee Mwangi Gikonyo said the gains that have been made over the last four years will go down the drain in case of a Fifa ban. “We have experienced stability in our game and are looking to take it to the next level. We do not want anything that will impede that progress,” he said. Gikonyo said they had high profile appointments in last year and this could go to waste. “Mary Njoroge was at the women World Cup last year in France while Peter Kamaku was at the Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt and was even earmarked for appointment in the Africa Nations Championships (CHAN).” Kamaku has also been slotted for a possible appointment to officiate in the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. “He is now one of our elite refs and has undergone four VAR courses so far. We can’t allow that to go down the drain,” he added. Mary Njoroge herself said they have no choice but to obey the Fifa directive as all the refs are under the world governing body, Fifa. “It was a great feeling being at the World Cup and a great experience,” she said. Former Fifa referee Richard Obare said local officials risk missing out on a number of training and symposiums if Kenya is suspended. Others who supported the move are Andrew Juma, Anthony Ongwae, Davies Omweno, Israel Mpaima, Caroline Wanjala, Agneta Itubo, and Gilbert Cheruiyot. Others are Tonny Kidiya, Oliver Odhiambo, Samuel Kuria, Joshua Achila, Caroline Kiles, Jane Cherono, Stephen Yiembe, Carlin Alusa, Maximum Itur, Stephen Oduor, Caleb Amwayi, Edward Lumbugu, Margaret Omondi, Richard Obare, Damaris Kimani, Dorcas Moraa, Moses Osano and Tabitha Njoroge.
