The 1961 MGA sports car of David Filmer is among the latest entries for the Golden Jubilee Africa Concours d’Elegance scheduled for September 27 at the Nairobi Racecourse. Other entries which have reached the Concours office recently include Gayling May’s 1967 Alfa Romeo Sprint 2600 coupe. This will be one of the leading machines in the up to 3000cc touring car class. The organisers are also receiving more attention from bikers including the 1956 BSA C10L of Peter Wanday, the Chairman of the Alfa Romeo Owners Club. This year’s Concours d’Elegance will be the 50th in the annual series. The objective of the Concours is to give the owners of well kept classic and vintage cars and motorcycles the opportunity to show them to the motoring enthusiasts who flock to the Nairobi Racecourse for the Concours. Competitors will have their machines assessed by highly experienced officials and have the opportunity to win overall and class prizes. There are 12 classes for all makes and types of cars, pickups and SUVs and eight for motorcycles.
