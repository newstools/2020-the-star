Projects that had stalled in Kiambu county for more than one year owing to lack of funding have been revived after the government started paying contractors. Governor James Nyoro said the most affected were roads, drainages and bridges. He said the contractors became frustrated and left the sites. “All of these projects will be done as contractors are on site. We aim at improving trading, movement, security as well as attract more investors,” Nyoro said. He spoke in Kimende town, Kijabe ward, on Tuesday when he made an impromptu visit to inspect the construction of a 4km road. The governor said Kimende road is among four and three bridges which had stalled because of lack of funding, forcing contractors to leave the sites. The project will cost Sh140 million to cover tarmacking, drainage, parking and footpaths. Other roads contractors had abandoned included Gakoe, Kalimoni, Mulela, Thogoto-Ndarire, and Thika. Bridges that had stalled included Riuriro, Kalimoni and Muere. The county chief was accompanied by MCA Nyutu Wamwere, subcounty administrator Dominic Kariuki, a member of roads board Sammy Nene, among other leaders. Street lights will also be installed to boost trading and security. Area MCA, who is also the chairman of the county roads' committee at the assembly, said the project will help the youths in accessing jobs once investors flock to the county. "Many urban areas in the county appear to have been abandoned and cannot attract investors. Once they are done, I am sure investors will come," Nyutu said. Edited by A. Ndung'u
