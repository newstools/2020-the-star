The Kenya Private Sector Alliance (KEPSA) has set up a 24-hour call center and an information portal to assist businesses during the Covid-19 crisis. The portal will provide give information on business and health matters for workers, strengthen supply chains, business initiatives, and economic mitigation. Businesses can contact the call center on 1196 for any business inquiry. The portal accessible at www.covid-19.ke will enable the sharing of information, essential medical supplies and ensure continuity of supplies for local businesses. “The two services are open for all the businesses including Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and will ensure business continuity,” KEPSA CEO Carole Kariuki said. The KEPSA Action Plan has been grouped into three categories including, health, economic and food production. Under the health category, the plan ensures that local businesses are manufacturing as many health essentials needed to contain the spread of Coronavirus. Some of these include masks, sanitizers, disinfectants, and medical products among others. KEPSA is also engaging the government on various economic issues including an economic stimulus package to ensure minimal job losses, cushion SMEs and to produce the needed health essentials, and financial packages to mitigate the threat Covid-19 poses to food production. Several private sector members are also undertaking different initiatives to tackle unemployment risks. These include flower farms giving out flowers to institutions like hospitals for free to maintain farm jobs, EPZs to produce for the local market and offload to mitumba sellers and other retailers among other initiatives. Several KEPSA members have launched initiatives to feed their employees, while other members are rolling out innovative feeding programs in the informal settlements in major urban centers across the country.
