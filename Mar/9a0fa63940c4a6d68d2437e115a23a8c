DCI sleuths on Tuesday gunned down the main suspect in the Sh72 million Nairobi West ATM heist which took place last September. Wycliff Oduor was shot after a shootout between a three-man gang following a robbery in Kayole, Nairobi. The mastermind well known as Vinii was killed in the shootout that followed. Police said they responded to a distress call from the victim who was being robbed by the gang. The other two suspects managed to escape on a motorbike and are being pursued by police. Police recovered a kitchen knife and a pistol from the slain suspect. Oduor had been arraigned and released on a Sh500, 000 bond. In 2019, men posing as police officers stole 13 bags of money worth Sh72 million, from the Standard Chartered Bank and G4S in Nairobi. The impostors stole the cash in transit from the G4S headquarters along Witu road and an ATM in Nairobi West belonging to Standard Chartered Bank. Several people including Bernard Mwenda, Benson Makokha and Nahashon Mutua who were alleged to rob G4S staff of the millions were arraigned.
