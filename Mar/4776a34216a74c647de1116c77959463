Kenyans have raised pertinent questions after the first case of COVID-19 was confirmed on Friday. This was after a 27-year-old woman, a Kenyan, landed in the county on March 5 from London. The woman fell ill and went to the hospital, where she tested positive for coronavirus. But then it is not clear where this woman has been from March 5 to March 13, when she was quarantined at Mbagathi Hospital. In these eight days, she might have boarded a plane and taken a taxi from the JKIA to her location. She might have visited the store to buy items and interacted with several people. Also, what about her family and friends? Are they safe? What if it is not a solo case? These are some of the questions that Kenyans are raising after Health CS Mutahi Kagwe announced the case. Speaking to the media, Kagwe said the patient is stable and eating. "...she will not be released from hospital until she is confirmed negative," he said. The government said it had traced all the people the patient came into contact with since her arrival. "We have done all the contact tracing and have all the names including the people who sat next to her on the flights she took," he said. The government has also suspended all visits to prison for the next 30 days. All the public transport providers have been directed to provide hand sanitisers.
