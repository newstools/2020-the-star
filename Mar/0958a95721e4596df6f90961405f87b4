As the Kakamega County secondary schools Term One games get underway today,  at St. Peter's, Mumias, hockey defending champions Musingu High School have warned arch-rivals Kakamega High School. Musingu coach Alfred Mbati said his charges are well prepared and ready to take on any team as they seek to retain the title they won last year after beating Kakamega 3-2 through penalty shootouts. "We know at this level, things are not easy but we are well prepared for any team.  We will take a game at a time and we hope to make progress as the boys are in high spirits and raring to go," he said. "Kakamega is equally expected to pose a  major threat but our focus is on all teams that have qualified from their respective sub-counties. Reaching this level is a great achievement that motivates all other teams to seek regional ticket," he added. "Sometimes when you come to this kind of games as a defending champion, each team will normally come hard at you but we are aware of this and we are not taking any chances. "Our objective is to win this championship and advance to the nations and the East Africa games," Mbati said. Mukumu Girls, who are also defending handball champions, expect a stiff challenge from little-known schools. Under the tutelage of Roselyne Iravonga, Mukumu won the title last year after beating Epanja 3-14 but she has warned her players against complacency.
