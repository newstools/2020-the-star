The Kisumu county government offices at Prosperity House and City Hall have been closed as part of measures to contain the spread of coronavirus. The administration has also  suspended the provision of non-essential services. The county is on high alert following the confirmation of a Covid-19 patient in neighbouring Siaya county. Governor Anyang Nyong'o said that suspected Covid–19 cases from Siaya have had interactions with a lot of people in Kisumu over the past few days. Nyongo said that this situation has increased the number of people being quarantined in the county isolation facilities as the contacts are traced. “Our health system is increasingly feeling overstretched by this increased demand. It is, therefore, my appeal to our people to stay home and avoid visits to public places,” he said. Nyong'o told residents to restrict movement to only essential ones such as buying provisions and visiting a health facility when one needs to. The departments of Health and Sanitation, Finance, Water and Environment, Veterinary Services,  Disaster and Emergency Services, Field Administration and Enforcement shall remain operational. “All clients services in those departments remain suspended unless dictated by the service," he said.
