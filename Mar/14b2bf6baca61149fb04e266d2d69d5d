The state of uneasiness and panic the coronavirus has brought to the world has to be one of the most unfortunate times in history. As much as the state is trying to find ways to curb the spread of the virus and set at ease the minds of its citizens, it’s not lost to them that the effects run deeper than what meets the eye. Not only has there been indefinite closure of all learning institutions but the government and private-sector workers have also been advised to work from home. The self-employed lot, however, does not seem to benefit from any of these measures. Furthermore, the impact of the self-quarantine seems to impact quite harshly on individuals whose daily activities involve interactions with the common mwananchi such as the mama mboga, hawkers and street vendors just to mention but a few. The government should work on taking certain small measures before embarking on the major ones. For instance, they should work on sending the Ministry of Health messages about the Covid-19 in English and Swahili for inclusivity purposes. All Kenyans should be kept aware of how coronavirus can be transmitted, prevented and the safety measures to undertake at this time of crisis. This will even help do away with the myths and misconceptions about the virus. Large percentages of the country’s population live in distress and quite frankly cannot afford certain luxuries such as stocking their houses with food and necessary necessities. This is where the government should extend its resources and offer a helping hand in terms of toiletries, clean water, food, and protective gear. The economy is set to dwindle no matter how hard we try to salvage it, thus the need for government intervention. Mghoi Eileen
