With over five years without a win, former Eldoret golf captain Anand Lakhani carded 42 stable ford points to emerge victorious during Syngenta Golf Series held at the par 71 Eldoret Golf Club. The exited Lakhani posted one of the best results, enjoying his putt, sinking rare three birdies on the fast-running course to claim the title. He said it has been a while since he won, unable to remember the year he managed to post such great points on the course. “It has been a while for me to win any tournament but luck came over me today,” said Lakhani. Playing handicap 5, Lakhani said it was not easy for a single handicap to earn such a great score. In his first nine, he started with a birdie in the second hole par 3 after a par in one par five and fired all pars for a total of 20 points. He returned with vigour with double birdies in 12 par 4 and 18 par 5 respectively with a bogey in 16 par 3 with all holes receiving pars for a total of 22 points in the second nine. The two-time captain, first, in his teenage and leading in the 2015/2016 season, Lakhani said the day started well, playing with great golfers. “The course was good despite the hot sun and running greens that were hard in putting. But with all that, I managed to overcome the challenges,” said Lakhani. Paul Mwangi and Jedidah Keitany were men and ladies winners on 39 and 37 points respectively. Playing handicap 14, Mwangi relegated Ahmed Ferej into second with 37 points while Amos Butit lost to Ferej on countback. Keitany, on the other hand, edged Hilam Shah with a point as club chairperson Florence Murgor was third with 36 points. Former club captain John Barorot was the first nine winners on 19 points as Ardash Shah was the second nine winner on 20 points. Lakhani was on the podium again to receive the longest drive prize while Diana Chemweno was the lady’s longest drive champion. Parit Sanghrajka was the nearest to the pin winner.
