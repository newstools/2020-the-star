Singer Otile Brown and Ethiopian model Nabayet have rekindled their love. In a statement made by Nabayet on Instagram, she described the singer as the only person she loves deeply. "Needless to say, it hasn’t been an easy ride, but boy was it worth it! No words can describe how grateful I am that it happened," she wrote. "Only a few lucky ones get to love so deeply and be loved." She went on to wish him a happy birthday. "Happiest birthday to you. May Rona stay away from you forever and may you have endless supply of sanitisers and toilet rolls. Life’s too short to be bitter and hold on to anger. Now or later, together or not, I will always be praying for your success and happiness," she said.
