Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe has taken every opportunity in his daily briefings to remind everyone to take health precautions to minimise the chances of contracting coronavirus. The print, electronic and social media are awash with instructions of what to do to keep safe and keep others safe. But it is still shocking to find that passengers from Europe, the epicentre of the pandemic, land at the JKIA and drive home without self-quarantine for the recommended 14 days. A majority of matatu crews seem to have ignored orders to provide commuters with sanitisers or soap and water. Public transport is a fertile ground for the spread of the coronavirus and that is why the government wisely closed schools and banned public gatherings. We call upon the matatu industry to stop burying their heads in the sand and realise the pandemic poses an existential threat that must be confronted with all possible weapons. We also appeal to Kenyans and foreigners arriving from Europe, Asia and the United States to not only self-quarantine but also get tested. The indifferent attitude of passengers in the public transport system has made Kagwe rightly order the arrest of those who ignore these basic protocols.
