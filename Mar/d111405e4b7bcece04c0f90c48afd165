Diamond Platnumz’s ex Zari Hassan has shaded his baby mama Hamisa Mobetto after her video dancing to the singer’s latest song 'Jeje' surfaced. Diamond shared Hamisa’s video jamming to his latest hit, leaving many speculating they were back together after he broke up with Tanasha Donna three weeks ago. "Jeje ya Mama ake Deedaylan, @Hamisa Mobetto. Global vibe. Number one song," Diamond wrote. Hamisa responded with a tongue and love emojis. However, Zari threw shade at Hamisa for ‘stooping too low’ and entertaining Diamond despite the challenges she went through with him. "It’s not clout but low self-worth, low self-esteem. Know the difference," Zari wrote. Hamisa took Diamond to court over child support and in 2018, the singer and his family accused her of using witchcraft. The two (Diamond and Hamisa) now seem to be getting along well.
