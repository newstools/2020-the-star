Ugandan President Kaguta Museveni has said the news circulating that he has imposed a total lockdown in the country is false. Through his Twitter account, Museveni on Saturday said that he has not given such directives and that he will inform Ugandans of any new measures that the country will take to mitigate the spread of coronavirus using the usual channel of a live broadcast. “My team has notified me about a forged tweet reportedly saying I have ordered a total lockdown of the country. That is false. Like I indicated earlier, I will keep the country informed of any new measures to curb Covid-19 through the usual channel of a live broadcast,” Museveni said. The false information had alleged that Museveni ordered a total lockdown which was to start tonight for 21 days. This comes as the country confirmed five more COVID-19 cases, bringing positive cases in the country to 23. Ugandan Ministry of Health said that all the five new cases were imported and the patients were under quarantine at the time of test. It said that 1,175 people are under follow up while 876 of them are under institutional quarantine and the other 299 are under self quarantine. The previous 18 confirmed patients with the virus are in stable condition.
