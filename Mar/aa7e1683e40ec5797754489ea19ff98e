Kenya Basketball Federation (KBF) will host their first-ever All-stars festival in July. Joseph Amoko, the KBF competitions secretary said the two-day event is scheduled for July 27-28 at Nyayo Stadium gymnasium. “ It is something that has been on our minds for long now,” said Amoko. “I am happy that it will be on our calendar of events and our fans will surely love it.” Other events that will light up the weekend, he said include dunking and shooting competitions, featuring only men players “It will be an exciting weekend that will give teams a break as they close the first and start the second leg fixtures,” noted Amoko. He said this is one programme that the basketball fraternity has always wanted to be included in the calendar. “The event is popular on the Nairobi Basketball Association (NBA) programme and has always drawn a good crowd,” he added. Amoko also said KBF will be more strict on transfers and asked all teams to register their new players before the start of the season. He directed players moving to new teams to fill the forms and pay before switching clubs. “No player will be allowed to play for a new team unless the transfer forms are duly filled and stipulated amount paid,” warned Amoko. He said the strict rule will apply across the board both in the KBF national and NBA provincial leagues. “Teams must have players cards before the tip-off,” he noted. “This time around, we want to avoid a situation where players move from one team to the other with no order,” he said. He warned coaches that they must observe the rules and register their players. “They will get the cards after three days.” Teams are already recruiting ahead of the season that was to start last week. Ulinzi Warriors and Equity Bank are the reigning men and women champions. They expect fierce competition from Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) sides.
