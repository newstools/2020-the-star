On Friday, Radio Jambo hosted a rhumba night at the Carnivore Simba Saloon. The entry fee was Sh300 only. In attendance were some of the Radio Jambo presenters and Bana Mazembe Band ready to entertain their fans. Radio Jambo fans were thrilled to see the presenters, some for the first time. The event is meant to be hosted every month at the same venue.
