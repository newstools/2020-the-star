President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga on Sunday joined thousands of fans at Kasarani stadium for a clash between Gor Mahia and AFC Leopards. The clash well known as the 'Mashemeji derby' attracted huge crowds with each side hoping to win. This was the 89th time the two rival teams are clashing against the backdrop of financial challenges ranging following the withdrawal of giant betting firm Sportpesa. Uhuru accompanied by Sports Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohammed and State House Comptroller Kinuthia Mbugua arrived at the VIP section shortly after the two teams made it to the stadium. Raila alongside his ANC counterpart Musalia Mudavadi and Kakamega governor Wycliffe Oparanya had already seated among other dignitaries. Fans accessing the 60,000Â  seater capacity stadium were earlier subjected to a mandatory security check. Stewards from either team were partially rendered jobless after police officers and military personnel took charge at all entry points into the stadium. Gor Mahia won the match with one goal.
