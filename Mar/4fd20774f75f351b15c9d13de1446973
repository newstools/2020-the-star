Two Naivasha-based breweries have donated about 550 litres s of pure ethanol to be processed to sanitiser. The Naivasha Subcounty Hospital faces an acute shortage of sanitiser due to an increase in the number of patients seeking services. Mashwa and Keroche Breweries came to the rescue with calls for more support as the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the country hit 38. Mashwa Breweries donated 500 litres while Keroche gave 50 litres of ethanol with a promise that they would continue to support the busy hospital. Mashwa operations manager Francis Karanja said the hospital served hundreds of residents including their workers, hence, the donation. He said the current situation called for support from all quarters adding that they fully supported measures introduced by the government to contain the spread of the disease. Chairman Karanja Mburu (Lakeview MCA) welcomed the donation terming it a God-send. Mburu also chairs the disaster management committee in the assembly. The ward rep said many health centres are faced with a shortage of sanitises due to increased demand and an increasing number of patients. “We thank Mashwa Breweries and other donors who have come out to assist our health facilities at these hard times and we call to other organisations to assist us,” he said. Meanwhile, the 25 workers from a leading Naivasha hotel have been released from 14 days of self-quarantine. The shaken workers were subjected to several tests by health officers before being released to join their families. Some of the hotel workers came into contact with a French national on March 9 before he later tested positive for the coronavirus. Naivasha subcounty commissioner Mathioya Mbogo said none of the workers exhibited any symptoms of the disease after self-quarantine. “From the day they came into contact with the French national none of them has exhibited the coronavirus symptoms and they have been released to join their relatives," he said.
