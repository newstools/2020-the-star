Kenyans are rushing to supermarkets to stock up after the country recorded the first case of coronavirus incident. A spot check by the Star in several supermarkets in Nairobi noted long queues of shoppers buying foodstuffs and other necessities in huge quantities, forcing retailers to limit them. The shopping rush saw some commodities like sanitizers and masks cleared from shelves even after prices tripled. Cleaning ware and paperware are also moving fast on the shelves. "Today has been busier than normal, sanitizers are out of stock," said Clifford Van Eden, Stock Buyer at Shoprite Westgate said. "We are seeing customers with bigger trolleys, with a lot of water and home supplies," he said A shopper at the supermarket, Lilian Nyareru had a trolley full of milk, eggs, flour, rice, and dry cereals. "I am stocking up in case of anything, we don't know what tomorrow holds," she said. A similar scenario is being witnessed at the nearby Carrefour located at the Sarit Centre. ‘’People are buying as much their money can. They are extremely anxious. The management has been forced to limit the number of items bought by an individual. I foresee a huge stock out by tomorrow,’’ an attendant who pledged for anonymity told the Star. The virus, which has since claimed over 4500 lives across the globe, infecting over 120,000 others has led to a total lockdown in countries like China, Italy, and Germany, where most actualities have been reported. The high demand for foodstuffs and cleaning products has since seen the Competition Authority (CAK) issue a statement to sellers not to hike prices ''Take notice that the said conduct is a contravention of section 21 (1) of the Act as read together with section 21 (3) (a) of the Act and will attract a penalty of up to ten per cent of the respective turnover of the manufacturers and retailers in question, pursuant to section 36 (d) of the Act,'' CA said.
