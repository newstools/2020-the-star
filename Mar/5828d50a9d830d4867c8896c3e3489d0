Four-time New York City Marathon champion Mary Keitany has expressed her frustrations due to the coronavirus pandemic. Keitany rues the effect of the virus in the sports industry and especially individually since she cannot train regularly like she is used to. This, she says, has left many sportsmen and women uncertain of what the future holds for them with nearly all scheduled sports events either cancelled or postponed. The three-time London Marathon winner said as much as she did not have a race this season, the virus has turned out to be a 'devil' which has seen the industry grind to a halt thus loss of income for many sports professionals. “This is a bad disease. It is killing athletics across the world. There's no much for us (athletes) to do since the virus has cost spread across the world,” said Keitany. The marathoner said training individually is tough since one needs teammates to help gauge his/her speed and endurance during training. “As I prepare for future races, I can’t train on my own. I need other athletes for support and speed work,” she added. She felt for athletes who had prepared for some of the events that were cancelled or postponed due to the pandemic. “Imagine that time when you are ready to run at a given race then you are told you can’t despite having trained for months on end. This kills the morale of all athletes,” added the former world half marathon record holder at 65:55. The Elgeyo Marakwet County-based runner is praying that the pandemic will be over by the start of next season.
