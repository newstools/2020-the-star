The death toll from Covid-19 has passed 10,000 globally. Confirmed cases are close to 250,000 and more than 80,000 recovered. California on Friday has issued a "stay at home" order to residents as it tries to stem the march of the coronavirus across the most populous US state. Governor Gavin Newsom told Californians they should only leave their homes when necessary during the pandemic. He earlier estimated more than half of the 40 million people in his state would contract Covid-19 in just the next two months. The virus has claimed 205 lives in the US and infected more than 14,000. Coronavirus has killed more people in Italy than in any other country, after deaths there rose by 427 in a day on Thursday. The number of deaths now stands at 3,405, which is more than in China where the virus originated last year. There have been 3,245 reported deaths in China, but there have been questions over the reliability of its data. A lockdown imposed on 12 March in Italy has been extended beyond the original 25 March end date. Nearly all Italians have been told to stay at home.
