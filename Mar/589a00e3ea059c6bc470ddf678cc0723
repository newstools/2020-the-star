Health CS  Mutahi Kagwe has said the challenges being faced by the government in fighting coronavirus have also been faced by other countries across the world. "There is no country on earth that has managed to control this diseases with its existing health facilities," Kagwe said on Sunday. He said "If the National Health Service in the UK has already been overrun by the demand of the illness. Even in Italy it has happened and even America is claiming that they do not have this, that or the other." Kagwe said all Kenyans should embrace the fight against coronavirus. "We as a nation should do what we have always done in times of extreme challenges, that is come together," Kagwe said. He said the government is expanding its capacity for mitigation purposes, especially at the county level. "This includes schools, air flight hangers which can be used as isolation facilities and hospitals if we get to that point," Kagwe said. He said the government has put in place measures to have more isolation centers if the situation escalates. "We need to begin to identify areas to take the sick in case our systems are overrun. We need to own this process as Kenyans," Kagwe said.
