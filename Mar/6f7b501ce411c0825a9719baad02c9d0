A forex training company director has denied unlawfully obtaining Sh58 million from 60 people. Emmanuel Mulinge Maundu alias Emmanuel Wambua was on Friday charged before Milimani magistrate Martha Nanzushi with 68 counts of obtaining money illegally. In the first count, the director of Forex Training and Consultancy Limited is said to have obtained Sh3 million from Ann Wambui on August 30, 2019, by pretending that he could give her a monthly interest of 30 per cent of the amount. The second count stated that he obtained Sh1 million from Catherine Gatura on February 1, 2019, by pretending he could give her 30 per cent interest on the principal. The two offences, alongside 66 others, were allegedly committed at View Park Towers last year. Efforts by his lawyers to have him freed on bail failed after the prosecution told the court that he was a flight risk. The court heard that Wambua had been arrested at JKIA trying to flee the country. The magistrate asked for a pre-bail report by March 10. Wambua has been in police custody for nine days.
