FC Talanta will not be cowed by Kariobangi Sharks' experience when the two sides lock horns in a Betway Round of 16 fixture at the Moi Stadium, Kasarani this weekend. Talanta, who ply their trade in the National Super League, will be seeking to toss out the former Cup holders and advance to the quarter-finals. With Talanta going for weeks without the guidance of a head coach, Sharks are deemed pre-match favourites but Michael Muya, Talanta’s centre half and assistant skipper, believes they are equal to the task. Talanta have been relying on their long-serving skipper and midfielder Patrick Muchiri following the expiry of coach Ken Kenyatta’s probation last month. Muchiri, who has been at the club for almost eight years was in charge when the club saw off Zetech University in the Round of 32 and will hope to replicate the same against Sharks, who won the Cup in 2018. Muya said they are not afraid of their opponents despite approaching the match as underdogs. “We have no reason to fear them for we are prepared. They play in the elite league but the winner will be determined after 90 minutes. Odds are in their favour but since we have every player around, I think we will give them a run for their money,” said the defender Muya, in the meantime, said the players were delighted to work under Muchiri, whom he labelled as a disciplined professional. Muchiri is a basic coaching certificate holder. “He respects us and we respect him too for he is disciplined and approaches everything like a professional. We enjoy playing and training under him and we will do everything possible to win for him," said Muya. "He has sacrificed a lot for the club and the players are keen to give him something to smile about.”
