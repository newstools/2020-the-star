Fans are not happy with the new song by Size 8 and Masterpiece, with some calling it a joke. The song titled High Bila Ndom has elicited a range of reaction, with some saying it is not a gospel piece. Fans have expressed their disappointment with Size 8, saying her music has always inspired and touched people. Wangui Waruguru said the bling worn by the artists is unchristian. "Say am judging it's okay but this is just [not] a religious song. This is no gospel. It is just a secular song dressed in gospel lyrics. So so worldly. If an unbeliever listens to this can it transform him from darkness into light?? This is a joke!! Such a disappointment. This is a Camouflage," she commented.
