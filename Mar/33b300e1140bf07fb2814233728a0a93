More than 300 small scale traders from Homa Bay East ward have been trained on financial management to improve their business skills. The traders, locally referred to as Aswekra, from four locations in the ward also received a grant of more than Sh600, 000 from the office of their MCA Juma Awuor. They will use the money stock to their businesses. Most of the traders who benefited from the programme sell food items like cereals, vegetables and fruits in local markets. The business does not require a lot of capital to start and the profit is mostly spent on purchasing household items. MCA Awuor said his office partnered with Equity Bank to empower the traders on business and financial management skills. “The traders who are widows have been encouraged to open accounts with the banks and save their proceeds,” Awuor said. Speaking during closure of a training workshop in Homa Bay on Saturday, Awuor said most of the traders undergo a lot of difficulties in looking for survival means and to keep their children in school. Equity Bank agreed to support them by giving them small loans. The MCA said the businesses the traders engaged in made very little profit that is not enough to invest in other activities. “It’s important for one to do business with the aim of transforming their lives. We’re boosting their business skills to enable them progress,” he added. The progaramme also targets boda boda operators who will be trained to be self-reliant. Awuor said most riders operated motorcycles that they did not own. He said the riders will be sensitized on financial saving to enable them purchase their own motorcycles. “This is just a start. Its success will determine whether we add more traders to the programme or not,” Awuor said. Beneficiaries Janet Achieng and Caroline Akinyi welcomed the initiative, saying it would assist them to boost their living standards. “We’ve been assured of accessing loans from small amount of money we’ll save with Equity Bank,” Achieng’ said.
