Kenya Harlequins have set their sights on the national Sevens circuit after a dismal Kenya Cup season. The Ngong Road giants finished a disappointing ninth on 27 points after winning five out of the 16 matches and missing out on the season-ending playoffs. The eight-time league winners were bundled out of the Enterprise Cup pre-quarters by Homeboyz after losing 48-10. Club chairman, Michael Wanjala, said the early end to the season will be blessing in disguise for them as it will allow them to regroup and set targets for the 2020/2021 season which will start with the national Sevens circuit in July. "It's a blessing in disguise and gives us an opportunity to take stock of what went wrong and how we can rectify the errors which we committed last season,” added Wanjala. He blamed lack of proper pre-season for his charges for the poor season."By the time we started the Impala Floodlights in October last year, we had done three weeks of pre-season which is not right for the Kenya Cup season. If you look at the top four clubs,—Kabras, KCB, Homeboyz and Impala—they have done close to 12 weeks of pre-season and it's the reason they are in the playoffs,” he added. The club's boss expressed confidence that his charges will be in the mix for Kenya Cup playoffs come next season. “I believe we have we have a good crop of players both young and old and with the right environment and preparation, I believe we can compete with the best clubs in the country,” he added. Wanjala said they are talking to a few sponsors in preparation for next season. "Yes we have spoken to few sponsors and we hope in the next couple of months, we can tie them down." Technical director, Victor Sudi, said a review of the management will be done in due course. "The club committee will review the management on how they performed this season and make a decision in good time before we start the sevens circuit."
