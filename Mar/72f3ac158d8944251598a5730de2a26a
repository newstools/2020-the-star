The Judiciary has directed all its staff to work from home in order to protect them from the coronavirus. Chief Registrar of the Judiciary Anne Amadi said the Judiciary has prioritized the safety and health of the entire Judiciary family. She directed court stations to notify the public of the directive and provide telephone and email contact details. This, she said is to facilitate urgent matters which cannot wait and ensure public inquiries are responded to promptly. “We have been providing minimal essential services across our court stations to ensure access to justice is not completely disrupted. However concerns have been raised by our staff regarding their safety as they attend to wananchi,” she said. "We have taken these concerns into consideration...upon consultation with the Chief Justice, it is our view that the health and safety of the entire Judiciary family must be prioritized.” Amadi explained that the leadership of the Judiciary continues to monitor unprecedented challenges presented by Covid-19 and its impact on the administration of justice.
