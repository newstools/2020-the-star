Police in Mwala, Machakos county, are investigating the death of one of their own whose body and that of a woman friend were found in his house at Makutano. The deaths of Jeminsta Mutua Mbai, 40, and Joyce Kaswii, 35, were reported on Wednesday by Esther Kaloki, the officer's mother. Mbai was based at Nyakianga police station in Murang'a. Makutano chief Simon Kiminza said Kaloki told the police that the house was locked from inside when she went to check on her son. A foul smell emanated from the house. It was Kiminza who informed the police who broke into the house and found the two bodies. Police, according to the chief, recovered several items from the house among them a suicide note supposedly written by Mbai, two empty bottles with poison stickers, a panga and a rope. Muange's body had strangulation marks and her mouth was foaming. Her face had several scars. Her belongings were packed, an indication of fallout and that she was about to leave. The two were said to have been in an on and off relationship. Mwala deputy county commissioner Aphaxard Gitonga said the incident was being investigated by the DCI. Gitonga said Mbai might have killed his girlfriend before taking poison. The two had been together at Makutano market on Sunday. The bodies are at Machakos Level 5 Hospital mortuary.
