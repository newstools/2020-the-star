Kaloleni MP Paul Katana has refuted social media claims that he is suffering from Covid-19 and admitted in the Intensive Care Unit. Katana on Tuesday told the Star that he had tested negative for the coronavirus disease. “I have been in my house. I went for testing at Kemri. Yesterday, I got the results and I am negative,” Katana said. He said he is in self-quarantine as a precaution. Speculation was rife last week that the MP tested positive for the virus after coming into contact with his Rabai counterpart William Kamoti. Katana met Kamoti during the Women’s Day celebrations in Rabai on March 8. Kamoti had met Kilifi Deputy Governor Gideon Saburi before attending the Women's  Day event. Saburi tested positive. Lands Chief Administrative Secretary Gideon Mung'aro and Kilifi Woman Representative Getrude Mbeyu also attended the Rabai function. The legislator said some leaders are afraid of walking on the streets due to stigma. Other leaders who made public their coronavirus test results include Kilifi South MP Ken Chonga, Mung’aro, Mbeyu and Shimo La Tewa MCA Sammy Gambo who also tested negative. “Let us stop using this pandemic to settle political scores. This is not something you wish someone contracts. Let’s share information that will give hope to people and not cause suffering,” Katana said. The MP urged police officers enforcing the dusk to dawn curfew to do so in a humane manner. Katana said some police officers will spread the virus by how they are handling people while enforcing the curfew. “Some police officers bundle many people in one vehicle without considering social distancing. The police officers themselves are not protected. “This is dangerous and police commanders must tell their juniors to conduct themselves properly during this time,” Katana said. (edited by o. owino)
