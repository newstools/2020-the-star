A guard being investigated for allegedly killing University of Nairobi student Elisha Otieno Odeng alias Ras has been granted Sh1 million bail. Magistrate Kennedy Cheruiyot said there had been a change of circumstances forcing him to reconsider the issue of bail. He mentioned the coronavirus pandemic, which had resulted in courts scaling down their work. In granting Spencer Kosgey bail, the magistrate said the suspect was unlikely to interfere with the witnesses who are students as most of them have traveled owing to the pandemic. Kosgey is required to report to DCI Kilimani offices daily until investigations are completed. The case will be mentioned on April 16. The suspect had been in custody for 10 days but police yesterday sought to have him detained for five more days pending conclusion of investigations. In an affidavit, Philip Kibet, an officer attached to DCI Kilimani, told the court that he was yet to record statements from two crucial eyewitnesses who are students at the University of Nairobi and whose safety was yet to be secured. He said due to closure of the university accessing witnesses had been a challenge and they required few more days to trace them and record their statements. “I am also yet to acquire several crucial documents from Lavington Security company as well as record statements of the personnel working at the said company,” he said.
