Health CS Mutahi Kagwe on Friday launched the KNH-Mbagathi Hospital Isolation Centre and the Infectious Disease Unit for coronavirus patients. These isolation and quarantine centres in Nairobi are part of preparations for coronavirus containment. Kagwe who is also the chairman of the National Emergency Response Committee on Coronavirus said the ministry has also received enough protective gear for frontline medics. The setting up of the isolation ward started on February 29. HealthÂ Chief Administrative Secretary Rashid Aman had said they would need a month to prepare the isolation section but President Uhuru Kenyatta gave them seven days. Nairobi Health executive Hitan Majevdia said the ward will hold about 40 beds. The secluded building was initially meant to be a 120-bed maternity wing. Although no Kenyan has tested positive for Covid-19, almost 100,200 people in about 94 countries have been infected and 3,408 reported deaths globally. At least 55,988 people have recovered from the infection. The virus emerged in Wuhan, China, in December. The vast majority of cases remain in China, but it has spread to all parts of the world.
