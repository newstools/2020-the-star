Hoffenheim and Bayern Munich played out one of the most bizarre conclusions in the history of football as they passed the ball between each other for 13 minutes after a long delay for an offensive banner in the crowd. Bayern were 6-0 up when their travelling fans unfurled an offensive banner about Hoffenheim president Dietmar Hopp. Coach Hansi Flick and most of the players pleaded — angrily in some cases — with the fans to put it away. Sporting director Hasan Salihamidzic and board member Oliver Kahn — both former players — also attempted to talk to the ultras. Referee Christian Dingert eventually took the players down the tunnel and the game was suspended for about 20 minutes. The match eventually restarted from 77 minutes, with fans told it would be abandoned if the banner appeared again. Bayern’s and Hoffenheim’s players then just kicked the ball between themselves — with goalkeepers not in their goals - to get the game to its conclusion. At the final whistle, 79-year-old Hopp, Bayern chief executive Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and the players stood on the pitch and applauded Hoffenheim fans in a show of solidarity.
