The coronavirus pandemic has sent an unprecedented scare even to the mightiest nations and establishments in the world. The Covid -19 disease has hurt global economies and crippled millions of industries. The virus has grounded workers and service providers at homes causing huge losses worldwide. The story is no different in Kenya. The virus has drastically disrupted the social vigour, carefree and outgoing nature of Kenyan people and their 'shemejis'. The social establishments and facilities such as churches, homes, stadia, restaurants, theatres, cinema halls and clubs have gone entirely silent in efforts to contain the spread. The jovial hearty handshakes and familiar animated chats in the cities and the countryside have gone cold. Kenyans are learning to keep distance in line with the government policy in fear of possible infections. The lucky-go mood and liberal social habits of Kenyan people have significantly gone low and peopleâ€™s faces have gone forlorn as the effects of the Covid 19 continue to be felt. On the bright side, however, the political noise and empty rhetoric from Kieleweke and Tangatanga factions have disappeared into thin air. The noisy political class and their accomplices have cowed away in fear of contracting the virus which gives us room to look at each other as humans together in a fight for life - as opposed to the animals we see each other as over political ideas and personalities. Kenyans should also heed the directives issued in order to tame the virus. This is not the time to hold parties in our houses and attend weddings and burials in huge numbers as this will catalyse the spread of the virus. Naivasha
