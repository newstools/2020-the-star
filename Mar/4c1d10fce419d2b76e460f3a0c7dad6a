Thika Stadium is set to be renamed after the town's first mayor Douglas Mundia, who died slightly over a week ago. Kiambu speaker Stephen Ndichu said a motion will soon be tabled to rename the stadium in honour of Mundia, who served for 23 years. "I have raised the issue with MCAs and we have agreed that because of the great role the fallen mayor played in making Thika what it is, we shall honour him by naming the Thika Stadium or a major street after him," Ndichu said during a memorial service for Mundia who was buried last Monday. He said the county assembly will also consider naming some of the streets or estates after other prominent sons and daughters of Thika. "Some of these names do not make sense, like Magoko Estate," he added. Ndichu described Mundia as an exemplary leader and a politician of repute who should be emulated by upcoming leaders. “His contribution in making Thika an industrial and commercial hub in the region will be felt for generations to come,” he said. Other speakers at the memorial service at the Thika Stadium led by Kiambu County Ex-councillors Forum chairman Ng'ang'a Wanjukira welcomed the idea of honouring Mundia, whom they said left "an unmatched legacy of cleanliness and efficient delivery of service to residents". Wanjukira took the occasion to press for the release of a stipend for the former civic leaders as recommended by Parliament following a petition by the former councilors. Mundia was first elected mayor of Thika in 1968, when it was declared a municipality and served until 1992, when he quit the then ruling party Kanu to join the opposition. He was buried at his Kang’oo rural home in Gatundu North on February 17.
