For Shadrack Kibet, handling infectious diseases is nothing new. Having been in a team of medical officers sent to battle ebola in the West African countries of Liberia and Sierra Leone between 2014 and 2016, Kibet sees Covid-19 as just a normal challenge “but not as serious as Ebola.” But, unlike the Covid-19, he says, there were minimal deaths since the disease spread slowly. While calling on Kenyan medics to be careful when handling patients, Kibet said deaths can easily result as has been witnessed in various countries in the world if safety measures are not adhered to. “I am not scared of  coronavirus like ebola, but our people must protect themselves. With ebola, you only get infected after touching an infected person,” he said. He currently works at the Aga Khan University Hospital. In an interview with Star on Monday morning, Kibet, 31, said he was aware of the dangers posed by ebola but still chose to give its handling a try. “I never feared going out of the country to tackle the situation knowing we were well protected in terms of protective gear. Otherwise, I would not have gone." He said he applied for the position after coming across an advert for a vacancy. The Infection, Prevention and Control (IPC) expert from Sotik in Bomet, who has been in the field for over 10 years, said he still gave it a try despite being new in the field. His first experience with infectious diseases was dengue virus which erupted in the country’s Coast region. With his involvement in controlling such cases, he has now been appointed in charge of a seven-member team that heads Koiwa isolation centre in Konoin, Bomet county, for response to coronavirus. He said his understanding of infectious diseases will help him broaden his skills in the field. The medic expresses optimism the country will manage the pandemic but "only if Kenyans adhere to the laid down procedures of staying home to avert further infections". Edited by R.Wamochie
