Eleven Chinese who have been in self-isolation for 15 days in Athi River do not have coronavirus. They were declared fit and healthy by the county’s health surveillance team. The 11, nine men and two women, caused a scare when they were spotted wearing face masks in Sidai, Mavoko subcounty. The county deployed a surveillance team in the four estates where the 11 were in isolation to monitor their health. Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua said health officials examined them and confirmed that they are not a danger to residents. He said the county is prepared for an outbreak.“We have three isolation wards and 15 trained medical staff ready to manage any suspected corona case,” he said. Mutua said two ambulances have been set aside as well. Guidelines have been sent to all the health workers on how to handle cases in case of an outbreak, the Maendeleo Chap Chap leader said. Mutua said the county bought and distributed 50 protective kits as well as equipment for public health facilities. “Machakos is prepared to deal with any case and I urge residents to inform the nearest health facility of anyone who recently came from overseas and is sick with a fever so they can be tested,” he said. “I wish to correct the perception by some people on Kenya’s preparedness. I can confirm that Ministry of Health officers are working very hard with us and Kenya is as prepared as it can be.” Edited by Josephine M. Mayuya
