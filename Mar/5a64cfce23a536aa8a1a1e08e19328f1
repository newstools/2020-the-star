 Residents of Bunyala have got a huge relief after the Busia county government restored water supply after weeks of dry taps. Water chief officer Moses Weunda said it was the intervention of Governor Sospeter Ojaamong and Bunyala North MCA Fredrick Musirimba that ensured the Sisenye Water Supply resumed operations. The scheme could not continue with operations after Kenya Power cut electricity supply over debts. The scheme owed the company Sh3.3 million. Ojaamong and Musirimba negotiated with Kenya Power to restore electricity supply as modalities were  being put in place to pay the bill. Weunda said Port Victoria had a huge electricity bill but the county cleared it to ensure continuous water supply. He said Sisenye scheme also had pipes that had bursted forcing the county to buy new ones for replacement. Areas that have already received normal water supply include Budalang’i market, Sifugwe, Mundere, Sisenye, Bumbe and the Masinde Muliro University campus in Budalang'i. Residents lauded the governor and the MCA for their intervention to have Sisenye water supply back in operation. Anjeline Nerima who sells water at the Budalang’i market urged the county to ensure there is continuous water supply in the area.  edited by peter obuya
