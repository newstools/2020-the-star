Chapa Dimba Na Safaricom Season One boys national champions, Kapenguria Heroes seek to reclaim their past glory when the Rift Valley regional finals get underway at the Green Stadium in Kericho County. Kapenguria, who are based in West Pokot, will have their bid severely tested by Transmara’s White Rhino in the boys' semi-finals first. Laiser Hill Academy from Kajiado will play Tumkas FC from Uasin Gishu in the other boys’ semis. In the girls’ semis, Itigo Girls from Nandi North face Achievers from Kajiado as Bomet Queens from Bomet take on Wiyeeta from West Pokot. Defending champions Kitale Queens and  Al-Ahly FC from Kajiado, who were runners up in the national finals, also failed to qualify. “One would easily mistake the grassroots for the finals going by how competitive the games were. The teams were allowed to have an additional three players in the spirit of tapping talent from the relegated teams and we expect an even tougher regional final with no team being perceived as an underdog,” said Evans Omondi, the tournament's Rift Valley region coordinator. The winning teams in the regional finals will walk away with Sh200,000 each and a chance to represent the region in the national finals,  where Sh 1 million is up for grabs in June. The runners up will pocket Sh 100,000 with a host of individual prizes set to be won. So far, Nairobi’s Dagoretti Mixed High, Beijing Raiders  (Starehe), Tumaini School (Makueni), Isiolo Starlets (Isiolo), North Eastern’s Berlin FC (Garissa), Coast region’s Yanga FC (Malindi), Kwale Ladies, Falling Waters(Laikipia0 and Ulinzi Youth (Nanyuki) have secured tickets to the national finals. After the regional finals, an All-Star team comprising of 16 girls and 16 boys will be selected to attend a 10-day training camp in Spain during which they will play friendlies against top Spanish La Liga Football Academies.
