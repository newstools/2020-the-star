Good evening, Health CS Mutahi Kagwe has this evening given new guidelines to businesses to contain the spread of the coronavirus. Meanwhile, a school in Bomet has defied President Uhuru Kenyatta's directive to remain shut to avoid the risk of the pandemic. These are some of the stories making headlines on the Star this evening. Health CS Mutahi Kagwe has urged PSV operators to carry less passengers in the fight against the coronavirus. "Fourteen seater matatus should carry eight passengers only," he said.    Pupils of Sigor Primary School in Chepalungu, Bomet county, are in school despite a government directive suspending learning activities in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. The school situated a few meters from the deputy county commissioner's office and the education office has been operating in open defiance of President Uhuru Kenyatta's order to all learning institutions to close. Modern Coast bus services has suspended its operations for buses going to Uganda, Tanzania and Rwanda. The Managing Director in a statement said the suspension is based on the directives given by the government with regards to travel to the said countries. South African Airways (SAA) said on Friday that it would immediately suspend all intercontinental flights until May 31 in response to a government travel ban aimed at stopping the spread of the coronavirus outbreak.   The Kenyan shilling fell to a new four and a half year low on Friday, extending its weakening streak due to persistent worries about the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on export earnings. At 0623 GMT, commercial banks quoted the shilling at 105.70/90 per dollar, a fresh low since late 2015, and down from 105.50/70 at Thursday's close.
