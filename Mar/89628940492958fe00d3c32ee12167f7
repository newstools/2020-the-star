President Uhuru Kenyatta has asked banks and mobile operators to reduce the cost of transactions as the country deals with the first two cases of Coronavirus. Uhuru on Sunday also stated that government offices, businesses, and companies are encouraged to allow employees to work from home apart from those in critical or essentials services. This is to avoid the risk of transmission through money and will encourage the use of cashless options. Kenyans have also been encouraged to avoid congregations and events in the church and to also minimize attendance to weddings and funerals. The restrictions are to immediate family members "Avoid shopping malls, entertainment places and minimize congestion in public transport whenever possible," the president urged. Visitors to hospitals both private and the public have also been limited and all hospitals and malls have been encouraged to provide soap, water, and sanitizers regularly. Uhuru also appeals to everyone to observe measures and remain calm as people spread misinformation that causes panic and anxiety "Kenyans have been faced with other crises and have triumphed. Everyone has to play part in safeguarding the nation and the lives of the people," Uhuru said. He added, "Pandemic will test us but I donâ€™t believe it will defeat us if we come together and everybody does their part and we shall by God's grace overcome the impacts. The government has also banned all travels in and out of the country and only Kenyan citizens with valid passports will be allowed in only if they test positive.
