Kabras coach Henley Du Plessis has said they will make tactical twitches for their upcoming Kenya and Enterprise Cup semifinals slated for later this month. The sugar millers will await the winner of this weekend playoff between Impala and Mwamba in the Kenya Cup in a fortnight and tackle Homeboyz in the Enterprise Cup semis. The South African tactician said they have few plays which they want to implement as both tournaments enter the business stage. "We have a few plays and tactical game plans we are working on as we try to be innovative," said Du Plessis. Du Plessis said they are working on improving at the breakdown and ensuring efficiency at set-pieces for the final few weeks of the campaign. "There are areas we are working on to ensure we don't get shocked in the playoffs. We have a couple of days to tighten those facets of play," he said. For the second year running, the Kakamega-based side have topped the log with 74 points and Du Plessis said the club is keen to end their three-year title drought. "It's the trophy that everyone here wants. We have been close in the last three years and now it's time to bring it home," he added. Du Plessis said they have a full squad with no injuries to report about. "Everyone is fit. The players were given a two-day break and resumed training today," added Du Plessis. Elsewhere, the Kenya Lionesses will have to improve on their defence ahead of the Challenger series in Stellenbosch South Africa at the end of the month, according to head coach Felix Oloo. "The team must adopt a good tackling technique. Our defence is one area we have worked on this year," said Oloo.
