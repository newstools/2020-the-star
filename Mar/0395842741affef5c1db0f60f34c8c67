The Presbyterian Church of East Africa has suspended physical services in the wake of COVID-19. In a statement signed by Rt Rev Julius Mwamba and secretary general Rev Peter Kaniah on Tuesday, the church said places of worship will remain open for individual worship despite all meetings and Sunday services being suspended. Services will be streamed online. The church, with a membership of 4.5 million believers, urged Kenyans to be hopeful, saying it is the antidote to fear. "Our prayer for the people of Kenya and the global community comes from Romans15:13 'May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in Him, so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit," the church said. President Uhuru Kenyatta on Sunday urged Kenyans to avoid public gatherings to avoid the risk of contracting COVID-19. His statement came two days after three cases of COVID-19 were confirmed in the country. PCEA has urged the government to increase the number of well-equipped screening centres across the country. It also called for the government to provide dignified care for those quarantined. The church also said water and other sanitisation services should be provided by the counties. The church also said the government should zero-rate taxes on essential commodities such as food.
