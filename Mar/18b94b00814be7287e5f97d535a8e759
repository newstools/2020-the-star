Chief Registrar of the Judiciary Anne Amadi has directed tribunals to devise ways of hearing urgent cases. In a statement, she said the mechanisms will be critical especially for the rent restriction tribunal, business premises tribunal and cooperative tribunal that serve a large number of people. “Any mechanisms put in place should take into consideration the directions from the Ministry of Health on handwashing, sanitising as well as social distancing,” Amadi said. The directions are part of 'further guidelines' on how courts should operate to mitigate the effects of Covid-19. The registrar said judges continue to review files and forward them for purposes of decongesting prisons supported by skeleton staff in each station for an extended period of two weeks. “The Judiciary will separately issue a statement on the number of prisoners so far released,” she said. In addition, the magistrates' courts have availed a list of contact persons for all court stations for purposes of processing very urgent case inquiries. For civil matters, the National Council on Administration of Justice committee has recommended that the deputy registrar in liaison with a judge constitute court as soon as practicable to hear urgent cases. The committee further states that staff stationed at registries during this period be provided with protective gear, including gloves, masks and sanitisers while serving and transport to and from their homes. The courts, through the Judiciary website, have provided phone contacts of deputy registrars or liaison persons who can be reached by litigants and advocates for all inquiries. Email addresses have also been provided. The NCAJ committee was appointed to monitor the administrative and contingency management plan to mitigate Covid-19 in the justice sector.
