Promotion chasing duo of Nairobi City Stars and Nairobi Stima go head-to-head at Camp Toyoyo in a National Super League encounter seeking to get a morale-boosting advantage over their rivals in the race to the Kenyan Premier League. The two teams sit top and fourth respectively, separated by 13 points but Stima midfielder Moses Odhiambo is confident they can bring back on track their dreams of taking the club to the top tier by beating the leaders. “It is going to be a big test for us against the best team in the league but getting a result against them will provide a huge psychological advantage in our aspiration,” said Odhiambo. With 25 matches played so far, both teams have played a game fewer than their rivals. Third-placed Vihiga United will also play Shabana at the Mumias Sports Complex in order to maintain their position in the standings against a looming Nairobi Stima. Second-placed Bidco will not be in action as their attentions are on their Super cup duel against fellow second-tier side Fortune Sacco at Kianyaga Stadium in Murang’a.
