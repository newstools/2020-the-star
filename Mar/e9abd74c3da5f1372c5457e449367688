Former journalist Moses Dola, convicted of manslaughter in his wife's death,  asked the court to review his 10-year sentence and put him on probation. He was sentenced in 2018 for killing his wife Sarah Wambui Kabiru,  a NTV reporter. He had been a crime reporter for now-defunct Nairobi Metro. Dola who is representing himself sought a second chance and asked the court for clemency. "The sentence imposed on me falls within the probative terms and I do hereby request the honourable court to consider ordering it to be served under probation," he told justice Luka Kimaru. In a three-page application, Dola asked the court to substitute probation for the sake of natural justice and alternative sentencing. He was charged with murder but the charge was reduced to manslaughter. In the affidavit filed in court Dola says he is a first offender, remorseful and has undergone rehabilitation in prison including counselling. He is begging for a second chance. Dola wants the court to consider the 23 months he spent in custody before posting bail as part of his sentence. He claims his family has initiated reconciliatory talks with the deceased's family and he hopes to reach a customary consensus for the sake of his 10-year-old son who is half-orphaned following the death of his mother. In 2018, High Court Judge Roselyn Korir substituted the murder charge with manslaughter. Dola was found guilty of the offence in October 2018. Kabiru was found dead on May 1, 2011, in their house in Umoja estate. Dola went into hiding but he turned himself in at Naivasha police station three days later. The judge said no one who could say exactly what happened to Kabiru on that day because they were the only ones in the bedroom when the killing took place. The judge, however, ruled that all evidence showed Dola caused the death of his wife. (Edited by H. Makori)
