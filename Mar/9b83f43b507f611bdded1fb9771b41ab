Nairobi County Government aims to train at least 3,500 health workers on Coronavirus by Friday. This comes as the county prepares to handle patients with suspected cases on the Covid- 19. During a press briefing at City Hall on Tuesday, Nairobi County Health Executive Hitam Majevdia states that as of Monday, 80 health officers had been trained at Mbagathi, 112 in Mama Lucy, 60 in Pumwani Maternity and 38 at Mutuini. On Tuesday, 100 health workers will undergo training on Coronavirus. “50 are at STC Casino health centre and 50 at Pumwani Maternity,” Majevdia said. “This shows as a county Nairobi is ready and prepared to handle corona cases and with the help with collaboration with stakeholders from the ministry of health and transport,” Majevdia stated. The county has also urged city residents to access services online where necessary. “People should take necessary preventative measures and avoid crowded places when necessary,” Majevdia added. Mbagathi Hospital chairman George Osewe urged the county and media to sensitise the public on the right information. “There is denial that the coronavirus is not here with us and people are not taking preventative measures seriously. We need to give the public the correct information and report as it is,” he said. Osewe noted that Monday’s strike was under control and services are running at the facility. “The public should not fear to visit Mbagathi in case of any suspicious case on coronavirus,” he added. The county will also conduct air fumigation in the CBD and its surroundings as from Wednesday to ensure street families are also sanitized. The county’s deputy director for health Wilson Lang’at said the fumigators will be mounted on the county vehicles and will move around CBD. “Street families and children are still part of us and we shall ensure they are also safe,” he said. The Ministry of Health will provide the necessary equipment for the process.
