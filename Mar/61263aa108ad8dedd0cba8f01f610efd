Kenya is now ranked 122 in the world ranking but Morans tactician Cliff Owuor believes they should be higher following a sterling performance in the continental scene last year. Following FIBA Afro Basket 2021 Pre-qualifiers in January, South Sudan (86.4) moved up 16 spots into 107th place despite losing to Kenya. Kenya (72.7) rose by 11 and are now ranked 122 ahead of Burundi (67.9), who gained nine positions after the Nairobi meet and are ranked 126th. “I am surprised with the rankings,” Owuor said,  adding “In all honesty, we should be ahead of South Sudan because they have not been competing in this event.” He added: “We beat them and should be up. But I appreciate this development because it is encouraging. We still have a lot of room to improve to another level.” In another development,  South Sudan has a chance to play in the Afrobasket 2021 after FIBA Africa introduced a wildcard qualifying tournament from June 27-29 at a venue to be announced later. This competition will feature four teams including Cape Verde, Chad and Zimbabwe and will determine the last spot. Only the winner of the event will earn a ticket to the tournaments biggest spectacle to be staged in Kigali, Rwanda.
