Wasafi signee and Diamond Platnumz’ best friend Rayvanny has left tongues wagging after commenting on Tanasha Donna and her baby daddy’s breakup. Diamond has children with different women from three East African countries: Zari (Uganda), Hamisa (Tanzania) and Tanasha Donna (Kenya). Rayvanny shared a post thanking the women for giving Diamond children, and asked his fans to name a country they wanted his boss to get a woman from. "Kenya, Uganda and Tanzani, Asanteni kwa watoto. Tumemalizana Na East Africa. Je mnataka Simba asongee nchi gani tena???" he wrote on social media. The 'Tetema' hit singer realised Diamond wasn’t done with East Africa yet and he corrected himself in another post, which read, "Oooh!!! Poleni Bado naskia Rwanda na Burundi ndo tumalizane na Mambo ya East Africa," he wrote. Rayvanny’s harsh remarks on Tanasha and Diamond’s failed relationship comes barely a year after he parted ways with his baby mama, Fahyma. Tanasha and Diamond have broken up and Tanasha claims it is due to disrespect from her baby daddy.
