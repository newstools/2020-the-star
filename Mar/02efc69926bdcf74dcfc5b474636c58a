The US Embassy has given its citizens in Kenya the last chance to leave the country even as the number of coronavirus cases shot up to 25. Kenya Airways indicated it will offer a flight for US citizens and US Lawful Permanent Residents departing JKIA on Wednesday, March 25, 2020, at 2100 hours, provided it can sell all the seats on this flight. “We understand from the Kenyan government that there are no plans for flights after midnight tonight. If you wish to depart Kenya, this will be your last opportunity for an indefinite period of time.” “This will be a direct flight to John F. Kennedy International Airport, New York, NY. The cost of an economy class ticket on this flight will be $3350, and the price of a business class ticket will be $4000,” the embassy noted. The foreigners were asked to contact KQ at these numbers (+254 741 131 526 , +254 203 274 747, +254 711 024 647, +254 741 984 764) for available seating on the flight leaving tonight at 9:00pm. Kenya Airways indicated that ticket sales for this flight will end at 1500 hours Kenya local time. This comes hours after British Airways opened up a small number of additional flights from Nairobi to London in a bid to evacuate British nationals. “For those wishing to return to the UK, we recommend you book as early as possible for the flights. Please visit ba.com to book,” the UK embassy said via Twitter on Wednesday. The UK High Commissioner to Kenya Jane Marriott warned that the flights were only outbound.
