 The Busia county government will sponsor 130 students to save KCA Amagoro University campus from closure due to low enrolment. Governor Sospeter Ojaamong said his government will sponsor the students to undertake various courses with more to be sponsored in the next financial year. Speaking during a consultative meeting with the University Council in Busia led by vice-chancellor Noah Midamba, Ojaamong said the presence of the university in Busia has improved education standards as more students aspire to join the college owing to its proximity. The governor assured Midamba of his government's commitment to ensure the sustainability of the college by sponsoring students through various funds offered by his administration. He said they will also use sensitisation programmes to encourage parents to enrol their children in the institution. Midamba, who was with chief finance and operations officer Michael Ingutia and council member Prof Olubayi Olubayi, said his team was happy to hear from MCAs Nancy Okademi (nominated) and David Kokonya (Malaba South). They are former students of the university. The VC said he was excited about the county government's commitment to sponsor students to undertake studies at the institution, noting that he will communicate to council members on the latest developments that will change the earlier decision to close down the college. "Students should brace for a blend of courses offered at KCA which has the highest employability at 80 per cent and is rated the best private university in Kenya," Midamba said. He said the college will introduce TVET courses to enrich youths with requisite technical skills. County assembly speaker Bernard Wamalwa said they will push for more budgetary allocation to sponsor more students to join KCA.  Edited by R.Wamochie
