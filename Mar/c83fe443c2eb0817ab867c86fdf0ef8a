Organisers of the Concours d’Elegance have postponed their upcoming events due to coronavirus. “Due to the restrictions on functions caused by the outbreak of the coronavirus, it is regretted that we have had to postpone the TV Programme Premiere and launch of the regulations for the Golden Jubilee Africa Concours d’Elegance,” organiser Bob Dewar said. He added: “When the restrictions are lifted, another bulletin will be issued for all officials and competitors inviting you to this popular motoring and social event on a new date.” “Meanwhile, it is business as usual in the Concours office at the Bob Dewar Publicity suite in Block G of Norfolk Towers, Kijabe Street. Volunteers are receiving entries and dealing with queries,” Dewar went on. “For those competitors who have not already entered the classiest event on the Kenya Motor Sport calendar, we recommend that you use the current lull in activity to submit your entry.” To help competitors meet the cost of participating in the Concours d’Elegance, organisers Alfa Romeo Owners Club has held the entry fees at the same level. “The entry fee remains Sh4,000 plus Sh500 for temporal membership of the Alfa Romeo Owners Club. Competitors with more than one entry will pay Sh3,000 for each additional entry. Printed regulations and entry forms for the Concours d’Elegance will be available in due course,” he said. Two of the latest entries on the list for Concours car competitors are the 1961 MGA roadster of David Filmer and Gayling May’s 1967 Alfa Romeo Sprint 2600 coupe.
