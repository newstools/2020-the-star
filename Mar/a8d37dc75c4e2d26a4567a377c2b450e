The sale of illicit brews is returning in Central Kenya following the closure of bars, but the government has put those involved on notice. Regional coordinator Wilfred Nyagwanga said security officers are on high alert and will deal with unscrupulous traders. The government closed all bars and entertainment joints as a measure to prevent the spread of Covid-19. "We are making sure the community and Nyumba Kumi will work with us so we ensure the area is safe and secure," Nyagwanga said. The administrator said though the majority of residents have adhered to state directives, some people still want to lead the same lifestyle they had before the virus was confirmed in Kenya. He cited those hawking goods along the highways. Nyagwang expressed concern that they do not comply with the handwashing or sanitising directive. He added that they do not honour social distancing. "We still have congestion is some of our bus stages and the keeping of social distance of one-and-a-half metres is still an issue. But we want to insist that all the directives must be observed," Nyagwanga said. He cautioned that those not observing the directives will be dealt with accordingly and appealed to all residents to support the war on the virus. People must prepare to start sleeping early from Friday after President Uhuru Kenyatta imposed a curfew from 7 pm to 5 am, as security officers in the region are ready to enforce the curfew, he said.
