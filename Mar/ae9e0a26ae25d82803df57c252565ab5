Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i has threatened to sue blogger Robert Alai over a publication he says is libelous. Matiang'i's lawyer, Donald Kipkorir, in a demand letter wants Alai to immediately pull down a publication titled “Concrete blasting company associated with CS Fred Matiang’i, accused of raining havoc in Kisii”. The CS says the publication as it appeared in the online blog -Kahawa Tungu - on March 13, written by Francis Muli, was meant to indicate that he is the owner of the alleged quarry in Kisii and that he has caused the death and injury of the residents of Nyamonema Getengo sublocation in Bobasi Kisii. “Our instructions are to demand your immediate pulling down of the said publication and all links to it. If the above demands are not complied with immediately, we have instructions to file suit to compel their removal and to pursue damages and costs for libel,” reads part of the letter Edited by A.N
