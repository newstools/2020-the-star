A possible drugs shortage is feared in Malindi following the Covid-19 pandemic that has affected supplies from India and China. A spot check in chemists in Malindi revealed they were still well stocked but there was a worry the supplies could be finished soon. Pharmacists say drugs could be available but at a higher price since the normal supply markets like China and India may not be able to bring in stocks. At Mijikenda pharmacy, Samuel Muhoro said in the near future there will be a shortage of essential drugs. "So far there is a shortage of drugs from suppliers. Many drugs are running out of stock. Now that will be the issue," he said. Muhoro said masks were missing as suppliers did not have any stock. He said drugs were slowly going out of stock and the prices of drugs have gone up. Kenya buys generic drugs from Asian countries which are supplied in bulk and at a cheap price. However, with the current pandemic, the pharmacist said they will be forced to go for branded drugs from Western countries which are very expensive. "We have industries in Kenya. They can begin producing the drugs though I do not know whether the capacity is there," he said. He said Kenya had the capacity to produce drugs such as cough syrups and anti-malarials but not complicated ones. Kilifi county health executive Omar Anisa said they last received drugs between November and December last year for the second quarter. Most health facilities in the county still have full stocks of drugs, Anisa said. Edited by Henry Makori
