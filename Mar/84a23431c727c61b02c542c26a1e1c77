The government has dismissed claims of a possible lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic. Government spokesperson Cyrus Oguna on Wednesday said the stories doing the rounds on social media are misleading. "There is information on social media of a possible lockdown in Kenya. The information is false, misinforming and causing panic. Don’t consume such content whose source can’t be verified," Oguna said in a statement on Wednesday. He asked Kenyans to remain calm and only rely on information from the right sources which is the Ministry of Health or himself. For the better part of the week, there has been speculation on social media that President Uhuru Kenyatta would announce a total lockdown as the confirmed Covid-19 cases continued to rise. The number of coronavirus cases in the country now stands at 25 since the last update on Tuesday. Nine new cases were recorded within 24 hours from tests carried out on 82 suspected cases. The tests were done at the National Influenza Centre, Kemri Nairobi, Kemri Kilifi and Aga Khan University Hospital. Globally, at least 440,145 people have tested positive for the virus which has claimed 19,751 lives.
