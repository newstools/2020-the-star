National Cereals and Produce Board men's team extended their winning run with a 41-24 win over the Gunners to open a two-point gap at the top the table. The team remain unbeaten after 15 matches, amassing 30 points. Black Mamba and Ulinzi, the other unbeaten sides, have 28 and 26 points respectively. NCPB team Manager Edna Kasandi said it is the obligation of the players to utilise their chances and as well adapt to the variations in tactics although embracing the 'one game at a time approach'. "The new tactics in training are meant to sharpen our attack and solidify the team defensively. The players have taken it positively and we just want them to show it more," Kasandi said. "The title race is very open this season with three teams still unbeaten. We are not throwing our chances away and for this reason, we are optimistic for a successful title defence. Ulinzi and Mamba will really push us hard to win all our matches." Elsewhere, Ulinzi overpowered both St. Paul's University and Gunners 41-24, 58-22 respectfully to move to fourth while Mamba's 29-19 triumph over  Boomerang moved them to second with 28 points. Rangers drop to third on inferior goal difference. Meanwhile, Generation secured all the points against Administration Police with 35-31 scoreline. The AP side also lost Nanyuki and Boomerang.
