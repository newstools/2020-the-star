The growth of Nairobi in terms of population – based on the recent Census – is worrying to both the private sector and government in terms of service provision. Most of the people in Nairobi, in town or even the estates, are not necessarily in the city for work but are idling around or looking for jobs or just visiting. With the Covid-19 pandemic, the leadership needs to keenly look at the process of decongesting the city to reduce fatalities in cases. The government has directed citizens to take precautionary measures against the fast-spreading disease such as self-isolating when one exhibits symptoms of flu and avoiding congesting any one place. Kenyans should realise the seriousness of this matter and put off enjoyment for as long as the danger lurks in the streets. Public gatherings – including the much-hyped BBI rallies – have been banned indefinitely. President Uhuru Kenyatta in his address to the county on the deadly virus advised Kenyans to avoid entertainment joints. But the joints should be banned too as Governor Hassan Joho did in his Mombasa county. Citizens should also take up a personal initiative and constantly wash their hands with water and soap and sanitise, not touch their faces and avoid crowded places; not only for our own safety but also for the safety of the whole nation.
