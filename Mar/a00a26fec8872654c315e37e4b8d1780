The government has warned traders not to take advantage of coronavirus to hike prices of items. Health CS Mutahi Kagwe said on Friday common items, including medicine, should not be hiked. "This is not the time to start making abnormal profits by charging abnormal prices. It would be immoral for anybody to take advantage of a situation like this," the CS said. The CS said there is an expected shortage of certain items in the country since the supply of goods from China will be halted. China is the epicentre of coronavirus. This comes after the first case of coronavirus was reported in the country on Friday. The patient was a Kenyan citizen who returned on March 5 from the US via London, UK. Kagwe further urged Kenyans to remain calm and continue with their normal activities.
