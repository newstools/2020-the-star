Kwale residents have decried water shortage and appealed to the county government to fix the problem. Their complaints come a week after Governor Salim Mvurya and Water executive Martin Kuya promised to address the crisis. Many taps remain dry and residents have to travel long distances to get water. Some have to excuse themselves from work because of the ravaging scarcity. The Water Services Regulatory Board had said Kwale loses about Sh38 million annually to non-revenue water. Resident John Sungula said some few areas in Kwale town received water for a while, then it stopped. He blamed poor planning for their suffering and urged the county administration to find a solution. "The Water Department must improve on some small areas and address the hiccups," he said. Executive Kuya, however, said power problems have hampered supply and led to rationing. He said once the problem is fixed, it will be possible to distribute water to the entire town. He said alternative measures are being undertaken to instal solar panels. But Sungula said leakages also affect water flow. He added that the county must monitor the distribution pipes to prevent illegal water connections. Sungula urged the county to focus on the main challenge. Residents say they pay bills on time and the department has no reason not to better their services. "If people make timely payment, then it's a right for them to have water," Sangula said. Another resident, Bijuma Abdallah, said it is difficult to do domestic chores given the shortage is a disaster. She said women do laundry in rivers, risking their health and that of their children. "Good sanitation is important, especially for ladies there are some clothes that need special treatment when comes to washing," Abdallah said. Butchery attendant Mwamakoti Mwakoroga said their business has suffered. He said meat requires proper hygiene and water is essential.
