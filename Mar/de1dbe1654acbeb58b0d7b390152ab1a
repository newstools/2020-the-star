As Kisumu residents grapple with curfew order to slow down the spread of coronavirus, thugs are taking advantage of them at night. Residents have reported being terrorised in Lolwe, Migosi, Carwash and  Mamboleo estates by criminals breaking into and robbing houses at night. They said the armed criminals break their windows, doors and even roofs to access the house before stealing everything. Erick Rabuogi wants police to beef up security in estates. Rabuogi said more than 15 water meters belonging to Kisumu Water and Sanitation Company were stolen at the National Housing-Kanywar court on the Kisumu-Kakamega road. “We’re in a dire situation of the pandemic and residents are vulnerable. Let the police take these criminals head-on." On Sunday night, thugs broke into a shop belonging to ODM Nyanza coordinator Kennedy Ajwang and stole everything. They gained entry from the rooftop. Ajwang said the thugs used a hacksaw to cut the roof and grills. “I lost goods worth more than Sh 340,000." After the robbery, the thieves removed the goods through the door, closed it and escaped the way they came, he said. The same night, Ajwang said, the thugs broke into a neighbouring shop and stole goods before heading to Silver Swan restaurant opposite Cosmos bar. They wanted to steal the TV screens but fled after the watchman raised alarm, he added. Ajwang, who is also the county party vice-chairman, said police should safeguard shops during the curfew. A panga-wielding gang has also allegedly been attacking people. On Sunday night, it attacked a caretaker in Lolwe Estate leaving with injuries on his head. Police commander Ranson Lolmondoni said they are aware and patrols have been enhanced. “We have put up measures to arrest those criminals," he said, urging shop owners to hire watchmen especially with curfew directive.
