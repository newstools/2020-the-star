A Kitui MCAs panel is undecided on whether to reject or approve a nominee to the county public service board after receiving two controversial letters about him. The Appointments committee chaired by Speaker George Ndotto is unsure whether to rely on a document saying David Munyao was deregistered by TSC or another which says the nominee is still recognised by the agency as a tutor. Munyao is among six people nominated by Governor Charity Ngilu to the County Public Service Board and who were vetted by Ndotto's team on Monday. Others are Francis Kiliku (chairman), Joseph Kyavoa, Bernard Munyasya and Esther Kasyoka. Petitioner Sammy Kisilu presented an affidavit to Ndottoâ€™s committee seeking to block Munyao's appointment, saying he had been fired by the Teachers Service Commission for immorality. Kisilu attached the TSC dismissal letter to the petition that was read to Munyao during vetting on Monday. The letter dated February 2018 said Munyao was dismissed from employment. It was signed by J.K Mutai on behalf of TSC secretary. Munyao dismissed the letter and produced another dated March 3 saying he was a registered and recognised teacher working under TSC. The two letters threw Ndotto's team into confusion. Residents are also keenly watching the appointments given none of the six nominees has any formal training in human resources. Ndotto on Wednesday said his committee will release a report on the vetting before the end of the week. He said the final decision rests with the entire house that will consider whether to endorse or reject their report on the nominees.  edited by p. obuya
