President Uhuru Kenyatta will this Saturday lead a digital national prayer day as Kenya strives to prevent the number of Covid-19 cases from rising from seven. This, as Health CS Mutahi Kagwe on Friday told Kenyans to prepare for the worst, adding that a surge in Covid-19 cases is usually experienced after 14 days. The President had on Tuesday announced the prayers will be streamed live from State House from noon. Uhuru said his administration has learnt over time that turning to God in such times gives the country not only comfort but also hope and strength to overcome even those challenges that seem insurmountable. "With this in mind and after consulting a cross-section of ordinary Kenyans as well as our religious leaders, I have decided to declare this coming Saturday, 21st March 2020, as a National Day for Prayer," Uhuru said in a statement. Italy on Thursday surpassed China in the number of deaths reported from the disease and on Friday, 627 people died, raising the death toll to more than 4,000.
