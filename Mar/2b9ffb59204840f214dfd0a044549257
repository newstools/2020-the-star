Meru county has come up with a raft of measure to combat coronavirus and set aside Sh20 million for that purpose. Governor Kiraitu Murungi has banned public gatherings in recreational parks and cancelled market business on Fridays, Wednesdays and Mondays. (These are the official market days.) County staff are expected to work from home except those in vital departments like revenue enforcement and fire and rescue. Isolation wards have been set side at Meru Teaching and Referral Hospital (20 beds) and Mboroga Health Centre (15 beds) in case the virus is reported in the county. “We should all take care of ourselves,” Kiraitu declared as he ordered the closure of night clubs, discos and recreational centres like Nteere Park and all stadiums for 30 days. Public Health director John Inanga said all hawking has been banned. Also targeted for closure are all business premises without running water and hand sanitisers. All these measures come amid a go-slow by health workers over the delay of their February salaries. Clinical officers secretary-general Moses Bayenia said medical workers are yet to be trained on how to tackle the coronavirus pandemic. “Furthermore, we do not have protective gear and we are yet to be paid to buy the items for ourselves.” He said the Covid-19 isolation ward is too close to other wards. Meru Referral Hospital said medical workers were adequately trained. “We don’t need to train all 1,900 health workers. Those who deal with broken bones do not require this training,” a spokesperson said. The hospital has trained about 30 officials to deal with the crisis. The facility is screening patients and sanitising before they enter the building. On Wednesday, the county government explained to journalists all aspects of the Covid-19. Edited by R.Wamochie
