Most markets in Vihiga on Friday remained deserted as security officers enforced the stay at home order to curb the spread of Covid-19. Security officers barred traders from accessing Mbale, Chavakali, Esibuye, Mudete, Cheptul, Majengo Esirulo and Luanda markets. County police commander Hassan Barua told the Star on the phone on Thursday no trader will be allowed to operate in the market. “We are not doing this to harm anybody but it’s for the safety of everyone. Stay at home to protect yourself,” he said. The government had banned public gatherings to stop the spread of the coronavirus.  Edited by A.N
