The High Court has dismissed the impeachment of Baringo assembly deputy speaker Ameja Zelemoi, saying it did not meet the threshold. Judge Edward Mureithi in Kabarnet said he was convinced the MCAs who voted to remove Zelemoi did not attain the 75 per cent required by the law. “I therefore order him to stay in office for the next seven days pending the hearing of the case on March 26,” Mureithi ruled. Mureithi heard that the speaker was neither given sufficient time to be heard nor a right of reply to respond to the charges leveled against him. On Wednesday, Zelemoi was impeached and immediately replaced by Kisana MCA Jacob Cheboiwo. He sued through lawyer Kipkoech Ng’etich of Gordon Ogola and Kipkoech Advocates. Among accusations leveled against him was misusing the assembly vehicle he was assigned to ferry cabbages for sale in Nakuru. He was also accused of colluding with his colleagues to fight Silale MCA Nelson Lotela in his office last year. Tiaty MP William Kamket and other leaders welcomed the ruling, saying “we are now happy as Pokot leaders to see justice done.” Kamket said he saw the impeachment as a political battle to scuttle Kanu ahead of 2022. “People must learn politics is always dynamic. Today you sit on the majority seat and next time you either land in minority or the opposition but peace and cohesiveness must always prevail” he said. Edited by Henry Makori
