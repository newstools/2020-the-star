Seven Chinese quarantined for fourteen days in Turkana have tested negative for the coronavirus. Turkana chief officer for Health Robert Abok said the county has been monitoring Chinese who have self-quarantined for 14 days. The seven came into the county at different times hence they phased quarantine measures. The Chinese quarantined are attached to a construction company building the A1 road from Kitale to Juba. On Wednesday, Turkana, Governor Josphat Nanok confirmed that seven Chinese had successfully completed the quarantine period and were declared safe. Abok said the health surveillance team is educating residents on measures to prevent infection and what to do in case of illness. “Health teams are all over in airstrips such as Lokichogio, Lokichar, Kakuma and Lodwar to screen passengers. We also have three vehicles for the work,” he said. Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe on Wednesday said there are now seven positive cases in the country.
