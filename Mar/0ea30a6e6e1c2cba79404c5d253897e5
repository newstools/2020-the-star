Uganda has ordered the closure of all learning institutions for a period of one month. President Yoweri Museveni on Wednesday said by Friday, March 20, all the learners should have arrived at their homes. Museveni said this is in line with measures taken by his government in stoppage of a possible infection. “I have directed all the 51,000 learning institutions to close by Friday midday. All the 15 million learners should be in their homes by then,” he said. In a status briefing, Museveni said though Uganda has not confirmed any positive case, it was wise to take precautionary measures rather than last minute. “When it comes to matters of health it is better to be a coward and be on the side of caution. If we run away from nothing it shall be well, and if there is the danger we would have avoided,” Museveni said. He said the directive will be reviewed after a month. Museveni said as a result, his government has with immediate effect suspended all religious gatherings including Sunday services and open-air meetings. He said those who intend to pray can do so in their homes, watch on televisions or listen to radios. “There shall be no political gatherings and this includes all cultural gatherings until further notice,” he said. Museveni said though, with a population of 42 million people, Uganda has had several alarms but luckily all tested negative. So far Kenya has confirmed three new cases raising the number to seven while Tanzania has three cases.
