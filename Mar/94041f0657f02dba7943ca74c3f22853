Singer Ruth Matete says she was in a relationship in which she was not appreciated. She says she was so scared of being herself with her ex. "Back when I was dating, I had to be the perfect girlfriend, marriage material... the whole nine yards, or is it six yards?" she said. Ruth is married to Nigerian pastor  John Apewajoye, whom she says appreciates her so much. "I met my husband and I have never felt so free. Wow! He's my best friend," she said, adding she can be silly with him without feeling any less of a woman. "But the cooking, I do in the house. Jezos. I learned how to make chapatis today. He laughed at the shape but still ate them," she said. Ruth and her husband are expecting their first child. Matete shared photos of her baby bump and wrote, “With my pepper soup, trying to keep social distance. No touching. No hugging. Mercy Lord.”
