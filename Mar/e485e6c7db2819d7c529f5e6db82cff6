  The Vihiga government has allocated Sh20 million from its contingency fund to be used for emergency response in case of an outbreak of coronavirus. Governor Wilbur Ottichilo said they were engaging the national government for more funding as the county prepares for the Covic-19 pandemic. He ordered business premises and social joints to remain closed if they fail to provide hand-washing points and sanitizers at points of entry. No night clubs will be allowed to operate for the next 30 days and clients visiting various entertainment joints were ordered to keep a one-meter social distance. Ottichillo issued the orders on Tuesday when he addressed reporters at the County Referral Hospital in Mbale. He was with deputy governor Patrick Saisi, county commissioner Ochillo Oyugi and health executive member Amos Kutwa. “We are appealing to those with dead bodies at the County Referral Hospital Mortuary to pick them with immediate effect for instant burials and avoid funeral ceremonies due to the situation we are in," Ottichilo said. We have put up hand-washing points at public office entrances to enhance frequent washing of hands as per the guidelines by President Uhuru Kenyatta, the governor said. He urged matatu operators to sanitise their vehicles after every trip as a way of preventing the spread of coronavirus. Ottichillo said an isolation unit has been set up at the County Referral Hospital with hotlines numbers 0798638872 and 0711489604 for anyone with an emergency case. “We are leaving nothing to chance. All guests entering the facility are being screened," he said. He added, "Health workers in all subcounty hospitals have been trained on identifying patients and referral of patients with symptoms similar to those of Covid-19.” He asked parents to ensure their children do not roam or visit relatives and friends because schools have been closed.  edited by p. obuya
