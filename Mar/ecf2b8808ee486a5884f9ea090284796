The Kisumu county assembly has suspended its sittings as a coronavirus control measure. Majority leader Kenneth Onyango moved the motion to have the assembly adjourned after Kenya reported the seventh case of coronavirus. Onyango said already a number of county assemblies across the country had stopped operations. He told the house that the County Assembly Forum had issued a circular to all the 47 assemblies to adjourn their sittings for 15 days. When the motion was opened for debate, MCAs said it was important to obey the Ministry of Health directives on prevention of crowding and social distancing. Manyatta B MCA Pamela Odhiambo took issue with the directive to ban any activity in the markets. Odhiambo said the directive was put in place without looking at the wider impact. She noted that markets provide employment opportunities to many people and banning them without proper consultation is not fair for residents. Health committee chairman Vincent Jagongo took the MCAs through some of the measures the county government has put in place to deal with any confirmed case of coronavirus. Jagongo said the measures put in place if followed strictly will keep the disease at bay. MCAs unanimously agreed to suspend sittings as they promised to rally their electorates to observe hygiene.
