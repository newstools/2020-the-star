A 65-year-old Kahawa West watchman has denied committing bestiality with his landlord's hen. Pius Mwendo Kinzilo allegedly lured the hen by dropping food near his abode on January 30. His landlord, Francis Waweru, rears chicken and ducks. Makadara chief magistrate Heston Nyaga was on Friday told that Waweru was away at the time of the alleged offence, but he arrived shortly thereafter with two neighbours and found the bird dead under a motor vehicle. The landlord asked the accused what had happened to the chicken and the man said he had accidentally killed it. He promised to pay for it the following day as he was rushing to work. Waweru and the neighbours examined the carcass and found part of the intestines protruding. They took the carcass and filed a complaint at Kahawa West Police Post. Mwendo was arrested and his trousers found with bloodstains.Â  The following day, the clothing item and the carcass were taken to a veterinarian who established that the hen was violated. Mwendo, who had been ordered to undergo a psychiatric examination, was released on a Sh100,000 bond with a surety in similar amount. The hearing resumes on July 9.
