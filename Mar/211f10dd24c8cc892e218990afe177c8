MKU chairman Simon Gicharu said the partnerships will nurture students and given them footings in future careers. “I urge MKU and Loras College Management to develop an MoU as soon as possible. I also urge staff and students of the three institutions to identify joint projects that they can undertake,” Gicharu said. Gicharu has praised current partnerships the institution has entered, including with Leuphana University, Germany. In September last year, MCU signed an exchange agreement with Manchester Metropolitan University. “Since 2018, MKU has received students from Bonn Rhein Sieg University of Germany for three weeks and more are coming in March," Gicharu said.
