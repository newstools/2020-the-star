A day like yesterday, 17 years ago, Kenya lost a promising star, E-Sir. Nameless, his close friend, took to Instagram to celebrate a life well lived. He shared their photos together and captioned them, "If only. Missing you bro. Today it's been 17years since you left us with your inspiring legacy! You understood synergy at a very young age." Adding, "You understood the market very well. You understood your gifts and passion and used them well. You achieved your purpose and your spirit lives as you continue to inspire new generations. Your spirit energy was about love and that's why people love you so much. As I continue to evolve I begin to understand your role in my life. Thank you for being part of my inspiration," he wrote. E-sir died in a road accident on the Nakuru-Nairobi highway. Nameless and E-Sir were travelling in the same car when the accident happened on their way back to Nairobi from a concert at Afraha Stadium in Nakuru.
