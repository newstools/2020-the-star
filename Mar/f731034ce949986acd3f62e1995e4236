Embu Governor Martin Wambora and MCAs have ended their protracted feuds, marking a new dawn for the county. Deputy assembly speaker Steve Munene has sought to assure residents of accelerated development following their meeting with the county chief. Munene said June 30, 2019, to December 31 was the worst period for the county government as the executive and legislative arms were entangled in factional, political and legal battles. He, however, expressed confidence that their newfound love will make room for exemplary service delivery. The Runyenjes Central MCA said the meeting was held last week at Izaak Walton Inn. They resolved to work together for the benefit of residents. He told residents to expect streamlined services and rapid rollout of development projects a few weeks hence. The MCA said their decision to bury the hatchet and get down to work was reached after weeks of soul-searching and consultations on the sticking matters that were causing a rift between leaders. He spoke on Thursday at the assembly. Ruguru Ngandori MCA Muturi Mwombo declared that the deal may amount to nought if certain issues they had raised are not immediately addressed. He, however, thanked Wambora for his willingness to join hands with the assembly in his quest to leave a desirable legacy after his 10-year tenure ends. He appealed to the executive not to be afraid to crack the whip on officers who would be flagged by the legislature as being incompetent. He said no officer should be noncompliant with the statutes that require them to physically appear before assembly committees from time to time to shed light on pertinent county issues. The leaders collectively pledged to support Wambora as his leadership enters the home straight towards the next election.Â  The MCAs said the county leadership will seek political solutions to political problems, including sending of emissaries and organising roundtable consultative meetings as opposed to litigation, intimidation and arm-twisting.
