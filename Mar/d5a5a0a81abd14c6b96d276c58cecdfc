Bumula  MP Mwambu Mabonga has said he will this week table an impeachment motion against the four Cabinet Secretaries who allowed a plane carrying 239 passengers from China to land in the country. Mabonga said Rachel Omamo (Foreign affairs), James Macharia (Transport), Fred Matiang'i (Interior) and Cecil Kariuki (Health) put the lives of Kenyans at risk. "We are going to table their names in Parliament for impeachment for their attitude towards millions of Kenyans," Mabonga said. Speaking when he launched Sh25 million constituency bursary fund at Musakasa training institute, the MP said despite other countries banning flights from China, Kenya went ahead to allow the passengers from the coronavirus-hit country. He said the four Cabinet Secretaries failed in their duties and did not protect Kenyans as required by the Constitution. ''It's now clear that the said CSs failed to protect Kenyan citizens and we don't see the reason why they should not be impeached," he said. The MP said they were not going to accept results from tests on the passengers, claiming the tests were being carried out by Chinese doctors who are not independent. "How shall we ascertain that the results of the passengers are true as they are not being carried out by an independent person?" he posed. The lawmaker said even if the passengers had been under 14 days quarantine the CSs had already exposed Kenyans to the risk of the deadly disease. Mabonga asked the bursary beneficiaries to work hard so that they could realise the importance of the kitty to them. He also appealed to local head teachers  not to send away students who had not completed  fees as his office was working on ways of assisting the needy ones. ''Next week I will be going around in day schools and identifying needy students who will then be given bursaries. So I am appealing to principals to be patient," he said.
