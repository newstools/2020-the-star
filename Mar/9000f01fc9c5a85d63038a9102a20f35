The government now says those who fail to self quarantine upon arrival in the country risk being fined or serving a jail sentence. Through Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe, the government said stringent measures have been initiated at the ports of entry, especially airports, to ensure all the guidelines are adhered to. Kagwe said as a result, Kenyans arriving in the country will have to swear a legal document that they will comply with the directive, failing which action will be taken. The CS said President Uhuru Kenyatta's directive banning travel from countries with cases of the coronavirus stands. He said only Kenyan citizens will be allowed in the country on condition they self quarantine. "When the Public Health Act is  invoked, self-quarantine is not a voluntary measure but mandatory that can lead to a fine or jail sentence. Going forward the measure will be instituted at the airport, where those arriving will swear a legal document that they will comply with the directive," he said. According to Kagwe, the government will continue to prioritise social distancing, which is key to preventing further spread. He said as a measure to protect Kenyans from those hoarding commodities like face masks and sanitisers, the government, through the Water ministry has reached out to water companies to reopen and ensure enough supply of water. Kagwe said as much as preventive measures are being put in place, essential services and work must go on. As a result, Kagwe said cargo vessels will be allowed on condition they are disinfected from points of departure and crews quarantined on arrival. "We have had consultations with the Chinese authorities so that as their companies reopen, there is a clear strategy on how goods will be moved," he said. Kagwe said after the consultations, all  the ships on high-seas will not be stopped from docking.
