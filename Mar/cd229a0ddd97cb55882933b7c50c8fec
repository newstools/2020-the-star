All private security guards must wear uniforms to move around and perform their duties during the curfew. According to the Ministry of Interior and Coordination of National Government, the guards are also to carry their national and job identification cards. “All licensed security guards companies are directed to ensure that every employee in their employment has a valid employment card, clearly indicating the name of the security company, a clear photograph, full name, national ID number and the job title,” the ministry said in a statement. This comes ahead of the 7 pm and 5 am curfew announced by President Uhuru Kenyatta to curb the spread of Covid-19. “In addition, to enhance identification of uniformed private security officers (security guards) by relevant governments agencies enforcing the public order (state curfew) wear their uniforms on their way to work; at the duty station; as well as their way home from work,” the statement said. Kenya registered its first death from the coronavirus pandemic on Thursday. Uhuru also announced the first case of recovery from the Covid-19 disease, 12 days after its outbreak. However, the number of those who have tested positive for the virus in the country stands at 31.
