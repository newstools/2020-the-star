 Onion farmers in West Pokot county have been told to halt harvesting onions since the major market for their produce has been closed over non-compliance with coronavirus prevention guidelines. Speaking to press, county commissioner Apollo Okello said they were forced to close Ortum Market after people there were not following guidelines to help curb the spread the virus. “We have been forced to close the market and onion farmers have been asked to stop harvesting for now," Okello said. He said 20 people were arrested on Tuesday after they were found in one onion store packing onions ready for distribution without proper hygiene. He asked buyers from other regions not to visit the market since it will be closed for some time. “Farmers should not harvest their produce for some time as we monitor the situation since we don’t want to risk anybody's lives." Ortum is widely known for its onions and buyers come from as far as from Nairobi, Mombasa, Lodwar, Busia and Kisumu. The commissioner asked residents to observe the laid down guidelines to help prevent the spread of the virus. He said very soon they are going to fumigate all markets in the county.    “All people entering this county should wash and sanitise their hands at the water points before entering this county," he said. He asked well-wishers to chip in and supply sanitizers. The governor asked all counties to set up hand washing points at every entry in the counties to help control the spread of coronavirus.
