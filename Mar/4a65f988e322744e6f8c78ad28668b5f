Health CS Mutahi Kagwe has urged employers to release their employees on time to beat the dusk-to-dawn curfew set by President Uhuru Kenyatta to contain the spread of Covid-19. If this is not possible, employers have been told to offer accommodation. Kagwe has reiterated the importance of keeping social distance, adding it is not obvious to tell that one has Covid-19. On Friday, many Kenyans were caught outdoors after the curfew came into effect and many were beaten by police. The police were condemned for using excessive force to get Kenyans out of the streets and into their homes. In Mombasa, photos were seen of residents being made to lie down by police after they tried to rush to catch the ferry before 6pm. Police spokesman said the incident was regrettable. Governor Hassan Joho extended the curfew in Mombasa after the curfew. There are four new cases of Covid-19, Kagwe has said. They are one Kenyan and three foreigners from US, Cameroon and Burkina Faso. A total of 69 samples were analysed in the last 24 hours. Kagwe said no one will receive favours and be released from mandatory quarantine because of their status in society. The CS said, "If that was the case, I would start with my sister's daughter... I have friends with children in mandatory quarantine." Kagwe on Sunday said Kenya has a chance to break the cycle and flatten the curve of Covid-19 spread by following rules of social distancing and observing quarantine rules. This is in addition to washing hands properly and observing high standards of hygiene.
