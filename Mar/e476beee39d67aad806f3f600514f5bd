The fight for gender equality at workplaces is far from over. In its second edition of 'Women of Influence' in honour of Women’s Day, True Love magazine held a champagne breakfast courtesy of Moët & Chandon at the Fairmont Norfolk hotel on Friday ahead of the day itself on Sunday. The global theme, #EachforEqual, sought to address the stereotypes that come with women and power, fight prejudice and celebrate women's achievements. The event tried to answer the question: "Must you choose when it comes to professional success and personal fulfilment?" The highlight was the talks by CEOs Brenda Mbathi (General Electrical Kenya), Marion Gathoga-Mwangi (BOC Gases) Caroline Munene (AAR Insurance) and Caroline Kariuki-Karuga (Kepsa).
