Strathmore University coach Peter Mwathi has credited the team's superb form to their desire to win the  Kenya Universities Sports Association title. Strathmore, five-time Kusa winners, are also being driven by the joy of emerging the university's team of the year two weeks ago. Strathmore top the league standings with 34 points after 18 matches. They opened a four-point gap against defending champions National Cereals and Produce Board following their weekend engagements. Starthmore won all their four matches and Mwathi said the spirit is high in camp. They are targeting to win their remaining two matches in the Nairobi South Conference League in order to book a place in the KUSA national finals set for Dedan Kimathi University in Nyeri later this month. "Our main agenda is to win all our remaining matches in the league. Scooping maximum points over the weekend was a good response from the team. We are optimistic of winning the KUSA title for the sixth time in a row," said Mwathi. "Our eyes are on the league as well. We fought stiff competition to win the institution team of the year award and I was named the coach of the year which further spurs confidence." Mwathi said, in order to fulfil the team's ambitions of winning titles, a cautious defensive approach will be used. "We are working on a defensive formation which will help destroy the piston attacking styles being used by our opponents.  This set up will make them difficult to score against us. There's nothing prestigious like winning the title with Strathmore colours."
