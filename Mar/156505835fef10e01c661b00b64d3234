The first students to be admitted to the Busia Medical Training College have graduated. The 50 students enrolled for studies in November 2016. They graduated on Friday after successfully completing a diploma programme in clinical medicine. They will be expected to offset personnel shortage in the county health facilities. Health is among Governor Sospeter Ojaamong’s priorities. Since the inception of devolution in 2013, the Health department has been one of the dockets that get the lion’s share of the county budget. "It is a dream come true to celebrate with the first batch of the Kenya Medical Training College Busia campus clinical students. They have graduated with excellent performance to justify my decision to fund the construction of the college in 2014,” Ojaamong said at the ceremony. He praised 49 of the 50 students for excelling. He said their good performance means county health institutions will employ well-trained individuals. “Forty-nine students scored 98 per cent. Only one student failed one unit,” he said. Another 50 students studying nursing and 50 studying clinical medicine are due to graduate in December. The campus has 400 students and is admitting another batch of learners this month. Those to be admitted include 50 for nursing and 50 for clinical medicine. "The recruitment is ongoing, with some students already receiving admission letters. My government last year introduced the Afya Elimu Scholarship meant to benefit students from the county pursuing diplomas in medicine and nursing-related courses,” Ojaamong said. Some 43 students benefitted from the first scholarship programme, with each receiving at least Sh40,000.
