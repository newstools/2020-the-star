 Two people have been arrested and forcefully quarantined in Bungoma after they ignored the self-isolation directive following their arrival from abroad. The government through the Ministry of Health has directed those arriving from foreign countries to self-quarantine for 14 as part of measures to contain the spread of coronavirus. But Bungoma county assembly employee Francis Tome wh arrived from Dubai last week refused to self-isolate. He was arrested together with his spouse who works as a secretary at the Bungoma police headquarters. They were taken to the Webuye isolation centre together with a local cleric who also arrived from abroad but refused to isolate himself. The cleric, Francis Khaoya of Faith Gospel Ministries had arrived from the US. He was arrested and put into quarantine where he will spend 14 days. Bungoma county commissioner Abdi Hassan asked residents to be more vigilant and report people who have travelled from out of the country. “We are not going to tolerate people ignoring government directives. We will arrest you and forcefully quarantine you and later charge you before a court of law," Hassan said. Bungoma Governor Wycliffe Wangamati has banned all open-air markets and directed that all funerals be conducted within twenty-four hours. “Our people should know that we are putting all these measures for their own good and not to hurt them,” Wangamati said.  edited by peter obuya
