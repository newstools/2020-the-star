Harambee Starlets coach David Ouma has touted the upcoming Turkish women’s Cup as an ideal build-up opportunity for the team ahead of the second 2020 Africa Women's Cup of Nations qualifiers starting April. The Starlets left the country for Instanbul yesterday after two weeks in camp for the international tournament scheduled to start today in Alanya, Turkey. He said the event will act as a build-up to the 2020 Africa Women's Cup of Nations Qualifiers against Tanzania in April. Ouma had earlier on Monday named the final squad for the eight-team tournament, entrusting five debutants among them Chapa Dimba hotshot Jane Njeri and Eldoret Falcons' defender Dorcas Shiveka. “This tournament has come at an opportune time for me to gauge my players ahead of the upcoming qualifiers. We have had one week to brush through our style of play and I am confident we will do well against top opposition,” said coach Ouma as the team left for Turkey. Meanwhile, influential forward Mwanalima Adam is relishing coming up against top opposition. She said the Turkey event will prepare them better to face Tanzania in April. “Coming up against top opposition is enough motivation for us to give a good account of ourselves in Turkey. We’ll give our best and hopefully, we’ll carry the form to our match against Tanzania,” said Adam. Starlets have been pooled alongside Northern Ireland, Chile, Uzbekistan with Hungary, Venezuela, Hong Kong, Romania and Turkmenistan set to make an appearance at the tournament.
