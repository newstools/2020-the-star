This year’s Nandi 4x4 Conservation and Diesel Power Jumbo Challenge in Kaptagat have been postponed due to the spread of coronavirus. The Nandi Challenge, which had introduced motocross, was scheduled for April 10-13 in Tulon Farm, Nandi County. The event, which was due to mark the third year, had attracted 80 cars and its theme was to conserve the environment. “The management of 4X4 Conservation Challenge wishes to inform sporting and environmental enthusiasts of the post postponement of the event earlier slated for April 10-13,” said event coordinator, Basil Maiyo. On the other hand, the organisers of the Jumbo Charge Kaptagat 4x4 Challenge postponed the event indefinitely. The event’s chairman Charles Mulupi said: “Jumbo Charge wishes to inform all fans, competitors and sponsors that the event has been postponed until further notice. We have reached this painful decision due to the outbreak of coronavirus (Covid19) that continue to plague the world.” The three-day event had been scheduled for the Easter holiday between April 10- 13. The Government of Kenya recently banned all social gatherings as a way of containing the spread of the dreaded virus. Malupi said they had lined up among other activities tree planting, extreme adventure, camping and networking. The event had already attracted 32 participants.
