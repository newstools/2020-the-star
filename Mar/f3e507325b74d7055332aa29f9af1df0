Health CS Mutahi Kagwe wants the Directorate of Criminal Investigations to unravel the problem of blood shortage in the country. Yesterday, Kagwe asked the DCI to speedily take action against cartels engaged in blood trade in and outside the country. “The ministry is aware that there are criminal elements both within the Ministry of Health who are colluding with outsiders to escalate the problems pertaining to blood countrywide,” the CS said in a statement. The statement was issued as the National Blood Transfusion Service received blood donation at Landimawe in Nairobi. “In the meantime, I want to assure members of the public that the ministry has started supplying consumables for screening to all hospitals across the country. We are also putting measures in place for purposes of ensuring the issue of blood shortage is dealt with once and for all.” Kenya’s blood bank is running on empty with some public hospitals allegedly selling a pint of blood for between Sh2,500 and Sh3,000. Some potential blood donors are said to be unwilling to give blood, fearing that it will be sold. The ministry welcomes partners and well-wishers to support blood donation within the laid down protocols. The safety and quality of blood and blood products cannot be compromised, the CS said. Kagwe is expected to meet stakeholders, development partners, academicians and specialists this week to discuss pertinent blood issues.
