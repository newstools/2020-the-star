The Kenya Electricity Generating Company (KenGen) has assured Kenyans that it has deployed mechanisms to ensure electricity generation continues uninterrupted. The company on Thursday said it has embarked on a shift system to ensure there are staff in all installations across the country at any given time. KenGen has also decongested its offices by allowing some of its employees to work from home as a way of minimising contact. All the company's operations will be running smoothly even as the country continues to handle the coronavirus pandemic. Also, the company said it has doubled efforts in hygiene to provide hand-washing and sanitisation facilities. It has also introduced regular disinfection of facilities and rolled out a sensitisation campaign across the company. KenGen has expressed its optimism that the country will overcome the COVID-19 pandemic.
