A patient has been put in isolation at Longisa Referral Hospital in Bomet after exhibiting coronavirus-like symptoms, including a 40-degree temperature and chest pains. Health officials in Bomet have sought to dispel fears the female the patient who had been rushed to Tenwek Mission Hospital on Sunday evening was suffering from the disease. Samples have been sent to the Kenya Medical Research Institute. County Health executive member Joseph Sitonik told the press the 27-year-old female has been examined and "does not fit the case definition of Covid-19".  She will be monitored before she is released. The businesswoman had travelled from Nairobi to visit her sister at Siongiroi in Chepalungu. She had not travelled outside the country or contacted known patients. Sitonik said samples have been sent to the Kenya Medical Research Institut. Results are expected later on Tuesday. The health official urged members of the public not to panic and not to spread alarming information. "We want to warn our people against spreading unverified information as those might cause panic...whenever a person develops such signs they should not be assumed to have the disease," he said.
