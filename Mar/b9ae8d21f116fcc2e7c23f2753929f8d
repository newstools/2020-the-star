Detectives are investigating a case in which a taxi driver was reportedly lured to Ruiru town only to be abducted, tortured and his body dismembered into 13 pieces. The pieces were found in Kijabe Forest in Kiambu county. Police on Thursday said they had arrested two more suspects within Suswa shopping centre in Narok who were found with a mobile phone suspected to have been used to call the driver. The driver went missing two weeks ago in a case the police are treating as a carjacking incident on February 23. The body parts are to be subjected to DNA analysis to determine the identity of the man. After the abduction, the detectives say, they traced and impounded the car registration number KCX 750T. At the time, the sleuths arrested Peter Irungu Maina, 37, and Eunice Masiado Nteita, 18, in Kinangop and Suswa, respectively. They later arrested three more. On Thursday, detectives arrested Joseph Lenguna, 24, and Daniel Parekire, 22, bringing to seven the number of suspects so far nabbed. Parekire was the one found in possession of the phone. It is not clear whether the driver was attacked due to a businessmen disagreement or if it was a case of regular crime. It is also not clear whether the suspects were acting on the instructions of another person. The DCI team said it was still aggressively hunting for any more suspects who may have had a hand in the man's disappearance and murder. Edited by R.Wamochie
