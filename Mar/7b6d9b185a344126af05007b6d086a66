A Kinangop landlord has suspended rent payment for his tenants for two months to help them cope with measures put in place to contain the spread of the coronavirus. Michael Munene said the move will enable his tenants to focus on the provision of food and other basic needs for their families. Munene’s one storey Dot Com House in Ndunyu Njeru town has 28 rooms going for an average of Sh3,000 and six commercial tenants paying Sh6,000 monthly. “We know the Covid-19 has got social-economic impact on everyone, especially low-income-earners who constitute a majority of my tenants,” he said. Munene said the public needs to cooperate with the government in dealing with the pandemic and be considerate of one another. He said apart from regular fumigation of his building, a sickbay has been set aside where anyone who exhibits the symptoms will be isolated as the health officers are called to assess the case. Munene said the two levels of government should find ways of easing the burden for Kenyans. The national government, he said, could through Kenya Power, suspend the payment of electricity bills for some time or reduce the cost. Peter Muya, a trader, said even with suspended rent payment, they may find it hard to make enough to buy food and pay water and electricity bills as businesses have been hit hard. “We also urge the county government to review or suspend the license fee and other business costs,” he said. Miriam Kagure urged other landlords to emulate Munene to ease the suffering being experienced by most Kenyans. She said the government should ensure employed Kenyans don’t lose their jobs.
