Liverpool have confirmed goalkeeper Alisson will miss next week’s Merseyside derby with a hip injury. The 27-year-old has missed the last two matches and has now been ruled out of Monday’s trip to Everton. He was also out of Champions League second-leg game with Atletico Madrid last night. Stand-in Adrian will continue in goal. The former Roma keeper has been left out of the Brazil squad for their World Cup qualifiers against Bolivia and Peru on March 28 and April 1. Alisson, who has played 28 times for Liverpool this season, picked up the injury in training before the 2-0 FA Cup fifth-round defeat at Chelsea. The world’s most expensive goalkeeper when he joined Liverpool in 2018 in a deal worth up to £66.8m, Alisson also missed nine weeks of the campaign with a calf injury sustained in their opening league match against Norwich City in August.
