Celebrated artiste Becca is back with 'No one', her first single of 2020, featuring South African superstar Busiswa and the DWP Academy dance crew. The collaboration is produced by Nigerian producer Dunnie. The hit has an infectious dance beat and is a mash-up of West African and South African sounds. This comes before the release of her all-female album set in July. The album will also be mostly produced, arranged, mixed and mastered by female producers. Speaking on the theme, Becca said, “Power must return to women. This album will bring together some of the most talented music queens as we support each other and our push for more opportunities in the modern-day music industry.” Becca is currently ranked as one of the top female artistes in Africa.
