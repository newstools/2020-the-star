  Police in Kasarani are holding two people suspected to have kidnapped and defiled a 14-year-old schoolgirl. Isaiah Wekesa Wafula and Elias Bundi Ntoribi were arrested on Thursday last week. The Form Three student at a school in Othaya, Nyeri, had been reported missing in Nairobi. She was found in Nyahururu. The suspects' detention followed an application by police constable Charles Aoma to hold them for 10 working days as investigations are concluded. Aoma asked Makadara chief magistrate Heston Nyaga to allow their detention until Tuesday next week. The officer said he is still pursuing the suspects' accomplices and feared that the two might interfere with investigations if they are released on bond. Ntoribi told the court that he had no idea why he was linked to the case. He said he was arrested at his workplace and taken to his house where a search was conducted but nothing implicating him was found.
