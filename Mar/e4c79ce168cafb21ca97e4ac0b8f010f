United States International University USIU-A Spartans will be without the services of attacking lynchpin Vivian Esimi for their Premier League opener against Blazers this weekend. The prolific forward underwent ankle surgery in July last year after sustaining an ankle fracture during the Betty Tioni tournament in Nakuru, ruling her out for the rest of the season. Spartans coach Willis Okeyo was optimistic of having the deadly goal poacher from the start of this season but by the look of things, it won't be possible. Esimi was in a rich vein of form, scoring the team's four of seven goals before her setback. USIU managed a meagre 13 goals in her absentia. Despite returning to training last month, the pacy striker is not yet ready to play.  Okeyo said they are in no hurry to rush her back into action until she is fully fit. "Vivian is training with the rest of the team but definitely won't play. Her injury was bad and we want to take a cautious approach in dealing with her. She will be missed but we will find a solution." In her absence, Perez Akinyi will carry on in the position. Okeyo wants the students to correct their wrongs against Blazers who are the defending champions. Two of the three loses suffered by Spartans last season were against the Tracy Karanja-captained side. Revenge is out of the equation for USIU  but Okeyo wants an improved display from the team. "We have to make our chances count, play boldly and get a result. We conceded six times against Blazers and we cannot allow this to happen again," noted the Kenya International. Okeyo also expressed his frustration on how the fixture was arranged. "It is unfair to play the top teams in the first match. In normal fixtures, Blazers and USIU would meet promoted teams and not how it has been arranged."
