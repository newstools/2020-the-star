Kitui Woman Rep Irene Kasalu has pleaded with the national government to provide food to residents, who are affected by new measures to curb Covid-19 spread. Kasalu, who spoke at her Kalisasi home in Kitui’s Mwingi Central sub-county on Saturday, said the government should put in mind the welfare of Kenyans who live from hand to mouth. “Following the measures put in place by the government to curb the spread of Covid -19, most families have been affected and lack food to feed their families,” stated Kasalu. Most business people in the county have decried low incomes since the pandemic was reported in Kenya. The government has since imposed new measures including staying home for self-quarantine, keeping social distance, reducing the number of passengers in public transport vehicles, and dusk-dawn curfew among others. Kasalu insisted that although the measures are for the common good of every Kenyan, the government should donate food to those who do not have enough. “Most women are suffering with their children during this time, if only the government came to their rescue,” urged Irene. The MP also asked security officers not to use violence on Kenyans during the curfew time. “During this time of the pandemic, I urge everyone to coexist with the other peacefully and together we will eliminate this illness,” said Kasalu. The MP also urged residents to take Covid-19 seriously and follow all precautionary measures laid out by the Ministry of Health. “Let us be obedient and take all laid out measures seriously and also remember to pray for the nation, advised Kasalu.
