Nurses at Mbagathi Hospital have lowered their tools a day after two more cases of coronavirus were detected in Kenya. Mbagathi Hospital chairman George Osewe told the Star that nurses at the facility feel unsafe, neglected and unprepared in case they have to handle an infected person . "Personal responsibility is very important and it is good they have come out and demonstrated their grievances by the go slow. They are also humans and cannot be exposed to the danger of contracting the virus," he said. Osewe said that only the nurses at the isolated block within the hospital have been trained to handle patients with the virus or suspected cases. "I believe the government should move in and handle the situation because the policies lays with them. You cannot just train a few nurses and leave the rest just because they are not attached to the isolated block," he added. County Executive for Health Hitan Majevdia also urged the National Government to address the issue and make all nurses feel on board. "Health is among the functions that was handed over to the National Government so at the end of the day the ball is in their court. But as a county we have the protective Personal Protective Equipment and by all mean we shall ensure that our county facilities have them," he said On Friday, the county spent Sh30 million to purchase Personal Protective Equipment and drugs for coronavirus.
