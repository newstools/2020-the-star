Gospel artiste Guardian Angel has released ‘Corona’ in conjunction with the Kenyan government to educate people about coronavirus and how to fight it. Speaking to Word Is, Guardian Angel said he was contacted by the Presidential Music Commission. "People in the village are getting information but they are not following the set instructions, as most are assuming the coronavirus is only in Nairobi. Most of them are (living from) hand to mouth, so it is hard for them," he said. He said most people have been travelling upcountry in the hope of staying away from the virus, but that is wrong. "People need to follow instructions since coronavirus is everywhere," he said. Asked how much he was paid, he was elusive about it. "God has blessed me, and it’s a project I enjoyed working on," he said. The project is in conjunction with the Ministry of Sports, Culture and Heritage.
