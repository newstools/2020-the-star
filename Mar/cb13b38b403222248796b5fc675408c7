The Kakamega government has spent Sh25 million on development of tea in the last five years to warrant construction of a factory in Shinyalu. The Kenya Tea Development Authority had demanded that the county produce five million tonnes of tea annually before the factory could be licensed. This condition was meant to forestall mayhem in the sector so the new plant does not poach produce meant for Mudete factory in Vihiga county. On Friday, Deputy Governor Philip Kutima said construction of the factory in Shinyalu is on course. He said the county government had met the requirements by the authority. "The county rolled out a tea development programme for the last five years in which we have been spending Sh5 million yearly which has seen us meet the tea production target. We’re on course," said Kutima, who doubles as the Agriculture docket executive. Under the programme implemented in conjunction with the Tea Research Foundation, more than 370,000 seedlings were distributed to farmers yearly. He said production had increased and the county government was now ready to proceed with the construction of the factory. "We already have land meant for the construction of the project," Kutima said. Meantime, farmers whose tea is ready will have to supply their harvest to Mudete factory. "Our plan is to fish our farmers out of Mudete once the new factory is completed. Why should they take tea to Vihiga when they have a tea factory at their doorsteps?". The deputy county chief pointed out that the county targets farmers from the Nyayo Tea Zone, Shinyalu, Ikolomani and Khwisero to serve the factory. Farmers in Vihiga will be welcomed to the new factory if they feel the terms of engagement will be better. Kutima appealed to farmers to support Governor Wycliffe Oparanya's vision of setting up "one of the best factories in the area" to improve their living standards. (Edited by F'Orieny)
