Calm has finally been restored in Mandera town after fighting between Jubaland  and Somalia Federal Government troops. On Monday, the two forces clashed, leaving 12 people injured in Mandera town. One of the injured later succumbed. A spot check in Mandera town on Saturday and Sunday showed that residents had resumed their normal businesses after remaining closed for the better part of the week. Those who spoke to journalists said though calm had been restored, the government should ensure such a thing does not happen again. “The last few days have been very difficult for Mandera residents. We don’t want to fight other people’s wars. We have our own problems,” resident Ahmed Mohamed, 66, said. On Saturday, the county leadership, led by Governor Ali Roba, appealed to President Uhuru Kenyatta to guarantee the safety and security of residents. “The situation taking shape in Mandera county is that of eroded public trust in their own government as a result of neglect, misplaced priorities and putting the interest of external region over and above that of its own citizens," Roba said. "We refuse to accept that the interest of other external entities supersede that of our population. We therefore demand that our government expels this foreign forces from Mandera with immediate effect.” The leaders said the situation had created panic and led to the displacement of people in Bulla Customs, Bulla Garay, Bulla Mpya, Bulla Arabia, Bulla Busle and Border point 1. They  requested Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa to render humanitarian aid to the hundreds of displaced persons in Mandera town. In the last one month, there has been a major fallout between the Regional Government of Jubaland and the Federal Government of Somalia. The presence of Jubaland Defense Minister Abdirashid Janan in Kenya is said to be the main reason for the escalating tension.
