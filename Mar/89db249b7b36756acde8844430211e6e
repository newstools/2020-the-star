Interior Chief Administrative Secretary Hussein Dado has asked Kenyans to observe the 7pm-5am curfew by staying at home instead of engaging police in running battles. Dado said the curfew was meant to help reduce the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. Speaking after an impromptu inspection tour of the curfew in Kilifi county, the CAS said he was impressed by how residents observed the law. Dado said streets in Malindi were empty at 7pm and commended the residents for staying indoors. He urged Kenyans in other counties to comply like those in Kilifi. "What I have seen in Malindi is wananchi have complied. If everybody complied like them everything would go smoothly," he said. The CAS commended the police for guiding the few residents who delayed or went out at night during the curfew. He appealed to business people to close early so that their staff get time to reach their homes early. "I want Kenyans to understand there is nothing punitive here. This is an enemy that has attacked the whole world," he said. Dado said told Kenyans that the curfew was imposed for their own good and that the best medicine for Covid-19 was to stay at home. "Those who have nothing to do should just remain at home. There is no enjoyment. For those who must work, they should use protection like sanitisers," he said. The CAS said a lot of children used to miss their parents but now they have come together. In South Africa, he said, there was a total lockdown and the military was in the streets but in Kenya, the police were doing a good job. Dado was accompanied by Malindi subcounty police commander Vitalis Otieno and other senior security officers. During the inspection, Dado found drivers of lorries transporting goods had packed at the old market. The drivers asked the government to allow trucks carrying goods to travel during the curfew as they were essentials and could be spoiled. Edited by Henry Makori
