Nyali MP Mohammed Ali has protested the government-imposed curfew citing ineffectiveness in bid to tame Coronavirus spread in the country. He urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to order a total lockdown in order to save the lives of Kenyans. "However, with the lockdown, he should be ready resources to feed the poor," he said. The Nyali MP on Monday wrote to the Majority Leader of the National Assembly Aden Duale requesting parliament to convene a special sitting of Parliament to consider ways of cushioning Kenyans from the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. Ali cautioned politicians against using the virus to manipulate Kenyans in their selfish politics. "Politicians who are playing politics with the coronavirus should stop. They use packets of flour and sanitizers to confuse Kenyans in the name of coronavirus yet they have different intentions," he said. The MP said politicians should instead get involved in assembling all relief funds from organisations which will collectively be used in taming the virus. "Don't play politics with the life of the poor," he said. Ali accused Kenyans of not treating the pandemic with the seriousness it deserves. "This pandemic is no joke. As Kenyans, we are taking the situation very lightly and talk about it like it's an anomaly. We don't have enough capacity to deal with it," Ali said. Health CS Mutahi Kagwe on Monday announced eight more patients had tested positive for the coronavirus bringing the country's total number to 50.
