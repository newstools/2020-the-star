As the coronavirus pandemic continues to spread across the globe, so has our fear of contacting various surfaces increased. There are now some familiar scenes in public places around the world – people trying to open doors with their elbows, commuters studiously surfing their way through train journeys to avoid grabbing a handle, office workers rubbing down their desks each morning. In Kenya, the government has confirmed 42 coronavirus cases and one death.  Total global deaths have hit over 34,000. But what exactly are some of the objects that can spread coronavirus? Below is a list of common 15 objects we all come into contact with on an almost daily basis; The US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention recommends daily disinfection for frequently touched surfaces such as tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks. The CDC also recommends the use of detergent or soap and water on dirty surfaces prior to disinfection. If someone in your home is sick with flu-like symptoms, consider regularly disinfecting objects in your home, since SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to survive for 16 hours on plastics.
