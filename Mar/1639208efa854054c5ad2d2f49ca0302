Queen of Pop Madonna has received a massive backlash after she referred to the coronavirus as the "great equaliser". The 61-year-old argues that it affects everyone equally regardless of status, but fans feel the rich have greater access to healthcare, including tests for Covid-19. Madonna, the 2nd richest singer in the world with a net worth of $850 million (Sh85 billion), posted a video of herself sitting naked in a bathtub and talked about how the coronavirus doesn't discriminate. “That’s the thing about Covid-19,” Madonna began in the bizarre video on Instagram. “It doesn’t care about how rich you are, how famous you are, how funny you are, how smart you are, where you live, how old you are, what amazing stories you can tell,” she said. She called it “the great equaliser,” claiming, “what’s terrible about it is what’s great about it." “What’s terrible about it is it’s made us all equal in many ways, and what’s wonderful about it is it’s made us all equal in many ways,” she added. Referring to her 1994 smash-hit single, 'Human Nature', Madonna concluded; “Like I used to say every night, ‘We’re all in the same boat and if the ship goes down, we’re all going down together'.” Her video comes in the wake of many celebrities posting their test results on Instagram, while many ordinary people die while waiting to be tested. Jon Linder wrote, "I've always respected Madonna for being a talented trendsetter & a leader in the music industry but her Coronavirus themed bath video was the dumbest thing that she's ever put her name to. Philosophy can go straight to hell right now. Let's focus on getting healthier as a world." Yoga wrote, "Desperately seeking relevance. Complete lack of self-awareness." Edited by T Jalio
