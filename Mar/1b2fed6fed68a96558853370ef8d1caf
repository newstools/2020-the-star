Opposition Chief Raila Odinga has thrown his weight behind measures put in place by President Uhuru Kenyatta's government to tackle Coronavirus. The ODM leader rallied Kenyans to adhere to a raft of measures announced by the government on Friday saying they were satisfactory. Kenya announced on Friday that a Kenyan woman, 27, who travelled to Nairobi from the USA via London had tested positive of COVID-19. Health CS Mutahi Kagwe said all public gatherings have been suspended. This includes the high stakes BBI rally that was scheduled for Nakuru on Saturday next week. All inter-school events, church crusades and games have also been suspended. Prison visits have also been put on hold. Raila said control measures will definitely cause disruptions across the county. But Kenyans must adhere to them. "We are in this together in this. We appeal to our citizens not to panic but instead to cooperate with the government, which has factual and science-based advice on how we must proceed," he said. Raila has also urged all ministries to continue providing clear scientific and medical information to Kenyans and not rumours that may cause unnecessary panic. Kagwe had earlier cautioned Kenyans from using social media to spread misinformation to cause anxiety. The CS asked all Kenyans with a cough, sneeze or fever to stay at home.
