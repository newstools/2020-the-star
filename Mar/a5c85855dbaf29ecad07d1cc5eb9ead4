The Lamu administration has bought drugs and medical supplies worth Sh25 million to be distributed to hospitals and dispensaries across the county. The consignment arrived on Wednesday. Residents had complained that the county government was neglecting the health sector and causing harm to patients. Health county executive Anne Gathoni confirmed to the MCAs last week that there was a shortage of drugs in health facilities. Gathoni told the county assembly committee on Health that the shortage was because drugs were being stolen by medics and subordinate staff. Patients had been unable to access basic drugs, with hundreds referred to hospitals in Mombasa, Kilifi and Malindi. Locals have been forced to seek treatment in costly private hospitals. Gathoni said Wednesday that the consignment included antibiotics, anti-diabetes, anti-asthmatics, injection fluids, anaesthetics, theatre and hypertension drugs and others. The drugs were supplied by the Kenya Medical Supplies Authority. Distribution is already underway and will go on for the next one week, Gathoni said. “We’ve ensured all hospital consumables, almost 300 different items, are bought,” Gathoni said. The four key Lamu hospitals, including King Fahad, Mpeketoni, Faza and Mokowe have started receiving the drugs. “We shall supply to all others in the next week,” Gathoni said. Speaking during a recent function in Lamu, Governor Fahim Twaha said his government was committed to providing improved health care for all. Lamu county has 34 dispensaries and numerous health facilities that serve its over 140,000 people. The development comes as the Senate Committee on Health is expected in Lamu on Thursday after successful petitioning by Senator Anwar Loitiptip. (edited by O. Owino)
