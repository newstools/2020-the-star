The vice-chairperson of the Judicial Service Commission, Mercy Deche, on Saturday celebrated her long-awaited achievement of a PhD in law. Deche, who graduated last December from the University of Nairobi, said the feat took her some six years. Her husband architect Arnold Deche and friends organised a Mijikenda-themed graduation party at the Voyager Beach Hotel. Those in attendance included the presiding judge of Mombasa High Court Justice Eric Ogola, who gave the keynote speech, together with other members of the Bench. Also present were Mombasa Senator Mohamed Faki, Maritime Affairs PS Nancy Karigithu, Retired Justice Andrew Hayanga, Law Society Mombasa chairman Mathew Nyabena and his colleagues, as well as family and friends.
