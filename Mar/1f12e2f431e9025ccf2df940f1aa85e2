County Government of Vihiga has been asked to support Vihiga United as they seek to return to Kenya Premier League next season. Speaking on behalf of fans, Cleopatra Minayo warned that the rise in football standards in the county will be reduced to nothing if the county's authorities sit back and do nothing. “It’s surprising to see the players going without salaries since November last year despite promises from top county officials," he said. Ironically, he said the county officials had visited the team in training and promised to pay their salaries but to date, nothing has happened. “It has been difficult for the players to raise even transport to training sessions. This has forced the technical bench members to settle for one-day training per week, which could prove counterproductive. It's very much disturbing going by competition in the National Super League," he said. Minayo said despite the troubles, the players have sacrificed for the team to ensure their dream of qualifying for KPL remains on course. Players, who sought anonymity admitted that the playing unit was unsettled and demotivated following the poor treatment by the county. They said they have the desire to stay and help the team but warned that if the situation persists, they will have no choice but to seek alternatives. Vihiga United are third on the log with 52 points from 27 matches.
