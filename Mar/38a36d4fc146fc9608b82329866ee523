Kenya airways has explained why they had to suspend staffer Geri Ali over a video clip shared on social media. Ali was suspended for sharing a video clip of China Southern airways landing at JKIA on Wednesday with 239 passengers on board. This was after an uproar from Kenyans over fears of contracting Coronavirus. "On February 26, KQ received a letter from KAA stating that there had been a breach of air-side security procedures at JKIA involving one of our employees," KQ said. In a notice on Sunday, the national carrier said in accordance with standard HR procedures, the employee was suspended to allow a full investigation to take place to determine the facts of the matter . "This process will be conducted expeditiously in a fair and transparent manner and in the meantime the employee remains on a full salary," KQ said. "We fully understand and appreciate the public interest generated by the suspension of our employees following the filming and circulation on social media of the arrival of china southern flights." Kenya Airways explained that the nature of the coronavirus is such that the public has a legitimate interest in receiving relevant information. "...but we are expected to adhere to airport security procedures and regulations set by the Kenya airports authority as the airport regulator and which are prescribed by law," it added. On Saturday, Gire said his life is in danger after allegedly receiving threats from the Anti-Terrorism Police Unit. He is allegedly been accused of working with a terrorist organisation on the basis of his name - Ali. Through his lawyer Dunstan Omari Ali said he is scared for his life so much so that he wanted to be kept in a police cell for protection. The Chinese Embassy said that all the passengers were advised to quarantine themselves for 14 days, a prevention method used in China.
