A Nairobi Court has temporarily stopped the impeachment of Governor Mike Sonko until due process is followed. This was after the county boss challenged its legality through Lawyer Harrison Kinyanjui arguing that the Assembly Act was violated. The matter is before Justice Byrum Ongaya who suspended the impeachment motion to a later date. During the hearing, Kinyanjui said the case is of utmost urgency as the Nairobi city county assembly is poised to debate a motion by the clerk seeking his impeachment tomorrow. But the Nairobi County assembly objected to the application saying that theÂ  Labour Court where the matter has been filed should not be used by Sonko to hold a function that is constitutionally mandated at ransom. "There's no employer-employee relationship between Sonko and Nairobi city county assembly. This is not the proper forum to bring this kind of petition. This is an employment and labour relations court," the assembly said. The Assembly said that Sonko has not brought any evidence to demonstrate that he is an employee of the five respondents as listed in his case. But in a swift rejoinder, Kinyanjui said the court has jurisdiction to handle the matter. He also mentions that they have not been given exhibits that form the basis of the impeachment. "This is a Kangaroo process. No man should be condemned unheard. If you allow this sham process to proceed it will prejudice my client," Kinyanjui said. More to follow....
