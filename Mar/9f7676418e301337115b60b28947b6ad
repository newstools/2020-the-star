Homa Bay health officials have quarantined six people suspected of being infected with the new coronavirus. County commissioner David Kipkemei said they have taken their samples for testing in Nairobi. The six came from Sweden, Dubai and Germany. “Three are being quarantined at Homa Bay County Referral Hospital while three others are being quarantined at their homes,” Kipkemei said. The administrator spoke on Friday as the Homa Bay government launched fumigation of matatus and bus parks. Kipkemei urged residents to avoid spreading false information about coronavirus on social media. “We don’t want residents sharing false information regarding Covid-19. Nobody should share any information that can make residents panic,” Kipkemei said. The administrator said the national government was working with the county government to provide health workers with personal protective equipment. So far, the county has received 25 protective gears. Kipkemei said they had deployed more police officers in major towns to enforce adherence to safety measures. “The officers are ensuring that residents do not gather in a manner that can make them susceptible to infection,” he said. Water and Environment executive Dickson Nyawinda urged matatu owners and operators to cooperate with officials carrying out the fumigation. “Water department in collaboration with disaster management department has dispatched officials who will ensure all matatus are sprayed with disinfectants,” he said. “Fumigation is part of the broader sanitation exercise residents are expected practice for us to fight the pandemic.” Edited by Josephine M.
