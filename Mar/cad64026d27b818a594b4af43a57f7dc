Farmers' groups in Garissa on Friday received a Sh35 million grant from the Kenya Climate-Smart Agriculture project for agribusiness. The project by the national and county governments and the World Bank aims to improve productivity and combat climate-related risks. Governor Ali Korane appealed to the community to adopt crop farming due to climate change that is threatening the pastoralist life. “Prudently utilise funds for the intended purposes to ensure success. This will ensure wealth but increase food security in the county that has suffered from drought and famine." He was addressing the farmers at the Garissa Farmers Training centre during the launch of county micro-projects under the KCSAP. “This comes at a time when the construction of our fruit processing plant for value addition is progressing well." The initial disbursement will benefit farmers from six wards – Balambala, Saka, Baraki, Maalimin, Masalani and Ijara. It aims at ensuring sustainability in agricultural productivity and building resilience to adverse climate change. Korane also said construction of the meat processing plant was progressing well. Livestock and Agriculture CEC Mohamed Shale said vulnerable groups were selected as beneficiaries after their proposals were reviewed by the project technical team. Kenya Livestock Marketing Council chairman Dubat Amey said many pastoralists were abandoning the activity for crop farming. “Our people are fast adopting crop farming. They need to be fully supported," Amey said. Edited by R.Wamochie
