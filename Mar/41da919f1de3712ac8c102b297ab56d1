British High commissioner to Kenya Jane Marriott was on Friday forced to self quarantine after her trip from UK. "36 hours left of self-quarantine (staying at home), following my UK trip," she said in a tweet. She urged all British Nationals to follow Kenyan Government advice and going directly home (not using domestic transport) after coming from a COVID-19 country. "We're in this together. No one is exempt," she added. This comes a day after foreign affairs PS Macharia Kamau was forced to  self quarantine after his trip from the US. The coronavirus has so far killed 9000 people and infected thousands. Kenya has reported seven confirmed cases. The most common symptom of infection with the coronavirus is a fever — about 90 per cent of patients suffer from it, according to the World Health Organization. The temperature elevation that is considered "abnormal" depends on the age of a person and the site where the temperature is measured. For older children and adults, a fever may be defined by oral temperatures ranging from 37.8 to 39.4 degrees centigrade, while a fever of concern would be one in which an oral temperature is 39.5 degrees centigrade or higher. The temperature under the armpit, also called axillary temperature, is considered to be abnormal when it is above 37.5 degrees. People with active coronavirus also have a dry cough and sometimes, shortness of breath.
