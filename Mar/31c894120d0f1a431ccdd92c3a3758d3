Hardly two days after Sofapaka President Elly Kalekwa insisted that the club will not relent in their bid to pursue justice in John Avire'S transfer saga, their quest was handed a major blow after the Egyptian FA was authorised to register the player, albeit provisionally. A letter from Fifa player status committee confirmed that FC Tanta, whom Sofapaka accuse of illegally detaining their player since last year, had been handed a provisional International Transfer Certificate (ITC). "The Egyptian Federation is authorised to provisionally register the player John Avire who is affiliated to club Tanta with immediate effect," read part of the letter from Zurich. Avire controversially signed for the Egyptian club in August last year, prompting Sofapaka, through Football Kenya Federation, to report their counterparts to Fifa for player tapping. FKF declined to issue the certificate rendering Avire's move and stay at Tanta illegal. However, the two teams launched negotiations to unlock the stalemate where Sofapaka maintained that Avire was their player by virtue of having a running contract. Prior to the letter, Avire had made his debut on Wednesday in Tanta's barren draw with Wadi Degla, leaving Sofapaka bitter. Sofapaka now claim that Fifa's move was in bad faith. "We feel cheated and robbed since the directive goes against the Fifa statutes and it means that the player has two contracts," said the club in a statement. Meanwhile, the FKF insisted that Avire is registered with them and has appealed to Fifa for guidance. "The player is duly registered in line with Article 5 of regulations and statutes of the transfer of players. The player's Fifa ID on Fifa connect platform is 13CBYD3 and as mentioned before, he has a valid contract which runs to December 2020 and which he has an obligation to respect," said a letter signed by FKF's Transfer Matching System Manager, Frank Ogolla.
