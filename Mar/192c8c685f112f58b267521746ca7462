A woman was found dead on Thursday in Kipsaraman, Baringo North subcounty. The body of Peris Chemweno, 55, was found on a verandah near a bar in Kipsaraman shopping centre. “She left home on Wednesday around 1pm and later that evening was spotted at the centre drunk and staggering. She didn’t come back,” her sister Julia Chepyator said on Friday. Witnesses said the victim was seen drinking on Wednesday night. Bars have been ordered closed by the government to contain the spread of coronavirus, but some owners have not complied. “But we wonder why her T-shirt was pulled off and some traces of struggles could be seen at the scene,” said Paul Tuigong, adding that they suspect she may have been strangled. He urged police to investigate. But Baringo North subcounty police commander Fred Odinga said the body could not be taken to a mortuary or be presented for postmortem. “Since the onset of coronavirus, the government no longer allows bodies at the mortuaries. So we urge the family to just bear with the situation, to retain and bury their loved one at home,” he said. Family member Willy Aengwo said they required preservatives and steriliser to keep the body at home. “We still require time until Saturday to brief the entire family,” he said. Saimo-Kipsaraman MCA John Aengwo condemned the rise in the sale of illicit brews. “We wonder why many bars are still operating in Baringo despite the presidential directive to close them,” he said, and urged the authorities to implement the order. He also urged residents to comply with the 7pm to 5am curfew beginning tonight. Edited by Josephine M. Mayuya
