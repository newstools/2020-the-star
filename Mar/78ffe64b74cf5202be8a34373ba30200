GE Healthcare and the Kenya Association of Radiologists recently held the 2nd Radiology Clinical Day to train more than 100 radiologists on the latest medical imaging technologies and techniques to improve diagnosis and disease management. The one-day forum, themed ‘Elevating Radiology’, was focused on gastrointestinal and abdominal radiology. GE Healthcare EA senior VP financing Jennifer Kinyoe said accurate diagnosis is a result of quality imaging services done with quality technology by competent healthcare professionals. “We are honoured to partner with KAR to ensure Kenya’s medical technologists are equipped with the right skills to continue providing better outcomes for patients.”
