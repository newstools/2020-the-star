The National Police Service is set to embark on itsÂ ambitious program to sensitise all police officers on trauma healing. The program tabbed Muamko Mpya-Healing the Uniform will be launched In Nairobi on Tuesday. Muamko Mpya-Healing the Uniform was initiated in 2019 and has seen the training of about 400 police officers across the country. The program is also meant to help the officers to boost their psychological wellbeing as they fulfill their mandate. The program which targets all police officers at all levels is also meant to enhance their sensitivity to issues of stress and trauma which they routinely encounter in their professional and personal lives. It also strives to create and hold safe spaces in police stations, offices, camps, colleges and communities. The program is also expected to enhance peer to peer support for officers to feel safe enough. The training will also be able to make police officers feel dignified to share their stories and experiences of stress, anguish and trauma in a confidential and non-judgemental environment. In addition, the program seeks to provide tools and frameworks that increase informed choices to ensure that stress and trauma that officers experience do not feed into the cycle of violence.
