Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) team manager, Chris Ogutu is keen to beef up the former champions ahead of the new season. Ogutu said his priority is to rebuild the sides and once again focus on the title. “We have already approached five players, three of them from Western to beef up our ladies side. The idea behind this is to revive the KPA sides and catapult them into contention,” he added. He said they also had trials for the men’s team and have a pool of 18 new players to choose from. Ogutu promised the porters will work hard to reclaim their top places in the country. “A top-two finish will not be bad at all,” he said. KPA women lost their league title to Equity Bank after going down 3-2 in last year’s play-off finals best of five-game series at Nyayo Stadium. On the other hand, the men’s team were kicked out in semis after falling to league’s eventual winners Ulinzi Warriors. The porters are scheduled to open their campaign this year with home matches against Kenyatta University ‘Oryx’ (women) and ‘Pirates (men) respectively.  The porters have won the national league women’s title 16 times while the men have done it seven times since inception in 1987. In a related development, Thunder coach Collins Gaya confirmed that he will miss the services of defensive ace Shem Otieno. The tactician disclosed that Otieno has moved to Equity Bank and will not be in his plans. Another player who has left is Collins Wekesa. Gaya also confirmed that Kevin Chogo, the team’s other mainstay in the centre will not be ready for action until September. Chogo, who together with national captain Griffin Ligare, carries Thunders’ offensive load, was injured during last year’s play-offs finals. “I will miss Otieno’s work ethics as well as Chogo’s inside plays,” Gaya said. “But I believe we will plug into the gap as we eye another good run this year.” Thunder, who battled champions Ulinzi Warriors in the play-off finals last year, are scheduled to play Umoja in their opening fixture.
