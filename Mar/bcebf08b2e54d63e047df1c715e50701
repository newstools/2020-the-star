Embu police have urged members of the public to help in tracing a farmhand who allegedly raped his employer’s wife before strangling her a week ago. Mbeere South subcounty deputy police commander Inviolate Imali on Monday called on the residents who know the whereabouts of David Kakuli to report the matter to the nearest police station for his immediate arrest. Imali said they suspected Kakuli ambushed Lydia Syomiti, wife of employer John Ireri, in a her house on Tuesday evening, forced  her into his house and and raped her before killing the woman. The incident took place in Njogu sublocation, Mavuria ward, in Mbeere South subcounty. Ireri who is a teacher at Seven Forks Primary School left his wife for work in the morning and returned in the evening but found her and the farmhand missing. He tried to reach his wife on her mobile phone but in vain. Because it was already night and he was tired, the teacher decided to sleep and look for her the next day. The police boss said in the morning the teacher broke into his farmhand's house and found his wife's naked body in his bed. He reported the matter to the police but the suspect remains at large.
