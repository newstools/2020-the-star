Gospel singer Bahati was in court on Tuesday to testify on the case in which Peter Blessing is charged with obtaining Sh2 million by false pretences. They appeared before magistrate Bernard Ochoi. The hearing was to start at 11am but failed to as Bahati had not arrived in court. On his arrival, the court was informed that he had been unwell and was still unwell. It did not ask for documents on the same. Peter Blessing had been charged with obtaining the money by false pretences. Blessing is said to have pretended he could produce music videos with the studios between July 4, 2019, which he denied in court last month. Earlier on, Bahati said Blessing walked out of his label without bothering to terminate his contract and went ahead to announce to the public that he had parted ways with EMB. Despite knowing that Peter had breached his contract, Bahati claimed he stopped his legal team against taking action until he was served with a demand letter from lawyers representing Peter Blessing. The case has been ongoing. On Tuesday, Bahati appeared after Blessing, through his lawyers, sought dismissal of the case. The case was, however, pushed to April 9, when Bahati will testify alongside two other witnesses (Weezdom and the investigating officer). Bahati had to appear physically since there is the likelihood of a case being dismissed if the complainant fails to appear for the hearing of a matter. He was, therefore, required to be present on Tuesday as the hearing was commencing.
