Farmers in Transnzoia are alarmed by the sharp increase in farm inputs. They said before the rains in the region farm inputs were affordable but [roces have skyrocketed. Farmer Jacob Monya said a 50kg of fertiliser cost Sh2,600 but some retailers are selling it for Sh3,200. “The prices have just increased in less than three days because of the rains that we are currently receiving,” he said. Monya said retailers have taken advantage of the coronavirus that has restricted movements and now are exploiting farmers. He said that this will greatly reduce the harvest. “Small-scale farmers will not be able to purchase the farm inputs and this will lead to food insecurity at the end of the year,” he said. The farmers have called on the government to intervene and control the prices of farm inputs. “Transnzoia is the breadbasket of this country and if we don’t control retailers who want to reap surplus profits, we are going to face a food shortage," former  Florah Mategwa said She said she is unable to buy fertiliser at the current market price, adding that she doesn't know what will happen to her. “I have already prepared my farm but am unable plant due to increase in the [rice pf farm inputs,” she said. Mategwa said President Uhuru Kenyatta told retailers not to take advantage of the coronavirus outbreak and hike prices of commodities. “Many retailers have failed to adhere to the directive and are selling the inputs at a higher price,” she said.
