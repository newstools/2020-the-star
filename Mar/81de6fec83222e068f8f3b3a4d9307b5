ODM rebels on Wednesday rejoined ODM after meeting party leader Raila Odinga at Capitol Hill on Wednesday. The rebels that rejoined the party are; Elizabeth Ongoro, Jakoyo Midiwo and Reuben Ndolo among others. They said they had apologized for leaving the outfit and pledged their loyalty to the party leader. In 2017, Ongoro defected from ODM citing frustration by the party. This was after Ongoro was asked not to run for the Ruaraka MP seat but refused. The seat is held by TJ Kajwang'. The legislator accused ODM of denying her the chance to exercise her democratic right to seek the Ruaraka MP seat. She was apparently barred from contesting on disciplinary grounds. Midiwo bolted out of ODM before the last general election after losing narrowly in the nominations to MP Elisha Odhiambo. He ran as an independent in the August 8, 2017 election and again lost to Odhiambo. Some of ODM members who left the party after the 2017 nominations are former Rarieda MP Nicholas Gumbo and former Funyula MP Paul Otuoma. Former Budalang'i MP Ababu Namwamba quit early to join the Labour Party of Kenya.
