National volleyball team coach Malkia Strikers' coach Paul Bitok says the current coronavirus pandemic has thrown Kenya's preparations for the 2020 Olympic Games into uncertainty. “I had plans that we start training for Tokyo on April 1 but that dream is almost dying. The girls were ready for training but this virus has put Kenya and the world in a dangerous situation,” said Bitok. He added that they wanted to use the Africa Club Championship, which were to be held in Egypt, to gauge their preparedness but the championships have as well been postponed since Egypt was the first country in Africa to report a positive case of the virus. “The players come from the top three clubs and we wanted, as they play in Egypt, to see how they are ready for Tokyo. From Egypt, we could get the best team to represent the country well in Japan," said Bitok.
