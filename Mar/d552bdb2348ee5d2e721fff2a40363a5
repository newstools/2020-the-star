Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi has gone into self quarantine after recent direct contact with a confirmed patient with Covid-19. He said he tested negative for the virus. "I had the emergency response team visit me at my home to collect specimen for testing . I got my results and they turned negative," he said. Kingi went into quarantine on March 19. We have already identified county staff who came into direct contact with the patient and we have ordered them to go on mandatory self quarantine for 14 days," he said in a statement on Sunday. Health CS Mutahi Kagwe had said a senior county official had tested positive for covid-19 and would be charged after completing time under quarantine. The official defied state orders to self quarantine after an international trip.
