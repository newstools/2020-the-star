Gospel singer Kambua says her baby is a miracle. The mother of one had been childless for over seven years. She explained how grateful she is through an Instagram post. "The encounters I have had with Him are all priceless. When the pain was gut-wrenching and my heart nearly drowned in tears, I never stopped believing that God would come through for me (whichever way He chose to)," she wrote. "And as I hold my toto today, I am reminded that God gives good gifts. My baby Nathaniel is a miracle. He is, as my husband likes to say, a world-changer and a history-maker. And I believe His life will continue to bring glory to God." She encouraged those who are childless to remain calm. "As you wait, my tent remains pitched right next to yours, in the land of hope. I haven't crossed over alone. We will cross together, leaving no one behind. None of us shall be left drowning in despair. Our stories, regardless of how they unfold, will be beacons of hope along ancient paths," she wrote. Earlier on, Kambua explained how she was constantly asked when she will get a child. “The reason it angers me is that people don’t even know what your journey is like. They don’t know what you’re struggling with," she said. “They don’t know if you even want to have children. They don’t know if you can have children and there are so many people, especially today, who are struggling with infertility. It's so unfortunate that we become such a culture of being so intrusive and putting people down.”
