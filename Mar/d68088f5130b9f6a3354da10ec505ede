Blazers' captain Tracy Karanja believes foreign duo of Nicola Watson (Zimbabwe) and Gerrtsan Stephany (USA) have the qualities to help the team to a record-breaking 23rd Kenya Hockey Union Premier League title. Watson, an experienced striker,Â  relocated to Kenya this year while Stephany, a forward cum-midfielder, is working with the United Nations in Nairobi. "Watson is one of the best players in Zimbabwe. She was a thorn in our flesh at the ACCC some years back. She is a talented player and we know her capabilities. Even though she wants to play social hockey, we are glad to have her," said Karanja. "We got in touch with her when she relocated to the country and the opportunity to work with her was tough to turn down. She is central to our objective of retaining the title." "Stephany is working with the United Nations. Her situation could not allow us to register her last season but her availability this time round is good for the team and a possible selection headache for the coach," added Karanja. Watson's presence relieves the team of the pain of losing experienced striker, Jacqueline Mwangi, to injury. She tipped Mwangi to make an immediate impact after being appointed the Under 21 and senior women's national team coach. Blazers' forward Barbara Simiyu will be her assistant alongside Glennis Namasake. "We are remorseful about her injury but hopefully, she will be well in a few weeks. I believe in her. I know her as a player and she is capable of handling the team and take it to the next level," Karanja said of Mwangi. "With women managing all the categories, we should be able to see the changes we have all been yearning for. We have to rally behind them to realise set objectives."
