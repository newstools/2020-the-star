Masinde Muliro University of Science and Technology (MMUST) skipper Samuel Mbeche will be out for the next six months after undergoing knee surgery. The centre has had a nagging knee injury for the better part of the season and underwent the operation on Tuesday at Kijabe Hospital. Mbeche will miss the championship semifinals and final alongside the national Sevens circuit which will start in July. Last season, the university side ruffled the big guns in the Seven Series, finishing a credible eighth with 50 points ahead of seasoned campaigners like 2017 champions Kabras, Quins and Strathmore Leos. Mbeche said the goal this year is to play in the top tier. “We are very a young team and we have come along way. Our target will be to qualify for Kenya Cup and compete against the top teams in the country,” added Mbeche. Mbeche has been a key player for the Kakamega-based side as they chase promotion to the Kenya Cup from the championship. The Kakamega-based side lies second on the log with 67 points —nine behind leaders Strathmore Leos and are quietly confident they will be in the top tier next season. The varsity side is due to face either Mean Machine or United States International University (USIU) in the semifinals. All Rugby related activities, however, were suspended following a government directive to curb the spread of coronavirus. Elsewhere KCB utility back Ken Moseti has retired after a 16-year playing career. The alumni of Nairobi School announced his retirement on his Facebook page. Moseti played for Nondies, Homeboyz and KCB. The diminutive hard-tackling utility back was part of the KCB side that won three Kenya Cup titles as well as Enterprise and Impala Floodlit titles. Moseti played for Kenya 7s under Coach Mitch Ocholla, during the 2011/12 season.
