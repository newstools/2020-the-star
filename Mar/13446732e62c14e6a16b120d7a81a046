Three people were on Sunday afternoon killed when their vehicle stepped on an IED in Koranhindi in Holugho sub-county, Garissa. The five, a driver, two patients[women] and two children, were in an ambulance that was traveling from Sangailu to Holugho sub-county hospital. Northeastern regional commissioner Nicodemus Ndalana while confirming the incident said the militants further sprayed bullets on the occupants. “It is by the grace of God that the two children who belong to one of the women killed survived the attack. Our officers immediately responded and they are still in the area pursuing the militants,” said Ndalana. Area governor Ali Korane took to his Facebook page to condemn the incident. “Deeply saddened by the heinous IED attack that killed 3 people traveling in an ambulance from Sangailu to Hulugho, Garissa County. Those killed include the driver and a patient. I condemn this heartless attack. Perpetrators of terror in all forms must be defeated,” read part of his post. The incident comes barely a day after North Eastern regional commissioner Nicodemus Ndalana urged area residents to volunteer information on suspicious characters within their midst saying that it was the only way to tackle Al-Shabaab menace. Ndalana said his office alone together with the security officers cannot eradicate the Somali based Al-Shabaab terror group without the cooperation of the wananchi. And on Friday, six suspected Al-Shabaab militants were killed in Jirole, Ijara sub-county. And on Saturday, the militants killed 3 police officers in Alinjugur and Hagadera in Fafi sub-county.
