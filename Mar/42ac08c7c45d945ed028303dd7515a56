Nairobi motorists have been advised to avoid the Kingara-Ngong roads junction from March 16 to March 28 as it will be closed for rehabilitation. The job is part of the ongoing construction of Phase 2 of Ngong Road. The Kenya Urban Roads Authority said traffic from Ngong' town and Karen via Ngong' Road will be diverted to Naivasha Road, Riara Road and then to Kingara Road. Motorists from the city centre intending to join Kingara Road will do so via either Ole Dume or Makindi roads. "We apologise for the inconvenience as we endeavour to provide efficient urban road network," Kura director-general Silas Kinoti said in a public notice. Work on Ngong Road Phase 2 started on March 20, 2018. It's a four-lane carriageway with walkways and cycle lanes on both sides. The Sh2.1 billion 3.5-kilometre road starts at Prestige Plaza and ends at Dagoretti Corner. The contractor, World Kaihatsu Kogyo Company of Japan, intends to complete the job by the end of next month. Kura says the main challenges have been traffic management, relocation of services and encroachment of the road corridor by small-scale traders. "The authority (Kura) is committed to transforming the urban transport system and we are striving to ensure that in all our roads development we input the Non-Motorized Transport facilities. This will greatly ensure our public mobility is effective and efficient," Kinoti said. Ngong Road Phase 1 was commissioned by President Uhuru Kenyatta in 2016.  It is a 2.5-km section from Kenya National Library to Prestige Plaza. The construction of the  10-kilometre Phase 3 is also ongoing and is expected to be completed by July. It runs from Dagoretti Corner to Karen shopping centre. The new Ngong Road will incorporate Bus Rapid Transport, a transit system designed to allow buses to run within a fully dedicated "right of way" to avoid traffic jams.  – mwaniki fm
