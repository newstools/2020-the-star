All the 47 county assemblies have suspended their sittings and operations for the next 15 days commencing today, County Assemblies Forum chairman Wahome Ndegwa announced yesterday. He said the move was aimed at reducing the possibility of spreading coronavirus. Ndegwa said following the presidential decree on Sunday and the recommendations made by the Health CS following the confirmation of Covid-19, the forum “recognises the weight of the matter and supports this decree made by the President.” Except for very crucial matters, county assemblies were encouraged to allow their staff to work from home and ensure daily tasks in their dockets are completed without delay. Before closure, Ndegwa said, the assemblies were advised to move, debate motions of importance and craft possible ways of dealing with the pandemic. The assemblies were further advised to engage their respective health executives for in-depth briefing on the levels of preparedness of their counties to deal with the pandemic. Ndegwa said nothing should be left to chance and all assemblies should observe high level of hygiene. All the necessary materials that will enable prevention, including water and soap, hand sanitisers and any other material that supports prevention will be provided to curb spread of the virus.
