The High Court has reviewed Embakasi East MP Babu Owino's bail terms to Sh5 million cash bail with an alternative of Sh10 million bond with two sureties of a similar amount. In his ruling on Tuesday, Justice Luka Kimaru considered that there were no compelling reasons to deny him bail or bond. The Mp has so far deposited Sh 4.4 million as cash bail. He will, therefore, be required to pay an additional Sh 600,000 to secure his freedom. Contrary to a lower court order, Justice Kimaru has directed that Babu will only help settle DJ Evolve's hospital bill as a moral obligation. "The accused person should continue paying the hospital bill as a moral duty to him, not as a court order...if he fails to pay it is up to him and his court," Justice Kimaru said. The matter will be mentioned on March 20, 2020. Babu Owino had moved to court pleading that it reviews the bail term issued, arguing that it was too high. He had been released by the court on Sh10 million bail in a case in which he was charged with the attempted murder of Felix Odhiambo, well known as DJ Evolve. The MP also wanted the court to stop the DPP from commenting on his case. Milimani chief magistrate Francis Andayi had directed Babu to deposit Sh2.5 million to be released and pay the remaining cash in installments. In an application filed at the Milimani law courts, Babu says he will struggle to meet the remaining installments as directed. “I have partially complied with the terms as set out and thus I am out on bail but I know that I will have to struggle to meet the remaining installments as directed in the terms of bail and thus would also appreciate an alternative of bond over and above a reduction of the amounts stated,” Babu says.
