A Tanzanian watchman was on Saturday night lynched by angry students of Uriri Vocational Training Centre during a fracas that left three students seriously injured. Moses Nobro, 26, was hired by the institution as a guard. Nobro and the students had an altercation at about 8pm when he reported to duty over a missing security bulb. “The watchman who was drunk excused himself only to come back with a sword and tried to attack the students in retaliation,” a student told the Star on condition of anonymity. Uriri police boss Peter Njoroge said in the confrontation the watchman assaulted three students: Brian Otieno Ogendi, 22, Kevin Odhiambo Ouma, 18, and Steven Ouma Osingo, 18. “The three students were taken to Uriri subcounty hospital where they treated before being referred to Migori referral hospital,” he said. In retaliation, the students attacked the drunk watchman before police were called in to restore calm at the institution. “He was rushed to Migori referral hospital where he was pronounced dead on Sunday morning. The institution has been closed for a week to bring calm and carry out investigations into the incident,” Njoroge said.
