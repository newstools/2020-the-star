An MP wants employers to conduct background checks on people they intend to hire instead of requiring all applicants to get costly clearance certificates from at least five agencies. Gideon Keter (Nominated) says the move will save jobseekers from paying money to agencies to be cleared for jobs they are not sure of getting. He said most unemployed people are less than 35 years and are, therefore, unable to afford the clearance fees. Many times, employers – especially the public service — require jobseekers to present the clearance documents prior to being granted interview slots. The certificates are from the Kenya Revenue Authority, the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission and the Higher Education Loans Board. Others are from Credit Reference Bureaus and the Directorate of Criminal Investigations, commonly known as a police clearance certificate. But Keter wants employers to ask candidates to get certificates only after they are considered for jobs. The lawmaker wants Section 9 of the Employment Act amended to remove the provisions which require people to pay for the certificates. The amendment reads: “An employer shall not require an employee for a contract of service to submit clearance certificates for which payment is required,” the Employment Bill, 2019 ... “…unless such employer intends to enter into a written contract of service with the employee.” Keter wants the candidates to obtain certificates only after they are hired  – for compliance with Chapter 6 of the Constitution. “An employer who intends to enter into a written contract with an employer may request an employee to submit mandatory clearance certificates,” the Bill reads. It was first read last month. Keter has been bidding for unemployed youths and persons with disabilities to be excused from the fees amounting to over Sh4,700. In February 2019, he came up with a legislative proposal to allow a waiver for youths and PWDs seeking jobs. (Edited by V. Graham)
