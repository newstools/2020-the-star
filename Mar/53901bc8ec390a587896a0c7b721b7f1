Smooth FM will be hosting an acoustic night event every first Thursday of the month at The Social House at the INCA rooftop bar. The event begins today. An acoustic night is an amazing musical night that takes you on a journey through music using instruments, vocal or unplugged format. The night could have some surprises from folk music, rhumba, pop, country, all done in acoustic format. The event targets fans aged 30-50 years, a more mature audience with disposable income, who want a memorable night out with their friends, family or spouse. People who appreciate quality and will enjoy a show where they can see the effort that was put into production. Artistes who will be featured for live performance in today's edition include Aaron Rimbui, who started his career as music director playing for Eric Wainaina, and Kanji Mbugua, whose creative ideas stem from his interaction with artistes overseas. The next edition will feature Atemi, one of the most prolific vocal artistes of our generation. Her music is clean and ranges in genre from neo-soul to jazz to afro-pop. Her single ‘Bebi Bebi’ made great waves on radio and is currently one of Kenya's favourite love songs. She is one of the artistes who Kenya stands by as our ‘best foot forward’ on any stage anywhere in the world. She will be our Kenyan connection on this first edition of FusionAfrique.
