Enterprise Cup champions Kabras have been handed a walkover to the semifinal after their opponents Mwamba failed to travel to Kakamega. “Mwamba will send one team to Kakamega this weekend and we will, therefore, play Kabras in Mwamba Cup only. A decision has been made to miss this weekend’s Enterprise Cup,”  read a statement on Mwamba’s official Twitter page. A decision has been taken to allow the first team players who are down with injuries to recover ahead of the Kenya Cup quarterfinal clash against Impala set for Impala Club next week. “This decision was reached on the advice of the club’s medical team as the first team is currently decimated by injuries. The doctors advised that the players will need extended rest and recovery in order to be fully fit for the rest of the Kenya Cup campaign,” the statement read. The sugar millers will now await for the winner of the Homeboyz v Nondies clash set for today at Jamhuri Park. Five-time Enterprise Cup winners KCB have made nine changes to the team to face Blak Blad at the Lion Den in Ruaraka. Oscar Sorano, Griffin Musila, Derrick Juma, Oliver Mang’eni, Samuel Asati, Mike Kimwele, Brian Omondi, Peter Kilonzo and Isaac Njoroge who played against Homeboyz will not start this weekend. In the front row, Patrick Ouko, George Asin and Nelson Nyandat will lead the pack, replacing Sorano, Musila and Juma. Nick Ongeri joins Francis Mwita who has maintained his slot in second row. Martin Owillah, Steve Wamai and Felix Ojoo will start together in the back row. Michael Wanjala comes to the starting squad to partner with fly-half Johnstone Olindi. Collins Wanjala and Geoffrey Okwatch have been introduced on the wings while Darwin Mukidza has kept his place at fullback. Stafford Abeka and former Blak Blad utility Levy Amunga have started in the midfield. The winner of the KCB v Blak Blad tie will either face Impala or Nakuru in the semifinals. The semifinals are slated for March 28 with the final on April 18 at the RFUEA ground
