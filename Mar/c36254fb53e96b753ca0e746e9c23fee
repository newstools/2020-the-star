Kiambu Woman Representative Gathoni Wamuchomba has said she will support Baringo Senator Gedion Moi's bid for the presidency in 2022. “My friend Gideon, start preparing your house. I am ready to support you,” Wamuchomba said. The lawmaker said she was convinced Gideon will be the fifth president of Kenya. Wamuchomba said she will not turn back since she has already made her mind. She urged other leaders to follow her. She acknowledged that Gideon took over his father's leadership mantle when he received the late President Daniel Moi's Nyayo baton. "We have seen all leaders who have been ruling were in Kanu. As of now, I'm convinced that Kanu will still rule," she said. When I visited the fallen veteran politician Nginyo Kariuki, he advised me to support you, she told Gideon. Nginyo was buried on Tuesday, where Wamuchomba first declared her support for Gideon. Gideon said Kanu will always remain a strong party. “Whoever thinks our party is not there, let them know that Kanu will remain. It used to be there, it is there and it will remain there," he said.
