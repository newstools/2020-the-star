Vihiga Governor Wilber Ottichillo suffered another blow after MCAs allied to him were removed from major positions in the assembly. Ottichillo had run to the High Court in Kakamega to get an injunction to stop the assembly from debating an impeachment motion. Speaking to Star on phone on Friday, majority whip Victor Ijaika said the house could not oversight the executive properly when some members had gone to bed with the county government. "The essence of kicking out these rebels is to ensure the house leadership is intact to serve the interest of Vihiga people," Ijaika told the Star. Luanda South MCA Peter Alukitsa was removed as chairperson of the agriculture committee and replaced by Francis Kiru. Transport and public works committee chair Manoah Tambua was replaced by Vincent Asiaya. Manoah Osore of West Bunyore was replaced by Stephen Mugalizi in the committee for justice and legal affairs. Patrick Akhwale ward was replaced in the land,housing and urban planning committee by Calystus Ayodi. Paul Ananda was replaced by Dominick Barasa in the committee for water and environment. The assembly was divided on the impeachment plans, with a section of MCAs accusing others of not giving the governor a chance to address the house. “These are our brothers. We don't hate them but we have decided to put theme aside so that when they come to their senses they will pick up," Ijaika said. "The assembly is well balanced with all communities well presented. For instance, the seats of leader majority and minority are taken by Bunyore community, speaker and the majority whip positions are taken by Maragolis and deputy speaker and minority whip are Tiriki.”
