The governmentâ€™s decision to suspend learning in the country due to the Covid-19 was a brave and laudable move but one that changes everything for students. A lot was to happen for students who had scheduled attachments and projects vital for one to qualify to graduate. As much as this call is for the protection of every citizen in the country, it is bound to affect the whole year as in May, institutions are supposed to enrol a new lot of students who sat their KCSE last year. Not all schools have adopted the E-learning system in the country. The most important thing right now, however, is to stay safe and contain the spread of the deadly virus. All we are left to do is hope for the best and pray this ends very soon since we are the ones who will suffer the most at the end.  Kabianga university
