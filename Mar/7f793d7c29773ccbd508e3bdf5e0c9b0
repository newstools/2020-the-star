The Kenya Davis Cup team got off to a poor start, losing their opening singles matches to trail Indonesia 2-0 in Jakarta yesterday. Christopher Rungkat beat Sheil Kotecha 6-1, 6-2 in the opening singles match. Kotecha was no match for the hard-hitting Indonesian in the opening set, dropping the opening three games of the set to trail 3-0. Kotecha rediscovered his form in the fourth game of the set and broke the Indonesian to trail 3-1. Rungkat then dominated the next two games to take a 5-1 lead as Kotecha saved a set point in the seventh game to stay alive in the set. His joy was, however, shortlived as Rungat closed out the set. Kotecha showed fight in the second set as he and Rungkat split the opening four games to be tied at 2-2. Rungkat stepped up a gear in the remainder, pounding several winners to win the opening match. Kenya's top-ranked player Ishmael Changawa put up a valiant effort in the second singles match but lost to David Susanto 6-2, 6-4. Changawa matched the Indonesian especially in the second set but fell short. Changawa and Ibrahim Yego will face off with Rifqi Fitriadi and Gunawan Trismuwantara in the doubles match today Team captain Rosemary Owino said she hopes the team can bounce back in today's doubles match ahead of the reverse singles fixture. "It's a big game for us. We need to win the doubles and get a bit of momentum for Sunday's reverse singles matches,‚Äù added Owino. The winner between Kenya and Indonesia will secure a slot in the Davis Cup Group II proper which will be contested in September alongside the losing nations from the World Group I ties
