Carole Kinoti, who is an award-winning designer, recently held a fashion high tea at the Lord Errol hotel, Nairobi. The idea of the fashion was to 'express how you feel'. With 15+ years experience in the fashion and design industry, Kinoti is renowned for enabling one to re-imagine the world of beautiful off-the-shelf attires that perfectly blend with one's attitudes and natural flows. This event was organised in collaboration with Lisa Christoffersen Arts and Lisa Christoffersson, with all the items available on purchase during the event.
