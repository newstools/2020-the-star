"All calls, SMS services, M-pesa internet and data shall remain available for the duration of maintenance," the telco said. "We are sorry for any inconveniences." This comes days after Safaricom waived fees for M-Pesa transactions below Sh1,000 following the COVID -19 outbreak. President Uhuru Kenyatta had directed that telecos should consider reducing the cost of using mobile money during this period to curb the spread. Over 9,000 people have died globally and thousands infected. In Kenya, seven cases have been confirmed.
