 Garissa Governor Ali Korane on Monday called for the support of development partners to revive the Garissa Tannery, saying its construction had stalled. The tannery was to be built under the Economic Stimulus Project. Korane said the project will complement the Garissa modern abattoir that is under construction. He was speaking when he hosted a delegation assessing the progress of development projects being undertaken in the northern frontier counties. The team was led by Devolution Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa and comprised UN Resident Coordinator Siddharth Chatterjee, India ambassador Rahul Chhabra, Devolution CAS Abdul Bahari, Russian embassy deputy permanent representative Vladimir Lenev and Frontier Counties Development Council CEO Mohamed Guleid. They visited the proposed Garissa Cancer Centre and Garissa tannery. The visit was meant to assess possible areas of intervention, partnerships and leveraging on opportunities considering geographic proximities in addressing shared developmental challenges in FCDC counties. Korane told the team the county was undertaking development projects that have the potential of transforming the livelihoods of local communities and boosting the economy of the region. “This great county requires rapid industrialisation to offer employment opportunities to the growing population which as you know has turned from the pastoral way of life as a result of climate change leading to rapid urbanisation. This has led to excessive pressure on meager social services,” Korane said. The governor said they had allocated 12,500 acres of land to pilot an ultra-modern abattoir. "They will buy, fatten, slaughter, sell, pack and even export our animals and also set up a facility to process hides and skins," Korane said. He added, "In the long run if successful, the project will be expanded and people in more than 18,000 households will benefit."  edited by peter obuya
