Homa Bay Governor Cyprian Awiti has once again threatened to sack lazy County Executive Committee members and chief officers. He said service to the people must be prioritised. Awiti spoke on Thursday at the county headquarters after the 10 executives, locally known as ministers, and more than eight chief officers signed performance contracts — the former for the first time. Also present were Deputy Governor Hamilton Orata and county secretary Isaiah Ogwe. Awiti said the contracts will give him an opportunity to weed out non-performers. He said the documents stipulate performance targets for each official. "I’m not intimidating my ministers, but this time they must work according to the stipulated expectations. The target is now clear and any minister who fails to meet his or hers will have to quit," Awiti said. The governor said the time had come for his administration to achieve development objectives to enable him to leave an admirable legacy. He said this can only be achieved through efficiency and accountability in every department. "We want to do away with a narrative that some departments are not delivering services to the people effectively," Awiti said. "Let no minister blame me or Orata for being harsh on them. What will save them is their performance." The county chief said his administration had embarked on result-oriented leadership to improve services to residents. "What I want is better output and outcome from each of my ministers. We want to see residents get government services in a deserving manner." Orata said the contracts will expose non-performers to the public. "Let the CEC members know that the document they are signing today will be made available to the public on demand. They should be careful because they are in a public court," he said. The executives are also expected to lead junior employees in their departments in signing performance contracts.
