Rapper Petra says her latest song 'Mine' is about the love journey from falling to heartbreak and the feelings these experiences bring. "I love hearing about love stories but never had a chance to give one, especially through a song, and that's one of the reasons why my new song is special to me," Petra told Word Is. Petra says she is excited to kick off the year 2020 with a blazing hot new jam. She effortlessly fuses rapping and singing on the track, which carries a touch of dancehall, to produce a record that will remain etched in your memory and soul for long. The audio was produced by Kash Keed and mastered by Sappy. The catchy video was shot and directed by Kevin Bosco Jnr. Petra is known for working with the big shots in the rap industry, such as Khaligraph Jones on the track 'Rider'.
