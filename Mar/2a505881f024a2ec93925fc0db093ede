Health CS Mutahi Kagwe has confirmed one more coronavirus case in Kenya raising the number of positive cases in the country to 16 people. The CS said that they have already traced 626 people who came into contact with those who tested positive for coronavirus. Kagwe further appealed to the matatu industry to reduce fares. "I want to make an appeal not to increase fares to our commuters. By so doing it will be counterproductive," he said. Kagwe apologized to those individuals who arrived from Sunday for inconvenience and delays. "We know we inconvenienced people but we apologise. It was necessary. All the hotels that are hosting persons who are under mandatory quarantine are requested to be considerate and offer discounted rates," he said. The CS said 96 people have been released after the 14-day follow up period while 550 others remain on the follow-up list. Kagwe announced that all the patients, except one who is at the Coast are in stable condition. 11 individuals are currently admitted at Mbagathi Hospital awaiting test results. The CS said passengers coming into the country between now and Wednesday midnight will undergo mandatory quarantine at their own expense at government-designated facilities. "We are encouraged to note that the majority of the people have complied with the measures we have so far announced. We continue to appeal to Kenyans to take the matter seriously and strictly observe the advisories issued which are all aimed at containing the spread," Kagwe added.
