The Pharmacy and Poisons Board in northeastern has raised a red flag over the possibility of counterfeit drugs being sold in chemists in Garissa, Wajir and Mandera. North Eastern region PPB's drug inspector Ali Omar said the drugs mostly being counterfeited include antimicrobials, child and maternal drugs and medicine for treatment of non-communicable diseases. “We have been conducting post marketing surveillance in both public and private hospitals as well as chemists where we sample selected products, mainly antibiotics, and taking them to the laboratory for testing to ascertain whether the therapeutic value is the same as what is indicated in the labeling,” said Omar on Sunday. He added: “We have collected 29 samples and the results will be communicated to the public in due course. If by any chance any of the products fail to meet the test then they will be immediately withdrawn from the Kenyan market and the importer, or manufacturer blacklisted." Last month, board officials raided pharmacists, shops, kiosks and miraa dens suspected to be selling prescription drugs to youth in Garissa town. Youth in the region abuse Cozepam, diazepam and benyline, which they use when chewing miraa. Last year, the board banned the sale of the drugs over the counter unless the patient has been prescribed by a doctor. “We want to put  on notice anybody still involved in this illegal business. We  are determined to completely rid off these drugs that have been badly abused by our youths, turning them into zombies,” he added. Miraa dens and shops still selling the drugs are doing so discreetly to a few select loyal customers. Abusers of the drugs, who requested for anonymity, said the drugs are hard to find since the board started the raids. “Things have changed. Unlike before when you could just walk in a shop or chemist and get them, right now it is difficult," said Abdi (not his real name). "Even the few who are still selling them are doing so with a lot of fear,” he added.
