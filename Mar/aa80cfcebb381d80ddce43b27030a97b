Taxman KRA will lead the collection of revenue remitted to the Nairobi City County Government for the next two years starting March 16. The county formally appointed the Kenya Revenue Authority as the principal-agent for overall collections for all county income in a gazette notice published on Friday. It will by this development be the collector of parking fees, cess, land rates, penalties among other City Hall charges. The monies collected by KRA would be deposited in both the Consolidated Fund and the County Revenue Fund. This followed the February 25 agreement signed by Governor Mike Sonko and Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa at State House, Nairobi. The deal was reached in the presence of President Uhuru Kenyatta and Senate Speaker Ken Lusaka to salvage Nairobi’s leadership crisis. KRA is taking over amid concerns by the Controller of Budget that City Hall's revenue has been declining over the years. The City-County collects an average of Sh11 billion annually. Sonko was barred from accessing his office on corruption charges on a Sh357 million shilling garbage tender. Finance CEC Allan Igambi said the KRA appointment was in accordance with Section 160 of the Public Finance Management Act, 2012. The law says the CEC may authorise the Kenya Revenue Authority or appoint a collection agent to be a collector of county government revenue. The governor surrendered Health, Transport services; Planning and development services; County public works, utilities. The National Government will also take over the management of staff working under the departments that the county boss surrendered. Uhuru’s administration took over the functions in the wake of internal constraints which hindered the county from operating effectively.
