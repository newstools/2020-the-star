BrighterMonday has launched an assessment tool that tests an applicants’ abilities beyond what is captured on their CVs to ensure competency and hard skills required for a specific role during the hiring process. “The tests are industry-specific and have been curated by experts making them excellent predictors of a candidate's ability to perform the tasks required, allowing employers to pick suitable candidates with ease,” chief executive officer, Emmanuel Mutuma, said. He said that the assessments are linked to a job listing and it, therefore, becomes part of the job application process meaning that all candidates responding to a job advertisement will take the assessment. The assessment tool is set to address one of the key underlying challenges in recruitment when a single vacancy attracts overwhelming numbers of applications making talent selection a laborious and time-consuming task. According to the Federation of Kenyan Employees (FKE) other than academic qualifications, employers are now looking at a candidate’s ability to fit into a role, something that cannot be measured by merely looking at a CV. Through the applicant tracking system, a back-end filter that augments the assessment tool, hiring managers will be able to view a candidate scores alongside other filters like education and experience levels. This way, an employer can compare a candidate’s proficiency, qualifications and experience levels at a glance.
