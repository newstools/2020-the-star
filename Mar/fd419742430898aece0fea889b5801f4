Tanasha has deleted Diamond's photos on her Instagram. The two seems to have broken up days after Tanasha begged her baby daddy in the song ‘Gere’ (Jealous), in which she featured him, not to cheat on her, In the salacious song, Tanasha begs Diamond to stick by her side and not play her with basic b*tches. Well, days after its release, Diamond released another track, ‘Jeje’. He has since been promoting it and not 'Gere', and it seems things have gone south. In 'Jeje', the video vixen twerks hard on Simba, which seems to have rattled Tanasha. In her Instagram stories, she describes that as disrespectful. She jams to Roddy Ricch's new hit ‘The Box’, which has over nine million views in one day. Tanasha says the song is trending as number one because there is no twerking and that the song preaches life. “Not bad b*tches, sex and immorality. Wisdom!" she says. Adding, “I will never sell my soul, and I can back that." She advises women against men who have narcissistic personality disorders. Narcissism entails personality qualities such as thinking very highly of oneself, needing admiration, believing others are inferior and lacking empathy for others. Rumours of Diamond cheating on Tanasha have been going around, but the mother of one has always defended him. Edited by T Jalio
