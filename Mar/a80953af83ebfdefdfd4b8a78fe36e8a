 Isiolo has resolved to convert an almost complete dispensary into an infectious diseases unit in case of an outbreak of Covid-19. This follows a Ministry of Health directive that all county referral hospitals should have an isolation ward to handle suspected cases. Isiolo County Referral Hospital lacks space for an isolation ward, hence the conversion of Shambani dispensary in Burat ward into an isolation ward, according to a technical committee headed by county commissioner Herman Shambi and Health executive Wario Galma. Kenya had three confirmed cases of Covid- 19 by March 15. Galma told journalists at the County Commissioner’s office that all rooms at Isiolo County Referral Hospital were fully occupied. “The new dispensary is almost complete, but it has space and sufficient clean water. The facility only lacks electricity. This will be operationalised by end of this week,” he said. The technical committee urged the public to uphold high standards of hygiene by avoiding crowded places. They should wash hands regularly using soap and avoid touching eyes and mouth. Shaking of hands should also be minimised.
