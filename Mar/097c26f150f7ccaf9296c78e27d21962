 Hamilton Karugendo has exited the Embu Water and Sanitation Company after 16 years as chief executive amid court battles between stakeholders and the county government. Karugendo was the company's chief executive from 2004 during which the company remained the second-best clean water provider after Nyeri. The University of Nairobi trained engineer's three-year renewable contract expired before a new board acceptable to all stakeholders was constituted. The county government and the EWASCO stakeholders have been feuding over a  "controversially-appointed" board. The matter has been in court for a year after the stakeholders rejected the directors "imposed on us" by the county government. Karugendo's contract ended in January. As the case in court remained unsettled, Governor Martin Wambora sacked Water executive Patrick Waganagwa and replaced him with the Land executive Josphat Kithumbu. Six months later, Waganagwa was brought back as the Health executive. Joel Ngatiari, a former Nairobi School principal, was retained as the EWASCO chairman. Phelix Gitonga is the acting chief executive. The company has advertised for the CEO's post. The applications close on March 30. Kithumbu told the Star by phone yesterday that Karugendo can also apply. “Karugendo is free to reapply for the seat. His application will be considered with those of the others,” he said. Wambora attended the last EWASCO board meeting (the first time) and pledged to support the board chaired by Ngatiari. Kithumbu assured the company of the county government's support so that it retains its position as a top-ranking provider of clean water in the country.  – mwaniki fm
