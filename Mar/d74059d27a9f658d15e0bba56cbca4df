World Half Marathon Championships earlier scheduled for March 29 in Gdynia, Poland has been postponed to October this year, due to the ongoing uncertainty created by the spread of new Coronavirus internationally. “The current international situation would have seriously compromised the event at this time as many countries are now restricting international travel, invoking quarantines and advising citizens and event organisers to avoid mass gatherings,” said a statement from the World Athletics. The statement added: “First and foremost, we had to consider the health and well-being of our athletes, officials and spectators in making this decision.” According to WA, advice from our medical team, who are in contact with the World Health Organisation, is that the spread of the Coronavirus is at a concerning level in many countries and that all major gatherings should be reviewed. “This week, we have worked with the Local Organising Committee to identify an appropriate alternative date for both the host city and for the elite competitors and we have agreed on October 17, this year,” read the statement. The event had attracted 25,000 participants and WA hope that the great majority of the recreational runners will still be able to participate alongside our elite competitors on the new date.
