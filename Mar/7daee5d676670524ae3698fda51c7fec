All Nairobi County Government staff engaged in revenue collection will from March 18, 2020 report to KRA Headquarters at Times Tower for re-deployment. This comes as the authority officially started to collect revenue for the county as per the deed of transfer signed between Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko and Devolution Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa last month. KRA is also set to oversee all streams of revenue and administer the taxes through the normal process of assessment, payment, accounting, remission and enforcement through both compliance and debt recovery. This is according to a joint statement by the Commissioner-General James Githii and Principal Secretary Ministry of Devolution Charles Sunkuli on Monday. The county formally appointed the Kenya Revenue Authority as the principal-agent for overall collections for all county income in a gazette notice published on March 6. It will by this development be the collector of parking fees, cess, land rates, penalties among other City Hall charges. The monies collected by KRA would be deposited in both the Consolidated Fund and the County Revenue Fund. KRA is taking over amid concerns by the Controller of Budget that City Hall's revenue has been declining over the years. The City-County collects an average of Sh11 billion annually. Sonko was barred from accessing his office on corruption charges on a Sh357 million shilling garbage tender. Finance CEC Allan Igambi said the KRA appointment was in accordance with Section 160 of the Public Finance Management Act, 2012. The law says the CEC may authorise the Kenya Revenue Authority or appoint a collection agent to be a collector of county government revenue. The governor surrendered Health, Transport services; Planning and development services; County public works, utilities. The National Government will also take over the management of staff working under the departments that the county boss surrendered.
