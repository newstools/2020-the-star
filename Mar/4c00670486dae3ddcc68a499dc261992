Kenya hopes to rack up more Olympic slots during the final World qualification event in Paris France from May 13-24 after bagging two in the just concluded Africa Olympic qualifier in Dakar, Senegal. The Paris event, according to National “Hit Squad” coach Musa Benjamin will give boxers, who failed to qualify in Dakar a second chance to secure a ticket for Tokyo. He, however, said this will be open only to boxers like Rayton Okwiri and Elly Ajowi who have not yet made it for the games. Musa couldn’t disclose the number of boxers earmarked for Paris but confirmed that there are plans to enter a team. “The world qualification event will offer us the opportunity to vie for more slots. It’s still early days though, so finer details will follow soon,” said Musa. The national coach was speaking upon arrival from Dakar, where Team Kenya (Hit Squad) chalked up two slots through Captain Nick Okoth and lady boxer Christine Ongare. The Olympic-bound Ongare is, by and large, Kenya’s most successful female boxer after making it to the Olympics, over and above, winning bronze in Gold Coast Commonwealth Games. The Hit Squad arrived back in the country from Senegal yesterday morning and was received at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport by Boxing Federation of Kenya (BFK) president Anthony Otieno Ombok aka Jamal. Hew was accompanied by Nairobi County Boxing Association chairman, Kennedy Otieno aka Kentrack and Kuala Lumpur Commonwealth Games silver medallist Absalom Okinyi aka Diblo, who is incidentally the elder brother to Nick Okoth. “Thank you all so much for the support, prayers and best wishes from when we started the journey to Dakar on January 11 to date. The journey to Tokyo is still on,” said BFK PRO Duncan Kuria aka Sugar Ray.
