Kitui Senator Enoch Wambua on Saturday donated handwashing water tanks across 15 market centres within the county to control the spread of coronavirus. The handwashing drive was kicked off at Kabati market in Kitui West where four water tanks were placed at strategic points within the market. The locals, who included children, got a chance to wash their hands. The senator told the locals that the virus was real and urged them to routinely wash their hands, avoid shaking hands as well as keep physical distance. "This virus is real but we are determined to beat it if only we can be disciplined and adhere to the precautionary measures laid out by the ministry of health," said Wambua, who was accompanied by the area deputy county commissioner James Odhiambo. Other centers across the county where the hand washing water tanks were provided included Migwani, Kisasi, Ikutha, Zombe, Mutomo, and Mbitini. Wambua condemned the police brutality meted on Kenyans across the country on Friday night. "It is very disheartening to see the police brutalising people who are struggling to beat the curfew deadline. There must be a civilised way of addressing this matter and those officers should be disciplined," Wambua said. The senator said that should the situation not improve in the coming few weeks, then a total lock-down would be necessary. The senator appealed to the county government to provide health officers with the requisite protective gear in order to secure their lives even as they fight to protect the population. The government has imposed a 7 pm - 5 am curfew that is meant to curb the spread of the virus.
