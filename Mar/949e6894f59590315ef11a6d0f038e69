MultiChoice has set aside R80 million (Sh475 million) for March and April to safeguard the incomes of cast, crew and creatives as well as the sustainability of production houses. MultiChoice Group CEO Calvo Mawela said they want to secure the incomes of creatives, cast and crew over this period. "We want to ensure that they and their families are not negatively impacted as work has come to a standstill," he said. Through the MultiChoice Talent Factory, they will be launching an online learning portal that will support over 40,000 members of the industry to gain access to courses and online masterclasses, so they can continue to hone their craft while adhering to the public health measures of social distancing and isolation. Furthermore, they have committed to guaranteeing the incomes of freelancers in their SuperSport productions.
