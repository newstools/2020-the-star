In the wake of the coronavirus outbreak in the country, Kenyans are not making it easy to deal with the panic that came with the pandemic that has wiped out more than 6,000 people in the world. Speculation making rounds on social media is enough to prompt one to self-quarantine just out of fear. This is even despite the state's warning against spreading misleading information on the Covid-19 disease in 30 African countries now. The Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization among other experts have released information on how to tell if symptoms of a common cold are just that or something worse. It should be enough to guide us on how to stay safe from the virus. Anyone caught spreading manufactured info - either out of malice or to make money - should be arrested and charged. The government should, however, be more transparent with the cases to minimise the speculation. Nairobi
