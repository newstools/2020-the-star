A Murang’a MCA has threatened to spill the beans on what transpired during the avocado rally chaos attended by Deputy President William Ruto. Nominated MCA Patrick Mutahi asked people to avoid listening to propaganda and that he will narrate what transpired at the right time. “I was admitted last night to Nairobi Hospital. I am recovering well,” he said. The MCA was among those injured during the meeting at Kenyoho Secondary School after Governor Mwangi Wa Iria's supporters exchanged blows with those of MP Alice Wahome. More people were injured during 17 minutes of chaos and have been admitted to hospitals in Murang’a, Thika and Nairobi. “Thanks family and friends for your prayers. I will speak about what happened yesterday at Muranga county. Please avoid rumors from Tangatanga Team,” Mutahi said. The meeting was brought to a standstill as several of Wa Iria's aides were beaten and eventually arrested. A number of supporters were dragged outside the venue. MPs who attended the meeting were MPs Rigathi Gachagua (Mathira), Wahome and Moses Kuria (Gatundu South). “It is my considered view after reflecting on what happened at Kinyoho Secondary School in Kandara that Mwangi wa Iria was not acting alone. He was to create a situation that would have precipitated something very nasty,” Kuria said. They said farmers had the liberty to sell their fruits to their desired buyers without limitation and that they should not be compelled to sell to specific buyers. The county government wants to control the avocado sector through a bill that seeks to regulate the production and marketing of the fruit. The county government intends to form farmers into cooperatives which will then enter into a contractual agreement with buying companies. But the leaders accused Wa Iria of compelling farmers to sell their fruits to a specific buyer.
