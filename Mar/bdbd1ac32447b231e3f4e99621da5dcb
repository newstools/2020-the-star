The company launched its report on 1,000 days of SGR operations at Syokimau on Tuesday. The official said as localisation increases, so does the number of Kenyans in leadership positions. “Two hundred and fifty two Kenyans work in leadership positions throughout the Mombasa-Nairobi-Naivasha route,” he said. According to the company, 1,072 Kenyan employees are capable of independently performing their duties as of February 24, 2020.
