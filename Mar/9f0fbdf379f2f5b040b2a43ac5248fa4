Gem MP Elisha Odhiambo has taken a swipe at his predecessor Jakoyo Midiwo, a day after the former legislator returned to ODM. Jakoyo was among prominent ODM rebels who returned into the Orange fold more than two years since they ditched the party. Odhiambo told Midiwo not to expect to be a ‘priest’ in the Orange party, saying the outfit has since been transformed. “He is like a priest who left the Catholic Church and is now coming back hoping to be a priest. He can only be an offering usher because ODM has now changed rules,” he said on phone on Thursday. The MP said that ODM leaders have reformed the party which no longer accepts vote-rigging and unfair practices during nominations. “Right now, ODM has changed. It is not the ODM Jakoyo left. It is an ODM with like-minded politicians that is gravitating around Raila. It is not a Luo party, it is a national party,” he reckoned. He added, “So, Jakoyo should come pole pole (slowly). I will make him a delegate in Gem. He will never be a priest, he can only come as a sadaka (offertory) collector.” Odhiambo floored Midiwo in ODM polls in 2017 forcing the latter to decamp the party. Midiwo ran as an Independent in the August 8, 2017 election and again lost to Odhiambo. On Wednesday, ODM leader Raila Odinga welcomed Midiwo, former Kasarani MP Elizabeth Ongoro, Reuben Ndolo (Makadara) and Oyugi Magwanga (Kasipul Kabondo), Omondi Mulwan (Alego Usonga) and Omondi Anyanga (Nyatike). Odhiambo, however, supported Raila’s move to welcome back the former MPs saying it will revamp the outfit ahead of the 2022 polls. “So, Jakom (Chairman Raila) is making ODM vibrant for our 2022 stab at the presidency and we fully support what he had done,” he said.
