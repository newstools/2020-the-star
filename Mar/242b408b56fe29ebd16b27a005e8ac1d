 Two Kitui county government officers and two former employees were on Tuesday charged with fraudulent awarding of tenders for Sh7.5 million irrigation projects in 2015. Deputy county secretary Alex Kimanzi and head of procurement Joshua Munyaka and former chief officers Joseph Musyoka (administration) and Gladys Kivoto (trade) were charged before Kitui chief magistrate Stephen Mbungi. They pleaded not guilty to two counts of flouting of procurement procedures and abuse of office. Munyaka was granted a Sh65,000 bail while the court ordered the rest of the accused be released upon paying Sh100,000 bail. They were alternatively granted Sh200,000 bond each. The officials are accused of causing the loss of Sh800,000 of public funds as members of the committee that awarded the tender for the Athi-Kalawa irrigation project. They are accused of overlooking the firm that merited the tender in favour of another. Mbungi directed the accused to return to court on March 18 for a pre-trail mention. The tender was awarded to Sami Construction Company Limited on February 29, 2015. The officials are accused of using their office to improperly confer a benefit to Sami Construction Company Ltd by awarding it a tender it did not merit.  edited by p. obuya
