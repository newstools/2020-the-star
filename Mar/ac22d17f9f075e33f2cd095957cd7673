Announcing the 86-year-old saxophonist's death to his fans on Facebook,Â they said: "A voice rises in the distance. "It is with deep sadness that we announce the loss of Manu Dibango, our Papy Groove, who passed away on 24 March 2020, at 86 years old, because of Covid-19." The family asked for strict privacy for his funeral, but did say they planned to hold a tribute to his memory when it could be organised.
