Kisii boda boda riders have not complied with the government's order to carry one passenger and wear masks. A spot check by the Star established that a number of operators plying Kisii-Kilgoris, Kisii-Keroka and Kisii Oyugis roads were carrying two or three people and without face masks. On Monday, Health CS Mutahi Kagwe directed that all operators and their customers wear helmets, have masks and sanitiser to contain the spread of coronavirus. Kagwe said the move was among new interventions put in place to allow continuity of livelihoods amid the closure of several businesses to reduce crowding. He said Covid-19 has was now spreading through community transmission and not imported as was the case with the first reported infections. "You can imagine how many passengers they interact with, in a single day. We need to save our youth who have invested heavily in this business," the CS said. County police commander Jebel Ngere warned defiant operators of dire consequences. Ngere said all directives issued by the government should not be taken for granted because they are aimed at saving peopleâ€™s lives. He said law enforcers would carry out a serious crackdown on all roads to ensure everyone complies. The government has since unveiled an elaborate team of experts for emergency response to coronavirus which had by Monday infected 50 people and killed one. Consequently, Governor James Ongwae has urged residents to observe all the guidelines to combat the virus. He urged residents not to take the directives for granted, saying that disease is real.
