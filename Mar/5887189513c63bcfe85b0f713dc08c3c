The University of Nairobi on Monday became the third higher learning institution to close in line with coronavirus mitigation measures. Other universities that have closed are Africa Nazarene University and Multimedia University. The closure comes after President Uhuru Kenyatta directed all learning institutions be closed by Friday. Primary and secondary day schools are to suspend operations from Monday. For students in boarding school, their administrators are to ensure they are home by Wednesday. Universities and tertiary institutions are to be closed latest Friday. Uhuru also urged companies to allow employees to work from home and Kenyans to use cashless transactions. The directive was issued after three people tested positive for coronavirus in Kenya. UoN vice chancellor Stephen Kiama said on Monday the university would review its workflow to allow and facilitate staff in non-critical areas to work from home. “The University of Nairobi will partner with the government by availing expertise at its disposal towards containing the spread of Covid-19,” he said in a statement. “I implore all the members of the UoN community to avoid high-risk areas and behaviour to protect each other from contracting Covid-19.” The university said they have fully complied with the presidential directive to suspend learning at all campuses with immediate effect.
