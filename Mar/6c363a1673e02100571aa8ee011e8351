Education officials in Chepalungu, Bomet county, are considering taking legal action against parents who allowed their pupils to go to school despite a government directive suspending learning. Chepalungu subcounty education director Barasa Wafula said, “In the coming days we shall be pursuing them with a view to charging them for disobeying orders from the government.” He stated administrative officers from the area had been asked to help in tracing the parents. “We have activated our teams on the ground and asked them to be more vigilant to ensure no such cases happen within our area again,” he said. Speaking to the Star, the official said by allowing their children back in school, the parents put their lives at great risk at a time the country is trying hard to combat the coronavirus pandemic. Meanwhile, the school’s head Gideon Kilel and a teacher only identified as Mwei who were on Friday arrested over the incident have been released. The two from Sigor Day Primary School were arrested after reports emerged Class Eight pupils had been going to school in open defiance of President Uhuru Kenyatta’s order. Area police boss Nelson Masai said the duo were released on cash bail after recording their statements. “They recorded their statements at Chebunyo police station and we released them on cash bail as investigations into the matter continue,” Masai said. Subcounty education officer Johnstone Mogusu also recorded his statement in connection to the matter. In a well-orchestrated move to look like no learning was going on at the institution, 40 Class Eight pupils were allowed in school in civilian clothing. One teacher was present overseeing learning. Bomet county commissioner Geoffrey Omoding has sent a strong warning that stern action shall be taken against anyone contravening the government’s directive. Edited by Henry Makori
