The government has said it will not deploy any of its doctors to the US. Health CS Mutahi Kagwe on Friday said if there was to be any such plan to deploy doctors, it would be through government to government initiative and not individual doctors. The US government on Thursday through the US Department of State, Consular Affairs made the plea via their website and social media pages, urging medical professionals to seek an appointment with their embassies. "We encourage medical professionals with an approved U.S. non-immigrant or immigrant visa petition (I-129, I-140, or similar) or a certificate of eligibility in an approved exchange visitor programme (DS-2019), particularly those working to treat or mitigate the effects of COVID-19, to review the website of their nearest embassy or consulate for procedures to request a visa appointment,' read part of the plea. The plea further read, "For those foreign medical professionals already in the United States, J-1 Alien Physicians (medical residents) may consult with their programme sponsor, ECFMG, to extend their programmes in the United States.  Generally, a J-1 program for a foreign medical resident can be extended one year at a time for up to seven years". According to the department, the expiration date on a US visa does not determine how long one can be in the United States. But Kagwe said if a request was to come and the country has the ability, it would be a government to government and not individuals. "We will not release any of our doctors and as a matter of fact, we have recalled those on leave to enhance our capacity. This is an international issue and no one  no one is superior or inferior," Kagwe said. According to WHO status update on the disease, the United states of America as of March 26 had a total of 75,226 confirmed cases with 1,095 deaths. Kenya suspended international flights on Wednesday.
