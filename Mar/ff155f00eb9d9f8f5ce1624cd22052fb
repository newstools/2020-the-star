The state suffered a blow after the High Court extended orders against the demolition of residentials in Shauri Moyo and Starehe estates in Nairobi until June 15. A total of 359 houses, some occupied by tenants for more than 20 years, were to be demolished. Justice James Makau said the government should not take any action until a case before him is determined. Union of Civil Servants secretary Nairobi branch Adam Katana told court the government had not given the occupants alternative houses. Residents lawyer Mariaria Nyaboga told the court the notice to evict was to be effected by the national and Nairobi county governments. He further said the majority of occupants are civil servants. Residents say the planned demolition is full of mischief as there are private developers already linked to the acquisition of land. “It is apparent that the ministry and the county government are involved in the premature execution as they have not complied with stakeholders’ resolutions and the Kenya Affordable Housing Programme Development Framework guidelines,” the lawyer said. He said the county government intended to evict families from their houses without adequate notice. Residents say they are government employees, law-abiding citizens and are entitled to be treated well at all times during any process. Starehe and Shauri Moyo estates have been earmarked for development by the government under a private public partnership. “Some of the resolutions that were passed by stakeholders and the implementing agency, the Nairobi county government, were that the residents will be allocated the houses that will be constructed in the empty spaces after meeting the terms and conditions during the allocation of the finished houses and that no resident will be evicted during the development of the houses,” lawyer Nyaboga said. He said in case of eviction, residents ought to be given ample time as per the law. The matter will be heard on June 15. Revised by Henry Makori
