Speaking to the press in his office, Mandera Deputy Governor Mohamed Arai said isolation wards had been prepared in all level four hospitals. The county has accelerated completion of a 47-bed infectious diseases hospital in Mandera East. “Following the outbreak of coronavirus, which has been declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization, we are cognizant of the challenges of our porous borders beside the other risk factors faced by our country as far as Covid-19 transmission is concerned,” he said. Arai said the Health department had set up an emergency operation centre, with hotlines at county and subcounty levels. The number has been shared with the public. The county emergency response coordination committee is working in collaboration with the national government through the office of the county commissioner. “The accident and emergency units at El Wak and Mandera County Referral Hospital (MCRH) will also be immediately operationalised. Personal protective equipment for healthcare workers is being distributed to all subcounty health facilities,” he said. He said surveillance and screening of incoming passengers at various points is being carried out. “The Mandera county government encourages the public to remain calm and avoid rumours that will cause panic. We will overcome all challenges with the will of God. The Ministry of Health will provide timely updates and intervention measures as we go along,” he said.
