Harambee Stars head coach Francis Kimanzi has handed the duo of Baraka Badi and Collins Sichenje their maiden call ups to the national team ahead of the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier match. Kimanzi summoned 16 players who ply their trade in the Kenyan Premier League for the third qualifier match against Comoros on March 25 at the Moi Stadium, Kasarani. The team will travel for the return leg scheduled four days later. Badi, who turns for KCB, has been arguably the most promising right back in the league and will seek to ouster the seasoned Samuel Olwande. Sichenje, on the other hand, has been a revelation in the AFC Leopards midfield despite being his first season in the top flight. Kimanzi who will seek to fill the remaining slots with foreign-based players in the meantime recalled experienced Tusker centre half Eugene Asike. The pair of Asike and Ugandan import Rodgers Aloro has been outstanding for the brewers this season as they boast one of the meanest defence in the league. Other returnees to the team are the Tusker duo of Sammy Meja and Robert Mboya as well as KCB’s Michael Mutinda and Leopard’s hitman Elvis Rupia. The team is set to report to camp on March 9th at the Nyayo National Stadium starting from 9 am. Goalkeepers: Brian Bwire (Kariobangi Sharks), Robert Mboya (Tusker); Defenders: Johnstone Omurwa (Wazito), Collins Shichenje (AFC Leopards), Joash Onyango (Gor Mahia), Eugene Asike (Tusker), Baraka Badi (KCB), Sammy Mejja (Tusker), Samuel Olwande (Kariobangi Sharks), David Owino (Mathare United); Midfielders: Kenneth Muguna (Gor Mahia), Michael Mutinda (KCB), Brian Musa (Wazito), Lawrence Juma (Gor Mahia): Forwards: Elvis Rupia (AFC Leopards), Timothy Otieno (Tusker).
