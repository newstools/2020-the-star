The handshake between President Uhuru Kenyatta and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga has succeeded 100 per cent, MP Ngunjiri Wambugu says. The Nyeri Town lawmaker said there is nowhere in the country where people have a problem with the legitimacy of Uhuru's presidency or his government. "That, as well as uniting Kenyans, are the objectives of the handshake," Wambugu said on Monday. He said the handshake was initiated to settle a country that was on the brink of chaos after divisive elections. Before the handshake, he said, weekly demonstrations and some counties threatened to secede while some people wanted to stop paying taxes and boycotted some products. Some MPs from the National Super Alliance were also boycotting parliamentary proceedings. All these issues were resolved by the handshake, Wambugu said in his office. "After the handshake, there were other developments like the Building Bridges Initiative. This is a process of getting people to speak what is going on in the country and what has happened in the past and what is going to happen in the future," he said. The MP said the fact that people are saying things that others do not like is not important. "The most important thing is that people are speaking from their hearts on what they think about their country, leaders, corruption and elections among others." Wambugu said the results of the BBI process will determine whether the country gets united. "So it's my hope that everybody will participate." He said those complaining about things they do not like in the BBI have an opportunity to do a memorandum and present it to the task force or give their views in BBI rallies going on in the country. "You can't sit and complain about everything yet you have never done anything about it," Wambugu said.  edited by peter obuya
