Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen has declared that the long-awaited Nakuru Building Bridges Initiative rally will be one of its kind. Murkomen said on Tuesday that all governors from the 11 counties will participate fully in the BBI rally without party factions or mini-factions. The senator said that each county will hold its consultations before meeting on March 19 in Eldoret to have a harmonised document for the region. Murkomen will lead his county consultation forum on March 14. "This process has my full endorsement, participation and support," Murkomen said. He added that they have agreed that all the leaders from the counties in the Rift Valley will fully attend the rally. The BBI Rift Valley region chapter has been postponed twice. The first was scheduled to take place on February 8 but was postponed following the death of the late President Daniel Moi. It was then rescheduled for March 7 but Nakuru Goveroner Lee Kinyanjui postponed it to March 21. Announcing the new date, Lee said that the rally will beÂ a culmination of consultative meetings to build consensus on the document and include local agenda. Murkomen's remarks come hours after President Uhuru Kenyatta met with governors drawn from the larger Rift Valley region at State House on Monday. The consultative meeting saw the governors brief the president on the planning of the rally scheduled for March 21. According to Statehouse, the governors assured the President of their full backing of the BBI process and undertook to ensure unity and inclusion of all stakeholders in the run-up to the Nakuru rally. Leaders from the region had earlier on asked the president and his deputy to attend the rally.
