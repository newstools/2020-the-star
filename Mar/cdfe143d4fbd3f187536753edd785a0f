Harambee Starlets have finally named the final squad of 21 players for the upcoming Turkish Women's Cup scheduled for March 2-11. Four players have been dropped from the initial 25-team provisional squad named by coach David Ouma two weeks ago. In the goalkeeping department, Thika Queens' Phiona Ariko has been axed as coach Ouma opted for Judith Osimbo who has been deputising departed Annette Kundu who now plies her trade in Cyprus with Lakatamia FC. Monica Odato of Wadadia who is still waiting to make her debut is in the mix and so is Zetech Sparks' Stella Ahono. Thika Queens'  duo of Nelly Sawe and Lydia Akoth are among the seven defenders in the team. Others are Lucy Akoth (Mathare United), Oserian's Dorcas Shikobe, Vivian Nasaka (Vihiga Queens) and  Dorcas Shiveka (Eldoret Falcons) and Foscah Nashivanda. Ouma opted for experience in midfield with the trio of Jentrix Shikangwa, Janet Bundi and Mercy Airo looking to cement their places in the starting line up. The three were in the starting line up during the Olympic Qualifiers and Cecafa Challenge cup. Also included are Topista Situma, Rachael Muema, Slyvia Makungu and Sheril Angachi. Tricky forward Mwanahalima Adams highlights the attack alongside Purity Anyetu, Jane Njeri and Stella Anyango. The team was expected to leave last evening for Cyprus.
