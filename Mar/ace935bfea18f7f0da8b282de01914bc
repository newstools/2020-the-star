Police are looking for a man who allegedly killed his wife while their daughter watched. Chief Michael Munyeke said Maithya Waema, 40, struck his wife, 33, with a panga on the neck on Thursday night after a quarrel at their Kilungu home, Makueni county. Their daughter, who is in Form 2, was slightly injured as she attempted to separate the two. The girl followed the two after her mother took off towards the shamba. Her father was in hot pursuit and when he caught up with his wife, he cut her with the panga. “On learning that her mother had died, the girl called neighbours and told them what had happened. The neighbours called me and I informed the police,” Munyeke said. Makueni county police commander Justus Kitetu said preliminary investigations showed they may have quarrelled after infidelity allegations. “The search for the suspect is going on,” Kitetu said. The body was taken to Kilungu Subcounty Hospital mortuary. Edited by Josephine M. Mayuya
