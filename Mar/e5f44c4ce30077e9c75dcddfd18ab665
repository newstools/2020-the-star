Students will from next week be taught extensively through lessons delivered digitally and via broadcast, Education CS George Magoha has said. This follows the confirmation of COVID-19 in Kenya, which led Magoha to on Sunday announce that schools would remain shut until the virus is contained. "Beginning Monday 23rd March, 2020, the Ministry will enhance curriculum delivery through four different platforms - Radio , TV, YouTube and Kenya Education Cloud," Magoha said in a statement on Wednesday. The CS said the ministry has partnered with KBC to provide radio programmes from Monday to Friday through Radio Taifa and English Service. "Radio Taifa lessons will run from 10 am to 11am. The English Service lessons will run from 9:15 am to 12 o'clock and from 2 pm to 4pm". The ministry will also transmit lessons on KICD owned Edu-Channel. Also, all programme content broadcasts will be available on Edu Tv Channel, which will be accessed on YouTube. Learners can also obtain digital content of all KICD approved materials from the Kenya Education Cloud. The CS has urged parents and guardians to ensure that their children are at home in line with the guidelines issued by President Uhuru Kenyatta. The government had earlier asked schools to close institutions. Boarding schools had been asked to release students by Wednesday, March 18.
