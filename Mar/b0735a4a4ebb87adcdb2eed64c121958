AFC Leopards captain Robinson Kamura is taking advantage of the unexpected break from the club’s 2020 football campaign to bond with family amd friends. The break has been necessitated by the coronavirus threat that has left many sporting activities around the globe in a limbo. Kamura revealed that since the government directive that limited public gathering forced the football authorities to halt the season, he has had a chance to bond effectively with his family. “I spend most of my time indoors,” revealed the free-kick specialist. “Following the government’s directive that seen the season halted, I am staying home safe and bonding more with my family,” Kamura added. The defender further pointed out that at this moment, football is far from his mind as his concern is the wellbeing of friends and family. “Football is part of my life but right now, I would advise guys to just stay home and avoid unnecessary movements that can make this deadly virus spread,” he advised. Under the guidance of his role model and former Leopards player Anthony Kimani, Ingwe have blossomed, putting together a string of results that have cemented their place in the top half of the Kenyan Premier League table where they sit in position six with 40 points—24 adrift of leaders and traditional rivals Gor Mahia. “We have improved tremendously in the last few months as a team. The coach has been of great encouragement giving us the confidence to perform to the best of our abilities in each game without unnecessary pressure,” added the former Mathare United centre back. Finishing the season on a high, should it resume, is not beyond Leopards as they are safely through to the last 8 of the Betway FKF Super Cup.
