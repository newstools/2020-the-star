Police officers are worried they might be exposed to coronavirus following orders to hold suspects in the cells and not in prisons. Suspects with serious offences will be taken to court but police have been asked to deal with small offenders at their stations. New suspects are remanded at police stations to avoid the risk of spreading the disease to prisons. This has been witnessed in the courts since Monday after Chief Justice David Maraga issued the directive. Inspector General of Police Hillary Mutyambai is yet to speak on the matter. “We only have soap and sanitisers at our station. We don’t have equipment to take the temperature of suspects and we do not have time to examine the suspects during the time of arrest. It is very dangerous but we shall overcome,” an officer told the Star at a Nairobi court yesterday. Victor Kioko and Mutisya Ngui are remanded at Huruma police station instead of Nairobi area remand prison. The two are accused of robbing Muthini Wambua of a wallet and Sh3, 500 in Huruma on Sunday. In a Makadara court, a woman suspected to have killed her ex-husband was on Monday  ordered to be detained at a police station. Mary Wanjiku Nduati is detained at Pangani police station after she allegedly stabbed Kelvin Maina twice on the chest killing him. In Milimani court on Wednesday, a man accused of forgery was ordered to be remanded at Central police station because prisons are not admitting new inmates due to the coronavirus outbreak. Alvin Okulo Owino had absconded a court session in a forgery case. Edited by Henry Makori
