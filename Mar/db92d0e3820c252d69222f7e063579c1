The Kitui county assembly Wednesday denied journalists entry into the chambers as a precaution against the spread of coronavirus. The press had been invited by the communication office to cover a special session on a Sh11.3 billion supplementary budget and the county fiscal strategy paper at 12.30pm. But private security and Administration Police officers said they had been ordered to deny journalists and members of the public entry. Communication boss Mutetei Mutisya told journalists that the directive was issued by assembly speaker George Ndotto to control coronavirus spread. Shortly after the journalists left, Mutetei circulated a message that the public has been barred from accessing the plenary. “This includes the members of the press as directed by the speaker of the assembly this morning,” he said. Mutetei promised to share photos, audios and press releases on the proceedings of the plenary with journalists. In the supplementary budget, Governor Charity Ngilu’s administration has sought to plug a Sh100 million hole in the Health department. Hospitals are facing a shortage of drugs, consumables, patients’ food and other provisions. The assembly suspended sessions six days ago in the wake of the coronavirus threat. (edited by o. owino)
