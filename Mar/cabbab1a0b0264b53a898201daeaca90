The 21-year-old patient who died on Sunday at Kangundo Hospital did not pass away as a result of the coronavirus, Kenya Medical Research Institute results have shown. Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua confirmed the results revealing that the patient had a bacterial infection. The patient had symptoms relating to that of coronavirus prompting the hospital to seek clarification from KEMRI. Mutua has said that people should not only think about coronavirus once they lose their loved ones at this time. "It is important to remember that people are also sick from many many diseases and we will, as usual, still lose our friends and family from other illnesses," Mutua said. He said his county health workers team is working hard to treat Machakos residents even with the extra stress of coronavirus scares. "I am working on a system to provide them with the highest quality working environments and to compensate them for their work," Mutua added. Health CS Mutahi Kagwe has warned governors on commenting or giving information on the Covid-19 cases in their counties. Kagwe said the government has only one communication channel to convey information to the public. He said having one central communication centre will enable the government to communicate without misinformation and confusion to the public. This was after Kakamega governor Wycliffe Oparanya had addressed the media on the status of one patient who hailed from his county.
