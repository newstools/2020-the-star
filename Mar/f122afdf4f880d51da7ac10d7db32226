Chief Justice David Maraga has emphasised the need to train heads of stations on how to enhance financial accountability. Speaking in Nakuru when he opened a six-day Head of Stations forum, the CJ said the annual event brings together judicial officers from various stations to discuss their welfare and issues affecting them. Maraga said the station heads would be trained on the need to be diligent and accountable on revenue collected and expenditure. "There is need to ensure that the station managers spend their budgets properly and for the intended purposes," Maraga said. Among the topics to be handled during the 7th Head of Stations Forum held at Sarova Woodlands Hotel, are empowering Judicial officers to enhance financial accountability, constitutional and governance framework for auditing, budget and accountability and sensitization on the role of integrity assurance officers among many others. Chief Registrar of Judiciary Anne Amadi said the head of stations is the Judiciary's manager who needs training as they transform. "The heads of station do not have the financial training but they supervise financial and accounting staff and they are being empowered on loopholes to look for in case of a financial crisis," she said. Amadi said the Judiciary was still negotiating with the relevant departments regarding the budget cuts and was optimistic the situation will change. She said the Judiciary was engaging Parliament and the Executive on the issue. "We are optimistic that the situation will change,‚Äù Amadi said.
