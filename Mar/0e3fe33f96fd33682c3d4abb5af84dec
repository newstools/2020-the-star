Naivas Supermarket on Saturday announced its partnership with technology logistics firm Glovo to reduce the price of home deliveries for shoppers to encourage staying home. This will be for online purchases valued at Sh1,000 and above. The move is in compliance with the government directive to limit public gatherings and crowding in stores as part of measures to curb the spread of the coronavirus, the chain store said in a statement to the media. The spaces in the store's outlets will be prioritised for the elderly and expectant shoppers, it said. In this arrangement, shoppers are encouraged to shop online and have their items delivered by Glovo, hence reduce the need for in-store visits. “We are exploring possible measures with our partners and suppliers to increase the traffic to the Naivas e-commerce platform in order to shift typical shopper behavior which is culturally ingrained to visit the stores in person," Naivas chief commercial officer Willy Kimani said. The chain also wants in-store shoppers to change their shopping timings, to prefer "off-peak and visit the 24-hour outlets in order to reduce crowding especially during evening hours, thus limiting opportunities for the virus’s spread." The 24-hour stores are located at Development House, Moi Avenue, Greenhouse and Westlands in Nairobi. Kimani said Kenyans have been slowly embracing online shopping but boted Covid-19 pandemic is an opportunity for the culture to be robustly entrenched, especially among urban residents. He noted that Naivas expects that Kenyans will embrace online shopping as part of measures to reduce crowding. Shoppers visiting the stores will be required to follow the six-feet rule of thumb; ensuring each person is at least six feet away from the closest fellow shopper at all times. Naivas joins Tuskys supermarket that yesterday rolled out home delivery in partnership with technology delivery firm Sendy.
