Heavy rains experienced in some parts of the country left a trail of havoc. In Nairobi, there was heavy traffic on Thika Superhighway stretching from Homeland to Kenyatta University after a downpour brought down a billboard on Thursday night. In Kisumu, a section of the road near Ayweyo trading centre, about four kilometres from Ahero township, was submerged in floodwaters after River Nyalbiego burst its banks. The Kenya National Highway Authority sent an alert on Friday to all motorists driving on the Kisii–Ahero. It warned them of traffic interruptions. "Consequently, traffic flow on the road section has temporarily been interrupted and motorists can use the Ahero–Awasi–Katito road, Kapsoit–Sondu road or Kericho–Kisii road. Kenha urges all motorists to be on high alert, and not to attempt to cross any bridge or section of the road that is overtopped by water," Kenha said in a statement. Meanwhile, the weatherman said rainfall will continue in most parts of the country. The five-day forecast released on Thursday said there will be showers and thunderstorms over several places in Nyeri, Murang'a, Kirinyaga, Embu, Meru, Kiambu, Tharaka Nithi, Laikipia, Nyandarua and Nairobi on Friday night. Kakamega, Vihiga, Busia, Bungoma, Kisumu, Kisii, Siaya, Homa Bay, Kericho, Nandi, Bomet, Nakuru, West Pokot, Elgeyo Marakwet, Baringo, Uasin Gishu, Trans Nzoia and Narok will also experience showers and thunderstorms over several places. “Expect showers and thunderstorms over a few places tonight in Turkana and Samburu counties. Marsabit, Garissa, Mandera, Wajir, Isiolo, Machakos, Makueni, Kitui, Taita Taveta and Kajiado counties will also experience rains tonight. Kwale, Mombasa, Kilifi, Lamu and Tana River counties will have mainly partly cloudy conditions at night with few places expected to receive showers," said Stella Aura, the director of the Kenya Meteorological department.
