The Nyeri government has set aside an isolation facility at Mt Kenya Hospital managed by three medics who served in Liberia during the Ebola crisis. Governor Mutahi Kahiga said his government was preparing for possible spread of coronavirus to the county. The isolation facility has a bed capacity of 21. The government settled on Mt Kenya hospital because it has compartments instead of open wards. “The county government has prioritised procurement of hand sanitising materials and personal protective equipment to be supplied for use within the hospital,” he said. The governor briefed the media on Monday on the precautions his government was taking after the confirmation of three coronavirus cases in the country. Hand sanitisers and cleaning agents will also be supplied to markets, factories and tea collection centres. Kahiga said the county had set aside Sh15 million for the purpose. The government has also given the public emergency phone numbers which they can call to report suspected cases of the Covid-19. A standby ambulance has also been provided to transport patients to the quarantine facility. The government, Kahiga said, had dispatched information officers and public health teams to sensitise the public on the virus. Recorded information will be announced through loudspeakers mounted on vehicles for the next one week. The governor ordered that all entertainment joints such as bars provide sanitisers and be closed by 10pm to limit personal contact. He said public health officials will be on the ground to ensure this is adhered to. “All county government seminars and meetings not of an urgent nature are suspended with immediate effect for 30 days. The respective department heads are required to liaise with the county secretary’s office on staff who will be authorised to work from home,” he said. Public appointments where residents see the governor every Tuesday have also been discontinued until further notice. Edited by Henry Makori
