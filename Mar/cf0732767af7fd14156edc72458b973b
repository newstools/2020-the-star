President Uhuru Kenyatta arrived at Harambee House with his car number plate upside down. He arrived at the venue to give a press statement on Coronavirus after the country recorded its first incident on March 13, 2020. The car has no presidential standard and Kenyan flag and he has no Aide-de-Camp (ADC). Kenya confirmed its first coronavirus case on March 13, 2020, Health CS Mutahi Kagwe said. "....the country has confirmed the first case of coronavirus from a patient who arrived in Kenya," he said. The patient was a Kenyan citizen who returned on March 5 from the US via London, UK. Kagwe said the patient is stable, and she will not be released until she tests negative. The CS has urged Kenyans to remain calm as the government has put in place enough measures to prevent the virus from spreading.
