Rivalry has emerged between Bomet Governor Hillary Barchok and Chama Cha Mashinai leader Isaac Rutto regarding the Building Bridges Initiative meeting on Saturday in Nakuru. The main bone of contention is who will organise it. Their differences came out on Tuesday during a BBI stakeholders’ consultative discussion organised by Barchok. Rutto skipped the meeting and instead held a parallel one at Bomet Green Stadium, a few meters away from the BBI meeting venue. He addressed a handful of supporters at the stadium and later went around Bomet town announcing the planned meeting. Rutto, who was in the company of CCM party officials and four ward representatives, urged residents to turn up in large numbers for the ‘county’ meeting in Nakuru. He said there will be ward meetings across the county for residents to will submit their views. Rutto said Bomet and Kericho share similar views on land issues which should be discussed before presentation at the Nakuru rally. The CCM party leader downplayed Barchok's meeting, calling it "a gathering of few individuals". "I couldn't attend such a meeting because I wasn't invited," he said. The Saturday meeting, he added, will be attended by all leaders from the county. "I will not allow any parallel meetings about BBI to take place in Bomet county. Let them take their meetings elsewhere, "Bartok said. He further warned leaders against politicising BBI rallies, stating that the Nakuru one will be led by governors. Paul Chepkwony of Jubilee is the governor of Kercho but he wasn't mentioned. (Edited by F. Obonyo)
