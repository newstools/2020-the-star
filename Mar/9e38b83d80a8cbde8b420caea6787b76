  Victoria Musenya, popularly known as Little Miss Charity 2019-2020, has donated 30-litre water tanks and hand sanitisers to the paediatric ward of Mwingi Level IV Hospital. She has also donated similar items for use in crowded places like bus stops and churches in the sub-county as her contribution to the fight against Covid-19. The donations were made through ATG Church. Mwingi Level IV Hospital infection control coordinator Jane Munyua thanked Little Miss Charity for the donation and her promotion of handwashing, which is the main guard against the spread of coronavirus. Little Miss Charity 2019-2020 walked around before presenting the donations showing people how to wash hands properly. Taxi drivers association official Kamwatu Malonza commended the church for mobilising people to wash hands regularly. “We now feel fit to fight Covid-19. We will make sure that all passengers wash hands before boarding vehicles,” Kamwatu said. Musenya said she felt that God had chosen her to do charity among the needy and show people the need to help one another. Her mother, Sarah Mutavanya, said Victoria had demonstrated the passion for hand washing and family and friends decided to support her. Sarah prayed that God will help humankind to overcome the challenges of the moment. The Rev Chrispus Mutavanya said that it was not the first time his daughter was mobilising people to wash hands. She has been doing it for the past two and a half years. “Following Covid -19 outbreak, Miss Charity decided to donate water tanks and sanitisers to the most crowded areas like bus stations so that people can prevent themselves,” Chrispus said.
