Our phones have become fundamental to our daily lives. It is no surprise really, as we use them for everything from making calls and keeping in touch with our loved ones, to paying bills, organizing your day, reading the news and even controlling our appliances. In fact for some, mobile phones are essential to their work and home lives. However, while they can be useful, they can often end up costing a lot – particularly when it comes to data and airtime. While paying as you use can be convenient, you often don’t get the best value for your money. Previously getting a post-paid line was a tedious and painstaking experience that put a lot of people off. It seems things are finally changing. Safaricom has announced that it is now easier and better value to switch to their post-pay tariffs. Particularly, if you use your phone a lot. Previously this required a trip to a Safaricom store armed with your ID, a deposit and the amount of money you wanted to spend, today all you need is your mobile phone. Simply dial *544# and choose “activate post pay” to get started and you can get yourself some amazing bundles. For only 1,000 Ksh you get 5GB, 400 minutes of talk time and unlimited SMSs. That is a huge improvement on the older deal, which only gave you 100sms and 100mbs of data for the same price. So if you are ready for the comfort and convenience of the new post-pay Safaricom tarrif make sure you sign up now.
