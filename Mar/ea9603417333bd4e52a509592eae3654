Talent is key to the growth of any individual. Talent has taken shape nowadays and has geared a lot of people in their professional lives. People are earning from talent which is helping reduce the numbers of unemployed people in the country. There exist many talent industries in our Kenya including the vast music industry, comedy and sports industry among many others that do not require academic papers. I would like to commend on several organisations and companies for making serious attempts in searching and building young talents. This involves football leagues, music and drama societies like the Coke Studio and Tusker Project Fame. There are also leaders who have engaged the youth in competitions. Kenya has very few schools and academies of talent. The Kenya School of Music and the Football Academy are too far from the reach of many young talented pupils in the country. There is a need to start at least one talent academy in every county. This will ensure that all talented pupils from primary to secondary levels are absorbed in these academies – especially with the help of the Competency-Based Curriculum –  for potential growth in our talent industry. Introduction of more talent schools will not only reduce the monotony of academics but also the high rate of unemployment. Unemployment has been brought by the high dependence on white-collar jobs by almost every youth graduating from school. There are fewer jobs each and every year since the number of graduates is on the rise and is disproportionate to the available opportunities in the employment market. Developing more talent academies will mean the youth and those leaving school will be self-reliant. There is a good number of learned individuals who have employed themselves using their talents. They include athletes, musicians,  comedians, designers,  graphical artists, DJs and many others.  Self-employment through talent is an everlasting indulgence that encourages the growth of the economy too.
