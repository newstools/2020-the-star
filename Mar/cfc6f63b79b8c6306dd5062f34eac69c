MPs have protested the nomination of Prof Mohamed Hussein Abdille as the Chief Executive Officer of the National Government Constituency Development Fund- CDF. House Speaker Justin Muturi had to cut short his statement to calm lawmakers who were chanting ‘Mbuno! Mbuno!’ bringing house business to a standstill. Yusuf Mbuno has been acting NG-CDF CEO for eight years after an attempt to get a substantive CEO flopped before the House. “I wish to convey a Message received from the Cabinet Secretary for National Treasury regarding recruitment of a Chief Executive Officer of the National Government Constituencies Development Fund (NG-CDF) Board,” Muturi said. “In the Message, the Cabinet Secretary is asking the House to approve the appointment of Prof. Mohamed Hussein Abdille to the position of Chief Executive Officer of the National Government Constituencies Development Fund (NG-CDF) Board.” It is at this point that chants of Mbuno ! Mbuno!  greeted the speaker forcing him to temporarily halt his statement to bring the house to order. Section 20(1) of the NG-CDF Act, provides that a Chief Executive Officer of the Board be recruited by the Board through a competitive process and recommendations made to the Treasury CS for appointment after approval of the National Assembly. Muturi referred the matter to the National Assembly Select Committee on the National Government Constituencies Development Fund to approve or reject the nominee within 14 days and report to the House.
