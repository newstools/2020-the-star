Police in Kisii have stepped up the hunt for a man who defiled a five-month-old baby in Tambachi, Marani, on Wednesday. According to statements filed with the officers, her mother had taken a walk to her farm as she slept. When she returned, she found the baby bleeding from her private parts and realised a stranger had sneaked into her house. She said the culprit capitalised on the absence of family members to commit the crime. "Nobody was there and the baby was in bed. This suspect may have watched my steps and knew I had gone out before he stealthily walked in to defile my baby in a manner so brutal," the mother said. Marani assistant county commissioner Fred Sungu said they hope to bring the man to book soon. "We are following crucial leads and hope to nab him as soon as possible." The incident has elicited emotional reactions, with activists and residents condemning the surge in defilement in the region. Activists Esnas Nyaramba and Joel Machuka called for quick investigations and arrest. They said the subcounty is quickly turning into a crime den due to proliferation of drugs. They urged the authorities to intensify campaigns against crime. "Unless those who commit these sins are prosecuted, we will still be witnessing a vicious circle of rape and defilement cases in the region," Nyaramba said.
