Mandera MCAs have asked the government to protect residents from the ongoing war in Somalia. Jubaland forces on Monday clashed with Somalia troops on the Kenya-Somalia border, leaving a trail of destruction and injuries on Kenyan soil. County assembly minority leader Jimale Abdiin in a statement on Wednesday said the presence of Jubaland Defense Minister Abdirashid Janan in Kenya is causing nightmares for residents. The fugitive minister was housed in a Mandera hotel and after the management complained, they relocated to rental houses near Mandera, where they have been living until they were flushed out by the federal government's army. The MCAs said because of the war, business has come to a standstill. Operations in schools, banks, hospitals, transport and communication have also been hurt. Schools along the common border with Somalia remain closed for the third day following Monday's clash. Several houses were destroyed. A trail of destruction, including spent bullet cartridges and a military vehicle, is evident near the Somalia border. "It is estimated that nearly 20,000 residents have deserted their homes to seek refuge in interior places within Mandera," Jimale said. They asked the state to flush out the forces who are believed to have camped in Kenya. Rhamu MCA Kula Abdi said they will lead residents in flushing out the Jubaland forces and the fugitive minister. Mandera security agents have reaffirmed they are in control and have sealed off the common border to prevent spillover into the country. Mandera county commissioner Â Onesmus Kyatha on Tuesday told the press the government will not relent in providing security to residents. He, however, urged residents not to worry as Kenya is not at war with any country. "What we are doing is protecting our borders and making sure there is no spillover into Mandera," Kyatha said. "We are also keen to thwart any al Shabaab attack in case they take advantage of the situation to attack our people."
