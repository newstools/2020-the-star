Reggae and the undying spirit of Bob Marley came alive at the August Memorial Park Nairobi.Â  Gravitti Band hosted various artistes from different genres in the music industry to pay tribute to the great artiste. The likes of Silayio, Sage, Captain Charisma and Ammi the Veggieman all wowed fans with a song each from the catalogue created by Bob Marley in his career. The proceeds from the gig, which were strictly foodstuffs and things needed by the less fortunate, will go to a children's home sponsored by the August Memorial Park. Gravitti intends to host the gig every last Saturday of the coming months.
