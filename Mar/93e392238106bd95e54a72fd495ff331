Five Kenyans were killed on Thursday evening by gunmen believed to be from Ethiopia in Sessi location, Moyale subcounty, Marsabit county. Residents claim the killers were Ethiopian soldiers manning the border. Among those killed were a husband and a wife. They were killed at 9.30pm in their house. Minutes later, two of their neighbours – two women – were attacked and killed by the same gunmen. Earlier in the day, an elderly man had been killed at the Moyale Airstrip. He was heading home at 4.30pm when he was attacked. On Friday, tensions ran high. Many residents fled for fear of further attacks. Deputy county commissioner Patrick Mumali on Friday said he has engaged the Ethiopian government to resolve the matter amicably. Marsabit leaders have condemned the killings. Marsabit Governor Mohamud Ali and Senator Godana Hargura said they will continue engaging with other leaders to end unnecessary killings of innocent Kenyans.
