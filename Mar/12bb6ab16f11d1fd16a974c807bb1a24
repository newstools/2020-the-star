The Kenya Union of Post Primary Education Teachers (KUPPET) wants headteachers to run co-curricular activities. KUPPET Kisii branch secretary Omari Otungu said since the Ministry of Education started running the schools co-curricular activities, they have been subjected to various challenges. “The ministry should cede the running of co-curricular activities to the Kenya Secondary Schools Head Teachers Association (KESSHA). When KESSHA was running the games, there ere little hurdles” said Otungu. He said referees and officials who conducted the Kenya Secondary Schools Sports Association Term One games at sub-county and county level are yet to be paid. According to officials, the money is yet to be disbursed to the respective county education offices. "All the counties in Nyanza are yet to pay teachers and officials who officiated the games," he said. During the recent Kisii County Term One games, KUPPET donated tracksuits to all coaches whose teams won titles. Teachers, who sought anonymity backed KUPPET proposal. “Officials borrowed money from KESSHA kitty to conduct sub-county and county games. These things were unheard of when KESSHA was handling games,” said one of the teachers. Even before the closure of schools a week ago, Nyanza Regional education director, Limo Chepkawai had already postponed the regional Term One games due to lack of funds.
