Sixteen NGOs have called on the government to stop charging water for people living in urban areas to ensure high hygiene standards in the face of the coronavirus pandemic. In an open letter to Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe, the organisations argue that with the worsening hard economic situation in the country, putting a price on water, especially in the urban areas will undermine regular hand washing to curb the spread of the virus. The lobby groups include Amnesty International, Action Aid and Social Justice Centers Working group, among others "All public water service providers and KPLC [should] announce a moratorium on all electricity and water charges for all people living in urban settlements for the duration of the [coronavirus] crisis," the groups wrote in the joint letter. Besides, they want the Ministry of Water to work with the community-based organisations to regulate the prices of water charged by private vendors at the grassroots level. The groups argue that people living in slum areas live at an enhanced risk of contracting the highly infectious disease owing to the high population density and water scarcity that compromise hygiene standards. "People in informal settlements are particularly at risk of viral respiratory infections due to their population density, open-air markets and use of public transport," they said. They further noted that "immediate access to clean and safe water for handwashing is a precondition for keeping people safe and preventing the spread of Covid-19." The lobbies also want the newly installed Nairobi Metropolitan Services board to vacate the ban on harvesting rainwater in the city "to allow communities to legally conserve and use rainfall to wash their hands."
