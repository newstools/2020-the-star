A coronavirus isolation centre has been set up at Malela dispensary in Ndhiwa constituency, Homa Bay county. Governor Cyprian Awiti and Deputy Governor Hamilton Orata said the county government is working with county commissioner David Kipkemei's office to get the 16-bed centre ready. Addressing journalists on Friday after a meeting with leaders, Awiti said they had also set up special wards at the county referral hospital and all subcounty hospitals. The county chief said anyone exhibiting coronavirus symptoms should call the hotline number 0725-902-835. Symptoms include a runny nose, sore throat, cough, fever, chest pains/pressure in the chest, vomiting, diarrhoea, headaches, difficulty breathing/shortness of breath, confusion, aches and pains and fatigue. It takes up to 14 days for the symptoms to appear. Awiti said they are monitoring Lake Victoria islands. “The special wards in subcounty hospitals will serve as temporary examination centres for suspected cases of coronavirus before they are taken to Malela,” Awiti said. The governor urged residents to maintain personal hygiene to help prevent the spread of the virus. “Let our people stop careless [handshakes], which may lead to spread of the virus,” Awiti said. He said all offices in the county will have public hand-washing facilities. Earlier, Kipkemei said doctors and nurses had been trained to take care of coronavirus patients. “We are ready to respond to any suspected case of coronavirus,” he said. Edited by Josephine M. Mayuya
