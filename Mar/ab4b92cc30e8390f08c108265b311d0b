Jonnie Walker recently launched two new alcohol brands, 'Song of Fire' and 'Song of Ice'. The event was held at Redhouse in 14 Riverside. The two whiskey offerings feature augmented reality (AR) technology, showing either a direwolf or a fire-breathing dragon to boost engagement with consumers. The main guests of the event were social media influencers. They included Sean Andrew, Stephu Mulinge, Eunice Pendo and Manasseh Nyaga.
