The owner of the matatu that killed an NTV journalist Raphael Nzioka earlier this month has been charged. Stephen Kirumba Njoroge appeared on Monday before Magistrate Martha Nanzushi during a court session outside the Milimani Law Courts and denied three counts of not adhering to several NTSA rules. It is alleged that on March 7 this year at the Kenyatta Avenue and Kimathi Street junction, being the owner of the motor vehicle KAR 516X, he allowed the Nissan Matatu to be driven on a public road without an insurance certificate this causing the death of Raphael Nzioki Mutuku who was crossing the road. He was also charged with permitting his matatu to operate with some parts of the vehicle not meeting the required standards. Some seat belts were missing and the windscreen was broken. He is also accused of failing to keep records of his driver who ran away after the accident and is yet to be apprehended. Njoroge did not keep records of his driver's name, address and driving license as required by law. He was released on a Sh300,000 bond or an alternative cash bail of Sh 100,000. The case will be mentioned on April 30.
