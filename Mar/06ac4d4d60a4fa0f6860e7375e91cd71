Thika Water and Sewerage Company has erected 15 water points in the industrial town to enhance sanitation in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak.  The firm, in collaboration with its major stakeholders like Bidco Africa, will provide soap at all points used by residents, matatu operators, commuters and traders, managing director Moses Kinya said on Monday. Kinya, who spoke at the company premises, said they have resolved to assist in curbing the spread of Covid-19. “We’ve already put in place proper measures to ensure our staff and clients apply the necessary precautions to prevent themselves from contracting and spreading the virus. We’ve extended the same to our customers, stakeholders and the general public by ensuring that the town has ample water,” he said. The MD added, “We have also ensured we minimise crowding at the premises. To that effect, we have sent home over 50 interns.” The company has installed two more pumps and repaired two others to increase water supply and ensure the region gets an all-time flow of clean water, the MD said. “We had embarked on a rationing programme after the breakdown of our two pumps but they have been fixed and are working. I assure residents that they will have undisrupted water supply in their homes as sanitation is paramount to tackling the spread of the virus." Thika District Business Association chairman Alfred Wanyoike welcomed the move. “It was long overdue but we appreciate the gesture by the company because it will not only ensure our people are hygienic and safe from contracting diseases but it’ll also make our town clean,” he said. Traders told the Star they appreciated the provision of the essential commodity acknowledging that even the vulnerable – including street children – will easily access it. Edited by R.Wamochie
