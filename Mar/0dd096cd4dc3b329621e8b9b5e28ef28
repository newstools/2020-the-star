As a way of keeping fit during the ongoing suspension of the sporting activities in the country, Sofapaka and Nigerian forward Promise Chinonso is borrowing the latest training skills from the internet. The government opted to temporarily call off all sporting and public gatherings last week in the wake of the spread of coronavirus, leaving sportsmen to look for alternative means to keep fit. Chinonso, a January acquisition from Lagos Atletico, revealed that he had turned to the internet to acquaint himself with the latest training methods embraced by international stars who have also been affected by the pandemic. The burly striker, who shot to fame after netting a brace in their 3-1 win over defending champions Gor Mahia last month, said he had learned how to train at home. " I use stretchers and jog in the streets thanks to short videos posted by my favourite players especially Portugal and Juventus ace Cristiano Ronaldo," he added. He said he had taken the initiative to jog in the streets of Buruburu after stretching in the house and was full of hope that by the time the dust settles, he will be ready to bang goals. He, however, said he had suspended going to the gym on advice from the club. "I am watching how the international players are doing through the internet and replicating the same in the house. I have been watching several clips posted by my idols and I am finding it interesting and helpful. I jog in the streets of Buruburu and train in the house just to keep fit," he revealed. Meanwhile, Kariobangi Sharks and Harambee Stars right-back Daniel Sakari says his form will not dip despite training at home. "I am training at home at the moment in line with the guidelines given by the club. I do some gym work in the morning albeit carefully without coming into contact with anyone. I am also running in the streets to ensure that I remain active," he said.
