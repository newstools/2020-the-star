The annual Zuri Awards went down on Friday at the Villa Rosa Kempinski, in an event that was attended by corporates and Gender CAS Rachel Shebesh. The awards will now be mainstreamed to be part of the government’s rewards scheme to honour exemplary women who have impacted the society. Shebesh hailed the establishment of awards and recognition systems for individuals and institutions that have attained high gender equality standards and best practices. “As the ministry responsible for Public Service and Gender Affairs, we operate under the maxim 'leave no one behind' and support the awards for very practical reasons,” she said. This year’s theme was: “An Equal World Is an Enabled World”.
