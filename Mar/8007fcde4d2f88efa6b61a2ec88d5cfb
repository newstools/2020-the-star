Defending champions Bandari have been warned against underrating three-time holders Sofapaka when the two sides clash in a Betway Shield Cup Round of 16 encounter at the Mbaraki Stadium on Saturday. Bandari, who saw off Kariobangi Sharks 3-1 during last year's final, want to use the Shield as a gateway back to continental football. However, the porters' coach Twahir Muhiddin wants his charges to take Sofapaka with the seriousness they deserve if they are to achieve their ambitions. "We know Sofapaka are a big team who are also hungry for success. We watched them beat Gor Mahia recently and we know they can cause upsets. We are eager to return to continental football and winning this tournament is the best way we can do this," said the former Harambee Stars head coach. And despite numerous from the visiting side over the timing of the encounter, Muhiddin insisted the match will kick off at 2 pm. Sofapaka have expressed their reservations on playing at 2 pm due to the humidity at the coastal city at that time of the day. "The venue is always available at 2 pm and we will have to play at that time. Sofapaka should not complain that the heat will affect them. The effects cut across and they should prepare to play at that time," said Muhiddin.
