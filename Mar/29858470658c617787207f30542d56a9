Kenya Cup champions KCB will be without international Oliver Mangeni for the remainder of the season. The towering second-row fractured his wrist during their match against Homeboyz a fortnight ago and will miss the bankers Kenya Cup playoff semi-final (against the winner of a Homeboyz/Oilers clash) and the Enterprise Cup semi against Impala. However, team manager Phillip Wamae said the team is in good spirits ahead of the business end of the season after a one-week training camp. "The training camp has been vital as it helped us asses our strengths, weaknesses and therefore identify areas we need to improve on ahead of the playoffs,” said Wamae. Both KCB and KCB II players are attending the training camp. KCB II, the Eric Shirley Shield champions face either Homeboyz or Impala II in the semifinals. For the second year in a row, KCB finished second behind Kabras in regular season with 71 points, three behind the millers. Kenya Sevens players, led by skipper Andrew Amonde, Vincent Onyala and Jacob Ojee joined the training camp yesterday after returning from the Vancouver Sevens. The camp is being conducted by Western Province coaches from South Africa. Wamae said they are relishing the challenge ahead as they seek a fourth Kenya Cup crown, which will put them level with the legendary Nondies outfit of the '70s and '80s. Elsewhere, KRU has rescheduled the Kenya Cup, KRU Championship and Eric Shirley Shield semifinal and final fixtures. The semifinal fixtures, originally slated for March 21 will now be played a week later with the finals set for April 18.
