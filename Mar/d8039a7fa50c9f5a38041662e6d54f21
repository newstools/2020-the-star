A teachers' union has cancelled a general assembly scheduled for Lamu, citing coronavirus fears. The general assembly of the Kenya Union of Post Primary Education Teachers was to take place from yesterday (Monday) at the Kenya Marine and Fisheries Research Institute-KEMFRI offices in Mokowe. Kuppet's national vice-chair Julius Korir, national treasurer Mwethi Njenga and executive secretary for Lamu Edward Mbuthia said the cancellation was in line with President Uhuru Kenyatta’s directive on Sunday for people to avoid public gatherings. The officials welcomed the President’s directive to close schools over the coronavirus outbreak. Kuppet had in a past statement urged the government to shut all learning institutions until the Covid-19 outbreak is contained. “We are glad the President heeded our call to close all learning institutions and we support him all the way. That's why we are cancelling our general meeting in Lamu,” Korir in Lamu. The union's Lamu branch executive secretary Edward Mbuthia said that in as much as they had spent a considerable amount of money preparing for the GA, it was in order to cancel as an indication how serious they viewed the outbreak. “It's been three hectic months planning for the meeting. We had spent 80% of the budget money on it. We are cancelling the meeting to support the government and show how serious this outbreak is,” Mbuthia said.
