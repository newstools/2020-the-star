The Naivasha Subcounty Hospital has limited the number of visitors to the facility. It has also set aside a four-bed isolation ward in preparedness for coronavirus. This is after President Uhuru Kenyatta on Sunday confirmed three coronavirus cases in the country. Under the new measures, only one family member will be allowed per patient in the wards. Superintendent in charge of the facility Dr Angeline Ithondeka said on Monday the move would prevent overcrowding in the wards. “We have directed henceforth that only one person will visit a patient in the ward and this is meant to address the issue of overcrowding,” she said. On the isolation ward, Ithondeka said they had received medical equipment, including sanitisers and masks, from the county government. The doctor said plans were underway to set up another 10-bed isolation ward within the facility. “Currently we have an isolation ward with four beds and enough medical equipment in case of any emergence of the virus,” she added. The move to limit the number of visitors caught many by surprise as they trooped to the facility to visit their relatives during lunchtime visiting hours. James Wambugu, who had accompanied six relatives to visit their ailing mother, said, “We were not aware of this notice, and we understand the new safety measures but it’s going to be tricky to many who are keen to see their relatives.” At the Naivasha police station, the closure of the nearby law courts left officers with tens of suspects arrested at the weekend. Some suspects were arrested with drugs, while others were held for being drunk and disorderly. Many were unable to raise the bond set by the officers. An officer, who declined to be named, said they feared some suspects would not appear in court if released on free bond. “The courts are only taking serious cases like robbery with violence and we already have a crisis due to the high number of suspects who cannot raise bond,” the officer said.
