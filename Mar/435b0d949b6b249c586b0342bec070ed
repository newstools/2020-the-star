Kenya dropped one place to 12th on the World Sevens Series log after a lacklustre performance at the Vancouver Sevens over the weekend. Shujaa have 36 points from six tournaments played with the players' fitness and conditioning as well as squad rotation facing numerous questions after dismal showings in Sydney, Los Angeles and Vancouver. Paul Feeney's charges won only one match, beating Wales 28-0 in the Challenge Trophy quarter-finals on Sunday. Kenya lost all their three preliminary matches on Saturday, falling 29-0 to New Zealand, 14-12 to Ireland and 17-14 to Spain to finish bottom of the pool. Shujaa will have a two and a half month break to correct their wrongs with the London and Paris next in line following the postponement of the Hong Kong and Singapore tournaments, due to the coronavirus outbreak. The two tournaments will now be staged in October. Feeney said it is important that the team plays in a tournament to keep them competitive with a focus on Olympic Games team selection in July. "It is a long break and we need to stay focused on the bigger picture which is the Olympics. We must keep the boys sharp in all aspects. Elsewhere, Impala Saracens won the Women's Festival which served both as an event to commemorate International Women's Day 2020 as well as the third round of the 2020 KRU Women's 10-a-side festival despite playing to a 7-7 draw with Homeboyz. The resultÂ saw the hosts finish top of the tier one standings with 8 points and a +34 points difference having won their previous two fixtures, 17-7 against Mwamba and 24-0 against Top Fry Nakuru. Homeboyz were level on points with Impala but let down by an inferior points difference that saw them settle for second place. Homeboyz had earlier beaten Mwamba 14-0 and Top Fry Nakuru 17-0.
