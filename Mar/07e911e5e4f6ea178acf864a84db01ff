Deputy President William Ruto has said that Kenya is a God-fearing country of prayer and not that of reggae, bhang and witchcraft. “I want to say without fear of contradiction that Kenya shall be a God-fearing nation. A nation of prayer can’t be that of reggae,” he said at Eshiunya Anglican Church, Kwisero, in Kakamega county during a Sunday church service. He added that politicians have hijacked the Building Bridges Initiative to derail Jubilee's development agenda so as to achieve their selfish ends. Ruto was taking an apparent swipe at ODM party leader Raila Odinga who is using 'nobody can stop reggae' phrase to initiate the BBI agenda. "This reggae, magicians and bhang shall be stopped, " Ruto said. He said the debate surrounding the BBI should be about the welfare of millions of Kenyans and not few individuals looking for power. The DP said there was no sincerity in the ongoing debate about the BBI, adding that the whole process has been hijacked to benefit few people ahead of 2022 elections. He also said Kenya would continue to be a God-fearing nation despite calls by some leaders to limit church offerings. “The biggest challenge facing the country is not the greed by few politicians seeking positions but the challenge of finding employment for millions of young people,” he said.
