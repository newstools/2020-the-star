In the early 70s, 80s and 90s, university education was worth fighting for and those who acquired it toiled to deserve it. They were even treated differently just because they made it to the university. They observed high moral uprightness, discipline, creativity and rational thoughts in workplaces. Contrary to the days, the decadent and flashy lifestyle characterised by inept character and myopic reasoning of many campus students nowadays has made higher education even more futile. They no longer introspect their values and the merits the education impact on them. Currently, many graduates don't know how to work after their undergraduate studies. They are insensitive to the changing world of creativity, talent and personal effort. In fact, most employers advocate for diploma students in colleges and technical institutions as they term them competent, responsible and creative.  Mombasa
