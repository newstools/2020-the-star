Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko asked Kenyans to accept what they are going through without being ashamed. “Shida yetu wa Kenya nikuogopa aibu ndogo ndogo. Be proud of yourself no matter how bad the situation is. Just appreciate your family,” Sonko said. The governor indicated that he was not ashamed in any way by the second pregnancy of her daughter despite the social media reports. “I am so so glad that my grand Dorraa Sasha will soon have a kid Sis. Haters talk during the day but sleep at night and life goes on as usual". The embattled man put aside city politics and held a party to celebrate his 45th birthday on Tuesday with his family and close friends. “I take this opportunity to ignore the current situation that I'm facing for a while and join my family to thank God for the love of life on this great day of my life,' Sonko wrote. Sonko added that he has managed to create friendship with Kenyans from different counties. “Son of Many Counties: fathered by Machakos County, mothered by Meru County, step-mothered by Makueni County, schooled by Kwale County, brought up in Mombasa County, trained at Lamu County, matured in Taita Taveta County, in-lawed by Embu county married from Kitui County, enriched by Kilifi and Kwale Counties, farmer in Kajiado, rancher in Narok County, neighbor of Kiambu County, friend of Murang'a County, King of Nairobi County and Goodwill Ambassador of Kenya and Africa.,” Sonko said.
