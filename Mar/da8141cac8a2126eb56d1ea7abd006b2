A Kenyan-born man might be hanged for allegedly killing more than 22 grandmothers at care homes in the United States. Billy Chemirmir 47, was charged with killing at least 11 elderly women and stealing their jewellery and valuables in Dallas, Texas. Chemirmir was previously arrested for the death of an 81-year-old woman, ABC Fox Montana reported. The 47-year-old was indicted on six counts of capital murder in the deaths of women aged 76 to 94. Chemirmir, according to the Journal Star, has been in custody since March 2018 over the death of Lu Thi Harris, 81, also from Dallas. Police found evidence linking him to the Harris murder when he was being investigated in the Dallas suburb of Plano for suspicious death and suspicious person calls. According to the Lincoln Journal Star, the break in the case came when Chermirmir forced his way into the apartment of a 91-year-old woman in March last year. In Texas, capital murder carries either the death penalty or a life sentence without parole. The case has been getting complicated by the day as new victims spring up and new suits are added on to the previous ones.
