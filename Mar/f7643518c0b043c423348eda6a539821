High Court judge Francis Gikonyo has recused himself from the murder case of a Marsabit chief. The Meru-based judge did not give the reason for his decision and allotted the case to colleague Alfred Mabeya. â€œFor good reasons which were discussed with Justice Mabeya, I recuse myself from the case," Gikonyo said. Former councillor Doyo Galgallo and Galmo Guyo, Bokayo Dida Boru and Somo Huka Kanchoro have denied killing Dirib Kombo chief George Bida Godana on December 16, 2018, at Garqarsa in Marsabit Central. Godana was hacked to death and his body doused in petrol and set ablaze. The suspects are out on Sh1 million bail each. The matter had been listed for hearing but defence lawyer Kiprotich Kiget sought for an adjournment saying his colleague, Anyegah Ondieki, was indisposed. Kiget produced a letter dated February 7 from Ondieki saying he would be out of the country between February 26 and March 12 on personal issues that were not foreseen at the time of fixing the hearing date. Prosecutor Charles Okeyo opposed the adjournment application, accusing the defence of using delaying tactics. The matter had been pushed late last year to Monday after Kiget fell sick. The DPP had lined up nine witnesses. They were to testify for eight days in-camera as they feared being harmed by the suspects. The defence will call 10 witnesses. The case will be mentioned on March 25. Edited by R.Wamochie
