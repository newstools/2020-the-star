Kisumu county is grappling with flooding that displaced more than 2,000 people following downpours. Many fear that being housed in five displacement centres could spread the coronavirus because of crowding and lack of social distancing. Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o said floods have affected vast areas of Muhoroni, Nyando and Nyakach counties. He said a disaster team of county and national officers is on the ground planning a strategy response. It will be implemented immediately, the governor said. Downpours have saturated the region since last week, sweeping away crops, homes and animals. Last week, a key road linking Ahero and Sondu markets was cut off by the raging waters. Motorists had to take detours. By Thursday last week, areas within East Kano such as Achego, Katolo, Manyatta and Ayueyo had been flooded. Because of concern over coronavirus cases, a number of displaced people are afraid to move to the rescue centres because of crowding. Some residents in Ayueyo area were especially concerned about virus transmission. They and others also expressed concern about an outbreak of waterborne diseases. Lilian Otieno from Katolo Manyatta village said the Nyajigo River has overflowed its banks, flooding homes. “We can’t sleep, all the areas are flooded, we have to put our kids on the table and keep watch as they sleep,” she said. Otieno urged the county government to open the waterway and divert floodwater. Early this month, more than 600 families were displaced in parts of Nyando after  Lake Victoria overflowed in some areas. However, as a result of restricted movement due to the coronavirus as well as the folding, the county is facing food insecurity. Nyong'o appealed to farmers to plant fast-maturing and suitable traditional vegetables and crops such as cowpeas, osuga, dek, alayo, oganda, fast-maturing maize varieties and sorghum. (Edited by V.
