Several clubs across the country are resorting to the noble initiative of raising funds towards the wellness of their caddies as effects of coronavirus continue to bite in the sporting circles across the country. Limuru Country Club and Golf Park in Nairobi are among clubs that have embraced the initiative to help caddies make ends meet. Caddies are some of the most important personalities in the world of golf. Locally, quite a big chunk of top locals pros like Dismas Indiza realised their golfing potential as caddies. But following postponement and cancellation of various sporting events including the Kenya Open, caddies have had no choice but to take it all in their stride. Over the last few days, Golf Park, which is the only public golf course in the country, has been appealing to its members for support to raise funds and assist its caddies during this difficult period when the whole world is declaring war on the Coronavirus-19 pandemic. They have subsequently created an account for this purpose. “Your support, willingness and contributions are highly appreciated,” a Golf Park source said in a passionate appeal to members. Limuru Golf Club board of directors chairman, Dr Wangari CN said members are being requested to help caddies through the tough times. “Further to our communication on March 24 and in keeping with the updated directive from the government of Kenya on COVID19 preventive measures, the board of directors has agreed that the club will be on full lock with no service offered.” “Considering caddies will be highly impacted by the closure, the ladies section has requested that we consider raising funds to help purchase supermarket vouchers to be issued to them,” said Dr Wangari.
