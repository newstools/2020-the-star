DT Dobie, in a bid to grow its range of locally assembled vehicles, unveiled the new Volkswagen Tiguan Allspace last Wednesday at their showroom along Mombasa Road. The Tiguan Allspace is a 7-seater, which is an alternative to the 5-seater Tiguan launched a while ago. The new Tiguan has a two-litre turbocharged 132-kilowatt engine mated with a seven-speed automatic transmission and is a four-wheel drive. Outgoing DT Dobie chairman Zarak Khan presided over the event.
