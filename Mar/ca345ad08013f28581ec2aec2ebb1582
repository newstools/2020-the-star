Christine Ongare saved her best for last to clinch a historic place in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, dominating Ugandan Catherine Nanziri to triumph in a flyweight division 'box off' at the Africa Olympic qualifying tournament that ended on Saturday in Dakar, Senegal. Ongare had promised to grasp the second opportunity to vie for an Olympic slot after she and Nanziri had lost their semi-final bouts and the determination of the Kariobangi North fighter was there to see from the bell. Ongare came out on top as a flurry of punches were exchanged in the opening minute of the first round. A punch to Nanziri's midriff area left the Uganda gasping for breath and Ongare swiftly hit home with more combinations to claim a flawless opening round. Having conceded the opener, Nanziri was determined to win the second but in her desperation, she missed glaring punches as Ongare ducked and weaved her way to claiming another round. The fight from then demanded a standing count for Nanziri to yank the coveted ticket away from the diminutive pugilist but she lacked the power needed to execute such a punch due to exhaustion, living Ongare to jump for joy when the referee declared her the winner. Ongare now joins Hit Squad captain Nick Okoth as the only two Kenyan boxers who will be in Tokyo between July 24 and August 9. She becomes the second female slugger to qualify for the Olympics after Elizabeth Andiego in London 2012.
