Safaricom on Monday rolled out a partnership with public transport sector players to accept cashless payments through M-Pesa. This is in line with the ongoing battle to combat the spread of the coronavirus. The partnership will see crews from partnering public transit firms begin accepting fares through their phone numbers. Chief Financial Services Officer of Safaricom Sitoyo Lopokoiyit said that many businesses are seeing an increase in demand to accept M-Pesa payments due to the ongoing concerns around the coronavirus. This comes after the company's recent move to enable Kenyans send M-Pesa transactions of Sh1,000 and below for free. "Our partnership with the different public transit players brings the convenience and safety of M-PESA to this crucial sector given the widespread uptake of public transport across the country,” Lopokoiyit said. "The service has already been deployed to more than 300 City Star Shuttle vehicles in Nairobi and will be rolled out to additional players in the coming days, helping them further comply with the Government’s recommendations to combat the spread of Coronavirus." For the passengers who will be paying their fares through M-Pesa, will follow the standard procedure when sending money to another person, keying the number provided by the crew. Safaricom announced all its M-PESA customers can send money for free for transactions of Sh1,000 and below for a 90-day period to help minimise the impact of coronavirus to its customers and to help them avoid the use of cash.
