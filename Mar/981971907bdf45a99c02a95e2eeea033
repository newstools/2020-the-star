Covid-19 hits Kenya at a time when the country is grappling with a high wage bill and sea-sawing economically. The economy is bound to be crippled more as businesses - both in public and private sectors - are temporarily halted in line with the state curfew order. The crisis at hand necessitates a collaborative engagement and concerted efforts from all citizens if tangible results are to be achieved. It is a move that calls for austerity and self-discipline in all aspects. However, as Kenyans minimise their engagement in social activities, it should be noted that about 36.8 per cent of the population live below the poverty line. Kenya's bigger population has little or nothing to save since the propensity to save is stronger among the rich than among the poor. Kenya has a high dependency ratio. Though the government has set aside Sh10 billion to cater to the vulnerable, the largest population comprises the youth, who must work to meet the needs of the dependants. As the fight against coronavirus continues, clearly, there are ominous signs of starvation, owing to the fact that the curfew goes on for an indefinite period of time. Kenyans need to brace for tough times ahead. The effect of starvation is equally a painful experience that results from the body burning stored fats, muscles and glycogen before causing metabolic acidosis. In Kenya, this could be yet another disaster that need not be overlooked.  Teacher, Machakos
