Upgrade of major highways and feeder roads has started in Kisii county barely three months to Madaraka Day celebrations to be held in Gusii Stadium on June 1. President Uhuru Kenyatta will lead Kenyans in marking the 57th anniversary of the country's self-rule. A number of dignitaries are expected to attend. Ahead of the event, Kisii has been undergoing a facelift, including repainting of buildings. The recarpeting and repairs on major roads are being done by the Kenya National Highways Authority (Kenha) and the Kenya Urban Roads Authority (Kura). Kenha director general Peter Mundinia said the highways will be ready before May 15. They include the Sh9.4 billion Kisii-Ahero-Isebania road whose tender was awarded to the Third Engineering Bureau of China City Construction Group Co. Ltd. It is funded by the African Development Fund (ADF) and the national government. Speaking at Governor James Ongwae’s office yesterday, Mundinia said the construction is overseen by two resident engineers. Maintenance work is underway on Kisii-Keroka-Sotik highway. Mundinia directed the contractor to fast-track the recarpeting of the road. He said the road leading to Nyamira has been done and only marking remains. His Kura counterpart Silas Kinoti said construction of the bypass from Gudka-Dajara Mbili is ongoing. It will ease congestion in Kisii town. "I'm assuring Kisii residents good work on urban roads will be done to enable successful celebrations," Kinoti said. Ongwae said the stadium is being upgraded. He warned the contracted firm against doing substandard work. "The opportunity to host the national event should not be taken for granted. All works given to contractors should be of high standards," Ongwae said. He said the event will boost business given the huge number of people expected to attend. The county boss urged landlords who have not repainted their premises to do so.
