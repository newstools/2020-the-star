Budget regional carrier Jambojet has suspended flights to Rwanda and Uganda with immediate effect to minimise the spread of Coronavirus. In a statement to newsrooms, Jambojet spread of the Covid-19, which has resulted in a decrease of airline passengers, especially on the international routes. As a result, Jambojet has decided to suspend its services to Kigali, Rwanda and Entebbe, Uganda with immediate effect,’’ the airline said in a statement. The Kenya Airways subsidiary launched the Kigali route in November last year. It has been operating two daily return flights to Entebbe since February 2018. It has promised to assure all the booked passengers are accommodated on alternative flights. The airline will, however, continue with its local operations as the management monitors the situation. ''Our flights to local destinations namely Malindi, Ukunda, Mombasa, Kisumu, and Eldoret will continue to operate as scheduled,’’ Jambojet said. It reiterated its commitment to the safety of passengers and staff, saying it will continue to monitor the situation and share regular updates.
