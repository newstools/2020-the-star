Joe Biden has won eight of the 14 states that voted to pick a Democratic White House candidate on Super Tuesday, a remarkable rebound for his campaign. The ex-US vice-president has swept Massachusetts, Minnesota, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Alabama, Tennessee, North Carolina and Virginia. But Bernie Sanders is being projected to win the biggest prize of the night, California, and three other states. They lead the race to face Republican President Donald Trump in November. How important is Biden's performance? Virginia and North Carolina are crucial because they are key swing states in the 2020 election. With all precincts reporting, Mr Biden won about 53% of the vote in Virginia, leaving Mr Sanders a distant second on 23%. Exit poll data across the board suggests Mr Biden has won large majorities of African-American voters, a crucial bloc for the Democratic party. Mr Biden also appears to have won convincingly among the type of suburban voters who pollsters say have been turning away from the current US president. "We are very much alive," Mr Biden told a crowd in Los Angeles. "Make no mistake about it, this campaign will send Donald Trump packing." How is Sanders doing? If Mr Sanders does win the liberal behemoth of California, as the Associated Press news agency projects, he will pick up the lion's share of the whopping 415 delegates that the Golden State sends to the party convention. Super Tuesday awards more than 1,300 of the 1,991 delegates needed to clinch the Democratic White House nomination. The left-wing independent senator also won his home state of Vermont, along with Colorado and Utah. All eyes now are on the second biggest voting state of the night, Texas. Mr Sanders had been heavily favoured to win the Lone Star State, but it is currently too close to call between him and Mr Biden.
