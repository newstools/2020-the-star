Cabinet Secretaries and Governors visiting Parliament will not be accompanied by their bodyguards, National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi has directed. The Speaker noted that Parliament is a safe place and no bodyguards will be allowed past the parking lot to reduce what he termed congestion of Parliament corridors. “State officers known as Governors have the unbearing habit of coming with so many bodyguards. Parliament is a safe place, there is nothing to fear. This is not a war zone,” Muturi said. The speaker also restricted the number of visitors allowed to see MPs at a given time. Every MP will be allowed a maximum of two visitors at a time. The restriction is meant to address what he termed increased human traffic of people hanging around the corridors of Parliament.
