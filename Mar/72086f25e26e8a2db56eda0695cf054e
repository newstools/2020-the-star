A Kiambu-based Psychologist has praised President Uhuru Kenyatta for the tax measures meant to cushion Kenyans from the negative effects of Covid-19. Gladys Chania, also a politician, said the move came at the right time, considering the economic crisis that has resulted from the spread of the virus. She, however, wants more actions to help the poorest of society. Speaking on Saturday in Limuru, Chania also appealed the government to introduce a security fund for low-income families and casual labourers. “The government can start a social security cash transfer for low-income families. This can be done through social welfare shopping vouchers,” she said. While briefing the nation on the coronavirus situation in the country last week, Uhuru announced the steps his administration will take to save the economy and jobs and protect the vulnerable in society, including residents. Those set to benefit immensely are low-income earners.  The measures include the removal of income tax for persons earning a monthly income of up to Sh24,000. Others are a reduction of income tax rates, corporate tax as well as turnover tax for small and medium-sized businesses. The President also announced pay cuts for senior members of his administration. He and DP William Ruto will forego 80 per cent of their salaries for contributions towards the fight against the virus. Chania urged Parliament to enact laws that can help the government to use such money whenever there are pandemics to save the lives of the poor. She called on Kenyans to observe hygiene and comply with the government’s directives to say safe and healthy.
