Kenya Secondary Schools Sports Association (KSSSA) western region secretary-general Quinto Omusugu is optimistic the sports calendar will resume as planned despite the current coronavirus pandemic. Omusugu, who is also the national deputy secretary, said it was a good move by the government to suspend learning programs for the safety of the students, teachers and other staff members. “We regret the outbreak of coronavirus which has temporarily affected our regional Term One programmes but we believe things will return to normal soon. “Let each and everyone observe the laid down government guidelines and security precautions in order to help contain the situation. “Most teams were well prepared and focused on winning tickets for the nationals but we had no option but to comply and wait for a further directive,” he noted. He, however, admitted that the quality of the competition will slightly be affected since the players are not training together as a team. Mukumu Boys’ handball coach Anthony Wekesa also raised concerns, terming the outbreak as a major threat to the sporting industry.  “This has really frustrated my program for the regional games. Our objective was to win the regional championship in Busia and proceed to the national level but the drive and the spirit of the players has been slowed down with the break,” he said. He, however, reiterated that the situation is affecting all the teams and warned his players to maintain good shape and not give excuses.
