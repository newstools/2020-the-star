Socialite Huddah Monroe and Rapper Khaligraph Jones have been beefing since the socialite claimed not to know the rapper. Earlier on, Kahligraph had fired a shot at Huddah for not picking up his phone. When asked in an interview why she does not pick his calls, she shrugged him off. "I never pick up calls but I think he is doing well. He won an award but I don't know any of Khaligraph’s songs," she said. Adding that she prefers Khaligraph’s frenemy Octopizzo. "I know a lot of Octopizzo’s music. Octopizzo is my favourite. He and Nyashinski are my favourite artistes in Kenya. Especially Nyashinski, I was disappointed when he got married, I had a crush on him." Khaligraph Jones released a freestyle diss track, where he called out the socialite. In the diss track, Khaligraph is heard referencing Huddah, calling her a slay queen and saying that despite the coronavirus quarantine, the socialite is still going out partying. He went on, saying he is not interested in her as she had already dated another rapper in the industry. Huddah fired a shot at him, saying she will manhandle him until he leaves her alone.
