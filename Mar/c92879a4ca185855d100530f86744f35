Deputy President William Ruto has hit back over AP Sergeant Kipyegon Kenei murder probe. Kenei, the policeman who handled Rashid Echesa and his fake arms dealers, was killed by powerful individuals. DCI George Kinoti told the Star that they had enough clues linking the individuals to the murder and subsequent cover-up. "We have identified the persons of interest and that will be the focus of our investigation going forward," he told the Star moments after he addressed a lengthy press conference where he played CCTV footage showing Kenei's last moments. But on a tweet on Friday, Ruto said the headlines on newspapers detailing what transpired before the murder were a cover up. "..the drama, distortions, convenient half-truths and the smear campaigns in sponsored headlines amounts to criminal cover up," he said. Ruto said Kenyans must be told the truth on who killed Kenei not the sideshows. "The truth must be found on why, how and  who  killed Sgt Kenei. The family, ODP,and Kenyans want the truth and justice and culprits held to account," he added. According to the investigators, Kenei had nothing to fear and was ready to spill the beans about what he knew regarding the fake arms deal that threw the DP's office into the limelight. According to the evidence gathered by the homicide detectives, Kenei's house revealed a scenario of a gruesome murder stage-managed to look like a suicide.
