Swahili telenovela 'Selina' and comedy-drama series 'Ma’Empress' are the most-watched local productions, according to Showmax. Selina stars Pascal Tokodi and Celestine Gachui, while 'Ma'Empress' stars Kate Actress and Neomi Nganga. Producer Phillip Karanja said Kenyans have embraced local content but producers are not keeping up with the amount of content they want. "I think the narrative that Kenyans only love watching international shows is a lie because the conversation on the ground is very different," he said. "In terms of quality, the only way to get to international standards is by being on the ground every day, working and practising.” 'Selina' producer and director Reuben Odanga said the feedback they get from shows like 'Selina' is that many people are watching. "Kenyans are appreciating local content, which is very good and important for this industry," he said. Both productions are on Maisha Magic, exclusively on Showmax.
