Health CS Mutahi Kagwe has urged employers to release their staff by 4 pm from their work stations in order to comply with the government curfew. The CS clarified that the government does not restrict anyone from going to work for both day and night shifts. Kagwe warned that the 4 pm directive does not give employers the right to reduce the salaries of employees. "To the employers, please, do not withhold people's salaries, wages just because of the situation that currently exists," he said. "Knowing now what we know and knowing that the transmission is here now, we should be telling ourselves that this is the time for us to do whatever it takes. This is a time to give sacrifice, not take advantage". Last Wednesday, President Uhuru Kenyatta announced targeted interventions aimed at cushioning Kenyans from further spread of the COVID-19 disease. Kenyans risk a fine of Sh10,000, three-month imprisonment, or both if arrested by security officers for violating the curfew order. The Law Society of Kenya has moved to court seeking to suspend the night curfew imposed by the state. They argue that the curfew is unconstitutional and the excessive use of force on Kenyans to enforce the curfew is illegal. However, if the court declines to suspend the curfew, LSK wants the review of the time extending the time of the start of the curfew from 7 pm to 10 pm.
