 Director of Criminal Investigations George Kinoti has travelled to the US to attend the much-coveted Federal Bureau Investigations (FBI) executive training. Kinoti left the country last week for the United States where he will be at the National Executive Institute for three weeks. The DCI boss is the only detective from Africa considered for the high level training with the other four attendees are drawn from Canada and Australia. At least 15 top FBI officials will take the participants through strategic leadership development and current affairs during the three-week training. The attendees - according to NEI’s website – must be heads of departments with more than 500 sworn officers serving a population of at least 250,000. The first two weeks of the training will be held in Washington before the attendees are taken to Glasgow for the final bit of the course. “NEI consists of three one-week training sessions throughout the year. Two of the sessions are hosted by the FBI Academy; the third is typically conducted overseas in concert with our global partners,” NEI's website states. “One of the most valuable aspects of NEI is the range and diversity of the executives, who bring immensely different levels of experience and perspectives.” NEI has provided leadership development for bureau executives and for the heads of the largest law enforcement agencies in the United States and overseas. Since 1976, more than 1,000 law enforcement executives have graduated from the institute. Upon graduation, each executive is invited to join the NEI Associates (NEIA), a non-profit foundation that continues the education of these executives and sponsors various research projects.  edited by p.obuya
