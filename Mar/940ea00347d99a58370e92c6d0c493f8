 Ken Silver Express has temporarily stopped ferrying passengers until Monday, April 7, in efforts to stop the spread of Covid-19. Ken Silver operates the Meru-Embu-Nairobi route. Manager Gerald Theuri told the Star on Monday they have stopped bookings and will quarantine their staff for 14 days before resuming business. “This is about our staff as they have been in contact with customers. We will be back to normal services on April 7. We are obeying President Uhuru Kenyatta’s directive on the restriction of movement. "We are also receiving a few passengers from the other side," Theuri said, adding that there are many vehicles that had gone to Nairobi without passengers. Meanwhile, matatu owners in Meru have asked the government to reduce fuel prices for travellers not to suffer from anticipated fare increases. Matatu owners secretary-general Joseph Bundi, who is also the Raha Express Sacco CEO, urged the government to subsidise fuel prices to cushion passengers as matatus comply with the government directive on spacing. “If the government reduces fuel prices we cannot increase fares,” Bundi said. He said the sacco has removed three seats in 10-seater vehicles so that drivers are not tempted to ignore the directive. “We have reduced passengers to seven but the fare is high because we have no otherwise. We get Sh4,200 profit daily. Matatu owners will meet to standardise and harmonise fares. We have hiked fares to a reasonable amount to remain on the road,” he said. The sacco has ensured that staff maintain high hygiene standards and that vehicles are fumigated after every trip in efforts to contain the spread of coronavirus. “We have complied and all passengers are asked to wash and sanitise their hands when entering and leaving our vehicles. We also ask passengers to be cooperative because most of them ignore simple measures like hand washing,” Bundi said.
