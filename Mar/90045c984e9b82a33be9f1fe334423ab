Nakuru Governor Lee Kinyanjui has said no one should lose his life in the manner Sergeant Kipyegon Kenei was murdered. Through his Facebook account, the governor paid tribute to Kenei as his body is expected to be laid to rest on at Chemasis village, Nakuru. "No man should lose their life in the manner Kipyegon Kenei left us," Kinyanjui said. He added, "We share in the pain of his son, who has to contend with living without his dear father, and wife rendered a widow at such a tender age". The governor has further said that "it feels very sad to bury such a young man full of promise and hope". Kenei's body was moved from Umash Funeral Home in Nakuru on Friday. He was accorded full police honors. His casket was draped in his police unit flag carried by eight officers in full ceremonial uniform. Kenei's body was discovered in his single room house located in Imara Daima, Nairobi. His death is suspected to be linked to the Sh39.5 fake arms deal which is under investigation. In his address to the media on Thursday, DCI boss George Kinoti said the suspects behind Kenei's death are strong individuals. "We have identified the persons of interest and that will be the focus of our investigation going forward," Kinoti said. Deputy President William Ruto is among the leaders expected at his final send off since Kenei was among the security officers attached to his office in Harambee Annex.
