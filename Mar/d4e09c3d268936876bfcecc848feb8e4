A Kwale matatu lobby has urged residents to limit travel unless it is essential to stop the spread of the coronavirus. Kwale Matatu Owners Association chairman Joseph Mutunga warned the residents against risking their lives “in the name of searching food” for the families. “Stay at home and only move whenever it is necessary. Being arrogant will cost you because you are exposing yourself to the danger of this disease,” he said. Mutunga spoke to the Star in Kwale town on Monday. He said if people do not take precaution, they will end up endangering the lives of their family members. Mutunga said residents should not assume that things are normal. He said citizens should adhere to the government health directives against Covid-19. The matatu lobby boss also expressed concerns over the increasing number of children loitering in the streets within Kwale. He said parents should not take the state closure of schools to prevent the spread of Covid-19 as if it were a holiday. “The main objective for the closure of the institutions was to curb the situation but it seems parents are not giving it much consideration,” he said. Kwale drivers and conductors’ chief security officer Suleiman Mwachoa warned that if the fight against the virus goes for longer, the transport sector might die. “If things continue in this manner, we will soon be forced to remove our vehicles from the road because of the losses being incurred,” he said.
