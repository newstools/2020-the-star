Nakuru county and fishing stakeholders have clashed over a drop in Lake Naivasha's fish stock. The latest data from the Department of Fisheries show monthly catch has dropped by close to 40 per cent, with fears it will get worse in the coming months. The department attributed the drop to a rise in water levels, saying it usually happens after heavy rains. Fisheries director Mathew Ngila said tilapia and common carp species have been affected. “We have recorded a 40 per cent drop in fish catch in the lake mainly due to the increase in water levels occasioned by heavy rains and this is always the norm,” he said on Tuesday in Naivasha. Central Landing Beach chairman Lucas Atieno, however, attributed the drop to illegal fishing. He said foot-fishermen, as they are popularly known, use undersize nets that trap immature fish. “We have a major problem around the lake in the name of foot-fishermen and if this is not addressed, fishing will be a thing of the past,” Atieno said. Ngila admitted that the number of illegal fishermen is on the rise but said their presence will not affect fish catch. “We are working with other stakeholders like KWS to address the sharp rise in the number of illegal fishermen,” he said. The director said they will restock the lake next week with 200,000 fingerlings from Sh2 million set aside by the county government. David Kilo from the Boat Owners Association warned that fishing is at stake. “Every day, we have tens of new foot-fishermen targeting the dwindling stock and we fear that fishing could be history in the coming weeks if no urgent action is taken by the county,” he said.
