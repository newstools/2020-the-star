A section of Vihiga residents has opposed plans to impeach Governor Wilber Ottichilo. Already, 23 MCAs have signed a motion to be tabled. They need two more signatures to make a quorum. Ottichillo sought an order at the High Court in Kakamega to have the assembly blocked from tabling his impeachment motion. The residents, drawn from the construction industry, sports and civil society, said the plan is malicious. In a statement read by Kelvin Mwangu, the Western region representative to the Federation of Kenya Football, they backed the governor and cautioned the county assembly against making good their threat to remove him from office. "Ottichillo has done development projects from the lighting of market centres, construction of roads and bridges, and improvement of the health sector, among other things. Itâ€™s amazing that some MCAs want to impeach him on grounds well known to themselves," Mwangu said. MCAs allied to the governor have been removed from their house positions. Chief whip Victor Ijaika told the star on the phone that those who support the executive cannot oversight it. "For the sake of wananchi, we have to replace them for quality and credible service to people of Vihiga county at a large," he said. However, Mwibona MCA Zakayo Manyasa and his Luanda South counterpart Peter Alukutsa said they will stick with the governor and dismissed the impeachment plan as a "minor issue that will perish". "I represent my people of Luanda South and so far they are in support of the governor's development record; therefore, no need of supporting the impeachment of a governor who is working for his people," Alukutsa said. They urged their counterparts to go for dialogue before contemplating impeachment.
