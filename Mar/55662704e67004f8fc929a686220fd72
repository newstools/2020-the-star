IEBC has said it is not aware of Polycarp Igathe’s resignation as Nairobi deputy governor. The commission on Thursday said they have not received any formal resignation notice from Igathe. The commission was responding to the County Assembly which had sought advisory opinion last year after Governor Mike Sonko was charged and barred from accessing his office by the court . “On the vacancy in the office of the Deputy Governor, Nairobi County, the Commission has not received any formal communication as to the alleged vacancy other than information in the media,” reads the letter. The letter was written by IEBC Director of Legal and Public Affairs Michael Ogoa. According to letter, there was no resignation meaning there is no vacancy in the office of the deputy governor. However, the same IEBC cleared Sonko’s nominee Anne Mwenda to be vetted for a position they never declared as vacant. Last month, a city ward rep had put IEBC on the spotlight for allegedly clearing Sonko's Deputy Governor nominee without ascertaining whether there is a vacancy in the office. Minority Chief Whip Peter Imwatok had claimed that Kananu had been cleared for a seat that has not been declared vacant. In January 2018, Polycarp Igathe resigned as Sonko's DG thus creating a vacancy which has not been filled up to date. Upon resignation, Imwatok had argued that the Governor ought to have communicated to the Speaker who then writes to the electoral commission regarding the resignation. He stated that the commission was quick to gazette a returning officer to clear the nominee before declaring the position vacant.
