Bungoma nominated MCAs will now serve in one assembly committee each. Their elected counterparts removed from them from other committees after they demanded cash for their offices and staff. Those who had leadership positions, including departmental heads, have also been stripped of their roles. Fifteen nominated MCAs recently sought court orders barring the passage of the county supplementary budget before their funds are included. This angered the elected members, who held a Kamukunji and resolved to punish them. The budget was, however, passed. On March 18, the court is expected to rule on whether the MCAs should enjoy the privileges. Those affected included Luke Opwora who had been deputy whip and Fred Musebe who served as Sports committee chairman. Musebe was replaced with Jorum Wanjala of Bukembe East, while Opwora is to be replaced this week. Musebe (Ford Kenya) and his ODM counterpart Sophie Marambu, who led other nominated MCAs to court, accused their elected colleagues of sidelining them. "We are all members of this house, notwithstanding whether you were elected or nominated. Our leaders and voters saw something in us that they want us to discharge. We canâ€™t be sidelined for holding different views," Musebe said. (Edited by F'Orieny)
