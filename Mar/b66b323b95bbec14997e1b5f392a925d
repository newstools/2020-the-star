A Nakuru based lawyer who allegedly plotted with others to kill a Belgian National has been charged with murder. John Gakinya has pleaded not guilty to the offense of murder. It is alleged that between 11 December 2018 and July 2019 jointly with other not before the court at unknown place within the republic of Kenya killed Dysseller Mireille Lesoipa alias Leila. Gakinya was before Justice Daniel Ogembo on Wednesday. He was charged even though the police are yet to find the deceased body who police believe was killed. Mireille went missing early last year and police believe a group of people plotted to kill her and take over her properties. Gakinya allegedly filed a case a succession in a Nakuru court where Lucy Waithera a friend of Mireille was a beneficiary in the fake will of the deceased. There is also a fake death certificate that was equally filed in court. Waithera a close friend to the deceased was also arraigned in court but she did not take plea for the second time as her mental assessment report was not ready. Gakinya's report was ready and he is the first to plead to the charges. His case will be mentioned on Monday when he will formally apply for bail. The prosecution has told court they will be opposing his release on bail.
