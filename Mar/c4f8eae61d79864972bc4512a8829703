Despite journalists being allowed to work outside past curfew, security agencies have been in a push and pull with journalists and photographers. Moses Ombogo of Anyole Fm in Emuhaya, Vihiga county, is nursing injuries at Emuhaya Hospital in Luanda after he was allegedly assaulted by police officers on Saturday night. Medical reports indicate the journalist has sustained internal injuries and broken bones. Earlier, the Nation Media Group's Peter Wainaina was also allegedly assaulted by police officers in Mombasa on Friday night, Day One of the curfew. Ombogo said on Sunday he was attacked by police officers along the Kisumu-Busia highway on his way home. “I was on my motorbike then one of them called me and I responded. But before even explaining where I was coming from, he jumped on me with a beating. My efforts to inform them am a journalist and providing my press card didn’t help me." Nurses at the hospital have said they will not offer night services in order to protect themselves from police brutality. Luanda OCPD Johoness Ndolo said he was not aware of Ombogo's case. "Follow the orders in place and be on the safe side of the law. We have enough time to do what is needed for us before the stipulated time to be in our homes," Deputy Governor Patrick Saisi said.
