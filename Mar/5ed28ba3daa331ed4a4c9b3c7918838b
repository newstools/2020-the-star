Risky home births could soon end in Bungoma county if all women adopt an initiative launched by Governor Wycliffe Wangamati. The Mama Care Pack programme will provide a set of essentials and postnatal support to mothers who deliver in hospitals. Wangamati's administration will distribute towels, shawls, sanitary pads, baby caps, baby soaps and body oil, among other items. Wangamati seeks to encourage women, especially from rural areas, to deliver in hospital under the care of skilled hands to ensure safe births. "Through this initiative, we hope to encourage mothers to deliver in hospitals and not at home, minimise risks and create decency at delivery," Â he said. Many women feel ashamed of giving birth in hospitals for lacking items such as towels. The county chief, who recently introduced a monthly stipend programme for community health volunteers, said every CHV who takes a pregnant mother to deliver in a county facility will get Sh500 per delivery. "Research shows many of our women fear giving birth in hospitals because they will be laughed at for lacking towels and clothes for the newborn, courtesy of poverty. The programme aims at ending this shame," Wangamati said. Health executive Antony Walela said that of the average 64,000 deliveries the county annually, 18,000 take place at home. He blamed this on poverty and lack of essentials. He said some women fear being harassed by hospital staff. "We want to encourage the 18,000 to deliver in hospitals," he said. "We have ensured that we motivate our workers so that they can have a good rapport with the patients."
