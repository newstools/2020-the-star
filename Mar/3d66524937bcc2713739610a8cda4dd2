The Kenya Airports Authority has refuted claims that a German army shipment containing six million masks meant for protection against Covid-19 vanished at JKIA last week. KAA through a statement on Tuesday said they conducted their own investigations into the matter and found out there was no cargo of this nature that had passed through JKIA for the last two weeks. They also revealed that no missing cargo has been reported to the authorities. "We, therefore, wish to inform the public that we are treating this report of alleged disappearance of six million type FFP2 protective masks as fake news and that our cargo section continues with normal operations," KAA tweeted. Kenya on Tuesday received 100,000 masks from the Jack Ma Foundation. Kenya is among 54 other countries that have been benefited from the Chinese billionaire and Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma's donation. The masks, together with 20,000 test kits and 1,000 protective gear landed at JKIA and were received by Ethiopia's Ambassador to Kenya Meles Alem andÂ the Director of Public Health Dr Patrick Amoth. Amoth said the donation will immediately be put into use to enhance capacity with the existing kits. He said priority will be given to personal protection especially to those working in isolation centres.
