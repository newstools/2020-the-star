World governing body, FINA have ratified the Kenyan swimming Constitution in readiness for the long-awaited elections. Sports Dispute Tribunal (STD) chairman, John Ohaga, said they received the document last week and the focus now shifts to the eight counties who are expected to ratify the document before taking part in the elections. Ohaga said he will meet the representatives of the eight counties to discuss the timelines in as far as the alignment of the Sports Act is concerned. “We have received the constitution and now our work becomes easier. It's now up to the eight counties to be aligned and get ready for the elections besides having the documentation ready,” added Ohaga.  The eight counties are Nairobi, Nakuru, Kisumu, Mombasa, Kilifi, Kajiado, Laikipia and Nyeri. Kenya Swimming Federation (KSF) acting chairman, Patrick Muyah, said of the eight, only Nairobi had met the requirements and asked the remaining seven to speed up in a bid to allow the elections to go on. “It's not an easy task but we are asking the other counties to work with speed so that we can move to the next agenda of the election,” he added. Muyah assured that the elections will be held if all the outstanding issues are resolved by stakeholders.  “If we can agree with everyone, then I believe we will have the sport headed in the right direction,” added Muyah. Ohaga said he can't give a timeline on a date of the election until counties meet the requirements including ratifying the Constitution. "Finances are still an issue and must be discussed,” he added. Kenya was suspended in December last year after missing two deadlines to hold the elections. The country risks being locked out of the polls if the elections are not held in time.
