A 22-year old woman died leaving behind her seven-month-old baby after she accidentally rolled down the deep Emkorak cliff near Kabarnet town in Baringo county on Wednesday. Vivian Cheplom, who lived at Kapkorowo, was reportedly out to collect firewood when the accident happened. “She was attempting to break a dry branch from a tree on the edge of the cliff when the rock she was stepping on came loose, and she rolled down,” Kewamoi assistant chief Kipchumba Kiprono said on Thursday. Kiprono said Cheplom died on the spot, having suffered deep cuts on her head and bruises all over her body. He said her sister in-law, a secondary school student, was holding Cheplom's baby not far from the cliff. “We notified the police who responded immediately and with the help of residents retrieved the body, although it was a tedious exercise,” Kiprono said. The body was taken to Baringo County Referral Hospital mortuary. Edwin Cheplom, a brother to the deceased, described his sister as disciplined and hard-working. The family was preparing to receive their prospective in-laws for her engagement on April 11. “The incident is a shock to us, but we have to accept God’s will,” Edwin said. Kiprono said this was the third incident in three years of people accidentally falling down steep cliffs around Kabarnet town. Edited by Henry Makori
