Kakamega residents have been asked not to discriminate against people with common flu in the face of the coronavirus scare in the country. Governor Wycliffe Oparanya said although the virus has symptoms similar to those of the common flu, it should not be used to "disgrace" others. "Some people run away from others just because they have normal flu. This is unfair because we need each other during this trying moment. However, if you have common flu, stay at home to avoid mistreatment," Oparanya said on Saturday. He further asked people living in urban centers to avoid traveling to their rural homes to limit spreading the coronavirus in the event they are infected. Oparanya said that such movements would curtail efforts by both levels of government to contain the spread of the virus. “There is a panic flight of people from towns to their rural homes after the virus scare. This is dangerous because it will lead to infection of the elderly in villages who are vulnerable to Covid-19,” he said. Kakamega has been put on high alert after three suspected cases were reported last week. Tests from three turned out negative on Friday. One of the three had arrived in the country from Dubai, another from Qatar, while the third on had travelled from Rongai in Nairobi to Khwisero. Oparanya said the county is set to receive three mobile clinics from the national government to facilitate testing for the virus, even in rural areas. Oparanya said that his administration will ensure availability of water in all markets, being essential in the fight against the spread. "Where there is no water, water boozers will be available as long as it's reported to us," he said.
