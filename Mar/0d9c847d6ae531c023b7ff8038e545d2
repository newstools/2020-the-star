Rev Kathy Kiuna says a married man approached her for her daughter but she turned him down. Taking to social media, Kiuna said the man even told her he never loses and that he always wins so it was just a matter of time. "I said a loud NO. When he said that, she [the daughter] decided to give him a chance and asked him what he meant by winning. She then explained to him what winning was and that his winning was twisted," she said. Kiuna said if her daughter gave in and she slept with him, he would have lost not won. "Winning is when he feels like doing it but overcomes it by doing the right thing as opposed to succumbing to his feelings," she said. "Winning is when you overcome the fleshly desires, allowing the word of God to guide you. Win from today in Jesus' name."
