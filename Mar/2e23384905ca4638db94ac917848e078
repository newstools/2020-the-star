A family in Kasipul constituency blames police for the death of their son during the first day of the implementation of the nationwide curfew to contain the spread of Covid-19. The family of Calvin Omondi accused the police of assaulting their son. Omondi, 23, succumbed to injuries on Sunday morning at Rachuonyo Level 4 Hospital in Oyugis town after an alleged attack by police officers at Kosele market. However, police have distanced themselves from the death. Area police commander Esau Ochorokodi said the rider sustained injures in a road accident. Ochorokodi said the information they have is that the man was riding his bike when he lost control and landed on a concrete bridge. “The rider hit his head in a culvert when he was riding back home. I’ve no information about attack by police during first day of curfew,” Ochorokodi said. However, according to the family, Omondi, who was a motorcycle operator, was allegedly attacked by officers on his way home when they were patrolling on Friday. His father George Onyango said his son sustained serious injuries in the head and chest after being hit with blunt objects. He said the attacks took place when he was returning home after ferrying a customer to Kendu Bay in neigbouring Karachuonyo constituency. “My son was assaulted about 30 minutes after 7pm on his way back home. He was attacked just a few metres away from home,” Onyango said. The father accused unidentified officers of killing his son. “A colleague who was with him informed that they were attacked by police before they rushed Omondi to the hospital,” Onyango added. The family wants investigations conducted and necessary action taken against the officers involved. “We want justice since Omondi has left a young widow and a child,” he added.
