The government is tracing 85 people who got into contact with a lady who tested positive. These were the words of Health CS Mutahi Kagwe on Wednesday. "These are active contacts' of COVID-19 patient who escaped from Mbagathi Hospital ," he said. Kagwe explained that the patient left the coronavirus isolation facility without authorisation. "She was tracked down and brought back by security agents. She tested positive," he said. But he did not mention where the patient went to after leaving the hospital. Kagwe noted that to improve Kenya's preparedness for the virus, Kenya held a video conferencing with doctors from Wuhan, China. "... our doctors were able to communicate with doctors from Wuhan. If you know an individual who has agreed to self-quarantine and is not, report them through 719," he said. "Any Kenyan travelling into the country must sign a legal form agreeing to self-quarantine." According to the World Health Organization, many countries with confirmed cases report a sharp spike, before the curve comes down. However, countries can 'flatten the curve' by preventing and delaying the spread of the virus so that large portions of the population are not sick at the same time. Kenya confirmed its first case of coronavirus last Friday with President Uhuru Kenyatta on Sunday confirming two more cases â€” for a total of three, until today when the number rose to seven.
