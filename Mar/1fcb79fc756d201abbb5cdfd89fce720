 Several Micimikuru tea pickers survived death by a whisker last weekend when a mugumo tree landed on their houses as they slept. Two of them were injured. The tree was uprooted by strong winds at 11pm on Sunday. On Tuesday, residents implored the Njuri Ncheke Council of Elders to conduct special prayers on their behalf. “I heard a loud bang and within minutes this house was collapsing. The mugumo tree hit a mouru tree and scattered branches which fell on our house. We were six in the house and we were trapped for hours," one of them identified only as Culubi said. He said the winds were accompanied by thunder and lightning. "It was God who saved our lives," Culubi said as he beseeched the revered elders for prayerful intercession on their behalf. The tea pickers lost everything – beds, clothes and bedding. Mary Mukomugaa said they will forever thank and praise God for saving them. Kenneth Muchui, a Kirima Secondary School student, was one of the injured. “I was asleep after my evening studies. I don’t know how I escaped,” he said Ziporah Kanuu urged the Miciimikuru tea factory management to trim all trees in the living quarters. “There are so many old trees on the farm and in the living quarters. They are a danger to us. We want KTDA to cut them,” she said. The occupants said they had been told to either vacate the premises or start paying rent, but they stayed put insisting that they can not afford to pay.  .
