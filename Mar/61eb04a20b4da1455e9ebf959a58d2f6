East African Breweries Ltd has partnered with manufacturers to distribute free sanitisers to vulnerable Kenyans. EABL Foundation has committed Sh50 million to fund the production of 135,000 litres of sanitisers by two Nairobi-based industries. EABL Foundation Trustee Eric Kiniti said they have engaged certified sanitiser producers to produce hand sanitisers for distribution to vulnerable groups and those at risk of exposure. Areas with informal settlements, EABL staff and communities in water-scarce will benefit from the distribution. “We shall be engaging our sales personnel on the ground as well as distributors to ensure the sanitisers get to the most vulnerable groups, mainly those who do not have access to water and good sanitation,” Kiniti said. The Foundation has also partnered with the two private companies to pack and distribute the sanitisers across the country, relying on EABL's extensive distribution network. The brewery has also been helping drive public awareness about coronavirus by printing posters for distribution to more than 40,000 outlets across Kenya. The input from the EABL comes as the government plans to distribute free sanitisers to the most exposed individuals. Three major oil marketers are expected to produce at least 20,000 litres of sanitisers daily to support the government's fight against the spread of coronavirus. Vivo Energy Kenya, Total and Ola Energy (formerly OiLibya) have volunteered to produce alcohol-based sanitisers to meet the high demand for the disinfectant.
