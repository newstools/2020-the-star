Former Sports CS Rashid Echesa has been arrested at his Karen home in Nairobi. The sleuths from the Economic Crimes Unit have been camped at his house since Monday morning and had been earlier denied entry into Echesa's premises. After waiting for hours they forced themselves inside the house after climbing the wall. The home is surrounded by an electrified perimeter wall. The former CS has been taken to the DCI headquarters. Sources say his arrest was in connection to a VX Land cruiser which he is said to have fraudulently acquired. All five vehicles from his home have also been taken away. Detectives were forced to buy fuel for some of the vehicles for them to be driven away. The operation took close to five hours. Echesa had earlier protested the police presence stating he could not allow them inside his house without his lawyer. His lawyer Brian Khaemba arrived at the scene before the detectives launched a search in the house. Echesa and three others were granted Sh1 million bail on February 17 after denying all the charges against them. They appeared before Senior Principal Magistrate Kennedy Cheruiyot where they were charged with conspiracy to commit a felony by conspiring to make a document with intent to defraud. The four were given an alternative of paying Sh3 million bond each to secure their freedom. Echesa and three others have been charged with 12 counts in the Sh39.5 billion fake military arms deal. They are also alleged to have obtained Sh11.5 million from Kozlowski Stanley Bruno by purporting that they would award him with a tender to supply military equipment.
