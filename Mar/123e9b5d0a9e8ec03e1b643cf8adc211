Kenya Ladies Golf Union (KLGU) chairperson Sarah Hoare wants golfers across the country to identify talent in a bid to ensure continuity of the sport. Following the successful hosting of the first-ever European Ladies professional Tour at Vipingo Ridge Baobab, Hoare wants the golfing fraternity to scout for talent and ensure there is no gap when the current generation exits the scene. “As women, we have to ensure we have quality players from across the country. Since I took over early this year, my main objective has been to ensure we get the best lady golfers from all over the country and boost our numbers and esteem as women,” said Hoare. She cited local schools as the best places to tap and nurture talent across the country. “Considering these are young girls, instilling golfing skills in them becomes easier,” she added. “I have the mandate to ensure there is a good flow of talent within the sport in the country and that can only be achieved if we come together and support our young people. At the same time, we want to tell golfers from each club to motivate their children to take up golf in order to avoid the vacuum that may occur,” she said. Last year, Kenya hosted the first-ever European Ladies professional Tour at Vipingo Ridge Baobab, the only PGA accredited golf course on the African continent, where Germany international Esther Henseleit shot a course-record round of 64 to win the title and enter into history books as the first winner of the tournament with a score of 14-under par 274. This year’s event will be staged at the same venue from November 12-15.
