Media personality Lillian Muli has dismissed rumours that she is pregnant. In a Q&A session with her fans on Instagram, a fan asked her if she was paged and she responded saying, ‘No’. Another fan asked if she gave birth to her two kids naturally or through CS. "Both were optional caesarian section," she responded. When asked whether she was planning to have another child, she said she wasn’t. "For now, no," she said. "I’m done." Lillian Muli has two sons with different baby daddies, and when asked if she was married, her response was vague at best. "I’m happy," she said. The mother of two moved on with Shabana FC Jared Nevaton after divorcing her ex-husband Kanene, and their relationship hasn’t been all rosy. They broke up in December 2018 but later got back together. A fan asked, "Who is your husband?" "I am sure you know him if I have one that is," Lilian responded. When asked about her greatest fear, she said, "Ageing alone."
