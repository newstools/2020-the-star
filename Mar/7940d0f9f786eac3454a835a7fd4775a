Gospel singer Gloria Muliro says she prays for Willy Paul because she does not approve of some of the music videos he makes. Willy Paul came into the limelight with Sitolia, featuring Muliro, in 2014. The track was well-received. He has continued to release more songs over the years but many now say he has lost the way. But Willy Paul says his purpose is to entertain. “Who says I quit gospel for secular? What God has put in me is beyond talent. I am a creative artist. One day I could wake up and record a love song, the other a worship song,” he has been quoted as saying. “At the end of the day the same God who blesses Wizkid and Davido [secular artistes] is the same one who blesses gospel artistes.” In a recent interview, Muliro said she would work with Willy Paul again but they would first have to hold a talk to correct his error. “As a mother, I love Willy Paul because every parent has different children. I pray for him. I don’t agree with the music he does,” she said. Muliro is one of the best gospel musicians in the country. However, it has not been a walk in the park. It took five years to get noticed. “I would attend meetings, even without being invited, and perform for free before the invited artistes come,” she said. “At one time, a microphone was grabbed from my hand while I was performing but I knew one day I would be great.” Gloria said she does not choose who to do a collabo with but waits on God to direct her. "I may plan a collabo with a big artiste, but God wants me to lift a young artiste so, before any collabo, I ask for God's intervention," she said.
