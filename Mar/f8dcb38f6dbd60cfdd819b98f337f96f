Former Football Kenya Federation (FKF) President Sam Nyamweya has termed Tuesday’s ruling by the Sports Disputes Tribunal a win for the football family. The ruling cancelled the recent FKF county polls and declared the end of the National Executive Committee’s term. John Ohaga’s Tribunal made a landmark ruling in case No. 3 of 2020 Football Kenya Federation (petitioner) Vs Sports Registrar (respondent) which was consolidated with case No. 5 of 2020 Cheptiret United Football Club (1st Petitioner), Bondeni Football Club (2nd Petitioner) versus FKF (respondent). “This was a masterpiece ruling, unprecedented in the sporting fraternity in Kenya and I dare say in the continent of Africa and can only be compared to rulings delivered at Court of Arbitration of Sports in Lausanne, Switzerland,” Nyamweya enthused. “The ruling breathes life to the Sports Act 2013 (revised 2019), it gives a sound legal and sporting interpretation of the contentious articles and provisions in the Sports Act and the Sports Registrar rules of 2016. It clearly outlines the principle of hierarchy of norms with regards to  FKF Constitution, the Fifa Statutes and regulations, Fifa Standard Electoral Code, FKF Electoral Code, Sports Act 2013 (Revised 2019) and the Kenya Constitution 2010,” he added in a statement. Nyamweya hopes the road map proposed of instituting a Normalisation Committee will finally deliver free, fair and credible elections at FKF.
