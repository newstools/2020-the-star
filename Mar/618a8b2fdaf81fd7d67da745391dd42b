House Speaker Justin Muturi has clarified that the 11 MPs who went to Somalia did not visit the neighbouring country as a parliamentary delegation. Muturi, however, said the MPs would not face any sanctions for their trip to Mogadishu to meet Somali  President Mohamed Farmajo and intelligence chiefs. “It is however important that State Officers live up to Chapter 6 of the Constitution on Leadership and Integrity. The MPs needed to notify the Speaker whether they travelled on official or private capacities,” he stated. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs had indicated that it was not aware of the trip by the lawmakers from Wajir and Mandera counties. The MPs were grilled by detectives on arrival at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport. They defended their trip saying it was in the interest of regional peace and stability. They further claimed that they did not require authorization from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as they had been cleared to travel by Parliament. The MPs were Ahmed Kolosh (Wajir West), Ibrahim Abdi (Lafey), Rashid Kassim (Wajir East), Mohamed Hire (Lagdera), Omar Maalim (Mandera East), Bashir Abdullahi (Mandera North), Adan Haji (Mandera West), Kullow Maalim (Banisa), Adan Ali Sheikh (Mandera South), Dahir Mohamed (Dadaab) and Ahmed Bashane (Tarbaj). There were claims that Somalia’s leadership lobbied the MPs to push Kenya to stop supporting President Ahmed Mohamed Islam, better known as Madobe, in Jubaland. On Sunday, Detectives laid a trap for the legislators for allegedly being connected to a suspicious trip to Somalia. A spot check by the Star indicated that detectives and police officers were stationed at the Wilson and JKIA airports as they await the arrival of the MPs. The security of the airport was also heightened with the detectives manning each gate of the airport. The MPs reportedly flew to Somalia for an undisclosed mission in the wake of tension between Jubaland and Somali National Army troops near the Mandera border.
