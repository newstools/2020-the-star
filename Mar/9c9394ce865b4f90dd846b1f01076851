Former Gem MP Jakoyo Midiwo has withdrawn an assault case against four Kisumu  police officers. Midiwo withdrew the case on Monday before chief magistrate Peter Gesora. He told the court that he decided to withdraw the matter out of his own will without being forced nor threatened. “The accused person asked for forgiveness and because I am human, I have decided to withdraw this case,”he said. The magistrate in a short ruling acquitted Godfrey Wachira, Violet Nyagah, Jeph Owino and Denis Mutua. They had denied four charges before the chief magistrate. Court documents say the four officers jointly assaulted Midiwo on February 10 at Central police station within Kisumu county. In the second count, the officers were charged with assaulting Elijah Oyugi, Midiwo's driver. They were also charged with stealing the former MP's mobile phone valued at Sh15,000. They were freed on Sh50,000 bond or a cash bail of Sh20,000 each.
