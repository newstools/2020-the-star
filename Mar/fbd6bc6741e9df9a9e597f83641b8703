The winner of the Impala vs Mwamba match will face Kabras in the semis as Homeboyz v Oilers encounter KCB in the last four. The Enterprise Cup semis will see Kabras host Homeboyz as KCB entertain Impala. The Kenya Sevens players will resume training tomorrow following a two-week quarantine period having played at the Los Angeles and Vancouver Sevens early this month. Technical director-cum-head coach Paul Feeney said with the postponement of the Paris and Londons Sevens, they may have to tweak their training programmes for the next three months. "We have to rethink our plans going forward and as a group, we will need to have more game situation training sessions within this time. We’re looking at dividing the whole squad into different teams where they’ll play against each other and then we will have video analysis sessions to see how to improve ourselves,” added Feeney.
