In the opening quarter, the Ruai-based Muhuru Muchiri were schooled in the game and condemned to an 18-0 defeat.

Buruburu Girls overwhelmed both Dandora and Maina Wanjigi sides with 64-4 and 63-2 points respectively. Despite the huge margins, coach Julius Otieno says the girls did not display their real game and feels the girls will play better in their Saturday’s ties. “Today the team did not play their game may partly because competitions were one sided. But they are facing formidable sides tomorrow (Saturday) which should be able to bring out their best,” said Otieno adding that Our Lady of Mercy Shauri Moyo, Olympic Secondary and Raila Educational are teams to watch in the Regional showpiece. Buruburu have an encounter with State House and Starehe Girls on Saturday at the same venue. In other matches played at State House Girls saw Starehe Girls Centre whitewash Maina Wanjigi 51-0 as Raila Educational Centre edge Ngara Girls 47-13.
