Vihiga Governor Wilber Ottichillo has told residents there will be no development this financial year and the next. The county has registered dismal development since the advent of devolution in 2013, with the current administration struggling with huge pending bills. Already the county has spent Sh139 million to pay pending bills amounting to Sh1.8 billion. Ottichillo said on Friday the balance will be released in tranches on monthly basis as per the approved and verified documents. Governor said transport, health, agriculture, education, sports and gender were the most affected sectors as their budgets were slashed to pay pending bills. "Once we are done with the Sh450 million that we are expected to clear by June the remaining bills will be spread to the remaining financial years," the governor said. "The only development that will take place in this county is from national government projects and other funded projects from foreign bodies," Ottichillo said.
