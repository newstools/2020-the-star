A man's body was on Monday morning found at Miathene market near the busy Kianjai-Mikinduri road in Tigania West on Monday morning. Saberio Kimathi is suspected to have been killed and the body dumped at the open-air market. Family members of the 45-year-old man have appealed to security agencies to bring the culprits to book. David Mutuma told the Star he was woken up around 6:20am on Monday by someone who told him that he saw his brother at the market. He found his brother's body with deep cuts. “We want to know the cause and those who killed him. Two young men came and picked him at home yesterday (Sunday) at around 6pm and that was the last we saw of him. I have heard the suspects brutally murdered him in a certain house and then transported the body to the market,” he said. His sister, Marcella Kabet, said they want justice. She said Kimathi had no grudges against anyone. However, some residents claimed Kimathi was a criminal. But it was not justifiable to murder and instead he should have been arrested. Others suspected revenge over a sour deal. “We have enough security in Miathene; this is an isolated case. We are shocked by perpetrators of such brutal killing. I wonder why didn’t arrest him and take him to the police for action,” resident Moses Kirimi said.  Edited by R.Wamochie
