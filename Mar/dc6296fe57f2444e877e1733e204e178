The 2009 Kenyan Premier League champions Sofapaka stretched their recent winless run to three matches after playing to a barren draw against Zoo FC on Friday at the Kericho Green Stadium. The John Baraza coached outfit were seeking to redeem themselves from a 1-0 and 2-1 losses in the hands of Ulinzi Stars and AFC Leopards respectively but were frustrated by the relegation battling hosts. The draw left Sofapaka eighth with 31 pointsâ€”20 behind league leaders Gor Mahia. On the other hand, the result meant that Zoo who are now placed 14 with 16 points, will have to wait longer for their first win of the second leg and the year. Zoo last gathered maximum points last year on December 1 when they beat Kisumu All-Stars 3-0. The club has since gone for eleven matches without a win, putting their hopes of keeping their top-flight status in doubt.
