Murang’a residents living on steep terrain have been cautioned to be on the lookout for landslides as the county is expected to receive enhanced rainfall. Some parts of the county are expected to receive more than 1,000 millimetres of rain this season, which may trigger landslides. County Director of Meteorology Paul Murage said the current weather forecast indicates that the county will receive enhanced rains, especially in April. Murage said last season the county received a lot of rain and the soil is still saturated. “Last season despite the county receiving enhanced rains, we did not lose any life. Property of unknown value was destroyed in various areas by landslides. This time we urge residents to be on the lookout for landslides and take necessary precautions,” Murage said on the phone. Murang’a county is prone to landslides, which sometimes lead to loss of lives and displacement of families. Murage further said waterborne diseases may also affect residents living in lower parts of the county, including Maragua and Kandara, where water tables are high. “During the rainy season, residents are advised to drink treated or boiled water to avoid contracting diseases,” he added. Meanwhile, the county government is giving farmers maize seeds as they prepare for the planting season. Agriculture executive Albert Mwaniki said county officials are taking the seeds to the doorsteps of registered farmers. “During other years, we usually distribute maize seeds at chiefs’ offices or other public premises but due to coronavirus threat, we have organised for seeds to be delivered at individual doorsteps to maintain social distancing,” he explained in a public notice. Certified seeds have enabled the county to increase maize yields in the past few years. Farmers have been asked to work on their farms at a time when people are encouraged to stay in their homes as the government enforces various measures to combat the spread of coronavirus.
