  Bumula MP Mwambu Mabonga has been buying goods from traders in his constituency at double prices as a way for motivating them to work harder. The MP also gives incentives to the traders whenever he makes the occasional visits to market centres in his constituency in Bungoma county. Mabonga was elected on an independent ticket in 2017 and the first-term lawmaker says he aims to encourage many people to venture into businesses for self-reliance and stop depending on handouts from politicians. “My team and I have been visiting local markets and interacting with smallholder traders. We ask how much their stock costs, we then buy it at double or even triple the price to assist them to grow. This is the best way to give back to society,” Mabonga said. Last Friday, the MP and his team were in at Kabula market where they bought stock worth Sh8,000 and paid Sh21,000. One woman whose stock was worth Sh1,000 was paid Sh5,000 and another received Sh6,000 for stock worth Sh2,000. Another trader sold stock worth Sh5,000 to the MP and he paid double the price. “I understand the difficulties our local traders go through to get capital to start their businesses including borrowing from financial institutions and Shylocks who demand triple the interest rates. That’s why I chose to help them reduce the burden of repaying back so that they can recoup their profits,” Mabonga said. So far, the MP has visited Netima, Mayanja, Kibuke, Lunao, Myanga, Mayanja Vitunguu, Kimwanga and Kabula markets. He said the target is to visit all the markets across the constituency. He plans to spend Sh420,000 on buying the traders' stock. “I also use the interactive sessions to enlighten the traders to form groups so that they benefit from Uwezo Fund. These funds can help them a great deal and it can be used to eliminate poverty and joblessness,” the legislator said. The merchandise bought is given to members of the public for free.  edited by peter obuya
