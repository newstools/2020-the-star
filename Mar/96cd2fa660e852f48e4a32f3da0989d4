Former Kenya National Examination Council CEO Paul Wasanga is the new Muungano Party leader. Wasanga served as Makueni county secretary but resigned following a falling-out with Kibwana. A source privy to what had transpired said their relationship waned and Wasanga chose to resign on learning he was about to be sacked. Muungano party secretary general Jonathan Muoki said they had been without a leader for three years after Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana joined Wiper Party following a pact between the two parties ahead of the 2017 election. "We are organising a meeting of all party members in the course of this week to speak in one voice over the matter,‚Äù said Muoki, who is a nominated MCA in the Makueni assembly. He told the Star that Muungano is a national party by virtue of having an elected leader in the National Assembly. But Kibwana, who plans to run for president in 2022, blamed Kalonzo for the change. He accused Wiper of meddling in the affairs of his former party to lock him out should he want to use it future. The second-term governor has been at loggerheads with his party boss Kalonzo Musyoka. He said Wasanga and Kalonzo are "one thing". "Kalonzo and Wasanga are the same thing. Kalonzo has now taken charge of Muungano. I want to say I will not be in Wiper in 2022," Kibwana said.
