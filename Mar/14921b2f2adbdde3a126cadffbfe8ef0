West Pokot County Education Board has suspended any further registration of new schools in the area until the available ones are fully utilised. They observed that there has been mushrooming of many small schools, to an extent ECD schools have been converted into primary or secondary schools. County director of Education Jacob Onyiego said some secondary schools in the area are being underutilised, noting that parents should ensure the available schools are fully utilized before thinking of starting new ones. He spoke at Nasokol Girls' Secondary during subcounty education stakeholders meeting. Onyiego mentioned some secondary schools in the area with a population of less than 100 with enough government teachers, while some parents or churches want to start a new in the same area. "There are some schools in the area with a population of 58 or 70 from Form 1 to 4 with at least four or more TSC teachers. But parents or church leaders from such areas are advocating putting up a new school," the director said. Onyiego further pointed out that absenteeism among headteachers and teenage pregnancy as factors affecting education performance in the area. "The trend of teenage pregnancies and teachers absenteeism has reached an alarming rate. If the headteacher spent most of their time outside the school how do you expect other teachers to be in school?" the Onyiego posed.
