Two men suspected of killing a woman after drinking with her in Donholm have been detained for 14 days pending investigations. James Otieno and Samwel Maina were detained by Makadara senior resident Lewis Gatheru after police linked them to the death of Edidah Wanjiku on the night of March 14 in Donholm estate. The two men have been detained at Buruburu police station. In an affidavit filed by investigating officer George Kaparo, Wanjiku was Otieno's girlfriend. The officer told the court that when revellers entered the gate where Otieno lived, the caretaker asked them to tone down the noise, but they did not listen. The following day, the officer said, Otieno reported an alleged suicide at Buruburu police station claiming Wanjiku jumped from the apartment on the fifth floor. He said he rushed her to Mama Lucy Hospital where she succumbed to injuries, Kaparo said. "There is a suspicion that she would have been murdered by the two suspects before they manipulated the scene." The officer said he needed time to trace key witnesses and record statements. He also needed to revisit the crime scene, he said. "The suspects need to undergo a mental test to determine if they are fit to stand trial." Edited by R.Wamochie
