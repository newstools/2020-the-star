The Kenya Ferry Services has disinfected ferries operating at the Likoni crossing channel following an outcry from commuters. Commuters were furious on Monday morning to find no preventive measure to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus had been implemented. But KFS communication officer Aaron Mutiso said the management has adhered to all measures provided by the Mombasa County Emergency Response team and the national government. “We have discussed how to implement the preventive measures outlined and within few days we will have implemented all," he said. On Monday evening, KFS employees sanitised ferries in operation and at the channel. Workers collecting money from motorists wore gloves. “We are already working on [providing] water at the island side and from Tuesday, commuters will be required to wash hands with soap before being allowed to board the ferry," Mutiso said. A public address system at the crossing channel is now being used to sensitise commuters on the virus. The official said some directives were hard to implement due to the number of people at the channel but KFS was doing all it can. Governor Hassan Joho and county commissioner Gilbert Kitiyo directed the ferry service to provide handwashing detergent and running water. This is to be enforced by the county inspectorate and NYS officers. Edited by R.Wamochie
