The coronavirus pandemic is set to impact Kenya Re's written premiums, claims and investment incomes amongst other business operations. "In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic we continue to seek ways to work smart and heavily leverage on technology to mitigate its negative effects; we will analyze the impact of the pandemic on business and develop appropriate response strategies,”  Kenya Re managing director, Jadiah Mwarania said. The reinsurer posted a 35 per cent jump in profit after tax to Sh4.18 billion last year compared to Sh3.10 billion in 2018. According to Mwarania, the sharp growth was a result of  an 18 per cent growth in gross written premiums in addition to 10 per cent growth in investment income. During the review period, gross written premiums grew by to Sh17.52 billion from Sh14.84 billion the previous year. On the other hand, investment income rose from Sh3.39 billion to Sh3.71 billion in 2018. “Despite the challenges we faced as a corporation, we managed to produce outstanding financial results including significant growth in shareholders’ funds,” Mwarania said. In 2019, shareholders’ funds grew 13 per cent (Sh3.58 billion) to Sh31.95 billion compared to Sh28.37 billion the previous year. Consequently, the corporation’s shareholders will receive a dividend payment of Sh0.10 per share once approved by an AGM. Net incurred claims grew 25 per cent to Sh11.06 billion while operating expenses increased marginally to Sh2.04 billion from Sh2.02 billion as at 31 December 2018. Mwarania said the firm had fully activated its Business Continuity Plan to minimize work disruptions and ensure that the business continues to function in these challenging times.
