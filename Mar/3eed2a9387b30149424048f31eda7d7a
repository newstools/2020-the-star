Kirinyaga Woman Representative Wangui Ngirici wants BBI rallies stopped because they are full of incitement remarks and were polarising the nation. She has asked President Uhuru Kenyatta to order a stop to the rallies and direct that those with views to take them to the Building Bridges Initiative task force led by Garissa Senator Yusuf Haji. There have been BBI rallies in Kisii, Kakamega, Mombasa, Garissa, Kitui, Narok and Meru counties where town hall meetings are followed by rallies at local stadiums the next day. Ngirici on Sunday said despite regions having town hall meetings, the views submitted in the memorandum are not the ones discussed in the rallies. She said the rallies had been turned into political mudslinging events. The MP said the push for constitutional amendments should not be politicised or hijacked by a few political leaders. She said the process should be open for all Kenyans irrespective of their political and religious association. "Submitting views to the BBI task force in Nairobi will ensure the opinions given are sober and not influenced by political connotations and affiliations," Ngirici said. She was speaking at Wamumu in Mwea where she donated plastic chairs to religious groups and pampers to women with babies. Ngirici said the BBI was aimed at uniting Kenyans and as such ought to welcome and respect all views from different political affiliations. The lawmaker accused governors of spending millions of shillings to transport people to various venues for BBI rallies yet counties were struggling to pay workers. "Governors should concentrate on improving the livelihoods of the electorate, rather than misusing funds that would have been used to improve roads, hospitals and purchase drugs," she said.
