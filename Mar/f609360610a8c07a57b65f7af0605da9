Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has ordered the suspension of all arrests by the City Inspectorate and Enforcement Officers, until further notice. This means that hawkers will not be arrested for operating on the street pavements and arrests will not be made to Public Service Vehicles who break the traffic laws. In short, people who will be breaking the laws will not have to worry about the headache caused by kanjos. In a notice issued on March 17, Sonko highlighted that the move is as a result of the suspension of courts's operation declared by Chief Justice David Maraga. “This is informed by the fact that the operations of all courts of law have been suspended, hence suspects cannot be arraigned within 24 hours, as provided for in the constitution,” read the statement in part. According to Sonko the arrests could also violate WHO and the ministry of health guidelines on social distancing. When one gets arrested by the inspectorate officers, they are normally put in the famous "kanjo van' which has little ventilation with  wire meshed protected windows. The van is overloaded and can accommodate close to 30 people. This might put people's lives at risk on contact the coronavirus in case any among them ins infected. The virus has so far killed over 6,000 people and infected thousands since its inception in December 2019.
