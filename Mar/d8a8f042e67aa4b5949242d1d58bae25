A Nyandarua nominated MCA has called for protection of parents from exploitation by schools boards through the sale of overpriced uniforms. Esther Mwangi on Tuesday sought a statement from the house committee on education saying the high cost of secondary education – compounded by the 100 per cent transition directive - has become a concern for the majority of Kenyans. Mwangi said the sale of school uniforms is done either in the specific schools or shops where exorbitant fixed prices are charged and that the schools provide no option for parents to purchase from other sources. She said the county and national governments, through the constituency development and national affirmative action funds, have made steps to ease the burden by providing bursaries but the cost of uniforms is still expensive. Mwangi called for an audit on the market price of the uniforms to ensure parents get the best prices, noting that what parents are forced to buy for over Sh1,000 in school, the uniforms cost Sh600 in other areas. There is a possibility the schools could acquire the uniforms at lower costs from other institutions– such as technical colleges and polytechnics – instead of allowing parents to be exploited by unscrupulous managements or their accomplices in the business sector, the legislator said. She urged the committee to consult with the county Education director to deal with the exploitation perpetuated by the schools’ Boards of Management. Edited by R.Wamochie
