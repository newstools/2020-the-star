A family in Bomet county has been left in distress and panic after its property was destroyed by lightning on Thursday. The family in Abosi village, Sotik, have been left without shelter after the Thursday evening incident razed two houses and left 16 goats, two cows and two donkeys dead. Six bags of grains in one of the houses were also destroyed. However, four family members who were present at the time escaped unhurt. When the Star visited the home on Friday morning, residents watched the carcasses in disbelief. They could not come to terms with the tragedy. Area assistant chief John Kiget termed the incident an act of God, adding that elders from the village would try to unravel the mystery behind it. He said it was unusual and had never happened in the sublocation before. “This is a strange happening. We have only been hearing about it but have never witnessed it here before. We might have to consult our elders deeply about it,” Kiget told the Star. Neighbours said they heard a sharp and loud bang and immediately saw a huge smoke billowing from the homestead. “We rushed to the scene to check what was happening and found animals dead, with the family members watching in astonishment,” one villager said on condition of anonymity.
