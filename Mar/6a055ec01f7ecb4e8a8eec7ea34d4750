Jubilee Secretary general Raphael Tuju is expected to make a full recovery in two months. Tuju, a close ally of the President, was involved in a grisly road accident last month at Kijabe Hospital while enroute to Kabarak for the burial of the late President Daniel Moi. Doctors at Karen hospital told the media on Thursday that they were amazed at his rate of recovery, pointing out that Tuju has been able to walk without assistance since Tuesday. Tuju regretted that he would participate in the hospitals annual marathon to raise funds for children with heart disease. "I have been participating in the run for 27 years now and I feel bad that I will not be part of this year's event on Saturday " he said. On politics, Tuju said he will briefed tomorrow on the current situation. "Right now I'm not thinking about politics, my concern at the moment is my health, " he responded when asked about a scheme to impeach DP William Ruto. Two weeks ago,Â  Tuju was flown to the UK for specialised treatment following orders by President Uhuru Kenyatta. The Star has established that Tuju was received in London by Kenyan envoy to UK Manoah Esipisu, although the hospital where he would be admitted remains unclear.
