Wajir county has set aside more isolation wards at border points of Habaswein, Dadajabula, Diif, Bute, Khorof Harar and Kutulo. County health executive Ismail Sheikh said on Thursday the department had enhanced screening of people at the border, including pastoralists. He urged residents, especially those coming in and going out of the county, to cooperate with health officials. Ismail spoke to journalists during the second county emergency response on Covid-19 meeting. The meeting was chaired by county commissioner Jacob Narengo and Deputy Governor Ahmed Mukhtar. On Wednesday, the Wajir county offices were closed and staff advised to work from home starting Thursday. Only employees offering critical essential services in the departments of health, water, fire, cleaning and enforcement sections, town and revenue section will continue working. In a memo, county secretary Abdullahi Maalim urged county employees to cooperate with the latest directive. The memo was copied to Governor Mohamed Abdi, county commissioner and the county health executive. “As you are aware, the government of Kenya has confirmed the existence of cases of Covid-19 in the country leading to drastic actions to contain the spread of the virus, including allowing employees to work from home,” the memo read. Maalim said all staff should be available on phone, so they can be reached easily by line managers when needed. Edited by A. Ndung'u
