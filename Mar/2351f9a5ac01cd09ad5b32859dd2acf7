A 54-year-old woman who had come from Germany caused panic in Machakos town after she was spotted on Sunday evening wearing a face mask. The residents raised alarm and informed the police who summoned the woman to Machakos police station on Monday morning. She, however, tested negative for the now dreaded disease. Health executive Ancient Kituku said the woman has been on self-quarantine for the 13 days. The government requires anyone who enters the country to self-isolate for 14 days. "We received a call from Machakos DCI for a coronavirus suspect and we have responded quickly on the matter," Kituku said. He said the county response team ran some tests on her and confirmed that she has no symptoms of the Covid-19. The woman is said to have been staying in a hotel with her tour guide in Machakos town. "Their temperatures are okay. They are not coughing or sneezing, so there is no need to panic," the executive said. The CEC said the county is well-prepared and equipped with the necessary protective kits to handle coronavirus. More than 200 health officers have been trained, Kituku said, adding that two isolation wards have been set aside. "I urge our people to follow the precautions tips and stay away from social gatherings, maintain hygiene and also be on the alert and report any suspected case." County police commander Karanja Muiruri said, "The case was reported yesterday by residents who had generated fear of the virus and urgent matters were taken where she was tested for the coronavirus. The results showed she was in good health." He said they have evacuated police cells as a precaution measure and urged residents to be cautious and maintain hygiene. The police boss said the county police department has deployed patrols to make sure all schools in the county are closed in line with President Uhuru Kenyatta's order on Sunday. Edited by R.Wamochie
