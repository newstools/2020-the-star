Teachers have been urged not to only concentrate on students who are smart in class but also those who are slow learners. “If you only love those who are clever and clean, what merit does that give, even the pagans do as much,” Nairobi Catholic Archbishop John Cardinal Njue said on Tuesday. He said teachers should avoid discrimination against any learner because everyone is gifted differently. The cleric said learners should not be judged but should be nurtured to realise their potential. “This will enable us as a nation to achieve the vision of the new curriculum which is to engage, to empower and ultimately to have ethical citizens," Njue said. Njue spoke during the 71st graduation ceremony of St John Teachers Training College Kilimambogo in Kiambu county. Principal Damaris Mbogo said teachers must constantly renew their thinking and mindset. “Teachers must be keep abreast of times, have courage to be innovative, embrace challenges and adhere to the core values of the teaching profession.”  Edited by A.
