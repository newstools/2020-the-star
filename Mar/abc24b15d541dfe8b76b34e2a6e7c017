A politician from Eastern seems to be so engrossed in men that he never ceases to insinuate a desire for a cosy time with them. Well, the man has caught the attention of some his constituents who can now easily predict what he would say during a chat about his colleagues in the political scenes. The man is said to have extraordinary attractions as per his recent comments about a popular party official. In unprintable words, he insinuated to having the fellow punished by very weird means. An upset lady intimated to Corridors that they will one day call out the fellow for his double life. It seems the outbreak of the coronavirus has come as a blessing in disguise for some politicians. Two MPs from Eastern Kenya were overheard discussing how they got a reason to avoid their constituents without criticism from bloggers. They said they had been under pressure to visit their constituents nearly every weekend, spending large sums of money to avoid the wrath of the bloggers believed to be sponsored by competitors. The keyboard warriors had been on their necks – exposing them whenever they delay to visit the area or fail to attend or contribute in funerals. A top official in the Ministry of Energy is a man under sharp focus of anti-corruption sleuths after it emerged that he recently “tipped” members of a House committee a cool Sh800 million. Those in the know say the crafty official who had accompanied the MPs who were to inspect key projects being undertaken within his mandate ended up touring only one project where the taxpayers money was shared among the members of the committee. Thanks to the birds of heavens, they have promised to unplay to anti-graft detectives all that they recorded during the outright looting of taxpayers' money.
