Traders are counting losses after fire broke out at Eastleigh South, Section 3 on Friday evening 9pm. Witnesses said the fire was caused by welders at a nearby garage. Forty stalls including hotels, boutiques, garages and furniture shops were destroyed. "We tried to contain the fire before the fire engines arrived but it was huge," he said asking the Nairobi County fire services to be more swift during fire outbreaks to minimise losses. It took around one hour for two fire engines to put off the fire.
