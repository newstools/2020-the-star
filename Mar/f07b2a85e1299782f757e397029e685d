The Tanzania Football Federation has asked football players not to shake hands while playing matches. In guidelines seen by the Star on Wednesday, the federation prohibited players from shaking hands before the match, which has been the custom across the world. The players have been asked to instead use sign language as an alternative way. "Utaratibu wa wachezaji kupeana mikono kabla ya kuanza mechi hautatumika kwa sasa, na badala yake watasalimiana kwa ishara tu," the guidelines read. Loosely translates to: (Shaking of hands before the match begins will not be followed. Instead, players will use sign language). The statement said the guidelines will be observed in all the Tanzania Vodacom League and other major leagues in the country. The federation said it reached the decision following the advice from the country's health ministry as a way of prevention from the virus. On Tuesday, Tanzanian President John Magufuli avoided shaking hands with guests at the State House. Instead of shaking hands, president Magufuli was seen shaking legs with Maalim Seif Sharif Hamad. Tanzania has taken several precautionary measures to prevent the deadly virus which has killed over 3000 and affected more than 80,000 people worldwide.
