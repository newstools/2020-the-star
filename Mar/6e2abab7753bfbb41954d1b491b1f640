Police are looking for a prison remandee who escaped from the Homa Bay County Referral Hospital where he was being treated for TB. The suspect, identified as Joseph Ogweno, escaped from an isolation ward on Thursday evening. He was admitted to the hospital from Homa Bay prison after he displayed symptoms of tuberculosis. The suspect was arrested last year on defilement allegations. Ogweno appeared before a magistrate in Mbita court, where he denied the charges and was remanded at the prison on November 29 after he failed to raise the bond. The officer in charge of the prison, Beverline Lungatso, said the suspect displayed signs of TB when he was in remand. “He had to be taken to the hospital for a check-up where doctors advised that he should stay at the health facility for up to 18 months,” Lungatso said. Police officers who were manning the isolation room stayed outside the ward because of TB. “At the time of his disappearance, the suspect had stayed in the hospital for about four months.  He might have taken advantage of being alone in the isolation room to escape,” she added. The suspect could have escaped after realising he was alone. She said her office is working with other security officers in Homa Bay to recapture him. “We’re telling him to report back to any police station because we’ll catch up with him. Anybody who knows his whereabouts should also report as early as possible,” Lungatso said. Edited by R.Wamochie
