The Kenya Pharmacy and Poisons Board has closed 117 chemists in five Eastern counties in a crackdown that also netted 44 alleged quacks. KPPB senior inspector of drugs Julius Kaluai said the pharmacies did not have up-to-date licences displayed on their walls. He called on the public to be cautious and look for documents when buying medicines. Those arrested, he said, were not registered with the board and had no qualifications to handle drugs. The exercise is aimed at promoting better healthcare. Kaluai appealed to the Judiciary to grant high deterrent bond from Sh200,000 to Sh1 million. Meru had the highest cases of unlicensed chemists ( 53 ). Upper Eastern Region KPPB boss James Gathogo said Embu followed with 36, Tharaka Nithi 15, Isiolo 11 and two in Marsabit. He said the crackdown took a week. Unlicensed distributors were prosecuted in various courts and their stock confiscated. Those who pleaded guilty to charges were fined between Sh15,000 and Sh50,000, while those who denied were released on Sh200,000 bond. Kaluai handed the list of the closed premises to the Meru county commissioner Allan Machari and Police Commander Patrick Lumumba for enforcement of the closure until they acquire necessary permits. "The crackdown was carried out in Upper Eastern region to augment the routine inspections that are carried out by region inspectors. Members of the public should be cautioned on the outlets where they buy medicines," he said at a presser. The operation targeted chemists that were profiled through the board’s online database, coupled with a mapping exercise undertaken by regional administrators. The county commissioner said the crackdown will be intensified to curb health risks for the safety of the general public. He also promised to collaborate with the board to ensure culprits are prosecuted and all the locked pharmacies remain locked until they comply with the law. “The crackdown is continuous," Machari said.
