Kenya Power has temporarily closed of all its banking halls across the country. This, it said is in line with the governmentâ€™s directive to stop the spread of coronavirus. "This is meant to protect customers and employees from potential exposure," the power retailer said in a statement on Tuesday afternoon. Customers can make payments for electricity bills and purchase of electricity tokens through alternative channels which include select banks, Airtel Money and M-Pesa, the firm said. The company will also provide drop-boxes for cheque payments, at all entrances of the banking halls. Banking hall staff will however be available on telephone to attend to service-related issues and address other complaints lodged by customers. Additionally, the company will continue supporting customers through its social media channels and the Kenya Power Self Service App, management has affirmed. Kenya Power has also established a National Command Centre that will be supported by eight other Regional Command Centres "to ensure business continuity during the crisis period." The National Command Centre has developed guidelines for safety of staff and customers. Already the company has released a section of its workforce to go on leave while retaining a staff complement to ensure business runs uninterrupted. "This has enabled the company increase social distance as a measure to protect its staff and customers," it said, through a statement by its corporate communications department.
