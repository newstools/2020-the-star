Sofapaka head coach John Baraza has termed tomorrow’s duel with Zoo Kericho a tough one but a must-win match. Baraza, who has come face to face with the reality of being a top-flight coach after enjoying fruitful early weeks when he was handed the permanent coaching mantle, said he is milking every opportunity to learn against some tricky opponents like Zoo. “It’s going to be a very tough match for us because Zoo are the host and equally both sides lost in their last two matches. Zoo and we are both looking for a win and this will make it a hard one,” he said on the club website. The all-time leading scorer with the club, Baraza admitted that February was difficult for Sofapaka and challenged his charges to take the ‘Bull by the Horns’ in the next couple of months before the 2020 season ends. “We didn’t have a good run last month having lost two matches in a row. It is a huge concern to us as a team and as the technical bench. It has to some extent tampered with the players' confidence and in addition, brought in more pressure on my side as the head coach. We talked about it and our focus now is on collecting ourselves and moving forward promptly as possible. We want to get our confidence back and have a proper consistency level.” Baraza maintained that they remain focused on finishing the season strongly despite indications that they will fall short of their objective of adding to their league title of 2009. “We had our targets and that was to win the league. Unfortunately, we are a bit off the race and so we are focusing on finishing in a respectable position. We believe we can achieve by turning around our season starting this Friday in Kericho,” he noted. Despite their wretched recent form, Sofapaka maintained that the onus is on them as a unit to deliver and as such, they will have to win the tie to at least relieve the pressure and get themselves back on track.
