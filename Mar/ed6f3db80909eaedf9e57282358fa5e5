The Media Council of Kenya has been put on the spot over its subjective attack on the media's integrity. The Kenya Editors Guild has accused the MCK of unjustifiably attacking the media's independence. This came after MCK released a statement on February 27 titled - Seek the truth and report it- cause no harm  accusing the media of serial “betrayal of public interest and violations of the code of Conduct for the Practice of Journalism in Kenya” MCK further accused the media of consistently creating screaming headlines without a corresponding and appropriate content, multiple repetitions of headlines over a short period of time, as well as partisan and skewed coverage of news and current affairs. But the guild president Churchill Otieno said in a statement on Sunday that these are serious accusations and could amount to severe indictment of the Kenyan media. "..Unfounded accusations are most unhelpful as they seriously erode the trust Kenyans have on the media as a key institution necessary for upholding democracy, good governance, the rule of law, promotion of human rights and other important values in society," he said. "MCK says it reached its conclusions ... but fails to provide any evidence on the existence of such a study, period undertaken, terms of reference, methodology, authors, and presentation of a report and recommendations." Churchill said MCK is clearly out of control, overstepping its mandate, and is clearly a threat to media freedom as enshrined in the Constitution of Kenya. In September last year, Churchill also warned politicians, government officials, and traders to desist from attacking journalists for whichever reason.
