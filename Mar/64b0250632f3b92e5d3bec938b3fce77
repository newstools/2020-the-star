Activist Okiya Omtatah has threatened to sue the NHIF board over irregularities in the appointment of the public medical insurer’s CEO. His grievance is that the board re-advertised the vacancy for chief executive yet another process had been concluded. The Health ministry had told a parliamentary committee that interviews were done successfully. NHIF chairperson Hannah Muriithi and Health Principal Secretary Susan Mochache told MPs three names were forwarded to former Health CS Sicily Kariuki. Without revealing the names, the duo told the Health committee that a substantive Cabinet Secretary would make the appointment. But stressing the right of access to information, Omtatah is demanding answers on why the post was re-advertised. He also wants to be informed on whether the board had powers to recall the initial three names. The activist further wants a report of the interview with scores of each candidate as awarded by individual members of the panel “…together with the criteria used in selecting the three names forwarded to the CS,” his March 5 letter to NHIF reads. “Kindly note that failure to supply the information as requested will necessitate recourse to the Constitutional Court, at your risk as to costs, for orders regarding access to information,” Omtatah said. “We hope that you will honour our access to information request and promptly avail to us, and to the Kenyan public, the requested documents,” the Kenyans for Justice and Development (KEJUDE) boss wrote. During his vetting for CS, Mutahi Kagwe promised the Committee on Appointment chaired by Speaker Justin Muturi that he would transform NHIF. The fund is faced with a cash-flow crisis amid concerns over corruption and mismanagement. But Kagwe says the turbulence will end as he intends to bar government agencies from contracting for private medical cover. He also proposed that contributions be made mandatory for all rich Kenyans, saying the voluntary regime has proven ineffective.
