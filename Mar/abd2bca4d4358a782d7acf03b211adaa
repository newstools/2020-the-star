The International Women’s Day this year saw Coast women trailblazers converge at the Sarova Whitesands Hotel to share their journey stories with girl students and other women. A luncheon, called 'Ladies' Baraza', brought together over 100 women and students from six schools at the Coast. The women in business inspired the young girls during the half-a-day forum, whose theme was, 'Breaking barriers. Equality is not a women’s issue; it is a business issue.' Speakers during the forum included Tristar Properties founder Leila Awale, Mpower Limited MD Janet Katisya, Waridi Fashions founder Kokie Rading and Touch by Laura Saloon owner Laura Wakio. Media personality Sheila Mwanyigha was the Master of Ceremony.
