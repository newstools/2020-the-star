Kaloleni NG-CDF has saved more than 5,000 students in various institutions from dropping outdue to lack of school fees. Some had failed to report school after the mid-term break. Most of them are students who joined Form 1 due to the 100 per cent directive. But the National Government Constituency Development Fund released bursaries worth Sh33.3 million on Friday. Speaking while presiding over the issuance of the bursaries at Gotani trading centre, Kaloleni MP Paul Katana warned school principals against sending students home for lack of fees. Katana said the burden of paying fees falls on parents and teachers, not the students. “It is sad to see students being sent home to collect fees when the teacher can summon the parents to discuss while the student keeps learning. For us to get quality grades, the teacher and the students need to have ample time together,” Katana said. The MP said the number of the beneficiaries has this year increased by about 1,800 students due to the 100 per cent transition. Last year, the Kaloleni NG-CDF gave out bursaries worth Sh23 million. Mariakani MCA Frank Kimosho defended the principals saying the 100 per cent transition has made many parents neglect their children and fee matters after admission. “They promise to bring fees but they never go back to school. How do you expect the principal to feed the students who have not paid fees? Parents should be responsible and make sure they honour the pledges they make to the school heads,” Kimosho said. Most of the parents expected to take their children to school using the Kilifi County Ward Scholarship Fund but the funds delayed. The bursary came as a relief and most parents who attended the meeting in large numbers to confirm if their children would benefit. Edited by R.Wamochie
