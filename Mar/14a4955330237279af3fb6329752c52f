Veteran media personality Fred Obachi Machokaa has encouraged rhumba music lovers to continue enjoying the great songs Congolese Soukous singer Aurlus Mabélé has left for them. Famous as the 'King of Soukous', Mabélé died on Thursday last week at the age of aged 67 years. According to a tweet by his daughter, French singer Liza Monet, her father had died of coronavirus. "I am inconsolable," she wrote. Speaking to Word Is, Fred sent condolences to his entire family and also his fans. "It is a sad day to the family and all other fans in general coz that was a respected person in the industry, especially Soukous music lovers," he said. Fred said the icon has been ailing for a very long time. "We have been praying he will recover but this coronavirus does not seem to be sparing people," he said. On the memories, Fred said all his songs were hits. "'Embargo' is one of the songs that will continue to resonate with the Soukous lovers for a long time. He is a musician who came into the industry when people used to sings by starting with a small tempo but that changed." Kenyans got a chance to watch him live in 1991. He was backed by his new solo guitarist Dally Kimoko, Jean Baron and then-drummer Awilo Longomba. "When he came to Kenya and I hosted him at the KICC. It was immediately after the inaugural Kanda Bongoman tour. That was a musician and a half and it is a pity he has rested," Fred said. Fred then encouraged people to observe all the guidelines given to prevent themselves from contacting Covid-19. "Coronavirus is real and therefore let no one assume that it only hit elsewhere," he said.
