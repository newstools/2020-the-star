President Uhuru Kenyatta on Sunday sent senior state officers to Somalia in the latest move signaling a climbdown in tensions between the two countries. The team  of security chiefs led by the Interior CS Fred Matiang'i  will meet Uhuru's Somali counterpart Mohamed Abdullahi Farmaajo to iron out issues over an alleged border intrusion. The move comes amid tension between the two countries on its border points in Mandera. The delegation led by Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang'i left for Mogadishu following a week that saw the Somalia National Army battle Jubbaland forces in Bula Hawa near Mandera County. The fighting by forces traditionally united against Al-Shabaab militants saw Kenya and Somalia accuse each other of territorial integrity violations. Last week Mandera residents were forced to flee after fierce clashes erupted between Somalia troops and Jubaland forces in Bulla Hawa. Heavy gunfire and explosions coupled with black smoke could be seen emanating in Bulla Hawa in Somalia which borders Mandera town. On Wednesday, Uhuru warned Somalia from provoking Kenya. Uhuru said the Somali soldiers bridged international laws and conventions engaged in aggressive and belligerent activities by harassing and destroying properties of Kenyan citizens living in the border town of ".. the foreign soldiers in flagrant breach and total disregard of international laws and conventions engaged in aggressive and belligerent activities by harassing and destroying properties of Kenyan citizens living in the border town of Mandera," Uhuru said on Wednesday. Uhuru asked Somalia to stop the smear campaign and commit the energy to deliver leadership and prosperity to its people. After a series of blame games from the two sides, The US and Ethiopia mounted pressure on Somalia to deescalate the tension. The pressure saw Uhuru and Farmajo speak on phone on Thursday announcing that committees would be formed to discuss border security.
