Police have extended the search for those who attacked and injured the directors of Utheri Wa Lari farm near Mai Mahu SGR station. They plan to also cover Kajiado and Narok counties. Phone records indicate that the prime suspects in the attacks could have fled to neighbouring counties. They injured the three directors and damaged their car. Two weeks ago, a group of youths raided the vast farm located near Mai Mahiu SGR station, destroyed a fence, before attacking the trio. For years, the owners of the land and herders have clashed over ownership of the 22,000 acres, despite the court handing it to the directors. Naivasha OCPD Samuel Waweru confirmed that they were still tracking the suspects. "We are still following the suspects some of whom escaped to Magadi and Narok and we are optimistic we shall get them," he said. Meanwhile, police in Naivasha are investigating a bizarre incident in which a 45-year-old man has been missing for the past week while on a business trip. Also missing is a family truck that the man used to collect firewood from Longonot area before he disappeared under unclear circumstances. His family has been receiving calls demanding ransom. A resident said the driver was hired last week to collect the firewood from Longonot and ferry it to Kinangop, Nyandarua. He said he accompanied two men but hours later he had not returned from his journey and his mobile phone had been switched off. "A day later, some people kept making calls to the family members seeking cash so the man and the lorry could be released," he said. Waweru said DCI officers were following up the case. "The incident was reported a week ago, but the man and the truck have not been recovered. It’s a matter of time before we get those involved,” he said.
