Governor Martin Wambora has denied that he was duped into signing into law high licence fees that have caused an uproar among residents. Ward representatives had alleged that he may have been hoodwinked into assenting to a bogus Finance Bill that they had not passed. But Wambora said he assented to the bill that the ward representatives had passed. Wambora said the county executive does not make laws but only implements what the county assembly passes. “They put very high figures and residents are up in arms against them. They are looking for a scapegoat, but they will not succeed. They have to go back and revise the bill. We are implementing what they passed,” the county chief said. The county assembly has launched a probe to establish whether the governor was tricked into signing the Finance Bill 2019. The investigations were instituted after Finance and Economic Planning Committee chairman Morris Muchiri claimed that dishonest officers within the county government may have unlawfully altered figures in the Embu County Finance Bill 2019, resulting in an unpopular law that overcharges traders. Deputy Speaker Steve Munene said the matter was serious and ordered the Finance Committee to immediately start investigations. He said it was worrying if the county assembly could pass a law and then have a distorted version being put into practice. Muchiri said that most charges had tripled, forcing some traders to close down their businesses. Ruguru Ngandori MCA Muturi demanded that collection of revenue be stopped until the investigations are complete and corrections are made on the Finance Act. Edited by A. Ndung'u
