The government will not publish the findings of an inquiry into a stampede at Kakamega Primary School where 15 pupils died, Education CS Goerge Magoha has said. Magoha said Friday that public disclosure of the multi-agency report on the February 4 disaster was not a priority at the moment. “Now you want to take me where I don't want to go. Have you read the Constitution?  There will be a report that will be made public when appropriate,”  the CS told journalists. The remark was contrary to Magoha's announcement on February 4 that a report on the cause of the stampede would be made public in three days. Families of the victims have been demanding information on the cause of the stampede. “We're now beginning to doubt if there was an investigation as to what triggered the stampede. No one is telling us what caused the deaths of our children,” Lavender Andeso whose child died in the stampede said. Police have yet to release information on the cause of the deaths, a month later. Magoha made a surprise visit to the school Friday and directed the administration to connect the block to electricity to ensure the staircase is lit up He said he was on a working tour of the school to asses the progress in the adoption of safety measures for pupils. “This building is one of the best in our public schools. The staircase is big enough to accommodate two groups of students in files,” he said. The probe team comprised officials from the Ministry of Education, the National Construction Authority, the Disaster Committee and the Directorate of Criminal Investigations. The CS said that though he empathises with families who lost their loved ones in the disaster, the school should be allowed to move on. “Right now my business is to know the safety of children in school,” he said.
