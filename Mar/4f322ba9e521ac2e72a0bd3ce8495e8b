Some Lamu MCAs have asked officials in the county health sector to resign to make way for more competent officials. Led by Salim Busaidy, who is a member of the Health committee, the MCAs on Friday said they receive numerous reports about the deplorable state of the health sector and how resident suffer for poor services or lack of services. The MCAs asked Health CEC Anne Gathoni and other senior officials to resign for failing to run the sector as required. “The state of the sector is pathetic and to think that we allocated a whole Sh900 million is serious. The ambulances are not working, the hospitals have no drugs. Now we are told people are stealing drugs and that’s why there are shortages. We want the CEC for Health and others to resign and end this insanity,” Busaidy said. Gathoni had appeared before the county Health committee where she admitted there was a serious drug shortage in county health facilities. The CEC, however, blamed it on the theft of drugs and supplied by medical and subordinate staff at the facilities. The culprits then sell the drugs outside the facilities, she said. Despite having received the largest allocation of Sh900 million in 2019-20, the Health sector in Lamu has come under intense criticism owing to the deplorable state of hospitals and facilities. Residents raised concern this year over the poor state of most facilities including the lack of basic drugs and other simple services with the majority of patients being referred outside the county. The Health CEC, however, said investigations have commenced to establish the people behind the crimes and take legal action on them. Gathonisaidformer medical workers who had been found culpable for stealing drugs had been fired promptly. “There is a serious shortage of drugs in our hospitals and we are aware some medical and subordinate staff are involved and we are working on finding them out,” the CEC said.
