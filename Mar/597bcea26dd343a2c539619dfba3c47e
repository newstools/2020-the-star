In a bid to ensure that Harambee Stars players get maximum fan support, Football Kenya Federation yesterday waived the gate charges for the forthcoming 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier match. Stars will host Comoros on March 25 at the Moi Stadium, Kasarani in their third match of the qualifying campaign. The federation entered into an Sh3 million deal with betting firm, Betika which will see fans follow the proceedings from the terraces free of charge. This will not be the first time the federation is waiving the gate charges as they allowed fans to access the 60 000-seater capacity stadium free of charge during a 2019 Afcon qualifier match against Ethiopia in October 2018. Stars won the match 3-0 courtesy of Michael Olunga, Erick Johanna and Victor Wanyama’s goals “We are absolutely thrilled to support Stars. We believe today’s announcement comes at an opportune time when our team needs all the support it can to further cement their chances of qualifying for the 2021 Afcon tournament,” said Betika’s head of business, John Mbatiah. “As a Kenyan home-grown company, we are fully committed to supporting the wholesome development of Kenyan football at different levels and that is why we have covered the cost of matchday tickets. We share in FKF’s aspirations of filling the stadium and getting the fans engaged with this great sport while bringing the best in everyone, which is at the very core of everything we are about." FKF president Nick Mwendwa underscored the significance of the match and lauded the firm for coming on board. Stars launched their bid to book a place in the finals set for Cameroon with successive draws against Egypt and Togo. Betika sponsors the National Super League. “The match against Comoros is very important for us and Betika’s decision to partner with us is timely. We urge Kenyans to show up in large numbers and support Stars, as we endeavour to consecutively qualify for the Afcon tournament,” said the federation boss.
