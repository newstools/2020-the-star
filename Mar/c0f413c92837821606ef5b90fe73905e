Cotu has asked employers to provide workers with protective gear to keep them from contracting or spreading the novel coronavirus. In a statement to newsrooms on Tuesday, Central Organisation of Trade Unions secretary general Francis Atwoli said the safety of employees was paramount and needed to be safeguarded. “As employers write memos to their staff instructing them to work from home, it is important to note that workers are now transforming a home into a workplace. This means that workplace safety standards must be applied," he said. "Employers must commit that in case of any injuries and diseases arising out of or in the course of work, the employer shall have to take responsibility.” Atwoli said Cotu will do everything possible to ensure workers remain safe. "The government and employers must avoid occupational hazards such as lack of proper personal protective equipment, poor infrastructure and any other condition that is likely to increase the spread of the coronavirus,” he said. Atwoli called for the implementation of the Safety Act of 2007 at workplaces. “Even in this tough time, Cotu still champions the rights of workers through social dialogue with tripartite setup and the community as well and pushing for the implementation of Occupation Safety Act of 2007  at workplaces,” he said. “As the umbrella organization for all Kenyan workers, we shall work together with our partners towards ending new infection both at workplaces and at home."
