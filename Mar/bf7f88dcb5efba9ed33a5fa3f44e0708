We are currently living in the times where nobody wants to be associated with the older days as every person claims to be “digital”. As much as we appreciate advancements in technology, we cannot ignore the fact that when it's uncontrolled, it can cause more harm than good to the direct user and people around them as well. This is because many people have become too dependent on technology that they have become slaves to it. We all claim to have gained independence but in the real sense, we are still in bondage – except by a different master. Currently, almost everything has been automated by technology and thus manual labour is no longer required. Technology may have made life easier for us but it has also made us lazy and fools. It has gone to the extent where our social lives have been affected. A group of people may be seated together but none of them can tell what the other is going through because all of them are busy laughing at funny videos on the internet. Many might claim that the problem is only with the younger generation but I beg to disagree. Time has caught up with our parents as well and there no longer exists family gatherings where parents try to understand what their children have been up to. Instead, they have assembled in their houses all glued to their phones and the only time anyone speaks or raises their eyes is when asking for a charger or requesting the Wifi password to please their master. The streets are full of zombies walking around texting and laughing at memes. We can’t avoid change and modernisation but we should make technology and the internet work for us instead of the other way round.  Kabianga University
