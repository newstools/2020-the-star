A Northeastern MP ran into trouble with Speaker Justin Muturi after he approached the chair while whistling. Mandera East’s Omar Mohamed attracted the speaker’s fury over the breach of code.  The MP found himself in unfamiliar territory for some seconds as the speaker dropped the words ‘be warned’, coming at the height of the probe into the trip of Northeastern  MPs to Somalia. His colleagues were overheard laughing at the incident, saying the lawmaker could have been carried away by the favorable ruling by the speaker on their trip. Has Budalangi MP Raphael Wanjala become the sole voice of the boy child both within and outside the 'august' House? Well, the tough-talking lawmaker seems to be fitting well in his new self-designated role which he undertakes with unrivaled zeal and zest. It seems the Speaker of the National Assembly has also recognised his new role. On Thursday when a debate on gender issues was on the floor, the Speaker called him out of nowhere to give his opinion on the issue. And true to expectation, the fiery legislator did not disappoint. He dismantled the proponents of the discussion in a way that left the whole house laughing for hours land cheering him on. A first-term legislator earlier this week shocked members of a committee when she entered the room laughing and 'thanking my God'. Curious about the unusual happiness, a member asked why she was all smiling. The lady said she had received Sh1. 9 million from Parliament to facilitate her travel to the UN Women's meeting in New York. A female legislator punctured her moment of joy with a reminder that the event had been called off. She advised her against spending the cash as Speaker Justin Muturi had already ordered the refund. But the MP said she was broke and she will spend the money and pay later.
