 Businesses at Kenyan beaches in Budalang'i and Funyula in Busia have been disrupted by the closure of the Kenya-Uganda border. President Yoweri Museveni last week ordered the border closed to contain the spread of coronavirus. On Wednesday, fishermen said the closure means they can't cast their fishing nets into deeper waters because Ugandan security officials will arrest them. Beach management unit chairman Stephen Musee said beaches usually attracted about 5,000 traders every day but the closure of markets and gatherings have left them with no business. He asked President Uhuru Kenyatta to liaise with Museveni to identify the maritime boundaries of the two countries so Kenyan fishermen cannot trespass into Ugandaâ€™s territorial waters. BMU secretary Omondi Ndeke said they have ensured all boats have sanitizers in line with the directives issued by the Ministry of Health.
