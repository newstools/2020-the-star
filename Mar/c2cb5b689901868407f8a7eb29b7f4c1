Nairobi residents on Tuesday woke up to a litter-ridden CBD as the county's garbage collectors put down their tools citing poor working conditions. The workers not only failed to empty the trash bins but they were also seen emptying out bins and intentionally dumping and spreading the litter in different parts of town. The angry garbage collectors were seen protesting in different streets demanding their pay. In Agust last year, it was reported that City Hall owes garbage collectors company Sh927 million shillings for the 2018-2019 financial year.
