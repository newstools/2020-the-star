 A hawker who admitted stealing a police officerâ€™s uniform, handcuffs and cash, will be sentenced on March 10. Johnston Ondemo Kikuyu was caught on CCTV camera stealing police constable Maureen Osumba's bag containing the items on January 11. The bag contained Osumba's jacket, uniform, a t-shirt, a certificate of appointment, a whistle, NHIF and ID cards, and Sh3,500, all valued at Sh14,750. The 19-year-old Ondemo admitted the charge. The particulars of the case were that Osumba alighted at Railways Station from Inland Container Depot ICD police station at 5am on January 11 on her way home. She walked into the Home and Away Building on Mfangano Street to answer a call of nature, leaving her bag with security guards. She returned to find her bag missing and reported the incident at Kamukunji police station. A few days later, Ondemo was arrested, but the items were missing. Makadara senior principal magistrate Angelo Kithinji asked for a social services department report before sentencing him next week.
