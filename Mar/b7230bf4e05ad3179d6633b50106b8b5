A one=year-old baby died at Likuyani village, Lugari subcounty, on FridayÂ  after being choked by groundnuts. The mother, Ann James, said she was taking tea when the child picked a groundnut and swallowed it. "The baby's mother stood and went out to pick a cup from the rack so she could give the child porridge when the boy who had put groundnuts in the mouth followed her crying before the chocking occurred," Elizabeth Mateche, who was present, said. The incident comes barely three weeks after a seven-months-old boy from the same area was choked to death by a lollipop candy at Chekalini trading centre. Musembe sublocation assistant chief Richard Etale confirmed the incident. Mateche said they unsuccessfully administered first aid to save his life before they rushed him to Lumakanda County Hospital where he was pronounced dead on arrival. The body was taken to Chebaiywa mortuary in the neighbouring Uasin Gishu county.
