Extreme Sports has suspended their leagues indefinately due to the coronavirus outbreak in the country. In an official communication to the Super 8 clubs, head of operations, Athanas Obala, attributed the suspension to lack of title sponsorship, harsh economic times and the recent global pandemic of coronavirus. The letter stated that the suspension will go on to allow the management to shop for sponsors. “We remain committed to our vision of improving youth’s lives through progressive engagement and we shall endeavour to search for like-minded institutions and individuals.” Further, the message expressed hope to return as it read: “The management team at Extreme Sports Ltd is proud to have sustained this noble initiative for the last 15 years and assures clubs, fans and partners that we shall work hard to keep hope alive and soon return to grassroots activities once the situation improves.” The indefinite hiatus comes after a tenure where the sport management organisation evolved from running one tournament to a 3-tier league.
