Rice farmers in Ahero Irrigation Scheme, Kisumu county, have been advised to stop selling their produce to middlemen. Western Kenya Schemes manager Joel Tanui said farmers should sell rice to the government to cushion them from exploitation and losses because of lack of market. He also urged farmers to form cooperatives for easy management. Many farmers have in the past been exploited by middlemen who pay them peanuts for their produce. “We want our farmers to fully benefit from their products to be able to feed their family and pay school fees for children,” he said. He spoke during the annual general meeting at Ahero Irrigation Scheme in Nyando subcounty. Last year, rice production at the Ahero Irrigation scheme was 25,000 metric tonnes according to Tanui. President Uhuru Kenyatta has ordered government institutions to buy rice from farmers. Tanui said they are following the President’s directive by ensuring that farmers are not exploited. The government is paying Sh85 per kg for Basmati rice with Sh40 per kg for Sindano rice, he said. The prices are expected to increase. Middlemen have been paying between Sh34 and Sh45 per kilogramme of rice, which is way below what the government is offering. Tanui said farmers will be paid within three days after delivering their produce to government mills. The manager said plans are underway to expand the area under rice production within the scheme from 11,000 acres to 16,000 acres.
