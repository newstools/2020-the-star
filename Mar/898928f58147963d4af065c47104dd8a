A Nairobi court has reduced bail terms for former Sports CS Rashid Echesa's four co-accused. Daniele Otieno, Clifford Onyango, Kennedy Mboya and Chrispin Oduor were charged alongside Echesa in relation to Sh39 billion fake military tender. They were released on a Sh 3 million bond and alternative cash bail of Sh 1 million. But on Wednesday they argued in court that the bail terms were too high. Making the ruling, magistrate Kennedy Cheruiyot reviewed the bail to Sh 1.5 million bond and a surety or pay a Sh 200,000 cash bail each. In his ruling, Cheruiyot noted that only Echesa has been able to secure bail while the four have not been able to raise any of the bond or bail that the court granted them. They were also charged with conspiring to commit a felony, making false document, obtaining money by false pretense, attempting to commit felony and uttering false document. They denied the charges.
