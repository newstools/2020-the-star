Wajir Governor Mohamed Abdi has challenged the 2019 Census results in court. He claims that the actual population enumerated in Wajir in 2019 was 1,612,025, not the 781,263 released by Kenya National Bureau of Statistics. This is a difference of 830,762. The governor has sued the KNBS, the National Treasury, the Commission on Revenue Allocation and the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission. Abdi wants the court to bar the National Treasury and the Commission on Revenue Allocation from relying on the gazetted 2019 Census results in determining allocation of resources. He also wants the IEBC restrained from using the results in the delimitation of boundaries. The governor further wants the court to compel the KNBS to grant the county access to their servers to determine the actual results transmitted from all the enumeration areas in Wajir between August 24 and August 3 “The KNBS has previously arbitrarily and unlawfully published and circulated impugned and disputed results which publications have been the subject of three court cases in the superior courts over a period of six years,” the petition reads. The county boss argues that the 2019 Census was distinctly different from the 2009 Census as there was higher public participation and greater public awareness of the relevance of the census to the development, representation and allocation of resources. “KNBS has failed and refused to verify the transmitted results of the affected residents in the enumerated areas of Wajir. In view of the glaring difference between the results published and those transmitted, this is a good case for the court to grant an order of scrutiny for the court to establish the sanctity and credibility of the 2019 Census figures,” the petition reads.
