Bungoma county has assigned chiefs and their assistants to carry out door-to-door awareness on coronavirus. Chiefs will educate residents on the need to wash their hands with soap frequently, avoid handshakes, avoid congestion and other precautions. Bungoma county commissioner Abdi Hassan said assistant chiefs were grassroots leaders as they were in contact with residents. “Chiefs and their assistants play a critical role in helping the government, hence I have directed them to walk house to house to sensitise residents to take care of their hygiene including frequent hand washing to stop contracting coronavirus,” he said. "Covid-19 disease is all about hygiene and I call upon Bungoma residents to embrace it and make sure that they are not infected with this pandemic.” Hassan said the government had tightened security at the borders to make sure no foreigners entered. The county has not yet reported any coronavirus infections. Addressing the press after holding a county security committee meeting, Hassan assured area residents that security at the border was tight. "The main challenge is that many people are not washing hands every time as per the precautions given by health officers,” he said. Hassan said the county has set up another isolation ward at Malakisi hospital in case the infection spreads to the county. He lauded the county government of Bungoma for partnering with the national government to fight the pandemic. Edited by Henry Makori
