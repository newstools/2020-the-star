Manufacturers have raised concern over the harassment and brutalization, by some law enforcement officers, of Essential Service Providers, in the enforcement of the 7 pm to 5 am curfew. In a statement, the Kenya Association of Manufacturers (KAM) said the harassment and brutality by law enforcement officers on essential service producers go against the government’s efforts to ensure that there is a continuous supply of food and basic products to all Kenyans at this critical time. ''We would like to urgently appeal to the National Security Advisory Council o work together with Essential Service Providers, under the protocols and guidelines agreed upon for the sake of getting our country through this difficult period,’’ KAM chairman Sachem Gudka said. He said that many businesses are now hesitant to continue their operations as directed, and this could cause supply chain disruptions and shortages. On Saturday, the manufacturers lobby together with the Kenya Private Sector Alliance (Kepsa) met with the Inspector General of Police, as well as the COVID-19 Multi-Agency Planning Team, to agree on protocols which would guide both law enforcers and producers to avoid disruption of production. After the meeting, they agreed that where possible, manufacturers should organize production shifts such that there is little or no worker movement during the curfew period. They also agreed that all employees to be issued with staff identification documents (IDs), which cannot be forged. For the police, o identify vehicles belonging to companies that provide essential services, drivers and turn boys will have to produce identification cards or letters from their employer. KAM said further mechanisms to identify vehicles traveling during the curfew period are being developed.
