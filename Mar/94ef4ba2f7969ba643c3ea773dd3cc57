MANUEL ODENY/  Police in Migori on Sunday evening gunned down two suspects in a foiled robbery attempt. Four other suspects escaped with gunshot wounds. A police officer also sustained a gunshot wound. According to the police, an AK47 rifle, 16 bullets, a home-made gun and other crude weapons were recovered. Suna East police boss Stanley Atavachi said the gang of six tried to rob Allaxis Hotel in Migori town but detectives who were on patrol swung into action. “Police confronted them, and they refused to surrender. We are working on identifying the two and have launched a manhunt for the rest,” Atavachi said. Director of Criminal Investigation through their Twitter handle @DCI_Kenya posted, “The six were challenged to surrender but instead fired at the detectives. During the shoot-out, two suspects were fatally injured but the rest escaped with gunshot wounds.” But witnesses claimed one suspect was cornered by police and shot at close range. “I came and I stood here (at the scene) and some people told us to keep our heads down. They forced one suspect to lie down,” a witness claimed. He said shortly after, police placed a gun at the back of the suspect’s head, told people around to close their eyes before shooting the suspect. “He counted to three and shot the man. They were three, one escaped,” the witnessed said. Revellers at the hotel scampered to safety. Atavachi said police will increase patrols but did not comment on the claims that one suspect might have been shot while lying down. Pursuit for the escaped suspects is ongoing.
