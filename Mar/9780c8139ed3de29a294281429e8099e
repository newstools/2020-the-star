A boda boda rider who knocked down a pedestrian along John Osogo Road on Friday got a reprieve after a Makadara court freed him on a Sh10,000 cash bail. Court documents say Alvin Odhiambo knocked down Gladys Njeri on March 18 while riding dangerously in Dandora, Kamukunji subcounty. Njeri sustained serious injuries on both hands and was rushed to Mama Lucy hospital where she was treated and discharged. Corporal David Kanyua of Dandora police station sought to detain Odhiambo in Police custody for 14 days pending investigations. In an affidavit filed before Makadara senior resident magistrate Lewis Gatheru, Kanyua said that he needed time to trace the motorcycle after the owner escaped with it to an unknown destination. "Your honour the respondent is a flight risk and if released he might disappear. I am also yet to record witness statement and filing of the victim's P3 form," he said. Gatheru said that being a traffic offence it won't be necessary to detain the suspect that long. The matter will be mentioned on April 24
