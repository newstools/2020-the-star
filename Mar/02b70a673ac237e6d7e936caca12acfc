Fresh from winning the best midfielder award in the Alanya Women's Gold Cup tournament, Harambee Starlets midfielder Sheryl Angach said there is still room for improvement. Angach wants to build on her endurance and improve her ball distribution stats. "I played against better teams and I discovered that my capacity to play the entire match needs to be worked on. Great players do well throughout. I also feel that I have to press for the ball, retain possession and feed the attack on a regular basis," she said. The Gaspo Youth playerÂ  believes in order to be an all-rounded player, her work rate, fitness, stamina, composure and technical ability have to be a notch higher. She hinted on remaining level-headed as she seeks to achieve her objectives. "To be recognised for top performance is great but I am not ready to settle for plaudits. I am not the refined article yet and I believe in remaining grounded to fulfil my ambitions. Tackling, passing, holding the ball and making the right decisions in crucial moments will be vital as well," explained the central midfielder who has made the position both at the club and national level her own. Her performance was worthy of praise from coach David Ouma who said it was a step in the right direction. The diminutive player said the team's performance was a wake-up call but reserved praise for the new players who were part of the team to the Turkish tourney. Kenya beat Northern Ireland 2-0 in the opening match before losing 5-0 to Chile and 3-1 to Ghana Black Queens. "It was a learning curve for everyone and the new lads did well. It is now a matter of training hard in readiness for the African Women's Cup of Nations qualifiers.
