Former world cross country champion Irene Cheptai will be seeking her first international title after maternity leave when she lines up at the Prague Half Marathon later this month. Cheptai, who won the 4th edition of Maria Soti cross country last weekend in Elgeyo Marakwet, said her plan was to run well in local races as part of her build-up for the upcoming races that include the Prague. “I used the Maria Soti race as part of my speed work and endurance ahead of  Prague. This will be my first international race this year and I am hoping for good results,” said Cheptai. After Prague, she said she will be seeking to make a cut in the  Team Kenya to the Tokyo Olympics during the national trials in June. “I want to gain a slot into the team ahead of the Olympic Games. It has been a while since I represented my country in major races and this year, I want to show the world of what I am made of,” said Cheptai. She said she will be competing in 5,000m because she has been consistent in the race especially on the local front where she has won a few races.
