Agriculture CS Peter Munya has said the government will clear locusts in the country by June this year. Munya said the government had a good road map that will ensure all locusts are wiped out before the planting season begins this year. He added that the locusts access the country on different days and time taking different routes. “The smallest locusts are in 40 million but we are in control of what is happening within our country,” the CS said. “It was not technically easy to clear them because they came from a large country but we dealt with the situation and managed to protect the food basket," Munya said. “We got people and trained personnel, NYS, county and national government officials who are working every day as per our road-map to clear all the locusts in the country,” “We are also increasing the number of helicopters we require up to 20." The CS was addressing journalists on Monday at the Ministry of Trade headquarters when he handed over the Trade docket to Betty Maina. Munya took over the Agriculture docket following President Uhuru Kenyatta’s cabinet reshuffle in January that saw Mwangi Kiunjuri axed from the ministry. "We ensured the first invasion, which was in hundreds of thousands was sprayed. Unfortunately, when you spray they split and others ran away," he said. He said the government was focused on those which survived and laid eggs. “Kitui and Tharaka Nithi were much affected with many hatching more eggs," he said. He noted that the government was looking at new arrivals and the first generation, which are being hatched in the country.
