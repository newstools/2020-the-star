Kenya Ports Authority managing director Daniel Manduku has resigned. Manduku tendered his resignation on Thursday evening in a letter to Transport CS James Macharia. Pressure has been piling on the besieged MD for the last couple of months and he was fighting several graft-related charges. Sources confirmed that a board meeting was on Friday morning in progress after Manduku’s letter which came as a surprise. Some indicated that the letter, which was drafted late in the evening, was because Manduku had gotten wind that disciplinary action was to be taken against him. “I write to communicate formally a decision which I have reached after deep introspection and lengthy consultation. As you know, it has been both an honour and a privilege to serve as the head of the most vital installation,” he said in the letter. Most of his staff were, however, by morning unaware of the development. His resignation is to commence effective June 1, but he has proceeded on terminal leave until then. He did not state why he was resigning but sources said pressure had piled up on him, especially after he recently faced 11 graft charges in relation to the unlawfully awarding of tenders for the construction of cargo storage facilities at the Nairobi Inland Container Depot. “I shall be eternally grateful for the support of all the outstanding individuals who have contributed to what we have achieved over the last few years and to you in particular for your leadership and vision,” he added. Manduku was appointed to the helm of KPA since 2018 May, after his predecessor Catherine Mturi. He becomes among the shortest serving MD at the parastatal. Edited by A.N
