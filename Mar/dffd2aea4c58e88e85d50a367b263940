Kenyans should observe brotherhood as an effective measure to curb coronavirus. The welfare of Kenyans has hit its lowest ebb and the state is in turmoil after several cases of Covid-19 were reported in the country. While President Uhuru Kenyatta and county governments have issued a raft of measures to contain the spread of the deadly coronavirus, it is high time Kenyans adopted a mentality of capitalism and government intervention and embrace collectivism which indeed will curb the virus. This is mainly applicable to those that are well off to the less advantaged. A flicker of kindness has been seen when some landlords have lowered rents giving the tenants an opportunity and the priority of their safety through affordable rent whereas, in public service vehicles, passengers are provided with sanitiser before they board. However, hand sanitisers are not ample in supermarkets as they have run out of stock after Kenyans panic-shopped all the items said to help prevent infection. Shopkeepers should not hike the prices of the items because their demand has risen. We are all connected as a community, so hoarding the items or making it difficult to access them affects all of us.
