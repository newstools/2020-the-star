Mombasa MCAs want a policy to guide contractors on jobs for unskilled labourers. Deputy speaker Fadhili Mwalimu tabled the motion. “Most youths in the county remain unemployed because oftentimes contractors do not engage local youths and instead employ labourers from other counties,” deputy speaker Fadhili Mwalimu says in a motion he tabled this week. The motion demands that contractors should always give county youths the first job opportunities. “Our youths do not have jobs. All the youths employed in the Dongo Kundu project are from the neighbouring county. Youths from Shika Adabu were not given the opportunity, yet the project is in their area,” Shika Adabu MCA Mwalimu Mgwisho said. Chief whip Wambua Junior said the assembly was not notified of contractors coming to the region and youths have a hard time getting jobs. “If we do not consider young people when an opportunity comes, we will be in trouble. Unemployment is a big problem. Our youths are idle and this motion should be implemented,” Hamida Noor (nominated) said. Private companies are supposed to give 70 per cent of jobs to local youths. Amriya Juma, another nominated MCA, accused most contractors of mischief. They do not want to employ the local youths because they have their own cheap labourers. Kadzandani rep Francis Nzai told his colleagues to ensure contractors gave jobs to youths in their wards.
