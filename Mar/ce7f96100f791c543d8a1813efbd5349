Kenya Airways is offering free one-way tickets to Kenya from New York as the clock ticks towards the suspension of international flights on Wednesday. "As our last flight departs JFK today, we are offering one-way complimentary tickets to Nairobi," KQ said on Tuesday. A ticket from JFK to Nairobi would ordinarily cost Sh98,825. The airline told those in need to contact their team on +1(866)5369224 for more information. "All passengers will be subjected to entry/screening procedures instituted by the MOH," the airline noted. "We shall definitely rise again, we look forward to having you on board when we resume operations. Keep safe!" On Monday, Kenya Airways "temporarily suspended" all international services effective midnight March 25. This is in line with the government directive to suspend all international flights effective Wednesday night as announced by Health CS Mutahi Kagwe on Sunday. The announcement came as eight new cases of Covid-19 were confirmed in the country, taking the total number of cases to 15. On Monday, another case was confirmed in Kenya, bringing the Covid-19 cases to 16. The move comes barely five days after the national carrier said it had been forced to reduce its network by over 70 per cent and it had become increasingly difficult to continue offering international passenger services. The national carrier announced unpaid leave for some of its staff beginning April 1 with the management team taking a 75 per cent pay cut, while CEO Allan Kilavuka agreed to an 80 per cent pay cut.
