It is no longer Building bridges but building competition, Former Kiambu governor William Kabogo has said. Kabogo who was responding to ODM party leader Raila Odinga through a tweet on Sunday said the theme for reconciliation has changed drastically. "Baba, this are not as rosy as people would want you to believe...the theme for the “leaders”changed from the building bridges meant by you and your brother," he said. Kabogo told Raila to ask those so called organizers more so governors to do train shows in their counties. "...then you’ll know the real position on the ground. It’s now competition as to who will become the Mt. Kenya leader after president Uhuru Kenyatta," he said. "No one will force a leader on us, take that to the Bank. “Vitu kwa ground ni different.” The former Kiambu boss took a swipe at Meru governor Kiraitu Murungi, Kirinyaga governor Anne Waiguru over the mess. "..you should take responsibility for this mess. Shame on you folks. Do rallies in your counties and asses your ground. You may end up quitting," he said. The Mt Kenya region on Saturday presented a 10-point demand to the Building Bridges Initiative task force. Nyandarua Governor Francis Kimemia read the resolutions during a BBI rally at Kinoru Stadium in Meru. Kimemia is the chairman of the Mt Kenya governors' caucus.
