A six-month jail term imposed on Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho for contempt of court has been set aside. Joho was committed to a civil jail term for violating court orders by demolishing a multi-million property owned by tycoon Ashok Doshi in Changamwe. The governor, who was expected to appear in court on Tuesday to defend himself, filed an application praying that the sentence the set aside. The application will be heard on March 11. High Court judge Silas Munyao on Tuesday said the court would grant the governor an opportunity to argue his application. Doshi had filed a suit in court seeking to have Joho arrested and committed to jail for six months over contempt of court. Doshi's lawyer Willis Oluga said that on March 6, 2019, Justice Ann Omollo granted orders stopping the county government of Mombasa from interfering with the suit through a consent written by him and county government lawyers. But Joho accused Doshi of grabbing the land, which he claims belongs to Changamwe Secondary School, and promised to repossess it. Joho then revoked the allotment that he claims the former Municipal Council of Mombasa allocated to Turf Developers Limited, who was the original owners of the land before Doshi bought it.
