The government will continue supporting residents of Budalangi constituency whose houses and farms were destroyed by the backflow of Lake Victoria, Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa has said. Addressing the flood victims at Siagonj Stadium in Bunyala South where he issued relief food, Wamalwa said the national government will use everything at its disposal to find a permanent solution to the menace in flood-prone Bunyala South. He said the dredger still in Kisumu county will be taken to Budalang'i to dredge the lake and curb the backflow of water which has hurt business premises at Maumau trading centre. The devolution CS said the World Bank-funded Lower Nzoia irrigation project had delayed because the National Land Commission had not completed compensating people whose land was affected. The project had been intended to provide a permanent solution to persistent flooding in Budalang'i constituency. "I am urging the NLC to speed up the compensation process of the people whose lands have been affected so as to pave the way for its completion." MP Raphael Wanjala appealed to the national government to consider allocating Sh100 million to facilitate the construction of toilets in 30 schools damaged by the backflow. He expressed concerns that unless urgent action was taken to construct new toilets, learners would be exposed to cholera and other waterborne diseases. The most affected is Musoma ACK Secondary where learning had been halted since the entire school compound is flooded. However, the 305 learners have, in the meantime, been transferred to Sango Teachers Training College in Lugare which is not occupied. The distributed relief food included rice, beans and baby porridge flour among others with Musoma ACK secondary students getting 20 bags of rice and 10 bags of beans. Edited by R.Wamochie
