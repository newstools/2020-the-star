A fourth-year Mount Kenya University student on Monday afternoon jumped to his death from the 7th floor of institution's Chancellor's Tower. The student who was pursuing a bachelors degree in Agriculture and Rural Development suffered severe head and leg injuries, according to Thika West sub-county deputy police commander Daniel Kitavi. Kitavi who briefed the press in his office said the male student succumbed to his injuries while undergoing treatment at Thika Level 5 Hospital where he was rushed. “We received the information around 2pm and our officers rushed to the scene. The student was rushed to the hospital but passed on while receiving emergency treatment. He had suffered severe injuries,” Kitavi said. He said the matter was under investigation to establish what made the student take his own life. “We suspect it was a case of depression although there was no suicide note left. We are probing the matter to ascertain the reason why the student jumped to his death,” he said. Some of the students who spoke to journalists on condition of anonymity said the student seemed depressed and at one point had told his colleagues that he would take his own life. “He had revealed his intentions to his classmates but we think they thought he was just joking only for him to jump to his death today. The incident has shocked us,” one of the students said. Kitavi called on students consult and seek help from their parents, elders or counselors when they have issues affecting them instead taking their own lives or inflicting grevious injuries on themselves. “Students who might be undergoing serious depression or are affected by any other issues should seek help from their elders, mentors or counselors so that they can be assisted to overcome their situations and get a solution. We wouldn’t want to witness another incident similar to today's,” he said.
