Cashiers at Embu Level 5 Hospital are demanding cash and rejecting cashless payments, exposing residents to coronavirus. Embu deputy speaker Steve Munene said cashiers at the outpatient department in particular have been rejecting cashless payments. Hospital CEO Daniel Mugendi was not available for comment as he was in theatre.Â  But Health chief officer Grace Muriithi termed the allegation untrue. She said hospitals have been encouraging cashless payments as directed by the national government. Muriithi accued the MCA of trying to earn political mileage by making a baseless allegation. The Health ministry has advised Kenyans to make use of cashless payment as much as possible to prevent the spread of coronavirus. Money has been identified as one way the virus is transmitted as it is handled by many people. Munene was speaking during a special sitting on Friday. The Runyenjes Central MCA urged the authorities to intervene. County assembly Health committee chairman Muturi Mwombo urged residents to observe the measures recommended by the national government to prevent the spread of Covid-19. The Ruguru-Ngandori MCA said the measures are not meant to oppress the public but to keep them safe. One measure put in place is a 7pm-5am curfew that started last Friday. Budget and Appropriations committee chairman Harrison Mwaluko (Mwea ward rep) supported the curfew and proposed a total lockdown if citizens defy the order. The assembly allocated the executive Sh22 million for the emergency kitty to fight the virus. Mwaluko said the amount is a drop in the ocean but a step in the right direction. Muminji MCA Newton Kariuki urged the national government to be realistic in fighting coronavirus, saying reducing VAT and imposing of a curfew will not directly benefit the ordinary mwananchi. He said small-scale traders need to be cushioned against the negative effects of the outbreak to the economy through expansion of trade opportunities. Edited by Josephine M. Mayuya
