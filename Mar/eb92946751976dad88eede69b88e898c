The government will onduct a drill on Covid-19 preparedness on Sunday at Mbagathi County Hospital at 11am. The drill is intended to test the preparedness of Nairobi residents when a patient is brought to the isolation ward. “If you hear sirens along the roads, don't panic. It's just a drill,” the CS said in a statement. The country on Friday reported the first coronavirus case. So far, 23 counties have set up emergency isolation centres. Those remaining are expected to do so as soon as possible. All counties have received 5,000 coronavirus protective kits and 14 high-risk counties have received 10,000 kits from the national government. The kits include face masks, gloves, gowns, shoe covers, head covers, respirators, eye protection, face shields and goggles to be used by health workers. They are Nairobi, Kiambu, Machakos, Kakamega, Kisumu, Busia, Migori, Nakuru, Kajiado, Mombasa, Uasin Gishu, Kilifi, Wajir and Garissa. All are near international borders and entry points. Nairobi is high-risk areas on grounds that it is the region’s biggest commercial hub with the biggest port of entry at JKIA. Mombasa and Kilifi are seaport counties while Nakuru, Machakos and Uasin Gishu are transit counties. Kiambu and Kakamega counties are considered high-risk because they are close Nairobi and Busia, respectively.
