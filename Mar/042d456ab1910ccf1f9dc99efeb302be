There will be no water rationing and disconnections in Bungoma for as long as the coronavirus outbreak persists. Bungoma Deputy Governor Charles Ngome has directed the Nzoia Water and Sewerage Company to ensure residents have enough water to maintain high standards of hygiene. “Nzowasco is fond of rationing or disconnecting water to those who have delayed paying their bills. I am telling the bosses to ask their employees to stop it,” Ngome said. Most Bungoma town estates lack water after Nzowasco disconnected their meters over delayed bills. In other estates, water rationing is the norm. For other estates, water was disconnected during the construction of the Sh1.4 billion Musikoma Junction-Kanduyi dual carriageway project. Peter Masika, a resident of Musikoma, said that they are incurring a lot of expenses in buying water that has gone up toSh20 per 20-litre jerrycan. (edited by o. owino)
