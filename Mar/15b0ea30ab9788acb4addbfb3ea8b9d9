Chief Justice David Maraga and his deputy Philomena Mwilu have agreed to take a 30 per cent pay cut for three months to make a contribution towards mitigating the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. “The Deputy Chief Justice, Lady Justice Philomena Mwilu and myself will take a 30 per cent pay cut for three months," Maraga said in a statement on Friday. He said the other four judges of the Supreme Court  have also agreed to take a 20 per cent pay cut for three months. Maraga has also appealed to other judges to make their contributions in order to help Kenyans in their hour of need. The money raised will be put into direct public interventions to be announced later. The CJ said the Judiciary will continue to monitor the situation and play its part. They join President Uhuru Kenyatta, his deputy William Ruto and the Cabinet Secretaries in taking a voluntary pay cut. National Assembly’s Justin Muturi and his Senate counterpart Ken Lusaka also announced on Thursday they would take pay cuts. The two said they would give away 30 per cent of their salaries for the next three months towards coronavirus emergency response efforts.
