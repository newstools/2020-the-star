Econimic Freedom Party has said the donations collected from the pay cuts taken by various individuals should be used for the right purpose. In a statement seen by the Star, party chairman Isack Abey said that the government should come up with a structured manner of collecting the money and other donations to prevent people with bad intentions from siphoning the donations for their personal gain. "It is not lost on Kenyans that similar good gestures have previously been abused by selfish and rogue officials to benefit themselves," Abey said. He 'lauded President Uhuru Kenyatta's move to donate part of his salary to support the effort to fight the coronavirus pandemic. "It is laudable that county governors and other national leaders have also embraced this good gesture to let go a portion of their pay for the sake of Kenya and to help combat and mitigate spread of Covid-19," he added. The party chairman has further said that with well laid structures for accountability, the money will go a long way in helping in providing sanitisers to millions of Kenyans. The party has urged Kenyans to minimise movement and adhere to all the precautionary measures announced by the government. "Above all wash hands and avoid handshakes. Remember this virus does not move, people move it," he added. The president and his deputy announced an 80 per cent pay cut to support COVID-19 spread prevention measures. National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi and his Senate counterpart Ken Lusaka followed the president's step by donating 30 per cent of their pay. Chief Justice David Maraga and his deputy Philomena Mwilu also took 30 per cent pay cut.
