Yesterday around 40 parliamentarians demanded that Deputy President William Ruto resign. Senator Minority leader James Orengo is leading the drive to have Ruto impeached. Yet there still appears to be insufficient evidence against Ruto. The DCI has not yet identified the murderers of Sergeant Kenei, a security officer in the DP's office. He was allegedly killed to cover up details of a meeting between an Egyptian and an American arms dealer and a fake Kenyan general held in the DP's office in February. If the DCI establishes that Ruto was involved, then it would be time to push for his impeachment. But right now it is premature. The Deputy President is also under fire for allegedly campaigning for the next election and thereby disrespecting the President. Yet all sides are already openly positioning themselves for 2022. In any case, it seems unlikely that Orengo could get the two-thirds majority, 233 votes, in the National Assembly needed to impeach Ruto. There are many critical issues facing Kenya today — locusts, coronavirus, economic slowdown, etc.  So is this the right time for MPs to be pursuing this publicity stunt of impeachment?
