Kenya Catholic Bishops have condemned police officers’ brutality and harassment on members of the public during the first day of enforcement of the presidential directive on a curfew. “We witnessed with shock, as vulnerable members of the society such as women, children and also some critical actors such as journalists and food suppliers being equally harassed by security officers,” The Justice and Peace Commission said that actions by law enforcement officers witnessed across the country, especially in Mombasa were unacceptable. “The brutal acts only add more injury to the people who are already vulnerable, this further exposes the vast majority to the risk of spreading and contracting the virus , including security forces,” CJPC said. The CJPC said human rights should be respected and the rule of law should be respected by the security officers enforcing the curfew. The police officers have been asked to also follow the directives by the government on social distancing when controlling crowds and enforcing laws. Kenyans have been asked to pay attention to the requirement that all must be home between during the curfew time even as they continue with their activities. “This is for our own good and for the good of all those we live with and even encounter in the course of our activities,” CJPC added. It has further asked all employers to also heed to the imposed curfew and ensure they work out plans to safeguard their employees by respecting curfew hours. The commission said there is need to look for options that accommodate every category of Kenyans during this critical period. They said the coronavirus spread will only be defeated through collaboration and adherence to the required measures. “Let us avoid blame games and concentrate more on what can enable us return to our daily routine in the shortest time possible,” CJPC added.
