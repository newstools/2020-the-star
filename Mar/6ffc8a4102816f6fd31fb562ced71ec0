Sauti Sol has cancelled their YouTube concert that was set to go down tomorrow, following the rise of coronavirus cases to 28. The concert was to be a compensation to their fans after they suspended their UK tour that was scheduled to be tomorrow. This is to keep their team safe as well as their friends and families. "Following the cancellation of our UK tour date at Jazz caf√© on the 28th, we were optimistic that we could stream to a Live Concert on Youtube to make up for the disappointment," Sauti Sol posted. "Unfortunately, with the rising cases of Covid-19, we must cancel the YouTube concert scheduled for this Saturday 28th March." Asked how the virus can be transmitted via YouTube, they responded, "Streaming a live performance requires a sizable crew, band and team members. "It would be irresponsible of us to risk their lives and those of their families. We must look out for each other in this unprecedented time." On the bright side, they announced they would drop the second single off their 'Midnight Train' album next week to make the quarantine period entertaining and pleasant. On Sunday, Sauti Sol came together to host a live concert, a move that was meant to encourage Kenyans to stay at home. Fans came out in huge numbers to be part of the live session as many commended the band for the move.
