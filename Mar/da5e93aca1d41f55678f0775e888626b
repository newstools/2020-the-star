St Mary's Mission Hospital has limited the number of visitors to admitted patients to one per patient per visiting session, with effect from March 16, 2020. This is after a Presidential directive was issued on Sunday to limit the number of visitors in hospitals as one way of controlling the spread of Coronavirus. In a statement released on Monday, the hospital said that it has taken measures to ensure, "everyone accessing and leaving the facility uses soap and water to hand wash, is screened and also uses alcohol-based sanitizers provided in all areas within the facility." The hospital said it is also committed to ensuring the safety of its staff, patients, partners and the public at large. "We, therefore, continue to institute strict measures and processes in our facilities. The measures are being instituted in liaison with relevant government agencies to ensure our efforts are standardized and effective," the statement read. The Aga Khan University Hospital in Nairobi on Monday also limited the number of visitors to the wards to only the registered next of kin. In a statement released on Monday, the hospital said that the next of kin will be allowed in for a maximum of 30 minutes. "We are urging patients seeking care at the main hospital and outreach centres to limit the number of people accompanying them to one person where possible. Aga Khan has also increased hand sanitizer gel points across the main hospital and the outreach centres," the hospital said.
