DCI detectives on Monday morning raided the house of the former Sports CS Rashid Echesa in Karen, Nairobi in search of documents relating to the Sh39.5 billion fake arms deal. The sleuths from the Economic Crimes Unit were denied entry into Echesa's premise and after waiting for hours, forced themselves inside the house after climbing the wall. The home is surrounded by an electrified perimeter wall. Echesa, however, protested stating he could not allow them inside his house without his lawyer. His lawyer Brian Khaemba arrived at the scene before the detectives launched a search in the house. Echesa and his co-accused were granted Sh1 million bail on February 17 after denying all the charges against them. They appeared before Senior Principal Magistrate Kennedy Cheruiyot where they were chargedÂ with conspiracy to commit a felony by conspiring to make a document with intent to defraud. The four were given an alternative of paying Sh3 million bond each to secure their freedom. Echesa and three others have been charged with 12 counts in the Sh39.5 billion fake military arms deal. They are also alleged to have obtained Sh11.5 million from Kozlowski Stanley Bruno by purporting that they would award him with a tender to supply military equipment.
