Mothers are giving birth in Mbagathi Hospital general wards after the government converted a 120-bed capacity maternity block into a Covid-19 isolation centre. The Star has established that some share beds because of the shortage of space. County Health executive Hitan Majevdia said the only solution to the situation is to build a new block but added that they have no budget to actualise that. Mbagathi is the biggest county-run facility in the capital. "We are sharing the general ward. There is no dedicated space. This was the dedicated space for maternity. Now we don’t have a dedicated space for maternity," he told the Star. "We have a lot of land parcels. We have to go back to the drawing board. But even if we go back, there is no budget. So either the national government to build us another maternity or we look for one somewhere, I don’t know." Last week, Heath CS Mutahi Kagwe, accompanied by Majevdia and other members of the National Emergency Response Committee on Coronavirus, unveiled the block as isolation for patients diagnosed with the virus. This followed a directive by President Uhuru Kenyatta to the committee to fast-track the setting up of the isolation rooms as part of preparations to combat the deadly virus. Kenya reported its first case on Friday. A 27-year-old Kenyan woman travelling from the US via London tested positive. "This is a global challenge and is not something to lose hope about. I want to assure Kenyans that we're not leaving anything to chance when it comes to our preparedness," Kagwe said. The 120-bed block, built at a cost of Sh200 million, has been serving as the maternity wing for nearly five years. In 2018, however, it was closed for renovations after county engineers recommended it strengthening to ensure the safety of mothers and other occupants. At the time, a fire had also broken out the facility, burning a switch box. The engineers found cracks on walls, poor drainage, sagging beams and below-standard structural elements.
