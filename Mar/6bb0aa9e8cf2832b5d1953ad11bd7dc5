More than 900 households in Salah ward who were displaced by floods late last year and are yet to return received Sh5.2 million transfers for relief. The funds were donated by Oxfam and implemented by Arid Lands Development Focus under the Tana River Floods Response Programme 2018-2020. Speaking in Sombo, ALDEF programme officer Mohamud Ali said the cash donation was the last phase of the programme under which over 1,500 households received Sh8.4 million in Madogo ward between January and February. Mororo, where at least 653 households displaced, received Sh3.7 million followed by Ziwani (Sh2.4 million) and Bakuyu (Sh1.6 million). Ali said the majority of those affected in Salah ward were irrigation farmers whose crops were swept away by the floods and are yet to recover. “These are households who are still living in IDP camps to date. We are assisting them with the money to help them pay for medical bills and food, among other necessities,” he said. “We are reviewing how they utilised the funds with a view of starting phase two of the programme.” He said the organisation was also implementing a sanitation programme that includes the construction of pit latrines alongside the cash transfer programme. Beneficiaries who spoke to the Star thanked Oxfam for the donation and urged other well-wishers to come to their aid. Mohamed Ismail said although the funds may not be enough, they will be distributed according to needs, including buying seeds so that they can return to their farms. Edited by Henry Makori
