Bungoma TSC director Ibrahim Adan has blamed the rise in teenage pregnancies among schoolgirls on teachers and parents. He regretted that the county was leading in teenage pregnancy and defilement cases mostly caused by teachers but parents are compromised to hide evidence. Speaking at Musakasa training institute in Bumula constituency, Adan complained that his office was having problems interdicting the culprits for lack of evidence. "We are told that teenage pregnancies and defilement of our girls in this county is mostly done by my teachers but when you come on the ground both the parents and the girls deny," he said. He said the perpetrators went as far as selling their assets including land to compromise parents and the affected child. Adan warned that he would use all mechanisms to ensure parents who are compromised by teachers are arrested. "Many school going girls get pregnant and drop out of learning institutions just because the teacher had compromised the parent with as little as Sh10,000. We are not going to allow that," he said. He said as much as they were blaming teachers the community should also hold the parents responsible for refusing to disclose information. Adan said in cases where they had got evidence they had gone ahead to interdict the affected teachers and others had been jailed.
