Comedian Eric Omondi has urged parents to allow their children to follow their passion as long as they have gone to school. During an interview with Churchill, the father of one said he started comedy while in class five and was the familyâ€™s entertainer. When he got to university, he decided to take it as a full-time job but just like many parents, his late mother was not for the idea after having paid a lot of money for his undergraduate course at Daystar University. Determined to create a name for himself in the industry, Omondi always dreamt big. "I wanted to do stand-up comedy like Churchill, do clips like 'Redukylass' and parodies like Kajairo," he said. He later met Daniel Ndambuki, alias Churchill, who has nurtured many talents at Daystar University, during a career week. "I was the emcee of the event and you [Churchill] took my number na ukaninyima number. Ukasema nitakupigia and you did after two years," he said. "Being the first comedian to be mentored by Churchill, he asked him to use his real name Eric Omondi, and since day one at Churchill Show, he took over the stage," he said. He said his other best moment was when he brought his grandmother to the show before she died.
