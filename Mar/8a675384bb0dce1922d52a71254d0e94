Juventus forward Paulo Dybala, one of the highest-profile players to be infected with the coronavirus, has started training again after recovering from the illness which he said left him struggling for breath. Dybala is one of three players at Juventus who have tested positive for the virus alongside defender Daniele Rugani and midfielder Blaise Matuidi, a World Cup winner with France in 2018. Players at other Serie A clubs have also tested positive. “I’ve had strong symptoms, but I’m much better today,” Dybala, 26, told the Juventus television channel. “Now, I can move and walk and try to work out. A few days ago, when I tried to do those things, I was struggling for breath. My muscles ached.” Football around the world has been brought to a standstill by the pandemic and Serie A has been suspended since March 9. (Writing by Meanwhile, Juventus’ players and manager Maurizio Sarri have agreed to their pay being stopped for four months to save the club an estimated 90m euros (£80.7m) during the coronavirus pandemic. All sport in Italy has been suspended until at least April 3. The Juve squad, which includes Portugal forward Cristiano Ronaldo and Wales midfielder Aaron Ramsey, will not be paid their full salaries in March, April, May and June. They top Serie A by a point from Lazio. Should football resume in the country, which has been the hardest hit by coronavirus in Europe, Juventus will look again at the situation ‘in good faith’. “Juventus would like to thank the players and the coach for their commitment at a difficult time for everyone,” said a statement by the club, champions of Italy for the past eight seasons. Players at other major European clubs, including German sides Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund, have also agreed to take pay cuts.
