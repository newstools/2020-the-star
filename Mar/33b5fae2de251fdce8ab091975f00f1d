A section of MPs drawn from Rift Valley has urged President Uhuru Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto to attend the much-awaited Nakuru BBI rally. The Nakuru BBI rally which was to be held on March 7 was postponed to March 21 by Nakuru Governor Lee Kinyanjui. Speaking on Thursday at the Parliament Buildings, the lawmakers largely allied to Ruto rendered their apologies for failing to attend the meeting called by the county government. The MPs cited that they were attending the Parliament sittings. The majority of them have also lamented the manner in which the invitations were sent out saying that the letters were signed by the unknown person. "We wonder how this person Njenga Mungai accessed the county's letterhead and signed the same to purport to invite us," the team led by Bahati MP Kimani Ngunjiri said. The Nakuru Governor had earlier said that the rally will be used to address the issues affected the 14 counties in the region and warned the attention seekers.
