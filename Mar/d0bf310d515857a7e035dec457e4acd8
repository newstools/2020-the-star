Youthful MCAs across all the 47 counties will undergo leadership training to improve their capacity and effectively carry out their mandates. Kenya Young Parliamentarians Association (KYPA) chairman Sakaja Johnson has unveiled a fellowship programme that will see all young ward representatives in the country trained. Sakaja said the fellowship is a development programme designed to connect and cultivate change makers who are committed to tackling emerging issues in their communities. “Leadership is not about numbers, leadership is about the impact that you have, let no one look down upon you because you are young,” Sakaja said. The Nairobi Senator spoke when he launched the programme at the Westwood Hotel in Westlands, Nairobi, on Friday. More than 50 members of county assemblies and members of KYPA attended. "Young people have changed the world and society. Your leadership must be bigger than you and it must have an impact, it must be genuine," he said. At least 30 young Senators and Members of the National Assembly are currently undergoing a similar programme to enhance their leadership capacity. Some of the youthful legislators undergoing the training are Babu Owino (Embakasi East), Nixon Korir (Langata), Kuria Kimani (Molo), Gideon Keter (nominated), Naisula Lesuuda (Samburu West), Charles Njagua (Starehe), Mohamed Ali (Nyali) and Paul Mwirigi (Igembe South). Others are senators Anwar Loitiptip (Lamu), Aaron Cheruiyot (Kericho) and Samson Cherargei (Nandi).
