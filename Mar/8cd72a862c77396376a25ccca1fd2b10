The Independent, Electoral and Boundaries Commission has maintained it was not formally informed of the exit of former Nairobi Deputy Governor Polycarp Igathe. Chairman Wafula Chebukati in a clarification letter on Friday said Igathe's exit became apparent on January 22 , 2020 after Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko communicated to them on naming a nominee. Chebukati said he received a letter from Governor Mike Sonko nominating a deputy governor indicating there was a vacancy, in compliance with Article 180 (5) of the Constitution 2010. He said if Igathe exited for whatever reason, the commission had no obligation to gazette his exit. "The commission has no legal obligation to gazette the resignation of an outgoing holder of elective office, but rather it has an obligation to gazette a new holder of an elective office,” he said. The county assembly of Nairobi had written to the commission last year seeking advisory opinion on the status of the county after Governor Sonko was barred from accessing his office following his graft case. Responding to the assembly via a letter dated January 9, 2020 IEBC confirmed that they had not received formal communication on the resignation of the Deputy Governor of Nairobi as of that day. “On the vacancy of the Deputy Governor, Nairobi City County, the Commission has not received any formal communication to the alleged vacancy in the office of the Deputy Governor, Nairobi City County other than information in the media,” read the letter.
