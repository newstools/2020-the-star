Oscar-winning actress Lupita Nyong'o says acting helps her face her fears daily. "Every day I go in front of people, there is so much I can control at that moment, and also it is when one can discover so much about themselves," she said in a Q&A with Vogue magazine. On how she manages stage fright, Lupita says she loves having stage frights because it is a reminder that she is facing something new. "That I am gonna risk something and hopefully in the process learn something," she said. Not apologising for existing always helps her cope with the pressure of being in a male-dominated industry. "I am not always strong but I think not apologising for existing helps me and every day is a learning day," she added. Lupita made history as the first Kenyan to win an Oscar for her supporting role in the movie '12 Years a Slave'.
