The Kenya National Private Security Workers Union have threatened to withdraw their members if the government does not give them a safe working environment due to the COVID 19 pandemic. Speaking to Journalists the Secretary-General Isaac Andabwa said more should be done by the state to ensure all Kenyans are protected from exposure including the guards. According to Andabwa as a body, they are in a state of confusion because the guards are not guaranteed a safe working safe environment at the different places that they are working. He says some guards have called him saying that they are exposed where they are working and they are afraid that they might get in contact or be exposed to the virus. "Where those coronavirus patients that passed through at JKIA when they entered the country our guards are there, those guards should also be quarantined," Andabwa said. He insists that they should be screened including every other person that came into contact with the said patients at eh Airport. He has further asked the state to put more control measures at all entry points in the country in order to contain the virus adding that all Kenyans and foreigners entering into Kenya should be quarantined on arrival at JKIA before being allowed to go home.
