A North Rift church has joined in efforts to secure the country from the spread of coronavirus. A circular released by Sirikwa Pentecostal Church in Eldoret on Thursday advised their congregants to adhere to measures set to contain the virus. Senior pastor John Ayieko and chairman Donald Otieno suspended Sunday services and all other scheduled church meetings for three weeks that include home care, training, committee meetings and men's and women's fellowship. “Sunday services will be availed online for members to access through a link that will be sent." Pastors will continue to offer ministerial help but within the government's guidelines but the church will remain open for individual prayers, it read. The church also noted that any burials in the region should be done within 24 hours of the death. “We will follow the direction by the governors in Noreb where 50 people will be allowed to attend the burial. The governors also discouraged home visits during bereavement." However, given the reality during such times, we recommend visitation to strictly be limited to three to five people at a time with absolutely no crowding and strict observance of all hygiene measures recommended by health practitioners," the circular read. The church leadership will continue to monitor the current situation and give updates online to avoid crowding at the church. The leaders backed President Uhuru Kenyatta's declaration of Saturday as a National Prayer Day urging their congregants to pray for the nation. “We encourage members to continue praying and seeking God’s intervention for the country. We also encourage members to join the whole nation this coming Saturday." Noreb chairman Jackson Mandago (Uasin Gishu Governor) had on Wednesday announced the closure of all mortuaries and instructed that burial ceremonies be conducted within 24 hours to compact the spread of the virus.
