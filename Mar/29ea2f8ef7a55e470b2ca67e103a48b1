The first floor of the new four-storey Tigoni Hospital block will be used as an isolation ward for Covid-19 patients, Kiambu Governor James Nyoro has said. It is not clear how many beds will be in the isolation ward. The governor said the 250-bed hospital will be opened next month.Â  The facility was expected to be opened at the beginning of this month, but they discovered it did not have operating theatres. Nyoro said on Saturday they held talks with Health department officials and the contractor agreed to include a male and a female theatre. "This is a big facility and we realised that doctors and nurses will be doing a lot of work but will be forced to take patients elsewhere for surgery while as we have experts," he said. "As you have noticed, the hospital is almost complete but some walls inside have been redesigned. This was because of the theatres we decided to have." Nyoro was accompanied by subcounty medical officer of health Samuel Gitau as well as health department officials to tour the facility. The governor urged the contractor to fast-track the completion of the facility. Edited by A. N
