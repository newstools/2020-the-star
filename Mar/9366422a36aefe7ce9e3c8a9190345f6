Integrated Payments Service Limited (IPSL) has announced that  all PesaLink transactions will be free with immediate effect until 30th June 2020. This is in response to the directive by H.E. President Uhuru Kenyatta where he asked all financial institutions to explore ways to increase mobile money usage to reduce the risk of spreading the COVID-19 virus through the physical handling of cash. IPSL had waived all transaction fees on the PesaLink platform in an effort to lighten the burden for Kenyans during this period as the Coronavirus situation continues to evolve. Speaking about the initiative, PesaLink CEO Agnes Gathaiya said, “As PesaLink we are committed to fighting this pandemic side by side with Kenyans; we have waived all the transaction fees to help alleviate the adverse effects that the still evolving situation surrounding the Coronavirus pandemic might have to Kenyans. "For the next ninety days, Kenyans can send and receive money from home or wherever they are from their phone. We are committed to walk with Kenyans through this season.” PesaLink provides a 24-hour, 7 days a week platform enabling customers to send money from as low as Ksh.10 to as much as Ksh. 999,999 at a fee. The transaction fee varies from bank to bank. The inter-bank money transfer service allows customers to send money from one bank account to another bank account in real time on all banks’ retail payment channels including mobile money, ATM and internet banking. PesaLink creates value for the industry, banks and customers through innovation and interoperability. The platform provides person – to – person and business to business services. “We will continue to monitor the Coronavirus situation and work closely with the government to lessen the economic impact of the pandemic in whatever way we can,” concluded Ms. Gathaiya.
