President Uhuru Kenyatta's former official handle is now in someone else's hands. The account @UKenyatta was deactivated in 2019 to clean up access. State House said then, that the action was taken on all other social media profiles that have been posting on behalf of the President. The Star established that the sentence, "If you are corrupt we will fight you. You can be my brother or my sister or my closest political ally, but if you are corrupt we will fight you,‚Äù was the bone of contention. But on Monday, the Star established that the account was already being used by another user. The account which had over 16.6k followers had postings that do not depict that of a president. "That is a fake account, it is not genuine and we have nothing to do with it," spokesperson Kanze Dena told the Star. Minutes after this was spotted and after the officials were contacted the account changed from 16.6k followers to 468 followers. The user of the account was also following six people, something that changed to three followers only. It was also changed from a parody account to "The fourth President of the Republic of Kenya. Unofficial account. Enforcer of the Big 4 Action Plan."
