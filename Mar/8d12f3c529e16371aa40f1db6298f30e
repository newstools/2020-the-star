The Mashemeji derby set for this Sunday at the Moi Stadium, Kasarani will be curtain raised by the clash pitting Gor Mahia and AFC Leopards' legends. Leopards, who are the hosts squeezed the precursor in a bid to inspire the players to step their input in the pitch. Leopards will be keen to redeem themselves from a 4-1 loss suffered in the first leg. Chairman Dan Shikanda reiterated their readiness to tackle their fellow legends having warmed up for the match in a friendly match against Bunge FC yesterday. Shikanda, who also featured for Gor during his formative years, said he will don in  Leopards' shirt and will aim to serve his former club with bitterness for the minutes he will play. “Before the main match, we will have the legends from either side entertain the fans. Leopards legends have been training for the match and I am looking forward to starting or even to make a cameo. We played Bunge FC yesterday and won and we hope to replicate the same. The match will inspire the players to give one hundred per cent,” he said. Besides the legends match, Ingwe will formally launch their new 61-seater capacity bus. However, Shikanda remained tight-lipped on the guest of honour. The bus was earlier set to be unveiled two weeks ago in Mumias but the club moved the function forward. The former champions were initially pursuing to lure Fifa president Gianni Infantino to grace the match but he elected to attend the Kariokor derby, pitting Yanga and Simba this Sunday at the National Stadium, Dar es Salaam. The two Tanzanian giants played to a two-all draw in the first leg where the Kenyan duo of Francis Kahata and Farouk Shikhalo were handed playing time. Shikanda said they will reveal their guest of honour before the weekends and urged their fans to turn up in large number to drum support for their team.
