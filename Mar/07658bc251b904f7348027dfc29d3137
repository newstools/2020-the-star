The Senior Police Training Institute in Loresho, Nairobi has been handed over to the Directorate of Public Prosecution. The property which was initially used for training officers from both the National Police Service and Directorate of Criminal Investigations, was handed to DPP Noordin Haji by Police IG Hillary Mutyambai, during a brief ceremony at the institution on Wednesday. "The institution was meant for training National police service officers, formerly Kenya Police Service. Both police officers and those from the DCI have been training here," Mutyambai said. The IG said the handing over has been long-awaited having had lots of multiagency meetings for the same. He revealed that the National Police Service had secured an alternative facility in Ngong. The IG said some of the officers will be retained by DPP. "Nobody will move members of staff, DPP is ready to accommodate our team as long as they wish to stay in the compound," he said. "The DPP is willing to remain with some of our staff. We are not disappearing from this institution." The DPP will allocate part of it to NPS for training. Haji said the institution will be used for training both police officers and prosecutors.
