The DCI detectives have arrested a 23-year-old man in Mwingi for publishing misleading and alarming information on Coronavirus. Elijah Muthui Kitonyo will be charged for publishing false information that is calculated to cause panic, contrary to section 23 of the Computer Misuse. According to section 23 of the Computer Misuse, the suspect might be liable to a fine not exceeding Sh5 million or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years or both. The suspect had issued a piece of contrasting information from that of the government about the coronavirus patient. The government spokesman Cyrus Oguna issued a warning to people spreading fake alerts about coronavirus on social media. The Ministry of Health had also issued the same warning after a woman through a viral video claimed that she was not quarantined as the government had said. The lady had dismissed the first case of coronavirus which was confirmed on Friday. The ministry of health and office of the government spokesperson are the only ones to give information about the virus. The government has so confirmed three cases of coronavirus in the country.
