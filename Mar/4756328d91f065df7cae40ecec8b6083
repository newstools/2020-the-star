As workplaces lock down, companies have been forced to operate remotely as much as possible. Smart companies are taking steps to ensure the safety of their employees and the community. But work still needs to be done. Sales need to happen. Opportunities need to be pursued. Service issues need to be resolved. Employees, whether they’re working from home or still in the office, need to collaborate. Limo Sadalla, CEO of Blue Consulting, says that if utilised well, technology could give employees an experience similar to that of the workplace when working remotely. Sadalla said for years many of their clients have under-utilised the capabilities of technology in simplifying jobs. One such innovation that could support work from home is the Customer Relationship Management system (CRM). The system provides a central place where the business can store all customer data (quotations, invoices, addresses, orders, customer queries, emails, SMS, phone calls) accessible and actionable across the company. It is designed to help companies improve their customer relationships, track every customer interaction and provide insights that can transform the business. Sadalla said due to the Covid19, many companies will be forced to re-visit and leverage everything on such systems to ensure sales are pursued, customers are served and employees are productive, even when they’re out of the office. Discipline must be maintained if the technology is to achieve its intentions, Sadalla said. With a cloud and mobile-ready CRM, employees and management can work and collaborate from any location using any device, including their mobiles. (edited by o. owino)
