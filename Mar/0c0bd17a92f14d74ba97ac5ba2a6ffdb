Students and the public can access e-learning materials and digital services at the new ICT centre at the Voi Community Library in Taita Taveta. The centre also allows users to access online courses and jobs. They can work online. Presiding over the launch on Monday, Voi MP Jones Mlolwa said the digital services will help hundreds of youth find jobs. “There are many jobs our youth can do online. We encourage them to use this facility to either read online materials, take online courses or do online jobs,” he said. Mlolwa revealed that the centre will receive desktop computers from the NG-CDF kit. He further handed over 13 laptops to the library for the centre. “The government is rolling out ICT hubs in every constituency. We are among the first regions to benefit from such centres that will improve education." He asked the community to adopt a learning culture, noting that apart from improving learning, the fully stocked community library will empower the community with knowledge. A cultural centre will also be set up in the library where books from Kenyan writers will be stocked, the legislator said. Head librarian Michael Kazungu said they have started outreach programmes to enable library users' clubs at interior schools where they can access books and other reading materials. “The constituency is vast and we want every student to benefit from the community library. We shall be taking books and laptops to interior schools so they can also read and improve their grades,” Kazungu said. He pointed out that selected schools listed in a trial reading programme had shown improvement in their mid-term exams. Kazungu urged students to utilise the library to excel, saying more revision materials had been loaded in the digital devices. Edited by R.Wamochie
