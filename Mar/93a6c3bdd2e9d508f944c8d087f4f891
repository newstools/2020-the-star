A man who jetted into the country from Sweden on Friday has been ordered to self-isolate by Homa Bay health officers. The man landed in Nairobi on Friday before taking another flight to Kisumu on Saturday. He then travelled to Homa Bay by road the same day. He checked into Homa Bay County Referral Hospital on Saturday, where samples were taken and sent to Nairobi for testing before he was released and advised to self-quarantine at his family home in Homa Bay town. Health officers said they are monitoring him closely, though he has not exhibited coronavirus symptoms. Homa Bay Health executive Richard Muga said on Saturday the man is aged between 30 and 40 years. “It’s mandatory that everyone from a foreign country is quarantined. We want our people to observe personal hygiene as a precautionary measure against contracting the disease," Muga said On Saturday, a lobby group in Homa Bay urged the county government to provide residents with clean water. Homa Bay Bunge la Wenye Nchi said there should be no laxity in handling the pandemic. “Let’s not have any weak link in our preparedness to fight Covid-19. The Homa Bay government should provide sanitation facilities at major markets,” speaker of the group, Walter Opiyo, said. Coordinator Okano Nyasanga said they are helping the county government in educating residents on the disease. “We’re telling our people that prevention is better than cure and everybody should maintain the required social distance and personal hygiene,” Nyasanga said.
