Kenyans are indisciplined and difficult people, Health CS Mutahi Kagwe has said. "Kenyans are very indiscipline and it will cost us. We want responsibility among citizens, Keep your kids home..you people of the media need to tell them," he said. Addressing the media on Tuesday, Kagwe said Kenyans have been warned against contracting the disease but they feign ignorance. "It is a grievous mistake. For us to give your child then you go exposing him or her. Then you call us and say serikali saidia.. this is the time you need to saidia yourself not the government..," he said. "Children were not sent for a holiday but for protection. Do not tell us ‘serikali saidia’. It won’t work…" Kagwe warned the 14-seater matatus who carry eight passengers and revert to their usual behaviour when the police are not present. "If we tell you that a matatu should carry eight, do exactly that..when you do it because you can see the police then later when the police are absent, you carry more people, it is sad," he said. "....it is difficult to understand ..are you trying to kill yourself and the people in the matatu.." He said that the government will announce further measures tomorrow. All public gatherings including church crusades, games and even interschool events were suspended. The CS urged Kenyans to remain calm since the government has put in place enough measures to prevent the virus from spreading.
