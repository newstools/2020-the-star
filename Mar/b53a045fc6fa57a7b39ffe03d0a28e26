On-demand courier service Glovo has embarked on a spirited campaign to promote safe home and office deliveries to curb the spread of coronavirus. This, as the government continues to advocate for home stays and work-from-home fomula to reduce human interaction and contact, which is a recipe for the spread of the virus. The firm has implemented a number of measures with the aim of avoiding, as much as reasonably possible, the transmission of the virus between users, distributors, partners and employees. These measures include signatureless delivery, which means means customers will no longer have to sign for orders upon delivery. It has also come up with “no contact” delivery drop-offs which allow customers to request that orders be dropped at a particular place of their choice. “Digital payment is recommended in order to limit direct contact between customers and couriers. Alternative payment methods you can use on Glovo include card or Mpesa,” said Priscilla Muhiu,Head of Marketing and Growth, Africa. For riders, it has ensured regular communication on hygienic and handling of products, temperature checks, sanitizing of delivery bags, handling procedures and placing them on designated surfaces among others. Food, groceries and pharmaceuticals continue to remain leading essential to majority of the population as the government moves to control access and purchases at restaurants, supermarkets and pharmacies. “We are keen to support the collection and delivery of basic necessities such as over the counter pharmacy products or food and groceries,” Muhiu said. Digital technology is expected to help the country cope with social and commercial distruption in the wake of coronavirus. “This means that we will continue to remain active, offering our support and services to deliver these essentials to all citizens for as long as we can do so while operating safely and under the guidelines of the authorities,” Muhiu said.
