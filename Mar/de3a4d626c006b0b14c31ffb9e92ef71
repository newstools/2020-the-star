The owner of the matatu that killed an NTV video editor early March has been charged. Stephen Kirumba Njoroge appeared before magistrate Martha Nanzushi and denied three counts of not adhering to rules by the National Transport and Safety Authority. It is alleged that on March 7, the owner of vehicle KAR 516X allowed the matatu to be driven on a public road without an insurance certificate, causing the death of Raphael Nzioki Mutuku who was crossing the road at the Kenyatta Avenue-Kimathi Street junction. Nzioki was crossing the road at 1.30pm when he was hit. The matatu sped off. Njoroge was also charged with permitting his matatu to operate with some parts not meeting the required standards. The court heard that some seat belts were missing and the windscreen was broken. He is also accused of failing to keep records of his driver who ran away after the accident and is yet to be arrested. Njoroge did not keep records of his driver's name, address and driving licence as required by law, the court was told. He was granted Sh300,000 bond and an alternative Sh100,000 bail.Â The case will be mentioned on April 30 for further directions. The matatu was alleged to have been plying the Kikuyu-Nairobi route under 2KR Sacco but the management told police it is not registered with the Sacco anymore. Njoroge allegedly told the police that he had already sold the matatu claiming he is not the right person to answer for the crime. Edited by R.Wamochie
