MwalimuPlus, an intelligent e-Tutor that provides personalised learning support to primary school children will now offer a 50 per cent discount for all pupils in grades 3, 5, 7 and 8 to access, study and revise via the app for the next 6 months. Those in grades 4 and 6 will access the app for free during the period. Revising Grade 8 students will now be able to access math and Science revision after the app loaded 10 years worth of KCPE papers. The firm said it took these measures to ensure all parents and primary going children will be able to continue with their studies by accessing the app at the most affordable cost during this period. This after the government closed all schools until further notice to curb the global crisis caused by the spread of the Covid-19 virus globally. According to MwalimuPlu CEO Mohamoud Ali, the mode of learning through this app is unique and offers learners more than just basic studying. “The system evaluates learners’ knowledge then proceeds to select suitable learning tasks for them. The platform interactively guides the learners to master the concepts under study,’’ Ali said. He added that parents and teachers are provided with reports that enable them to monitor their child’s progress. It also identifies and corrects areas of weakness by providing more problems to be solved until the required competency is achieved. Launched in 2017, MwalimuPlus is an initiative that aims at ensuring children can learn and study no matter their geographical areas.
