A man charged with killing a driver after robbing him of a tour van will remain in custody until March 23 when his bond application will be determined. Gideon Kariuki Macharia allegedly robbed Tirus Waiyaki Munyua of the Sh3 million vehicle on December 21, 2019, after hiring him to take him to a “church function” in Salgaa, Nakuru. The killing happened on Nairobi–Nakuru highway, a Makadara court was told on Monday. The van belonged to Peter Kariuki Nelson. Principal magistrate Angelo Kithinji was told that Macharia left Kahawa West after informing his boss of a client who wanted to be taken to Nakuru. That was their last communication. His body was found near a school in Ngong. Macharia was arrested in Uganda on December 22 as tried to sell the vehicle.  Munyua’s ID and travel documents were found in the suspect's hotel room. The suspect is also charged with forging Kariuki’s logbook.
