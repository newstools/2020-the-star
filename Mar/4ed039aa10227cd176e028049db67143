A traffic police officer is held at Gigiri police station for soliciting Sh20,000 from a motorist and issuing fake a cash bail receipt. Police constable Mohammed Sirat was arrested at his house along Limuru Road while counting the cash on Wednesday. Police reports indicate Sirat flagged down motorist Michael Kidula near Redhill Junction and accused him of overtaking at an undesignated area. "The officer asked for Sh20,000 bail, which the motorist did not have. He accompanied the motorist to NCBA lobby at Village Market where he withdrew the money and gave it to the police officer," a report from Gigiri police station reads. The officer then issued Kidula with a fake cash bail receipt. It was written, "Not to go to court, forgiven" at the back. The driver became suspicious and reported the matter to Gigiri police station. Gigiri subcounty commanding police officer Richard Muguai said internal disciplinary measures against the officer have started. The officer will appear in court within a week. "We will proceed to Village Market to review CCTV footage of the transaction as part of our evidence," he said. On February 24, IGP Hillary Mutyambai said all the static traffic officers along the roads will be removed and replaced with mobile officers. "We have few officers who were used to corruption. They always think they can sneak out to the road without being noticed. We are asking members of the public to alert us of such officers," Muguai said. Edited by R.Wamochie
