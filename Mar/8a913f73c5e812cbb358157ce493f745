A woman is undergoing treatment at Mwingi Level 4 Hospital together with her newborn baby who was retrieved alive from a latrine. Mwingi Central subcounty police commander Peter Mutuma said the woman checked into a private clinic at Mumbuni market complaining of a stomachache. The woman was directed by a clinical officer to go to the latrine and bring stool samples for testing. Upon taking too long at the latrine, the clinical officer went to the toilet to check on her. She was surprised to find the patient in a pool of blood. Mutuma said when asked, the woman said she gave birth and threw the infant in the latrine. The officers called police officers who together with residents helped retrieve the newborn. Resident Kanyambu Musyimi disclosed to the Star that the woman worked at a filling station within the market and no one knew she was pregnant. “I guess she always had her tummy tightly tied, for no one within the market noticed she was pregnant,” Musyimi said. The man, who digs pit latrines for a living, said they knew the baby was alive as they could hear her crying from the latrine. Boda boda rider Patrick Mwanzia said the woman had sold him fuel the day before. Joseph Maluki, a retired senior chief, urged women who give birth but do not want the baby to give them up for adoption. “It is inhuman to attempt to kill an innocent soul,” Maluki said.
