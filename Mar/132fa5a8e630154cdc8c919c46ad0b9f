Nyeri county speaker John Kaguchia has asked the church and politicians to speak out when things go wrong in the country. Kaguchia was referring to the landing of a Chinese plane in Nairobi on Thursday last week with 239 passengers. The passengers were cleared to enter the country, causing alarm among Kenyans about possible spread of coronavirus in the country. The passengers on the China Southern Airlines flight were also ordered to self-quarantine. Kagichia said he at the time called on area MPs to join others in speaking out on the issue so that the country is not exposed to the disease. He said it was also wrong for people to remain silent as the whistle blowers were being victimised. Kaguchia called on leaders to speak the truth about the infectious disease. “And that is why I also want to challenge the church. Please you are the salt of the earth and if the salt loses its taste, then it is all thrown out,” he said. He called on the church not to let politicians to mislead the nation as they watched. “Please don’t keep quiet when we are not doing the right thing. Please talk and say it as it is,” he told the clergy. Kaguchia  spoke in Nyeri town on Monday during the county prayer breakfast organised by Nyeri Ecumenical Bishops Council. Present were Nyeri governor Mutahi Kahiga, MPs Rigathi Gachagua (Mathira), Gichuki Mugambi (Othaya), Ngunjiri Wambugu (Nyeri Town) and Woman Representative Rahab Mukami. Others were Nyeri Catholic archbishop Anthony Muheria, ACK Mt Kenya West bishop Joseph Kagunda, bishop Paul Wanjohi of  New Life Church and Nyeri county commissioner Loyford  Kibaara.
