For many Kenyans the concept of using Chama’s to raise money is a familiar one. Whether it is to save and invest or increase financial security, they have been used to help thousands of people. However, like most things controlled by people, it does have its flaws, and unfortunately, the consequences of this is people may loose a lot of money. One person who knows this first hand is Peter, who told us his story. “ We had decided to meet every month and each putting together about 3,000 per person. Then we agreed that after contributing for about six months, we were supposed to be given a loan. “So if someone wanted to borrow a small 10k, then we would give it to them and they would pay it back with a small interest. “But there was someone who decided to borrow around 40,000. The first month he pays a little. The second month, he only pays his interest, the third month he didn’t pay at all!” "So what we did was we all went to his place, we took his TV and CD player and even a cupboard. Then he took us to the police and told them we had robbed him. It was my first time in a cell!” This story unfortunately is not unique to Peter.
