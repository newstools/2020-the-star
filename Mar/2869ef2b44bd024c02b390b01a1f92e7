Vihiga Bullets’ recent good form gives them hope of coming away with something from their visit to Gusii Stadium, where they take on hosts Shabana. Bullets have enjoyed better performances when in their travel than at home, leaving assistant coach Milton Kidiga optimistic of getting a result against their unpredictable hosts. “We have played better away from home and that is something that we have to try and maintain while also working hard to improve our home form,” said Kidiga. The trainer could not put a finger on exactly why the National Super League newcomers have endured dismal return at home. “Maybe it is the pressure of playing in front of our own supporters or the being over-eager to get a result but it is improving and for sure, it will get better,” he remarked. Eight further matches have been lined up this weekend as the NSL enters round 27 this weekend across different venues. Fortune Sacco and Migori Youth aim to break their tie of 38 points as they battle each other at the Kianyaga Stadium while promotion hopefuls Nairobi Stima will be at home to Talanta. League leaders Nairobi City Stars travel to Bomet to take on struggling APS Bomet on Sunday. The highlight of the weekend will be a game pitting Kibera Black Stars against Vihiga United at the Camp Toyoyo grounds. Vihiga currently holds the third position with 46 points while Kibera Black Stars are at position sixteen with 21 points.
