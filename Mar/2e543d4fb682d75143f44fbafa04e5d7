President Uhuru Kenyatta on Saturday asked Kenyans to continue praying as the country grapples with the fight against coronavirus. "Kenya is  a nation that believes.. let  us continue praying for Kenya, pray for peace, unity and healing," he said. "...there are those who are saying we depend on science and not prayer but I want to tell them that even science needs God." Uhuru said God will listen to prayers, adding that he will grant Kenyans their wishes. "Our God is a listening God and He will grant us our hearts desires.. let us seek his forgiveness for anything we may have done wrong individually, collectively and to ask for His favor in the face of the challenges that we have," he said. Uhuru led the nation in the National Prayer Serive against the coronavirus at State House in a service which started at noon and ended at 2.30pm. The masters of ceremony were outgoing Citam presiding Bishop David Oginde and Archbishop Anthony Muheria. The service comes as Health CS Mutahi Kagwe on Friday announced a raft of new measures to contain the virus. He urged PSV operators to carry less passengers in the fight against the coronavirus. "Fourteen seater matatus should carry eight passengers only," he said. Kagwe said 25 seater PSVS should carry 15 passengers only. A thirty-seater matatu and above should maintain 60 per cent seating capacity. This also applies to the Standard Gauge Railway. Kagwe said this is effective beginning Monday, March 23, 2020. But he noted that the issues of fares going up is still under discussion with the transport sector. "We have left that matter under the discussion of transport operators..we will have an economical challenge," he said. "...there is no organisation, that is not going to be affected. What we are trying to do is mitigate it, so that instead of a total closure you attain a 50 per cent."
