Singer Vivian has refuted claims she is expecting a child with her husband Sam West. This after Vivian posted a photo on Instagram with kids on her birthday and captioned it: "Anyone, who believes I would be a good mum to these kids, including the one being baked? Yet to come." She later deleted the post, although fans had started sending in congratulatory messages. In the photo, Vivian seems to have added some weight and the bulging baby bump was visible. The couple is, however, raising a blended family as Vivian came into the union with a daughter from a previous relationship, and Sam West also started the family with a son from a former relationship. When Word Is reached out, Vivian said, "That was not a baby bump, it was just a joke. There was something I was doing on my birthday with kids. No, I'm not pregnant."
