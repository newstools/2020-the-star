Kenya Under 12 teams have set their sights on the Africa championships slated for Morocco in September. The boys' and girls' teams qualified for the African event after finishing first and second respectively at the East African championship held in Uganda last weekend. The boys' team of Zayann Virani and Baraka Ominde won all their matches to top the round-robin format with hosts Uganda finishing second. In the girls' category, the Kenyan team of Seline Ahoya and Stacey Chepkemoi finished second behind Tanzania. Coach Joseph Karanja was full of praise for the team after negotiating through the tricky one-week tournament in Uganda. "It was tough but both teams came through and now we start preparing for the African event later in the year," said Karanja. Kenya will be up against some of the top juniors on the continent including Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia, Rwanda, Burundi and South Africa. Karanja said the event will be a learning curve for the players. Elsewhere, the Kenyan Davis Cup team has been relegated to Group 3 after losing to Indonesia in the playoff fixture last weekend in Jakarta. Kenya lost all five matches and will head back to the African zone to be played in either June or September.
