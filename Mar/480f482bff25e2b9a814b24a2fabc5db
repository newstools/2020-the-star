The Kisumu county assembly has appointed Owen Ojuok as its first substantive clerk in seven years. More than five different people have held the post in an acting capacity. Most had their terms ending in controversial circumstances. Nelson Sagwe, Philip Adundo, Ben Opiyo and Linet Ochieng held the position before Ojuok was also appointed in an acting capacity. On Wednesday, Ojuok was confirmed by the MCAs following the approval of the County Assembly Service Board. The board picked Ojuok out of six candidates who were interviewed for the position. The report of the CASB on Ojuok’s recruitment was tabled in the assembly by Speaker Elisha Oraro who is the board chair. Oraro said that the nominee attained the panel’s 50 per cent pass mark and met constitutional requirements to be the assembly clerk. The MCAs endorsed the board’s report, saying Ojuok has what it takes to run the assembly as the clerk. Majority leader Kenneth Onyango and chief whip Prisca Misachi said Ojuok's confirmation was good for the continuity in the management of assembly business. Nominated MCA Aslam Khan observed that the House had been well managed while Ojuok held the post in an acting capacity. Eleven people had applied for the clerk's position. They included Ben Nyakinda, Linet Akoth, Elijah Ochieng, Charles Otieno and Dancun Ogalo. Ojuok promised to bring unity in the assembly leadership. He asked members to shun division and focus on their oversight and legislative roles. (edited by o. owino)
