Two men committed suicide in different constituencies of Bungoma county under unclear circumstances. In the first incident in Lunakwe village, Bumula constituency, a 42-year-old man took rat poison following an alleged difference in a land leasing row. Neighbours said Dismas Barasa had leased his one acre to two different people and had failed to return the money to either. “He is ever a silent man, it is good to speak out on some issues affecting you, we could have raised funds and returned the cash but unfortunately he is gone,” neighbour Martin Wabwile said. His widow Esther Nanjala said Barasa spent most of his time sleeping and looked disturbed but had told her about the lease. “He had told me he was a bit confused about who should plough and plant on the land and we were still deliberating on the issue to get a solution when I found him already dead,” Nanjala said. His body was taken to Bungoma County Referral Hospital mortuary. In Sengeli B in Maeni location of Kimilili constituency, a man hanged himself on his kitchen rafters. His widow Elizabeth Naliaka said Maasai Wanyonyi, 38, hanged himself on March 10 under unclear circumstances. “We had breakfast well and I embarked on my farm work on returning home, I found my husband hanging in our kitchen. We hadn’t quarrelled at all,” Naliaka said. But acting chief Leonard Muloboti said the couple had long-standing domestic differences which led to them sleeping in different houses. “This home is known for brewing busaa and this has caused a lot of problems between the couple. They hadn’t found a lasting solution. This could be a possible reason for the suicide," Muloboti said. Wanyonyi's body was taken to Webuye County Hospital mortuary awaiting postmortem.
