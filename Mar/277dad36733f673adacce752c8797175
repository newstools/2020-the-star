Parents in Vihiga have been ordered to quarantine their children or be arrested. Vihiga county commissioner Ochillo Oyugi said parents of children loitering in markets will be locked up. County police commander Hassan Barua said children roaming with no clear reason will end up in police custody until their parents come for them. “Children, stay at home for your own safety and stick to books. Learning has not come to end,” Barua said. The two spoke to the Star on Tuesday morning on the telephone. Vihiga has not registered any coronavirus case. “Learning institutions were ordered to close by the government so that parents are able to protect their children from this coronavirus," Oyugi said. "But to my surprise, children have been left loitering here and there. It’s like nothing is happening and parents are not concerned at all.” He said deputy county commissioners, their assistants, chiefs and assistant chiefs had been directed to help of subcounty and ward administrators to ensure no children were out and about. Oyugi urged politicians within Vihiga to serve as an example to ensure state policies were adhered to during the Covid-19 outbreak. The officials said no gatherings would be allowed in the county. Funerals will be allowed only to family members not exceeding to 15. Governor Wilber Ottichillo has residents to collect bodies in mortuaries and bury them immediately. “Any politician will not be allowed to attend a funeral function in this situation unless he is a family member of the deceased," he said. Church services remain suspended until the situation normalises. "We are pleased with our transport sector within the county. They have complied with the orders, although we understand the circumstances they are going through but we urge them it's for a short period of time," Barua said. Edited by Henry Makori
