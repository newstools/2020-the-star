A Catholic priest met the wrath of police after he was found conducting mass in Bungoma town on Friday night against the government directive. Fr Christopher Wanyonyi of Christ the King Cathedral was leading the service past curfew hours when police ambushed the church, led by county commissioner Abdi Hassan. Faithful who had turned up were forced to scamper for safety even as police zeroed down on the priest. Police confiscated the items that were being used for worship including the sacrament. Hassan said it was unfortunate that several Catholic churches were still conducting mass even after being warned. “We have lots of respect for the clergy but it is very unfortunate that instead of them leading in fighting this virus, they are the ones who are engaging us in cat and mouse games,” he told the Star. He said they will act tough on such clerics "who are misleading their faithful". “We are getting information that they are telling people that attending service will help them deal with the virus scare, this is wrong,” he said. The county security team has also summoned Kanduyi Catholic priest Fr John Ogolla who they say has also been conducting secret mass. “We have also summoned Ogolla and we can assure you that we shall lock him up.  If he doesn’t appear we will go for him,” Hassan said.
