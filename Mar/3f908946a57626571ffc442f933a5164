Deputy President has asked public servants to desist being misused by politicians for their political agendas. Ruto on Sunday said certain politicians are using the civil servants to push their agendas. “We live in a country that is free and democratic. To try and use the criminal justice system to perpetuate a certain political agenda is in itself criminal,” Ruto said. Ruto was speaking in Buuri, Meru County, where he attended a prayer service at the Catholic Church of Uganda Martyrs Kibirichia Parish. The DP said some of the leaders across the board are being intimidated of serious consequences if seen attending functions carried by certain people. "Governors in Kenya today, MCAs and MPS are being treated to intimidations, blackmail, threats that they will be taken to courts because of their political violations," Ruto said. On Saturday, during the burial of sergeant Kipyegon Kenei, Ruto asked the Director of Criminal Investigations to independently carry out his work. Several leaders accompanied the DP to Meru including area Senator Mithika Linturi. Mithika echoed Ruto's words, cautioning the DCI boss George Kinoti against being abused by politicians. Kikuyu MP Kimani Ichungwa said the intimidation that they were facing was epic. “We cannot freely speak out our minds because of our association with the Deputy President. We would not accept to be the slaves of the so-called system,” Ichungwa said. He also said the public should be explained as to why the dreaded Flying Squad was disbanded. Gatundu North MP Moses Kuria said Ruto's allies will not be stopped by the pressure from the system. “If it were not for Ruto, Uhuru Kenyatta would not have been a President in Kenya. That I can state without any fear of contradiction,” Kuria said.
