Authorities have moved to allay fears that youths and students forced to stay home may turn to crime. There is concern that the coronavirus lockdown is likely to turn many youths idle while at home and that some may be tempted to engage in crime. On Monday, Nairobi police boss Philip Ndolo said there was no need to panic while at home as police will be on standby to avert any attempts to engage in crime. "We are on the same posture we took since Christmas festivities and we are not relenting," Ndolo said. Constant terror threats in the city have forced police to remain on high alert for months now. Mombasa county police commandant Augustine Nthumbi said police will make sure the students stay at home and not loiter in the streets. "Last holiday, there was an increase in crime which reduced when schools opened. Now that they are coming back, we will be very alert," Nthumbi told the Star. Criminal activities in city suburbs have in the past been blamed on idle youths and school-going children when on holidays. "Let people stay at home at all times, we are going to make sure there is enough security for families at home," Nthumbi said. Mombasa has been plagued by youth gangs who have reigned terror in areas of Likoni, Old Town, Majengo and Kisauni for a long time. On Monday, students started arriving home following Sunday's directive by President Uhuru Kenyatta that schools be closed to curb the spread of coronavirus. Universities and tertiary institutions were given up to Friday to be closed. Uhuru said confirmed cases of coronavirus had risen to three. (edited by p. obuya)
