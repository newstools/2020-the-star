The Ministry of Health on Tuesday said that boarding schools will assist in boosting the country's capacity in dealing with the spread of coronavirus. During a press briefing on Tuesday at Afya House, Health CAS Mercy Mwangangi said that the government is exploring the use of the country's boarding schools countrywide in the event the situation worsens. "We have engaged county governments to identify specific boarding schools that will assist in boosting our capacity," she said. The CAS said already 37 county governments have complied with the rest in the process of complying. "We are also looking at hangars fields as well. This is expected to offer us the additional 300,000-bed capacity," she said. "We have also taken over the Kenyatta University hospital that has a bed capacity of 300 beds which we are in the process of equipping to boost our capacity. Out of this number we intend to isolate some beds for ICU." The CAS spoke when she announced Kenya had reported nine new coronavirus cases as of Tuesday.
