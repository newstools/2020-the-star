Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital in Eldoret has formed a 24-member multi-disciplinary task force to deal with the outbreak of coronavirus should it reach Kenya. Hospital CEO Wilson Aruasa said the team, led by Dr Simiyu Tabu, who is head of emergency services at the hospital, will complement the work of the task force formed by President Uhuru Kenyatta to deal with a possible outbreak of the disease. Speaking  to the press  in his office on Wednesday, Aruasa said they have put in place adequate measures to handle the situation in the event of an outbreak. “The multi-disciplinary task force that I have assembled will be working closely with the Ministry of Health, the devolved units, private and faith-based health facilities in North Rift region,” Aruasa said. The hospital has set aside a 10-bed capacity isolation ward as part of their preparedness. Aruasa said the ministry had allowed them to spend the hospital’s emergency funds towards construction of an additional 15-bed capacity ward expected to be completed by end of the month. “The contractor who was awarded the tender to construct the isolation and treatment centre has done almost 90 per cent of the work and we hope the project will be completed by end of this month,” Aruasa said.
