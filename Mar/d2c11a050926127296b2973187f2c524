Dagoretti South MP John Kiarie is being questioned by Kabete DCI over claims he made there are more than 7,000 individuals quarantined in his constituency over Covid-19. The MP had earlier said Kenyans should be prepared to face the reality ahead of a rise in coronavirus cases as mass testing begins on Sunday. The MP urged the government to be open and tell Kenyans the truth as far as positive cases are so that they can take the situation seriously. “Kenya Government must forthwith communicate the gravity of the real situation without sugar coating anymore. Let Kenyans know how bad things are about to get. They will be better equipped to make personal decisions and put up with government decrees, measures and restrictions,” Kiarie said. The MP said it is high time that the government comes up with more isolation centers around the country and that the burden should not be left to county governments who are currently designating a few hospital beds to cater for patients with Covid-19. “Kenya National Government must set up massive isolation centers around the country; over 4,000 bed isolation centres in Kasarani, Nyayo and City Stadiums in Nairobi. Over 3,000 bed Isolation centres in Mombasa and similar centres countrywide,” Kiarie said. Kiarie further said the country should kick-start production of sufficient masks which he said is about to be the most important commodity in the country. According to him, the situation might overwhelm health officers and the government should support the community health volunteers who can help officers at the village level.
