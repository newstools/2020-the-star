High Court Judge Weldon Korir has stopped the DPP and DCI from arresting and prosecuting Gire Ali over alleged criminal charges of terrorism. The charges according to the court documents arise out of an alleged act of video recording of China Southern Airline at JKIA on February 26. Gire, an assistant security agent at KQ, witnessed the landing of the said aircraft which was contrary to communications by KQ that the flights from china had been suspended from landing due to the outbreak of the COVID-19. Also granted is an order suspending a letter by KQ that suspended Gire from work. Gire through Lawyer Danstan Omari told the court that the act of threatening and suspending him from work is meant to intimidate him and interfere with the enjoyment of his constitutional rights. Last week Kenya Airways suspended Gire indefinitely for sharing a video clip of 239 passengers aboard a Chinese flight that arrived in Kenya. "Following a report of video of China Southern flights arrival at JKIA and circulation of the video clip widely on social media and your alleged involvement in the matter, it has been decided that you be suspended from duty with effect from Feb 27," Chief Human Resources Officer Evelyne Munyoki said. Munyoki said the suspension was in line with the company policies. "This is to pave way for further investigations into the matter. During the period of suspension, you will be required to avail yourself to the investigating team," Munyoki said. She asked Gire to avail himself to his manager or any other person in authority when required. "You are therefore required to remain contactable and within reach during the period. Also note that the suspension period will be on full salary," she said.
