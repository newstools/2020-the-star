Netflix has created a $100 million fund to help with hardship in the creative community during this period of Covid-19 crisis. Almost all television and film production have now ceased globally, leaving hundreds of thousands of crew and cast without jobs. These include electricians, carpenters, drivers, hair and makeup artistes and more, many of whom are paid hourly wages and work on a project-to-project basis. "This community has supported Netflix through the good times, and we want to help them through these hard times, especially while governments are still figuring out what economic support they will provide," Netflix said in a statement. Most of the fund will go towards support for the hardest-hit workers in their productions around the world. Netflix is in the process of working out exactly what this means, production by production. "This is in addition to the two weeks' pay weâ€™ve already committed to the crew and cast on productions we were forced to suspend last week. Beyond helping workers on our productions, we also want to support the broader film and television industry," it said. "So $15 million of the fund will go to third parties and non-profits providing emergency relief to out-of-work." Netflix will announce the details of donations to groups in other countries next week.
