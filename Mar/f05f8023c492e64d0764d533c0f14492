Turkana Governor Josphat Nanok has dismissed claims he is under investigation for embezzling funds from Tullow Oil Company. Governor Nanok termed it a political witch-hunt after a story appeared in the Daily Nation that he was under investigation. "I'm confident that the truth will exonerate me and put the matter to rest. I'm prevented by law from doing business with the county government due to conflict of interest," he said while addressing mourners in Katilu Turkana South at the weekend. Nothing prevents him from fron in engaging in lawful private business with other companies he said Nation media reported that Nanok, his West Pokot counterpart John Lonyangapuo, Ikolomani MP Ben Shinali and Tai Enterprises Ltd, a construction company, have bagged numerous government tenders. Anti-graft detectives are trying to uncover why Tai Enterprises sent Sh45 million it received from Turkana county to Nanok, who then shared it with Lonyangapuo,Â  Shinali and an individual identified as Isaac Makimei Gitau, the newspaper reported. The newspaper said the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission said Nanok actually wired to the three parties more than double the Sh45 million. Gitau was the biggest beneficiary as he received Sh40 million. Shinali and Lonyangapuo received Sh27.3 million and Sh11.25 million, respectively, the newspaper said.
