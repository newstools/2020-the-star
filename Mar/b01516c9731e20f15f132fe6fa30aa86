@MANUELLODENY The Migori administration is removing silt deposited in two rivers by heavy rains and floods, which have reduced the output to water supply lines. Rivers Oyani and Hibwa that supply water to a Sh1.29 billion project serving Migori town and a Sh350 million Isebania project were heavily silted during the rainy season. Migori County Water Services Board MD Titus Okoyo told the Star in his office that work on some parts has commenced. “At Oyani River the intake area needs to be re-configured to ensure a steady flow of water, while in River Hibwa two intake areas of Sorore and Hibwa had heavy siltation completely blocking pumps,” Okoyo said. He said the two pumps at the Isebania project were destroyed, blocking  water supply. At Oyani, the project is operational but will need attention. “We have begun to de-silt and repair affected areas, but we bank on upcoming multimillion projects by the national government to solve the problem permanently,” Okoyo said. He said a Sh200 million connectivity project for Oyani and Sh100 million for Isebania that will jointly connect an additional 100,000 people are underway. “While the water intake has been compromised, water supply has been going on. We expect new connections, with projects already tendered,” he said. Joseph Karanja, a water officer at the county government, said a third project in Kegonga, Kuria East subcounty has been affected by the construction of the Kehancha-Ntimaru road with pipes being destroyed. He said the project can produce 250 cubic meters of clean water to about 15,000 families. (edited by O. Owino)
