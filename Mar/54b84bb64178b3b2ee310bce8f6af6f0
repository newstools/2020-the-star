Media giant Radio Africa Group on Thursday launched a multimillion-shilling drive to augment the fight against the spread of coronavirus. The campaign was lead by events and brand activation team Kendi Kamotho, Magdalene Waweru, Andrew Lucheli and Chanelle Kittony. Other than dedicating airtime on all its radio stations, the Star newspaper and digital platforms, the company launched a soap distribution drive to promote washing of hands and maintenance of hygiene. The media company, in conjunction with Lifebuoy, distributed 14,200 bars of soap across Nairobi in the ongoing Covid-19 prevention campaign.
