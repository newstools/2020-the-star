Makolanders registered their first win of the season against Mathare United to go top of Zone ‘A’ table in the Kenya Women’s Premier League. Both teams engaged in a dull first half with Makolanders enjoying most of the possession and creating minimal chances.  Former Dalhem IF midfielder Christine Nafula scored a brace in the second half to put the visitors in front. Esther Aluoch of Mathare United failed to convert from the penalty spot and Nyarotso Olwich put the game to bed in the 78th minute by putting the experienced side three goals in front. Makolanders head coach, Rishadi Shedu, expressed pride with how his charges played. “We dominated the game in the first half but couldn’t convert because they have strong central defenders. We changed our approach in the second half and it paid dividends,” he said. Assistant coach Mary Aluoch was left ruing chances that led her side to their first loss of the season. “We missed a penalty kick and did not take our chances like our opponents. It’s the first game of the season and we’ve lost it but we will work hard for the next games,” she said. Only one game was played during the weekend from Zone A because most of the players are set to grace the game-week fixtures are on national duty in Alanya Gold Cup in Turkey.
