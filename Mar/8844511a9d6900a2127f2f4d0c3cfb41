The railway line from Nairobi to Nanyuki will be completed in May, tested in June and fully resume operations in July. Nyeri county commissioner Loyford  Kibaara said railway stations will be established in Kiganjo in Nyeri and Karatina in Mathira. “As we speak, we have cleared (the railway) from Nanyuki to Kiganjo and we are coming to Karatina and moving on. Where the rail had been closed by the Kenya National Highways Authority (KeNHA), it is now being opened,” he said. The administrator who is also the chairman of the County Development Implementation Committee said the Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) have been assigned to build a bridge in Murang’a county. Kibaara spoke in a Nyeri on Monday during a county prayer breakfast organised by Nyeri Ecumenical Bishops Council. He called on all those who may have encroached on the Kenya Railways Corporation land to vacate so it could secure the railway corridor. The corporation in December released a notice calling on all those who had illegally occupied Kenya Railway land within railway station and adjacent reserves to move. The corporation said it had taken measures to enhance the safety of the railway line and that of the general public. “There will be luggage trains and two passenger trains that will be operating from Nanyuki to Nairobi which will give area people a chance to transport their horticultural products to the market in various destinations with ease,” Kibaara said. The rail was revitalised following a request by Mt Kenya governors to the President Uhuru Kenyatta. He said Uhuru will visit Nyeri county soon to open Othaya Level 6 Hospital which is now operating as Kenyatta National Hospital Annex. Recruitment of doctors and nurses is going on, he said.
