The government plans to complete Sh41 billion projects in Meru before 2022, Transport CAS Wavinya Ndeti has said. She said the least done project is at 30 per cent, while most of them are half-done and some are 95 per cent complete. All the projects must be completed before new ones are started. “The over Sh41 billion projects will be completed before any other project starts. Do not listen to those saying there are projects that have stalled,” Ndeti said. The CAS spoke on Sunday when she assessed the progress of projects in Meru, including construction work at the Kinoru stadium which is 70 per cent complete. Ndeti also visited the Meru Level 5 Hospital to inspect the progress of a cancer ward. Governor Kiraitu Murungi’s hailed the national government for its commitment to fast-track completion of projects in the county. He said some projects had not been completed due to delays in the release of funds to counties. “In the past six months access to government funds from the national government has been a challenge and this has caused the delay of the ongoing projects. However, contractors are on site,” Kiraitu said. Edited by A. Ndung'u
