Hip hop singer Juliani is scheduled to release his fourth album next month. Speaking to Word Is, Juliani said the title is 'Masterpiece' and it has 13 songs. "'Masterpiece' tackles your faults as a person that sometimes make you feel inadequate. Every day people feel that and that is why I related to it," he said. He said there is nothing wrong to say you are at your lowest moment. "Like for me, an artiste who has been there for a while, I feel like the expectations are high, but all we need to do is to share our problems," he said. Juliani said the album has taken him four years to complete because there were other projects. One of the songs is called 'Tuesday' and it talks about heartbreaks. "If you have been through heartbreak, you know what this feels like," he said
