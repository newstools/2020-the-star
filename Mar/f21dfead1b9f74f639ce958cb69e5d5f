The unceremonious resignation of Bandari FC patron and the Kenya Ports Authority Managing Director Daniel Manduku will not affect the day-to-day running of the club, according to team manager Wilson Oburu. Manduku threw in the towel this morning but the club maintains that the void left by the man credited for transforming the club during his tenure will not be felt. "This season's budget had already been passed and I do not think we will struggle now that he has left. Next season's budget is also approved too. He loved the club and supported us and we hope he will continue supporting us," added Oburu. Oburu challenged the administrator who will be appointed to fill in Manduku's shoes to build on what he had achieved and lead them to raise the status of the Coastal side to a higher level. "During his time, we won the Shield and finished as league runners up twice. We punched above our weights at the continental scene courtesy of his support. I hope the incoming boss will pick from where Manduku has left and support us." "The club has created employment to youths and members of the technical bench and we have in turn represented the parastatal well," said the former Kenyan international.
