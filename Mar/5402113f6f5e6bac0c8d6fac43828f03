Barcelona’s Champions League last-16 second leg match with Napoli scheduled for March 18 will take place without spectators due to fears over the spread of the coronavirus, a club spokesman said on Tuesday. The match will take place at Camp Nou after a 1-1 draw in Napoli, but no supporters will be allowed to enter the stadium. Other games in the competition this week — Paris St Germain v Borussia Dortmund and Valencia v Atalanta — will also be played behind closed doors. “The Champions League match scheduled for Wednesday, March 18, between Barcelona and Napoli, will be played at Camp Nou behind closed doors,” said Barcelona in a statement. The Spanish Health Ministry had said sport fixtures expected to draw crowds from zones designated as high-risk for coronavirus, such as northern Italy, would be played without spectators. Meanwhile, media access for Paris St Germain’s Champions League last-16 return leg against Borussia Dortmund tonight has been cut to the bare minimum over coronavirus concerns, the French club said. The game at the Parc des Princes stadium will be played behind closed doors, French authorities said on Monday as the government banned gatherings of more than 1,000 people, and tight restrictions have now been extended to the media. “Access to the Parc des Princes is authorised to five right-holding media, chosen by Uefa, and to the club’s media,” PSG said in a statement, adding that pre- and post-game news conferences had been cancelled. The French champions lost the first leg 2-1.
