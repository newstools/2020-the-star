A Kwale pastor accused of defiling a disabled girl will remain in custody pending determination of the case. This after a court declined to grant him bail, saying he was a threat to the witnesses. Bishop Paul Mwangi of Apostolic Congregation Ministry in Taru is accused of defiling the 13-year-old girl who was attending a service at his church. He denied the offence which was allegedly committed between January and April 2019. The bishop is also facing similar charges at the Mariakani law courts where he is accused of defiling a 12-year-old girl. While giving the bail ruling, deputy registrar Christine Ogweno said that the 'man of God'Â  will remain in remand until key witnesses are placed under the witness protection and testify in the trial. Ogweno gave the prosecution 30 days to place the witnesses under protection and further directed the expedition of the case. She said the court had a duty to ensure a fair trial without fears of interferences of the witnesses which the prosecution had signaled over. Previously, the prosecution objected to the bail request, saying they had evidence that the accused had hired hitmen to eliminate the minor's father who is among the key witnesses. According to an affidavit sworn before the court, the church leader had a tendency of contacting witnesses as happened in the Mariakani defilement case. Mwangi is said to have made contact with witnesses and prospective witnesses before and after he was charged with a view to interfering with their testimonies. "He had contacted one of his church members and tasked him with procuring services of hitmen who were to kill both the victim and her father," the prosecution said. The affidavit said the accused had paid for the services via M-Pesa and that the matter was reported to police and investigations were ongoing. The case will be heard on March 29.
