A Kenyan-based software solutions provider, Verus Global Systems, has launched a system to ease the process of property management in the country. The Electronic Property Management Systems (EPMAS) offers features such as property accounting, tenant and supplier management, lease tracking, bank reconciliation, maintenance schedules, and vendor management for the needs of the real estate market. Verus Global System chairman Ken Wathome said the system will enable property managers in the real estate industry to take control of rent, vacancies, maintenance cycles, finances and accounting in their businesses. “The property market in Kenya needs a tool that allows maximum functionalities, so more time can be spent on work that matters such as building and managing well-designed functional properties that meet the needs of the market,” Wathome said. He said the system will also enable entrepreneurs who lack the time or expertise to maintain their properties and deal with tenants. Verus Global System managing director Faith Kiithu said the objective of developing the software was to ease processes in real estate and property management. “The Kenyan property market has grown tremendously over the years, however, the industry has been lagging behind in adopting technology. Our solution will let users access business metrics, track maintenance, and communicate with renters, owners and vendors,” Kiithu said. The launch was attended by stakeholders in the property market as well as Verus Global System board of directors including, Carole Karuga, Julian Kyula, Okalle Makanda and Gilbert Saggia.
