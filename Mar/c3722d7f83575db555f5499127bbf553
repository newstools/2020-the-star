Olympic Marathon champion Eliud Kipchoge is still keen to defend his title in Tokyo next year despite the current coronavirus chaos. The World marathon record holder said despite the postponement of the global extravaganza from this year to next year, he is looking forward to defending his crown. "I look forward to defending my Olympic title next year in Tokyo and witnessing a wonderful event," he said. The Tokyo Olympics were postponed on Tuesday to 2021, the first such delay in the modern gamesâ€™ 124-year history. This was to contain the spread of coronavirus that has hit the globe. Kipchoge, who the most decorated marathoner of all time with 13 major marathon wins under his belt, said training has been tough especially with the spread of the virus. "It has been hard for others since they have been training day and night. Olympics is an important event for people. Careers have been shattered and this cancellation affects all lives," he said. He added: "The mere fact that you can have a medal to hang around your neck from the Olympics and that you were a participant is an excitement worth waiting for," noted Kipchoge. Speaking to CNN on Wednesday, Kipchoge asked his colleagues to accept these hard times and support the world in fighting Covid-19. "They should just continue training for next year. They will have a chance. We need to accept and support the various leaderships," he said. Kipchoge noted that the postponement of the London Marathon, where he was chasing a fifth title, was also unfortunate. the event was earlier scheduled for next month but has now been pushed to October 4. "In the world, anything can happen. All we have to do is accept and move on," he said. Tokyo 2020 organising committee chief executive, Toshiro Muto, said it was not clear who would pay the extra costs arising from the postponement. Japan has put up US$12 billion to host the 2020 Olympics.
