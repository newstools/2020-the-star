   Tension is building up in Kiserian, Baringo South sub-county after bandits suspected to be Pokots stole over 100 cows belonging to Ilchamus on Thursday. Politicians have weighed in, with some Jubilee Members of the County Assembly pointing an accusing finger at their Kanu counterparts for the raid, which followed Wednesday's impeachment of Churo-Amaya MCA Ameja Zelemoi as Deputy Speaker. Zelemoi is a Pokot and a diehard Kanu adherent. Jubilee MCAs Nixon Lemlem (Marigat), Silas Tochim and Kipruto Kimosop gave their Tiaty counterparts up to the end of Friday to return the stolen animals or else face a major protest. “We shall make sure all roads connecting Tiaty to Marigat, Kabarnet and Nakuru are barricaded and rendered impassable for Pokots,” Lemlem posted on his Facebook page. Mukutani MCA Renson Barkei said on Friday that his 50 cows were among those stolen and driven towards Karau and Chepkalacha in Tiaty. Marigat OCPD Bonjolif Munuve his officers were pursuing the raiders to recover the animals. He said nobody was injured during the raid. “We are working closely with the Tiaty chiefs to locate the bandits,” Munuve said adding that the exact number of stolen animals was yet to be determined. Meanwhile, Tiaty MP William Kamket on Friday obtained a seven-day stay order quashing the impeachment of Zelemoi. He and Pokot MCAs had rushed to the High Court at Kabarnet seeking to have the impeachment annulled as it was "done un-procedurally". He was accompanied by the assembly minority leader Sam Lokales (Tirioko MCA), Daniel Tiwit, Maria Losile (Loyamorok), Solomon Makal (Kolowa) and Sherdrack Mailuk (Tangulbei). Judge Edward Mureithi noted while giving the stay order that the impeachment lacked merit. Zelemoi had soon after his impeachment blamed what had happened to tribalism and political power games between Jubilee and Kanu.
