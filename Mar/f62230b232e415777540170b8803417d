Nairobi County Assembly Minority Whip Peter Imwatok has said he will now follow the law and not proceed to debate the motion on the impeachment of embattled Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko slated for today. However, Imwatok insisted he will not withdraw the motion from the House pending the direction of the court next week. The motion had been slated in the order paper of today's house business. On Monday, Justice Byrum Ongaya suspended the motion to a later date. “The debate was scheduled to take place today but we shall respect the court order until we get a final direction from the court next week,” Imatwok said. The Makongeni MCA said the motion had already reached the threshold and passed all the necessities for it to be debated. “ As a member of ODM party, we respect the law and obey the court. On Monday if the court gives us a green light we shall not hesitate to move forward,” Imwatok said. “The motion matured last week on Thursday and I can assure you if we get the green light we will send the governor home.” County Assembly Speaker Beatrice Elachi is expected to officially communicate to the house on the way forward on the impeachment .
