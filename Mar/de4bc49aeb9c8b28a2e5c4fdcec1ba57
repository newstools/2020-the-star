Necessity, they say, is the mother of invention and tough times call for tough measures. Kenya is facing a difficult time in view of the new coronavirus pandemic which is fast spreading globally. Unless the situation improves, a lockdown will be inevitable. Kenya has four confirmed cases. Primary, secondary school and university students are already at home after an order to close learning institutions. What can be done so students don't lose out on too much learning? The Education ministry should make use of the media and internet to continue passing on education materials. The once-robust broadcast to schools by the Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development should be activated and beamed countrywide for primary and secondary school students at home. Radio and TV stations can carry education programmes as a public service during this period. University students can benefit from e-learning. Longhorn Publishers has availed for free its online learning platform to support continued learning. Students with internet access should take advantage of this. Telcos should lower internet charges specifically for e-learning. Parents must equally understand that they have to be more vigilant and ensure their children do not just while away their time watching cartoons, movies or listening to music, but dedicating some time to reading and revision.
