Double tragedy has hit a family in Meru's Kinoro location, South Imenti. It has not only lost a loved one but can not bury him over Sh500,000 owed to PCEA Chogoria Hospital in neighbouring Tharaka-Nithi County. The family is now appealing to well-wishers, especially to the Meru county government, for assistance to offset the hospital bill and give Morris Mbaabu, 24,  a decent send-off. Mbaabu's body has been detained at the mortuary in Tharaka-Nithi County since February 12 after the family failed to pay the treatment bill. Meanwhile, the mortuary charges are piling up at a daily rate of Sh1,000. Mbaabu's mother Sophia Kathure said her son was admitted to the ICU on November 18, 2019, with a chest complication. He was transferred to the general ward on December 6, 2019, after his health improved. “My request to the well-wishers and Governor Kiraitu Murungi’s administration is to help us raise the money for the hospital to release my son's body for burial. The bill was Sh354,000 when he was discharged in December but we didn’t have the money. "We only raised Sh70,000 (in December) but the hospital demanded we clear the full amount before releasing the body," she said at her home last weekend. The family has sold nearly all its properties and has so far raised Sh140,000. Kathure said the hospital refused a title deed as collateral, insisting on full payment of the bill before the body is released for burial. Mbaabu's uncle Dominic Guantai said the burden is heavy for the family. The local chief's appeal to the hospital for the release of the body fell on deaf ears. Another resident, Amos Majau, said family members have endured a lot of frustrations and appealed to Meru leaders to assist them. A Chogoria Hospital official who requested not to be named said on Friday that she was not aware of the detained body.
