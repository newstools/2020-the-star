Kenya will for the second year running host women's ITF World Tour in October. Tennis Kenya (TK) secretary-general, Wanjiku Mbugua, said they haven't settled on a venue yet though they have been given the hosting rights. "We have been given the hosting rights by ITF for this event and we have started preparations for the tournament. Last year's event was held at Peponi School in Ruiru," she said Mbugua said plans are also at an advanced stage to host a leg of the men's ITF  Tour although discussions are still ongoing. Countries expected for the week-long event include Burundi, Congo, India, Sweden, France, Great Britain, Netherlands, Israel, Russia, Ukraine and Gabon. Others are Nigeria, South Africa, Poland, Romania, Brazil, Venezuela, Turkey, Australia and the USA. Mbugua said hosting the event for the second year running will be a big boost to the women's game in the country. “Our lady players have shown their calibre in the recent tournaments and having it again later in the year, will be a big boost and will expose them to world-class competition,” she added. Elsewhere, Kenya's Davis Cup team arrived in Jakarta yesterday ahead of their Playoff fixture against Indonesia on Friday and Saturday. Head coach Rosemary Owino said they have had a rigorous preparation with the players in the ITF Egypt Futures tournament in the past fortnight. Owino said the boys will have four days to acclimatise to the hot and humid conditions and are relishing the challenge of facing the hosts. "We have had good preparations in Egypt with the players and now the next couple of days will be aimed at finalising our preparations,” added Owino.
