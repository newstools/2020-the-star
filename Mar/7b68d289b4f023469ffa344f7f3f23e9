A slip up in the defence cost Shujaa the lead, allowing Max Mcfarland to cut through and land his side’s fourth try that levelled the scores to 24-24 at full time. Scotland retained the ball at the start of the extra time and this led up to Alec Coombes landing his brace and securing his side’s victory.
