Kenyan hypeman Gudah Man says hyping to President Uhuru Kenyatta and First Lady Margaret has been a dream come true. He told Word Is last Thursday that he hopes and prays to continue hyping to them. “I’ve done events for State House. It’s not yet official that I am their hypeman but I did hype for the President and First Lady. I did a couple of events I can’t count,” Gudah Man said. He said the proudest moment in his career was seeing the President dance to his hypeset. “Making the President of Kenya dance, no one does that. No one makes the most powerful man in Kenya dance for five minutes. It is fun, I have some of those videos on my YouTube,” he said. Gudah advises upcoming hypemen to have faith in God, practise, be consistent and to never to give up. “There is hope for someone who thinks everything is lost. Hype made me know that things will be okay. I’m here to give hope,” he said. Before becoming a recognised brand, Gudah played football and made music. “Currently I’m doing graphic design, working with H.O.P. I also have a project called Gudah Man Live 2. I did one in 2018 and I’m doing another one this year in August,” he said. He first got on the stage 10 years ago. “I didn’t know what I was doing, I got on stage because the MC was not there. I did a famous dance and that was how Gudah the hypeman came to be,” he said. “God makes me relevant and He gives me the energy. He makes all the energy come together because I’m just a vessel He is using.” The artist spoke during the launch of Coca-Cola’s without sugar beverages in Meru. “The launch of the new range of Without Sugar portfolio is part of our company’s strategy to offer our customers choice ranging from various pack sizes to the amount they want to consume and how much they want to spend thereby driving by affordability,” said Nelly Wainaina, Coca-Cola East and Central Africa Franchise Marketing Activations Lead. The launch was preceded by a two-day roadshow that started in Nairobi’s Roysambu to Meru.
