The Aga Khan University Hospital in Nairobi has limited the number of visitors to the wards to only the registered next of kin. This is in response to the presidential directive to limit the number of visitors in hospitals as part of the measures on coronavirus prevention. In a statement released on Monday, the hospital said that the next of kin will be allowed in for a maximum of 30 minutes. "We are urging patients seeking care at the main hospital and outreach centres to limit the number of people accompanying them to one person where possible. Aga Khan has also increased hand sanitizer gel points across the main hospital and the outreach centres," the hospital said. To create awareness and provide answers to frequently asked questions, the hospital has created a dedicated webpage on its website that hosts resources on COVID-19. "We have also set up a dedicated hotline manned 24 hours a day by medical professionals which continues to provide relevant information." Kenya has three cases of the highly contagious disease that is threatening to bring the world economy to its knees. The first case was reported last Friday from a 27-year-old patient who had travelled into the country from the US via London. Informing the country of the new cases on Sunday, President Uhuru Kenyatta said the two tested positive as a result of coming into contact with the first patient. “Our health officials have already moved them (new patients) into Kenyatta National Hospital isolation facility,” Uhuru announced during a press conference at Harambe House.
