It is unfortunate that the Kenya Revenue Authority is choosing to ruthlessly pursue Keroche Breweries over a tax dispute. I find it hard to believe that this issue cannot be resolved without bringing the company to its knees. President Uhuru Kenyatta speaks of the Big Four agenda yet his government is busy destroying home-grown industries. Then the taxman will say how they didn't reach their revenue targets after fighting one of the biggest taxpayers to the ground. Shall the Kenyan economy only be dominated by foreign multinationals? Why do we favour them over our own people? I urge the President to protect local businesses from this harassment. Kenyans should feel free to be successful in their own country; after all the government has been promoting 'Buy Kenya, Build Kenya'.  Nairobi
