Kenyatta University Titans hope to put their act together as they seek an immediate return to the women's Hockey Premier League. Coach Richard Wandera said they are working on how to convert chances as they prepare to take on Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology this weekend. Both sides were in the top tier last season. JKUAT lost 1-0 to the University of Nairobi in their opening match and have the opportunity to redeem themselves in this weekend's fixture. Defender Rachael Bonareri will face her former club when she parades in the Titans line-up. Lavina Awuor is a sure bet to lead the attack having impressed in pre-season and the tactician has tipped the pair to lift the morale and confidence of the team. "Our objective is to play well and return to the top tier. It was hard last season as our attack was wasteful. The defence was equally not up to the standards but we have fine-tuned those departments. The girls are psyched up and I believe we will overcome the challenge." Wandera avers that the best is yet to come from the team. "There was remarkable improvement towards the end of the season and should the team pick from where they left, it will be hard to deny them their chance."
