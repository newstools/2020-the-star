Alex Juma was sentenced to hanging by a trial court before the High Court rescued him from death by reducing his sentence to life imprisonment. And after 22 years behind bars, Juma wants the court to further reduce his sentence. The 61-year-old has filed an application before the Mombasa constitutional court to have his sentence reduced. The prosecution has softened its stance and urged the court to reduce Juma's sentence to 25 years in prison. Juma pleaded with Judge Erick Ogola to grant him a second chance for freedom after serving in prison for 22 years. He said life in prison had taught him lessons which he will hold dearly if granted freedom. Juma was charged with two counts of robbery with violence and illegally being in possession of a firearm without "I promise not to ever commit the offence I committed again. I have learnt a lesson. I will start life as a responsible person and will work hard to earn a living," Juma said. The prosecution said Juma jointly with others who were not in court, robbed two people of cash amounting to Sh317,000 and a wristwatch. The robbers are said to have used violence on their victims and further threatened to kill them by shooting. Juma allegedly committed the offences in 1996 before he was found guilty as charged and sentenced in 1998. He now wants the sentence reviewed. Edited by Peter Obuya
