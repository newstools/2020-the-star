CashPot, a newly launched easy-to-play basic numbers game, on Friday entered into the Kenyan market with hopes of changing the gaming scene. CashPot has been designed to offer players a 1-in-33 chance of winning, which is currently the highest in the market. Other gaming platforms' odds are 1 in 10,000. It launched in Westlands at an event attended by top news editors of various media houses, including the Star associate editor Joseph Olweny. Also present were CashPot CEO David Mighty and chairman Ngovi Kitau. The teams behind the CashPot Lottery aim to restore patriotism by reiterating the narrative that with each purchase, Kenyans will not just be playing for fun but also consciously helping the community.
