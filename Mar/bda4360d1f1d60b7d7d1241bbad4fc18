A police officer was busted ferrying four Ethiopians on the Isiolo-Moyale highway, Isiolo North, on Friday. Constable Hillary Kosgei Kipng'eno attached to Marsabit Central police station was found carrying Zayenu Mundeno, 20, Abdelikader Mahmade, 19, Fikire Yohannes, 19, and Shemsu Sultan, 20. According to a police report seen by the Star, the officer was arrested in a multi-agency operation at midnight. He was carrying the four in a civilian car, a Toyota Wish registration number KCU 447U. Kipng'eno was arrested alongside Abduba Guyo, 32, who was driving a separate car which had no passenger. They were held at Isiolo police station. "The suspects are in custody to be arraigned today with the offence of being unlawful in Kenya for aliens while the Kenyan will face offence of human trafficking," the police report read. In February, two General Service Unit officers Solomon Mutuma and Ali Dida Halakhe and civilian guide Ali Hassan were apprehended by a multi-agency team manning a roadblock on Dogogicha-Yamicha road in Merti subcounty, Isiolo. The trio was found transporting 22 bales of bhang weighing about 110kg and 10 Ethiopian men in a government vehicle traveling from Moyale to Meru County. “The jungle green vehicle was under the command of Mr Mutuma who had a pistol and an AK-47 rifle and he was seated in the front with Mr Dida (driver), who had an AK-47 rifle," the police report read. Criminal networks are said to use remote routes for drugs and human trafficking. Edited by Henry Makori
