The chilly Sunday morning weather in Nairobi did not deter thousands of Kenyans from thronging Nyayo Stadium for the fifth edition of the Beyond Zero Half Marathon. First Lady Margaret Kenyatta, the brains behind the initiative that creates awareness and supports maternal health care and the reduction of the child mortality rate, was at the venue early to flag off the races, starting with Paralympics 21km race at 6.30am. Coincidentally, the race fell on the International Womenâ€™s Day, an occasion when the achievements of women worldwide are celebrated and challenges facing them recognised and plans of action formulated.
