If the situation is it getting bad then it's getting worse in Kenya. Coronavirus is now the new rhythm in the country; any press conference by the Ministry of Health is adding panic to that already started in social media. The Kenyan government should be more serious about this pandemic because the cases reported are of people who recently travelled into the country. The efforts the government is making to contain the spread of the virus are laudable but officials should be deployed across the country to enforce the orders given by the President. Also, telling people to quarantine themselves immediately after jetting into the country is not working because people tend to be ignorant. That is why fake news is trending all over the internet. People spreading such misleading information should be charged in line with the Computer and Cybercrimes Act. The government should take the full responsibility of quarantining the people who are getting into the country before they are released to their homes because even when they are told to self-quarantine it is clearly evident that they aren't doing so. They interact with other people around their homes on the assumption that since they are not showing the symptoms, they are not infected. Such cases show us that if we don't heed experts' advice on containing the virus, it will overwhelm our health systems.   Kisumu
