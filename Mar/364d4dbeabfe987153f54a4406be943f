As police officers engaged residents in running battles last night during curfew, officers in Kabarnet, Baringo county, had an easy time as the town was cleared by 7pm. “Even before our police alarms went out by 6.30pm, nobody was still loitering in town and this is an applauded move,” civil administration police commander Moses Lekakei said. Lakakei encouraged residents to maintain the same spirit through the curfew duration, “because all this is not about President Uhuru Kenyatta or police but for your health”. He reiterated that no one was arrested during the curfew - including boda boda operators, drunks and traders. The curfew was announced to contain the spread of the Covid-19 disease in the country. Lekakei and his Baringo Central counterpart Ibrahim Abachilla later served journalists and night security guards with hand sanitisers and gloves. “If you are not a security officer, a journalist or an ambulance driver, I wonder what someone of sound mind is still doing in town,” Lekakei said. Abachilla urged the media to also stay safe as they cover activities during the pandemic. He urged them to carry masks, gloves and hand sanitiser. Meanwhile, only goats were roaming in the dead-silent town which is a semi-24 hour economy. Hotels, shops and bars were closed. “I use to sell coffee and eggs at night before the curfew,” Jonah Kemboi said, adding that he heeded the curfew to protect himself from the virus. Residents, however, called upon the government to consider supplementing them with relief food. Edited by R.Wamochie
