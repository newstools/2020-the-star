Fourteen unclaimed male bodies at Naivasha subcounty hospital mortuary will be disposed of as soon as the facility gets a court order allowing it to do so. The bodies have exceeded the three months duration for claiming them. The hospital buried 13 decomposed bodies in a public cemetery four months ago. A senior department of public health official said the county government’s resources were overstretched as bodies are frequently dumped at the mortuary. “We have seen a trend where families that do not have land or are unable to bury their relatives dump the bodies in the mortuary,” he said. Chief county Health officer Samuel King’ori was recently quoted as saying that the issue of bodies abandoned in mortuaries is worrying. King'ori said the county was spending a lot of money disposing of the bodies. “Relatives are abandoning bodies in our mortuaries mainly due to the high cost of burial. This trend is worrying.” He said they want to acquire land for cemeteries but there are hardly any willing sellers. “This financial year we have been forced to reallocate Sh15 million meant for cemetery land to other demanding issues,” the officer said. Recently, Longonot residents appealed to the county government to fence off the cemetery and build a public toilet for mourners who use bushes to relieve themselves. Local leader James Kuria said some people relieve themselves at the cemetery because it is not fenced off.   – mwaniki f.m.
