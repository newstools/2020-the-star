More than 6,000 households in Kanjuiri Ridge ward in Ol Kalou will soon say goodbye to water problems following the rehabilitation of Rutara dam. The dam, whose source of water is a spring in the nearby Kanjuiri hills, occupies 34 acres. It was built in 1948 by white settlers but over the years, it has lost its glory owing to siltation from human activities. The national government, through the Central Rift Valley Water Works Development Agency, will undertake the project in two phases at Sh80 million. Nyandarua Water executive Milka Wanjiru said the first phase will include dredging and de-silting the dam for six months. Phase two will include construction of reservoirs at Kanjuiri hills and laying distribution pipes. “This is a big project which will ultimately benefit as many as 10,000 households. We thank the national government for approving our proposal and funding the project,” she said Once the dam is complete, farmers from Ngorika will get clean and safe water for farming and domestic use all year round. Kanjuiri Ridge MCA Suleiman Kihika said the county government of Nyandarua would not have managed to undertake the project as every ward gets only about Sh7.8 million annually for water projects. Kihika urged residents to own the project and protect the dam by planting indigenous trees and grass in nearby farms to prevent erosion. Simon Njenga of Public – Craft International Ltd, the contractor, said they will take the next 14 days to mobilise for the work to start. “Six months is the maximum period we are given to complete this project, but we shall be able to complete it in three to four months. As a business person, I know that failing to complete any project in time will make the contractor incur extra cost,” he said. Edited by Henry Makori
