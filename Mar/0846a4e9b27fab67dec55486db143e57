A government workers' union has suffered a blow after a court dismissed a case in which they sought to stop the Nairobi government from advertising vacancies in the county. On Monday, Justice Hellen Wasilwa ruled that the Kenya County Government Workers Union slept on their rights for too long and that the orders sought stood as spent or not tenable. “I therefore find the entire petition not merited and I dismiss it with no order as to costs,” the judge said. In 2016, county employees through their union sued the county government and its service board. They sought orders to stop them from carrying on with the advertisements, interviews, recruitment or employment of any new employees without undertaking staff audit, qualifications assessment, right job placements and promotions. The union maintained that its members were employees of the county who held legitimate expectations that they should have carried out staff audit and qualification assessment promotions prior to them advertising vacancies within the county public service. “The advertisement was discriminatory, unfair, unreasonable and the same was made in bad faith as it was open to all members of public and the respondents failed to follow the set preconditions to confirm whether internal members of staff can fill the said positions,” the union argued. The employees maintained that the county government’s actions were in breach of the constitution. In response, the county through acting County Secretary Robert Ayisi admitted having advertised for various positions in the county service board on August 26, 2016. He said the advertisements were done in accordance with the human resource manual. Edited by A. Ndung'u
