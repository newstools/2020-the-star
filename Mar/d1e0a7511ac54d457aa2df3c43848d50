The move by the government to impose a curfew from 7pm to 5am has elicited mixed reactions among Narok residents. While some have welcomed the directive, others say the curfew infringes on freedom of movement. On Wednesday, President Uhuru Kenyatta ordered a nationwide night curfew to prevent the spread of Covid-19. Residents and businesspeople who supported the move urged Kenyans to adhere to the directive and stay home. “If it is true that staying at home will save us from Covid-19, then the curfew is the only way to protect Kenyans,” vegetable vendor Gladys Kerubo said. Narok Chamber of Commerce chairman David Mpatiany urged traders to cooperate and close their businesses early. “This is a matter of life and death. This is not the time to complain but follow the given guidelines. Once the virus is tackled effectively, we can get back to our businesses,” he said. But not everyone has been as receptive to the restrictions. Some traders said the curfew will hurt their businesses. "What the state should have done is enforce the guidelines on this disease instead of a curfew,” boda boda operator James Chege said. Narok county commissioner Samuel Kimiti said residents should respect the government’s directive. “Everyone should ensure he or she is at home before 7pm,” he said. Transmara West subcounty deputy county commissioner Mohammed Noor said security officers will patrol Kilgoris town to ensure that directive is adhered to. He urged factories to change their working hours to ensure everybody is home by 7pm. Edited by A.N
