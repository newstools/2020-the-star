US Media personality Oprah Winfrey has dismissed claims that she was arrested for 'sex trafficking'. “Just got a phone call that my name is trending . And being trolled for some awful fake thing,” she tweeted on Wednesday. “It is not true. I haven’t been raided or arrested. Just sanitizing and self distancing with the rest of the world. Stay safe everybody.” She became no one on trends after numerous reports claiming that her house in  Florida, was raided, and that she had been arrested on sex trafficking charges. The conspiracy theory surrounding Oprah started with QAnon. The far-right group which centers on an anonymous individual known as “Q,” is known for starting wild conspiracy theories. A fake video was posted about her arrest, in which a “news reporter” claimed that her property was roped off and seized by authorities . The theory also said actor Tom Hanks and Charles Barkley were arrested. Their pending charges were also linked to the Pope and the Vatican.
