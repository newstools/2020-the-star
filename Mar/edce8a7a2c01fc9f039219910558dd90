Police officers in Voi on Sunday shot dead a suspected gangster. The armed criminal who posed as a boda boda operator was gunned down at a Voi hotel in an attempt to steal. Another suspect escaped on a motorcycle. Taita Taveta county police commander Said Kiprotich confirmed the 9am shooting. He said police acted on a tip-off and successfully averted the robbery. "We had gathered intelligence reports that a group of criminals was targeting to rob high-end hotels and petrol stations over the weekend before the money is deposited on Monday," Kiprotich told journalists outside the Vine Breeze Hotel in Voi. A Taurus pistol and eight rounds of ammunition were recovered. The police boss further revealed that police had launched an investigation and manhunt to arrest the escapee. "We have contacted the boda boda chairman so he can help us in investigations. The criminals were using a motorcycle," he said. Hesbond Mwasi, a customer at the hotel, said the suspected criminal was demanding money from the cashier before police stormed in. "The guy brandished a gun at the waiter at the counter. He wore a helmet," Mwasi said. Preliminary results indicate a suspect is a renowned figure in the town. He is a former manager at an entertainment joint in Voi. This comes a fortnight after three other criminals were arrested while trying to rob residents in the region. They were later handed over to the DCI in Milimani, Nairobi, who had been pursuing them.
