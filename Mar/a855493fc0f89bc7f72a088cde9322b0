Terryanne Chebet says losing her job at Citizen TV back in 2016 was one of the lowest points in her life. Speaking in a recent TV interview, she said she didn’t see the impending layoff coming as she wasn’t under-performing at her job. “Just hearing the news crushed me, and it crushed from a very personal point because it is one thing when you lose your job but it's another thing when you lose your job so publicly and such a public job," she said. She said she had a strong belief in her self and when they announced there would be a redundancy, she did not imagine she was on the list. "I called my friend and I was crying, then I went home, locked myself in a room. And the hardest person to tell was the house help. That was so hard because I had lived with her for more than 10 years and she had never seen me cry," she reminisced. The best thing is that she had a strong support system. She added that she had to move on and focus. "One of the people who came through for me was my business partner at Scarlet Digital (advertising agency),” she said. "She pushed me to focus on the positive. I was fighting so much internally but then my brain was engaged in so many other things." Edited by T Jalio
