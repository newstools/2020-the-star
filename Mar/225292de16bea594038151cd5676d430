National Super League side Vihiga Bullets coach Edward Manoah says his team has overachieved. “When we were promoted, we set a target of maintaining our NSL status. We have superseded our targets and now we want to finish in the top 10. The club is just one year old and I'm impressed by the progress,” said Manoah. He added: “Next season our target is top-five finish, then in the 2022-2023 season, we target promotion to the Kenya Premier League.” The club sits 9th on the NSL log with 36 points from 26 matches. The coach added that he will continue with his policy of recruiting youthful players. “We already recruited six schoolboys who will join us once they complete their studies,” he added. Manoah, who spoke after his team lost 2-1 to Shabana in an NSL match on Sunday, at the same time challenged the football governing body FKF to ensure only competent referees handle NSL matches. The veteran tactician was sent off after storming the field to protest decisions by the centre referee while the game was on. “We spend time to prepare for games then referees make questionable calls. Vihiga and Shabana are not chasing promotion, the referees should be fair,” said a bitter Manoah. On his side, Shabana coach Vincent Nyaberi was happy with his side’s second straight win. “The boys played well and I want to thank the fans for motivating them. I also want to appeal to fans to turn up in large numbers during our home games to cheer the boys,” added Nyaberi. Youthful speedy winger Ashif Obwaka, who started his first match gave Shabana, the lead in the 24th minute with Coulibaly Mohammed adding the second for the Glamour Boys. Masamba Nicholas pulled one back for Vihiga Bullets. Ashif is a son of the late Enock Obwaka who played for Gor Mahia and was also the coach of Shabana.
