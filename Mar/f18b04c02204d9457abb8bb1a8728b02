City Hall will pay development project contractors whose claims have been audited and approved Sh859 million after MCAs last Thursday approved the 2019/2020 supplementary budget. Some Sh2.8 billion was set aside for recurrent pending bills. County Assembly Budget and Appropriation Committee chairman Robert Mbatia on Monday said the committee had reviewed the supplementary estimates together with the submissions of the Finance executive. "It is up to the treasury to decide on the list of contractors to pay as we have done our part as an assembly and we expect that due payments are done," he said. Last month, the county paid Sh120 million to the Kenya Medical Supplies Authority. On June 19, 2019, the MCAs passed a Sh4 billion supplementary budget to pay some of the pending bills following President Uhuru Kenyatta's directive on the subject on Madaraka Day. Between October and December last year, the county cleared Sh3 billion owed to Kenya Revenue Authority as statutory payments. City Hall maintains that its financial burdens would ease if the national government paid Sh400 billion it owes the devolved unit.
