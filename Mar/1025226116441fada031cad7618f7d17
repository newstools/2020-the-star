Interior CS Fred Matiang'i has threatened to sue blogger Robert Alai and three others over libel. Matiang'i, through his lawyer Donald Kipkorir, accused Alai of publishing libelous content on his Kahawa Tungu blog. According to Matiang'i, Alai on March 13 published an article saying he owned a concrete company that was causing havoc and misery to residents of Bobasi in Kisii county. Matiang'i said Alai's publication meant that he owns a quarry that violates established regulatory approvals, that he caused death and injury of residents and that he doesn't care about the health and property of residents. "The said words published in the blog and Twitter page were calculated to disparage the minister in his public life," Kipkorir said in the demand letter. According to the lawyer, Alai meant Matiang'i is of dissolute and profligate character and he is guilty of abuse of office. "The said publications were out of malevolence and spite towards the minister and were also calculated to increase the popularity of the said blog and Twitter page with a view of making profit as a media influencer to attract advertising," Kipkorir said. The lawyer said, "Our instructions are to demand your immediate pulling down of the said publication and its complete expunging online and all links to them, whereupon we can go into quantum payable". He added, "If the above demands are not complied to immediately, we have instructions to file suit to compel their removal and to pursue damages and cost for libel."
