Some 4,000 residents of Sossian ward in Laikipia county will benefit from an earth dam constructed at Sh18.7 million by the national government. Nakwam dam situated on the border of Laikipia, Baringo and Samburu counties has a capacity of 96 million litres and is expected to be complete by the end of this month. It is being constructed by the National Drought Management Authority with financing by the European Union. Devolution Chief Administrative Secretary Abdul Bahari visited the dam located in Laikipia North constituency to inspect progress yesterday. He said with the expected heavy rain, the water to be collected could last for over a year if properly utilised. The CAS said once operational, it will help reduce water-related conflicts among pastoralists who have in the past clashed at livestock watering points. “There are over 20 such projects in other Asal counties being done by the government to harvest rainwater for future use by the pastoralists and in other areas for small scale irrigation,” Bahari said. Laikipia North MP Sarah Lekorere who accompanied the CAS termed the project one of the best in the county by the national government as it will promote peace and among communities. She said herders had been travelling for nearly 20km in search of water for their livestock and this had resulted in fights between communities. “The government should do the same in the neighbouring Tiaty and Samburu Central constituencies so that when animals are moving they can have enough water,” Lekorere said. She called on the county government to support the initiative by sinking a borehole in the area for use by residents so that they can leave dam water to livestock and wild animals.
