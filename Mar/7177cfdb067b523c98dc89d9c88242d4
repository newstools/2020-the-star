A cargo train carrying crude oil from Mombasa to Nairobi derailed spilling some of its contents and damaging a water pipe near Kibwezi railway station in Makueni. The Saturday morning accident occurred after vandals stole pieces of metal that join the rails in the section. Kibwezi Makindu Water and Sewerage Company managing director Stephen Mutiso said more than 60,000 people in Masongaleni and Mtito-Andei could not access the commodity following the accident. They are served by Umanyi springs water project from Chyullu. “We are waiting for Kenya Railways to remove the wreckage of the cargo train so that we can repair the pipe and restore the flow of the water,” he told the Star on Saturday. He said the train fell on the water pipe serving Masongaleni, Ngwata and Thange areas causing serious damage on the piping system. Willy Kalovya, a resident who arrived at the scene shortly after the accident, said part of the railway line had been vandalised. Kalovya said it is not the first time such an accident happened asking authorities to find the vandals and bring them to justice. “Water mixed with crude oil has been flowing into the bushes around here. We appeal to the government to hunt for the vandals because I believe they are part of the community around here dealing with scrap metal business." County commissioner Maalim Mohammed confirmed the accident saying the government was investigating the incident. No deaths or injuries were reported. Edited by R.Wamochie
