Closed Kiambu markets will open on Wednesday, Governor James Nyoro said on Saturday. Last week, the governor ordered five markets closed effective Thursday evening for failing to take the requisite precautions to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. He said Limuru, Wangige, Kikuyu, Githurai and Dagoretti markets would be closed until traders self-regulate and their managements' put in place proper containment measures. But on Saturday, the governor said traders will observe social distancing, since they have put in place mechanisms to ensure that there is space between each trader. "We would not want to go against the government's instructions, but our people need to eat, and they buy commodities there." Nyoro said they are in talks with the Limuru Water and Sewerage Company to ensure there is piped water in those markets. Traders have also been urged to buy hand sanitisers. He said they have held talks with market officials on how to spread traders in and out of the market. "We visited those markets so that we could talk and show the traders how they can work without jeopardising social distancing," the governor said. The governor spoke when he inspected construction of Tigoni Hospital. On Tigoni Hospital construction, Nyoro said the first floor of the new four-storey block with 250 beds will be used as an isolation ward for people suspected of having contracted Covid-19. The block will be opened next month. Trader Samuel Njonge said most of them have incurred huge losses. "Those of us who sell tomatoes and other perishables are counting losses since a lot of our stock went bad. If we are allowed to go back, we shall observe hygiene since we also value our lives," he said. Edited A.N
