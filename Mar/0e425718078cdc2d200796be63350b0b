The Smirnoff Battle of the Beats season II Mombasa Edition crowned DJ Dave the third winner of the hotly contested deejaying competition recently. All winning DJ acts walked away with a MacBook pro laptop, a flight case and a 2TB hard-discs. In a pulsating final event at Club Mioâ€™s in Mombasa, DJs battled it out on the decks. DJ Dave impressed the crowd and judges with his expert command of the decks, detailed set, song choices and mixing techniques that gave him the ultimate edge in the tightly contested finals. DJ Dave becomes the third overall winner of the Smirnoff Battle of the Beats season II deejaying competition, which will see other aspiring deejays battle it out in the remaining two editions in Kisumu and Nairobi.
