"It is standard business continuity planning practice in our industry to have a live work arrangement in the event of an emergency or a disaster situation," Nbutu said. She added, "Our workforce is largely drawn from youths from low income communities with potential but are unable to find jobs because of the high unemployment rate therefore most of our employees live in high-density areas with risky sanitary measures".
