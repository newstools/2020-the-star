A 20-year-old woman on Sunday allegedly strangled her two-month-old daughter to death before killing herself. Rose Joseph lived with her uncle and aunt in their rental house in Mwingi town and worked at their M-Pesa shop within the town. On Sunday morning, Christopher Musyoka and his wife left for church leaving their niece in the house. On coming back after the service at around 2pm, they found the door locked from inside. They tried to open and after unsuccessfully trying to enter the house, they reported the case matter to Mwingi police station for assistance. Mwingi police officers responded and forcefully gained access into the two bedroomed house and found the body of Rose Joseph dangling from the roof in one of the bedrooms. She committed suicide using a rope. They also found the body of the baby girl lying on an adjacent bed wrapped in a bedsheet with fresh blood oozing from her nose. A suicidal note was also recovered on the bed detailing reasons for the infanticide and subsequent suicide. According to the suicidal note, the deceased was conned out of Sh100,000 at the M-Pesa shop and when she reported it to her uncle, he thought that the girl had stolen the money. Mwingi Central subcounty police commander Peter Mutuma said the woman killed herself due to lack of guidance and counselling after she lost the money. Mutuma urged members of the public to assist each other on such issues to minimise suicide cases. The bodies were moved to Mwingi Level 4 hospital awaiting an autopsy.
