Tension is high at Naivasha GK Prison after an inmate went berserk and attacked other inmates using a sharpened spoon and seriously injuring two of them. The inmate, who is serving a death sentence, got incensed after one of his cellmates, who was also injured, ‘stole his lover’. Details emerged that cases of sodomy and fights over relationships are on the rise in the prison. It has more than 3,000 inmates. Following the attack, police moved in to investigate the case and the suspect was charged with aggravated assault. Naivasha OCPD Samuel Waweru said his officers visited the prison to investigate. He said the Prisons department had also taken its own internal disciplinary measures. "During the incident, two of the inmates were seriously injured using a sharpened spoon and we have recorded their statements as part of the investigations," he said. The accused got into an argument with a cellmate over another inmate with whom they had a sexual relationship. According to a source in the prison, the suspect used the institution’s workshop to sharpen the spoon before hiding it in the cell. In the evening, he went for his cellmate with intent to kill him, according to the source, forcing the others to intervene before warders on duty came to their rescue. “The suspect has been sharing a cell with four other inmates and accused one of them of taking away his lover, leading to the attack,” he said. Meanwhile, two weeks after a middle-aged man was kidnapped by unknown people in Naivasha, police have yet to establish his whereabouts or recover a lorry that he was using. His family had received calls from people demanding Sh200,000 ransom as police moved in to investigate the case. “We are still following the case and though the victim and the lorry have not been found, we are sure we shall get those involved,” the OCPD said.
