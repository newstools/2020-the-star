Shabana ended their six-match winless run in the National Super League after edging Ushuru 1-0 at Gusii Stadium. Coming into the game, Shabana had lost three and drawn three games. First-half substitute Ashif Obwaka scored the lone goal shortly after he was introduced for Dennis Onyancha. Obwaka, who was playing his second match for Shabana tapped into the empty net after Ushuru goalkeeper Robert Ouma misjudged Mohammed Coulibally’s cross. Shabana coach Vincent Nyaberi termed the win a turning point for his team. “We have not had the desired results in our recent matches that's why this win is so important for us. I want to appeal to our fans to return to the stadium and cheers the boys,” said Nyaberi. “We want to continue winning because that is what our fans want.” The tactician praised Obwaka saying he has a bright future. “He completed his high school studies last year and I’m impressed by his display. He plays according to instructions,” Nyaberi added. He appealed to the team’s management to address issues affecting the players and technical bench. Ushuru’s assistant coach Jackson Gatheru said the loss is a wakeup call for his team. “Our target to return to the Kenya Premier League still remains. This is just a minor setback. We must go for a positive result in our next game against Mt Kenya United,” said Gatheru, who played for Shabana during his heydays. He, however, blamed Shabana for employing time-wasting tactics in the second half. “It was a good game which was well officiated but in the second half, Shabana resorted to wasting time. Fans also turned up in large numbers to watch the game, which is a good thing,” added Gatheru. Shabana fan Wesley Mokua praised his team for the win. “It’s long since we celebrated a win. Winning against Ushuru is not easy,” he said.
