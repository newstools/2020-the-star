Sudanâ€™s Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok has survived an assassination attempt targeting his convoy in the capital Khartoum, state television and a cabinet source said on Monday. Hamdok, who was appointed to head a transitional government after the overthrow of long-time President Omar al-Bashir last year, has been moved to a safe location, state TV said. Images broadcast on regional TV channels and social media showed a convoy including several damaged white SUVs and a badly damaged car.
