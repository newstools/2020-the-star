Pentecostal and evangelical churches have asked the government to crackdown down on leaders spreading fear in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. The churches expressed concern that some leaders were blowing matters out of proportion and creating fear, which was hampering efforts to contain the disease. “We urge our members to ignore rumours and myths about this disease that are making rounds,” said bishop Elizabeth Thuiya, chair of the House of Clergy Association. Thuiya said it was their mandate to ensure that congregants got the correct information regarding the disease. “We as pentecostal and evangelical churches pledge to take very good care of the flock God has placed under us,” she said. The secretary general of Kenya National Congress of Pentecostal Churches Joseph Moilo asked the office of the registrar of marriages to work with churches to facilitate marriage documents online. “We also advice those wishing to conduct wedding ceremonies to limit the numbers and follow precautions as set by the government,” he said He thanked the government for establishing centres at the national and county level to deal with cases of the disease. “We encourage Kenyans to take note of the location of these centres for quick response and for information they may need,” he added. Alliance of Registered Churches of Kenya secretary general Isaac Mwangi asked members to adhere to the directives stipulated by the government while congregating for worship. “Our churches shall remain open for worship,” he reiterated. The three appealed to other stakeholders to play an active role in reducing the impact of the disease. “To our members and the nation at large, we urge you to take precaution as directed by the Ministry of Health in places of worship and any gathering,” Mwangi said.
