Kenya Defence Forces killed 12 al Shabaab militants on Thursday following a successful raid on their camp at Nginda area, a location between Korisa and Bargoni in Lamu county. Coast Regional Coordinator John Elungata said among those killed is a notorious al Shabaab commander from the Coast region who has been providing intelligence and logistical support to the terrorists who have been hiding inside the Boni forest. The camp raid is a blow to the extremist group as the militants holed up in the forest could starve due to lack of food supplies and ammunition. Elungata also divulged that during the operation, the team captured one militant and recovered several weapons, including 3 AK 47 rifles, seven magazines, over 1,000 rounds of ammunition, pouches and a water carrier which were coward militants left behind. “Our soldiers killed 12 Al Shabaab militants during the Thursday morning raid and captured one alive. The raid was part of the ongoing KDF operations in pursuit of AS militants who launched a botched attack at Kotile Special Operations Group Camp on 13th March 2020,” said Elungata. The attack is believed to have disoriented the Somali based Al-Qaeda linked group as the camp was the only one remaining in Kenya which the terrorists were using to coordinate their activities. Security teams operating in the region have since intensified operations, tracking the assailants within the thickets of Lamu West and Lower parts of Tana River counties. “The intensified security operations by Kenyan security agencies have significantly degraded al Shabaab leading to killing of those attempting to conduct pockets of attacks in Kenya and leaving others terrified resulting to scaling down of their activities,” said Elungata.
