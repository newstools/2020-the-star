Media personalities and artistes recently visited Ilbissil Primary School in Kajiado county for a mentorship programme. In attendance were DNG from 254 Cares, Kush Tracy and Miss Curvey Kenya. Miss Curvey Kenya encouraged the pupils to hold on their dreams no matter how big they may seem since nothing is impossible through God. Ilbissil alumnus Robert Gitau urged the parents to be their neighbours' keeper and always share information about parents giving out their daughters for early marriage. The headteacher Justus Mumo was grateful to the team that spared time to visit the school.
