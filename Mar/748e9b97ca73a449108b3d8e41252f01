Turkana county has set up 11 isolation facilities for suspected COVID-19 patients. The total capacity is 57 beds. Executive for health and sanitation Jane Ajele said they have procured Sh1.5 million medical supplies from the Kenya Medical Supplies Agency. "We have identified 10 isolation facilities in Turkana and procured commodities to improve preparedness against coronavirus to protect our people," she told a press conference in Lodwar on Monday. She said the county purchased personal protective equipment, face masks, gloves, gumboots, gowns, disinfectants, sterilizers, adult body bags and sprayers. She said all seven subcounty hospitals have an isolation centre. Another three will be used as needed in the refugee centre and the two land entry points in Loima on the Uganda border and the west South Sudan border. She said the preparation team has been dispatched to all entry points to screen temperatures of travellers and take their details so they can be traced if needed. International gatherings have been banned and schools closed for 30 days. Robert Abok, chief health officer, said the health surveillance team is educating residents on measures to prevent infection and what to do in case of illness. He said the county needs a lot of funding to prepare for COVID-19. “Health teams are all over in airstrips such as Lokichogio, Lokichar, Kakuma and Lodwar to screens passengers. We also have three vehicles for the work,” he said. Abok disclosed they have been revealed that they have been monitoring three Chinese who have self-quarantined for 14 days. They are attached to a construction company building the A1 road from Kitale to Juba South Sudan. The number of coronavirus cases in Kenya has risen to four, officials said on Tuesday.
