ODM party leader Raila Odinga has dismissed reports that he met Kilifi county governor Amason Kingi during his recent visit to Mombasa. There were fears that Kingi might have been infected by his deputy who was found to be positive with the coronavirus. There were also reports that the governor might have met Raila during his trip to Mombasa, something that the AU envoy has refuted. "Raila made a low-key visit to Mombasa where he stayed in his house. During the visit, he did not meet with any of the leaders of the Coastal counties or their deputies," his spokesman Dennis Onyango said. In a statement on Monday, Onyango said Raila only met the Deputy Governor of Mombasa County William Kingi. "He did not meet the Deputy Governor of Kilifi County. Treat reports indicating otherwise as lies and malice," he said. Raila appealed to Kenyans to treat such reports as the work of people who have failed to comprehend the magnitude of the challenge the nation is facing. "...and instead find pleasure in abusing social media platforms to spread misinformation to cause fear and panic, a trend the State must arrest urgently," he said. He appealed to Kenyans to continue obeying directives from the Government including frequently washing their hands. Raila has further suspended travels outside the country, public gatherings and meetings. "He has been operating mostly from home while transacting official business online. In addition, he has since suspended operations at his Capitol Hill offices to minimise human traffic to the office," he said.
