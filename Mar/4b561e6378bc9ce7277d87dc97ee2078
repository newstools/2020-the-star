  Turkana Governor Josphat Nanok says he is still the ODM party vice-chairman despite having been replaced by Loima MP Jeremiah Lomorukai. The Orange Democratic Movement Party in August last year announced that Nanok's position had been taken up by the MP. But Nanok on Friday said he has not received a letter about his removal. He said the party move to kick him out does not hold because there was no consultation. ODM while replacing Nanok said the governor had on many occasions suggested he had decamped to the Tangatanga wing of the Jubilee Party that is loyal to Deputy President William Ruto. “Following numerous public pronouncements that he has quit the ODM party, the National Executive Council has unanimously resolved to replace Nanok as the party vice-chairman with Loima MP Jeremiah Lomorukai. The MP was welcomed to the NEC by the party leader Raila Odinga,” ODM said in a tweet. But Nanok says the pronouncement does not hold. "I'm still the ODM vice-chairman because the right measures to kick me out were not followed and no consultation was done. Leaders deserve respect. I still stand firm as the vice-chairman of ODM since the party didn't follow the right measures to kick me out," Nanok said. The governor spoke during the Turkana consultative meeting on the Building Bridges Initiative that was attended by leaders, community representatives, religious, professionals and minority groups. In August, ODM leader Raila Odinga said Nanok had announced publicly that he had joined the Tangatanga group and should not claim that he was kicked out of the party. "I was invited for the Turkana Cultural Festival to celebrate but Nanok lectured me. It's clear Nanok publicly left the party after he decided to join Tangatanga movement and it's even in the media," Raila said. He said they are ready to accommodate the second-term governor if he wishes to return to the Orange fold.  edited by peter obuya
