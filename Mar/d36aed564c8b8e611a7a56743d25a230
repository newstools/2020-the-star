Hundreds of athletes have suffered a major blow after 2o training camps were ordered closed in Nandi to combat the coronavirus. Nandi has the second largest number of athletes after Elgeyo Marakwet— both professional and amateur— training in several camps spread across the six counties. While declaring a number of steps taken to combat the spread of Covid 19 by his county government, Governor Stephen Sang said athletics camps pose a major threat. “We have several foreign athletics managers, agents and the runners flying in and out of the region and we have decided to close the camps for 30 days with immediate effect,” ordered Sang. Major athletics camps in Nandi County are managed and run by Italian-based managers and agents  Federico Rosa, Claudio Berardeli and Gianni Demadonna. Italy is one of the nations adversely hit hard by the Covid 19 scourge. Nandi County was set to host the 2020 edition of the inter-counties sports games from March 25-27, 2020. The county was also supposed to host the  Kenya Secondary School Games at Kapsabet from  April 14- 17. Sang said his government was acting on an order issued by the Ministry of Health and the Office of the President. To effect the closure order, Sang said they were working with the office of the Nandi county commissioner to ensure the directive was effected to the later.
