A head teacher has been convicted of attempting to defile a Standard 8 pupil. Daniel Ongoi is awaiting sentencing after a Makadara law court found him guilty on Friday last week. He was convicted of committing the crime on March 1, 2014, in an Industrial Area school. He also faced a second count of committing an indecent act with a child, a 13-year-old girl. The girl testified that Ongoi frequently called her to his office. She said that on the day of the crime they had sat an exam. When it was over at 2pm, the accused collected the papers and told the girl to take them to his office. He then told other pupils to go home. The minor narrated how Ongoi closed his office door, led her to another room and placed her on a sofa. He removed her underpants and laid on top of her, however, sensing she would scream, he stopped and let her go, she testified. The girl told a friend who reported to her mother. A medical examination revealed multiple tears of the hymen and a thick discharge. The doctor concluded there had been penetration. In his defence, Ongoi said he was called to the chief's office and informed he had defiled a child and they [the family] wanted to mediate, but he declined. He said that he was later arrested and taken to Industrial Area police station Senior principal magistrate Angelo Kithinji said the conviction of the accused was based on the evidence of the complainant. “This court has had a chance to observe her and is satisfied the victim was truthful and not 'fixing' the accused due to a grudge. "I do find the accused guilty of attempted defilement and do proceed to convict him,” Kithinji ruled Kithinji ordered Ongoi’s social inquiry report availed to court on March 23 before sentencing.
