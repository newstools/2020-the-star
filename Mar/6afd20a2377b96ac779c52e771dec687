Kenya’s premier golf event, the Magical Kenya Open, has been postponed indefinitely. This follows a government directive to ban all international and regional meetings involving foreigners, adding the only meetings to be allowed will be those involving purely Kenyans. The Kenya Open, which is a round of the prestigious European Tour, will now be shelved until further notice. Kenya Open Golf Limited chairman, Peter Kanyago confirmed the postponement in a statement adding that new dates will be communicated. In the statement to the media, the KOGL boss said: “Kenya Golf Limited has received the Government of Kenya’s decision to postpone all conferences and meetings of an international nature in Kenya for the next 30 days, including the 2020 Magical Kenya Open, due to the ongoing global threat from the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The Kenya Open Golf Limited respects the decision of the Government of Kenya and supports all efforts that safeguard our country against the possible entry of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).” Kanyago confirmed that the KOGL has already conveyed the decision to the European Tour and they have assured us of their full support. “We will be announcing new dates for the championship in due course,” he said. Kanyago confirmed that the organisation will be sending out further communication to all our stakeholders. Kenya Open Golf Championship is, by and large, one Kenya’s biggest promoter in domestic and international sports tourism.
