Singer Majirani is holding a fundraiser for his football club, Majirani FC, over the weekend in Eldoret. He told Word Is on Wednesday, "Running a football club is quite expensive, I have been funding the club alone for the past three years. it hasn't been easy so I decided to call for the support of my fellow musicians. All the concert proceeds will go to the club." Adding, "I'm working hard with the boys to see the club get promotion to the second division league before August this year. It will be a big step for us here." The 'Hivo Ndio Kunaendanga' hitmaker said he can give part of the ownership to anyone willing to help the club. "As of now I still own 100 per cent shares of the club. I had a meeting with my lawyers last weekend and decided to let go 49 per cent stakes of the club to anyone willing to come in an ownership capacity," he said. "It can be the community or private individuals, I am open to any opportunities. I'm only passionate about the growth of the club."
