The Kenyan Government has suspended flights from North Italy, specifically Verona and Milan, to the Kenyan Coast, following the global coronavirus outbreak. The suspension takes effect from March 3, 2020. The National Emergency Response Committee on coronavirus, which was constituted last Friday by President Uhuru Kenyatta, met today under the chairmanship of the Health CS to review the situation and status of the coronavirus. "Following Consultations with the Italian Embassy and Stake Holders, the National Emergency Response Committee on Corona Virus (NERCC) has concluded that flights from the North of Italy, specifically Verona and Milan which usually has direct chartered flights to our coast be suspended effective March 3rd, 2020," a statement from the Government Spokesman Crus Oguna said. NERCC says that this part of Italy is currently experiencing coronavirus incidents which could affect the safety of Kenyans. NERCC will continue to monitor the situations and purpose changed as the situation evolves. The President through an Executive Order last week said the NERCC will coordinate Kenya's preparedness, prevention and response to the threat of the disease. "The team will coordinate the capacity building of medical personnel and other professionals," he said. Last month, the High Court temporarily suspended flights from China. Justice James Makau issued the ruling following a caseÂ filed by the Law Society of Kenya. The petition by LSk was filed by lawyer Dudley Ochiel. He said the matter is of great public interest.
