Kenyans on Saturday rushed to meet the dusk-to-dawn curfew ordered by President Uhuru Kenyatta. Many, not wanting to experience the horrific episodes Kenyans underwent on Friday at the hands of the police, adhered to the curfew. The curfew runs between 7pm and 5am. The police received widespread condemnation after videos and photos circulated showing officers meting out violence against residents trying to get home to beat the curfew. In Mombasa, locals tried to get onto the ferry before 6pm on Friday, but ended up being bundled up and beaten. Police spokesman Charles Owino said the situation was regrettable. In Nairobi, residents got stuck as matatu operators stopped operating around 5pm. However on Saturday, it was a different story. Few Kenyans entered the CBD and for those who did, they headed home by 5pm. The usual traffic synonymous with the CBD was not present on Saturday. In Nakuru, police were on the streets from 5pm to ensure residents were told to head home in good time. At the Coast, chaos witnessed at the Likoni crossing channel on Friday forced security officers to extend the start of the curfew by an hour and a half in the whole region. Regional police commander Rashid Yakub on Friday evening said though the chaos is regrettable, Kenyans have to learn to listen to and obey directives issued
