Commercial sex workers in Turkana have complained about a decline in business following the dusk-to-dawn curfew to contain the spread of Covid-19. Sex workers who spoke to the Star in Lodwar town said the curfew has limited their presence on streets hence the market. They asked the Star not to use their real names to protect their identity. They said that they are unable to put food on their tables and pay their bills. Akuwom told the Star that since the curfew started, she is unable to reach her customers. "We normally hang around the streets of Lodwar town and clubs but since the curfew started we haven't earned a single cent to help us pay our bills," she said. She said before the curfew, she could serve at least four clients, earning Sh2,000 in a day. Stella urged the government to extend the curfew to start at about 9pm to give them time to serve a few clients for daily bread. "The streets are empty by 6pm you can't even get a man to convince him for service for Sh100 so that you get food, " she said. Njeri said she is unable to pay her rent and buy food because of the curfew. She has urged the government to provide food for them because they have been left vulnerable arguing that they cannot get clients during the day. Edited by R.Wamochie
