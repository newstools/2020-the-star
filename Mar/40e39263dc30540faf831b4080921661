Kenya's Margaret Muriuki clinched her second marathon career win when she won the Los Angeles Marathon over the weekend. Muriuki clocked 2:29:27 with Ethiopia's Almaz Negede coming home second in 2:32:28 with Jane Kibii of Kenya third in 2:36:04 USA's Emily Gallin came home fourth in 2:40:15 with compatriot  Grace Gonzalez fifth in 2:50:08. Muriuki dominated the race from the start, alongside Negede until putting on a kick at about the 30km mark. This was Muriuki’s second marathon — and second victory. A cross-country and 1,500m runner early in her career, she also won in Honolulu in December. “It was not much different from Honolulu,” she said. “I just tried to push myself.” The 33-year-old ended Ethiopia’s dominance over the last two years, with Askale Marachi and Sule Gedo winning in 2019 and 2018 after Kenya’s Hellen Jepkurgat won in 2017. In the men's category, Kenya's John Langat came home second after a thrilling race down the stretch with Ethiopia's Bayelign Teshager. Teshager clocked 2:08:26, Langat a close second in 2:08:43 with Wilson Kwambai claiming the last podium place in 2:09:16. 2017 winner Elisha Barno came in ninth in 2:15:15 Elsewhere, less than six months after his triumph in Buenos Aires, Evans Chebet put together back-to-back marathon victories when winning at the Lake Biwa Marathon on Sunday, clocking 2:07:29 at the World Athletics Gold Label road race. The 31-year-old Kenyan made his break just before the 36km point and went on to win by 36 seconds. South Africa's Steven Mokoka  came home second in 2:08:65 with Felix Kiprotich third in 2:08:48 “Today, I ran 2:07 but it was not an easy race because of the rain and wind,” said Chebet, who set a PB of 2:05:00 when winning in Buenos Aires last year. “I want to come back to run again next year.”
