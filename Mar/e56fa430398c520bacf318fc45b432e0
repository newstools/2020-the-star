DJ Pierra Makena is putting her hopes on the government not to announce a total lockdown, which might prevent her from seeing her family. The DJ is in a compulsory 14-day quarantine after coming from the US over the weekend. "I miss my baby so much. She misses me, too, and does not understand what is going on," she wrote on Instagram. "I don't have the latest videos of us. I haven't seen her in like forever. 11 more days to go, all I pray is we don't get a total lockdown, such that I can't even go to my mom's after the 14 days, please God hear our cries." Adding "Felt better yesterday. Still can't sleep at night. Spoke to my baby and she is not taking it well." She said it's terrible and she feels bad that she can't see her yet. "Staying in the house is weird, though... but thanks to my friends who have been checking up and even coming downstairs to wave at me. Crazy, huh?" she said.
