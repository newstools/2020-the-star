Nakuru Senator Susan Kihika has urged the government to pay the cost of mandatory quarantine for Kenyans arriving in the country. Kihika said those being quarantined may not be in a financial position to pay for the bills in various quarantine facilities. On Tuesday, Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe said more measures to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 will be announced on Wednesday. He also announced that passengers arriving in the country must undergo mandatory testing and quarantine. As a result, the government listed 57 places where the passengers can go for quarantine. In the list, the government gave names of hotels, universities, resorts and lounges. They also gave the location, full board rates in dollars, available rooms and the contact person(s). Some of the places include Hill Park hotel in Upperhill. On a full board basis, the hotel charges Sh7,000. There are 44 available rooms. Hilton Garden Inn is another facility located at the airport. Full board charges go for Sh9,000. There are 100 available rooms. Others are Safari Park, Pride Inn Hotels, Jacaranda Hotel, Trademark Hotel, Four points Sheraton, Boma Hotel. Kenyatta University, Kenya School of Government, Crown Plaza airport, Mombasa beach hotel, LaMada hotel are also included in the list. But Kihika who is also the Majority Whip in the Senate said most of these passengers are Kenyans returning from overseas and it is unfair to subject them to the extra costs.
