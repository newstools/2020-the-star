Health CS Mutahi Kagwe last Friday reported the country's first covid-19 case. The World Health Organisation on Sunday said there were 273 confirmed Covid-19 cases in Africa in 26 countries with 6 reported deaths. In some of the churches across the country, greeting by hand, hugging and also provisions of lunch has been suspended until further notice. Some of the members worshipping from home meanwhile have been urged to use the church pay bill numbers for their tithes and offering. In giving Holy Communion to the sick, the Kenya Conference of Catholic Bishops has asked priests to observe a high level of hygiene, washing of hands before and after the Holy communion or anointing the sick to avoid any infection. They also stated that strong measures should be followed especially before carrying out any assistance on the Altar by the servers and any extraordinary minister who comes in contact with the liturgical items or Eucharistic species. CITAM said they will provide hand sanitisers in all their ministries. "On behalf of our presiding bishop, and the entire CITAM family, we pray for God's protection on the people of Kenya and his continued favor upon our Nation," they said in a tweet. These measures will continue until the threat of the virus is abated. The Seventh Day Adventist church in Ranen Conference administrative area has cancelled all planned and ongoing crusades over fear of coronavirus. The conferenceâ€™s director, pastor Bering Ngore said all churches in the conference that covers Migori and part of Homa Bay counties have been instructed to cancel the crusades and inter-church gatherings.
