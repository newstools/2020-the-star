The government has rolled out the distribution of free sanitisers to Kenyans beginning Sunday. This is aimed at cushioning Kenyans from the hiked prices of the commodity after it became scarce in the market since March 13 when the first coronavirus case was reported in the country. Sources told the Star that the sanitisers produced by the oil industry will be available across the country through the offices of area chiefs where Kenyans will pick them. Last week, Head of Public Service Joseph Kinyua issued a directive to Kenya Pipeline Corporation to work together with private manufacturers to produce the alcohol-based sanitisers to be distributed to the public for free. The Health Ministry made the recommendation after it established retailers had hiked prices. As a result, the government ordered the release of all ethanol held at various Ports and customs to be used to manufacture of the commodity. “Kenya Pipeline Company will utilise an accountability framework for the manufacture and distribution of the sanitizers,” Kinyua said. Three major oil marketers are expected to produce at least 20,000 litres of sanitisers daily to support the government's fight against the spread of coronavirus. Vivo Energy Kenya, Total and Ola Energy (formerly OiLibya) volunteered to produce alcohol-based sanitisers to meet the high demand for the disinfectant. The government plans to freely distribute the sanitisers to the most exposed individuals and sectors of the economy like the Public Service Vehicle Operators. The programme also targets densely populated areas among them Kibera, Mukuru and Mathare slums in Nairobi, eateries along Mombasa road, and the Likoni ferry among others.
