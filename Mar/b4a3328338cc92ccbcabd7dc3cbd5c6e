BBI has become a political pigsty where the politicians roll in mud as Kenyans watch. When Kenyans witnessed President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga shake hands as a symbol of peace and unity, the people were assured of a peaceful country and a government that would prioritise developmental projects. Kenyans were indeed happy that the handshake would bring about a people-minded government that would set aside all ethnic and political differences. However, long after the iconic handshake, the Building Bridges Initiative has turned into a rift, creating more division than ever. All rallies that have been held are marred with political rhetoric, chaos and political intolerance displayed by politicians. The rallies should be centred on educating the people on the proposed changes and how the changes would forge development. Also, the people opposed to the campaign should have a chance to enlighten the people on the back draws of the proposed referendum and why the Constitution should remain unchanged. However, all citizens have witnessed is humiliation between the two sides as if it is a competition. In the recent BBI rally at Kinoru stadium in Meru, the politicians opposing BBI walked out of the rally soon after addressing the crowd. Yet the report is claimed to unite Kenyans â€“ politicians included. Furthermore, how can the BBI forge unity while the chief campaigners are at loggerheads? Ironically, most Kenyans do not know the content of the BBI report. Therefore, it is a waste of resources to campaign for a referendum that is foreign to the people. The leaders should go back to the drawing board and decide on an effective way of conducting civic education on the proposed campaign, together with how to work together in front of and away from the masses. Otherwise, it is all a waste of resources.  Nakuru
