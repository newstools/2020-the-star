 North Imenti MP Rahim Dawood has rubbished claims that he was selectively dishing out development projects by sidelining areas that did not vote for him. Former MP Silas Muriuki last week said Dawood had ignored the rural areas of the constituency in his development plans because residents did not vote for him. “The areas where I got a lot of votes are not given bursaries and infrastructure. When they ask, they are told to ask me because they voted for me,” Muriuki said. The former MP ran against Dawood and lost both in 2013 and 2017 to his successor. Muriuki said Dawood had sidelined Nyaki East, Nyaki West, Ntima East and parts of the municipality because he got fewer votes in the areas. He said roads in Meru town's central business district were full of potholes. “Gakoromone market is pathetic while Njuri Ncheke, Kirukuri, Mosque and Harambee roads are full of potholes. Meru town is neglected by MCAs and the MP,” Muriuki said. But Dawood denied the claims saying he had distributed equal funds to all wards since he became MP. He said he has done more than Muriuki did when he was MP. “For instance, in Bishop Lawi High School, Muriuki gave out only Sh200,000 yet I have given Sh1.3 million, at Chugu Primary School, he gave Sh650,000 but I have given Sh1.2 million and in Kirimatune Primary School, he did not give anything but I have already given Sh1 million,” Dawood said. He said he also lobbied for the tarmacking of Giaki-Miomponi road. Dawood said Muriuki is welcome to vie against him in 2022 but should stop mudslinging and seek for votes with honesty. “I am ready to face him in 2022. For now, let's finish BBI and delivering development as I pledged then we can begin campaigning,” Dawood said.  edited by Peter Obuya
