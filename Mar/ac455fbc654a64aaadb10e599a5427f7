A 10km executive race has been added to the 21st edition of the Safaricom Lewa Marathon set for June 27. Initially, the race which started in the year 2000, featured the 42km full marathon, 21km half marathon marathon and the 5km Safaricom junior race. The race also received a Sh30 million boost from Huawei and Safaricom PLC. The two giant corporates each contributed 15 million. Organisers expect the Lewa Marathon ambassador and world record holder, Eliud Kipchoge to grace the occasion. Last year's event was attended by among others two-time world marathon champion Catherine Ndereba, former world marathon record holder  Paul Teragat as well as First Lady Margaret Kenyatta. Last year's winners have been offered free entry and Sh150, 000 will be up for grabs for winners of this year's event. Organisers explained that the race is a fundraising event and does not run under the athletics rules hence the prize money cannot go beyond the set amount. Last year, the event raised close to Sh50 million but the figure is expected to rise. Online registration opens today and participants in both 42km and 21km will have to part with Sh20,000. The executive category attracts a fee of 50,000 while the junior race will require 3,000.
