The World Athletics together with the Government of Kenya and Athletics Kenya have postponed the World Athletics U20 Championships Nairobi 2020 (7-12 July). This is due to the ongoing challenges posed by the spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) internationally. In a statement released on Tuesday, World Athletics states that the current global situation would have seriously compromised the event at this time as many countries are restricting international travel, invoking necessary quarantines and advising citizens and event organisers to avoid mass gatherings. "We had to consider the health and well-being of athletes, officials and spectators in making this call. We recognise the immense preparations that have gone into the event and wanted to give certainty to the athletes as early as possible as we collectively come to terms with the global impact and threats associated with COVID-19," the statement read. The spread of the novel coronavirus is at a concerning level in many countries and all major gatherings should be reviewed without delay. "We are working together to identify a mutually appropriate alternative date convenient for the Government of Kenya and elite competitors," World Athletics added.
