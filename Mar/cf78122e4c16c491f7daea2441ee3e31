Homa Bay and Nyamira counties' secondary schools' Term One games earlier planned to start today have been postponed to next week. Kenya Secondary Schools Sports Association (KSSSA) Homa Bay County secretary, Gerald Onyango, said the games were moved to next week due to the delay in releasing funds. “We expect to start on Monday and finish on Thursday due to financial issues. Teams should continue training as we expect a highly competitive championship,” said Onyango. The games will be held at Asumbi Teachers Training College and Asumbi Girls. KSSSA Nyamira County secretary, Hesboniah Okerio, said their games will start on Wednesday next week and conclude on Saturday at St Kizito Nyansiongo High School in Borabu Sub County. “We expect to have referees clinic on Tuesday and teams arrive on Tuesday ahead of the action on Wednesday,” said Okerio. At the same time, Kisumu, Siaya and Migori will stage their championship as from today to Sunday. The Kisii County games started yesterday at Cardinal Otunga High School Mosocho. In Kisumu, the championship will be staged at Maseno School, according to KSSSA Kisumu County secretary George Osura. Hosts Maseno School are favourites to lift the basketball and rugby titles while Kisumu Day coach Booker Odhiambo is confident of retaining the hockey trophy.  Sinyolo Girls will also be eyeing to defend their hockey title. Sinyolo were re-admitted to the games after a one year ban imposed on them for fielding an ineligible player was lifted. In Siaya, the championship will be staged at Siaya Medical Training College (MTC), Kirindo primary and Muhala.  Muhala will host rugby 7's and 15's while MTC will host hockey, basketball and handball.
