A women’s organisation has proposed that hotlines and services for all victims of domestic abuse should be listed as essential services and kept open. Collaboration of Women in Development (CIWD) says law enforcers should be sensitised on the need to be responsive to calls from victims. The call comes in the wake of reports of brutal force meted against residents in Mombasa and other parts of the country by security officers during curfew hours. CWID executive director Betty Sharon said this will ensure \the pandemic does not inadvertently lead to more trauma, injury and deaths during the curfew period, given the high rates of violence against women perpetrated by intimate partners. While supporting Kiambu Governor James Nyoto’s initiative to provide water for residents and his Mombasa counterpart Hassan Joho's plan to provide food to residents, Sharon called on the President to give orders of water supply to households in slums and rural areas. “These are places where women struggle to get water for washing hands and cleaning market products. Availability of the commodity will decrease the spread of the virus as women would struggle to observe social distance whilst fetching water,” she said. Sharon said there was a need for collaboration at the grassroots to ensure the spread of coronavirus was curbed. “A woman who lives in a 10 by 10 house, has four children and has to buy water that can only flow from the tap twice a month, how do we help her not to be infected or spread the virus?” she asked. The official said women constitute the largest percentage of the unemployed population in the country. “We have women at the market centres and those engaging in small businesses. They should be provided with access to clean water,” she added. Edited by Henry Makori
