Embu residents have been urged to stop treating foreigners with suspicion following the confirmation of three Covid-19 cases in the country. Health executive Patrick Waganagwa said not all foreigners are infected with the coronavirus which has killed more than 7,400 people across the world. Waganagwa said most of the foreigners in the county are engaged in road construction and other projects and had not been out of Kenya for a long time. Wagangawa, who spoke in his office when he received protective gear from the national government, said the county has set aside an isolation ward with 20 beds at Embu Level 5 Teaching and Referral Hospital. Each of its level 4 hospitals has 10 beds, five males and five for females. He said the only people of concern are those who arrive from countries with confirmed cases. The Health executive was reacting to reports that some residents were treating foreigners differently. Waganagwa called on the residents to thoroughly and regularly wash their hands with soap and use sanitisers to prevent infection. Churches have banned handshaking and provided sanitisers to congregants. Supermarkets like Naivas and hotels are also requiring visitors to use disinfectants before entering the facilities. Canan Hotel has placed water and Dettol disinfectant at the entrance and inside for clients to wash hands at entry and exit. The Salvation Army church also placed water at the entry and a notice informing the faithful to wash hands before entry. The Reverend Paul Kithuka of Bishop Kims’ Methodist Church told the faithful to stop the habit of standing outside the church shaking hands after service. “I advise all our church members to cooperate and take time to wash their hands before entering the church, and also carry handkerchiefs,” Kithuka said.
