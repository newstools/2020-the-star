The Prince of Wales has tested positive for coronavirus, Clarence House has confirmed. Clarence House said Charles and Camilla were now self-isolating at Balmoral, adding that the prince has been working at home over the last few days. An official statement read: "In accordance with government and medical advice, the prince and the duchess are now self-isolating at home in Scotland. "The tests were carried out by the NHS in Aberdeenshire, where they met the criteria required for testing. "It is not possible to ascertain from whom the prince caught the virus owing to the high number of engagements he carried out in his public role during recent weeks." The prince's last public engagement was on 12 March, but the Press Association news agency reported he subsequently had a number of private meetings with Highgrove and Duchy individuals, all of whom have been made aware. A number of the household staff at Birkhall - the prince's residence on the Balmoral estate - are now self-isolating at their own homes. A palace source said the prince has spoken to both the Queen and his sons - the Dukes of Cambridge and Sussex - and is in good spirits. According to the latest Department of Health and Social Care figures, there are now more than 8,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK - although the actual number of cases is likely to be far higher. Some 422 of those patients have died.
