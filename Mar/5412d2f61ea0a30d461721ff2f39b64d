Kenyan international Philip Maiyo has turned to coaching as he mulls over his retirement as a player. Regarded as one of the most successful volleyball players in the country, Maiyo has started attending classes in readiness for his coaching career after playing professional in over 10 countries. Maiyo, who is a product of Malkia Strikers' coach Paul Bitok, said he has been attending coaching classes as he hopes to plunge into club management. “My retirement is just around the corner and I have to start thinking of what next after playing,” said the lanky player. Maiyo has, in the meantime,   urged the government to build more indoor facilities in a bid to attract more youths. “Volleyball in Kenya has struggled because it is mostly played outdoor yet 90 per cent is supposed to be indoor,” he said. Maiyo, who is also the Kenya Volleyball Federation (KVF) North Rift vice chairman, said his career as a pro has been confined indoor yet he is forced to play outdoor whenever he comes to the country. “While out there, we play indoor but the game in the country is basically outdoor. This makes it very difficult to adopt such a play. The government should build facilities to host big matches but for now, we have to live with such conditions,” he said. Maiyo’s last posting as a professional player was in Japan, where his contract elapsed last year. “My contract ended in Japan last year and now am free. I want to emulate Bitok (Paul) who has been a very helpful coach in my volleyball career. I know it will not be easy but I am ready for it,” he added.
