Posta Kenya has partnered with Jumia to offer a discount in delivery of goods to customers outside Nairobi. All customers will only pay Sh116 to collect their orders from Postal Pick Up Stations. This partnership is in line with the continuous commitment from Jumia and Posta to ensure Kenyans have access to essential goods during the coronavirus outbreak. “We are proud to collaborate with Posta Kenya to reduce the price of delivery for customers countrywide at this critical time,” Jumia Kenya CEO Sam Chappatte said. “E-commerce platforms like ours, with e-payment and last mile delivery capabilities through partners like Posta, are in a good position to be part of Kenya’s response to this pandemic.” When shopping on Jumia, customers will have the option to pick products from a Post Office closest to them during the checkout process, the products will be dispatched to the selected office for collection. “We will avail buckets of clean water and soap in all our stations to ensure proper hygiene standards,” Postmaster General and CEO Posta Dan Kagwe said. According to the World Health Organization, the risk of contracting the virus from a package that has been moved and exposed to different conditions and temperature is low. As a result, shopping online is safe as it allows customers to avoid busy markets, malls or supermarkets.
