Normal operations have resumed at the Mbagathi Hospital after its nurses called off their strike. Speaking to the Star on Monday evening, Mbagathi Hospital chairman George Osewe said the decision was arrived at after a consultative meeting involving the hospital's management, National Government and Kenyatta National Hospital representatives. “There was a disconnect between KNH and Mbagathi where the nurses from the county felt left out in the preparedness on coronavirus. Therefore. It was agreed that more staff should be brought in at the facility as we prepare to handle cases on the coronavirus," Osewe said. The chairman stated that health staff from both Mbagathi and Kenyatta vowed to work collectively as Kenya grapples with coronavirus cases which stands at three. Nurses at the facility had downed their tools Monday morning citing negligence and lack of proper training from the government. In addition, both staff from KNH and Mbagathi will undergo all necessary training required to handle suspected cases and patients with the pandemic. “We have agreed that training will not be done selectively. Mbagathi being a county facility all nurses will be trained together with those from KNH,” Osewe said. Personal protective equipment will also be equally distributed among nurses. “Safety of the nurses is also considered as a matter of priority. We shall ensure they are well protected to provide the necessary equipment. But as for now, we are back on normal with all nurses on board,” he said. Mbagathi Hospital owns the isolation block for patients infected with the coronavirus. The former 120-bed maternity block was transformed into a 40-bed capacity block following President Uhuru Kenyatta’s directive last month.
