Controversial singer Muigai Wa Njoroge has a new political song, 'Muri Mururu' 'Bitter Root) that is trending as number one on YouTube. Muigai says the song targets a bitter root that has grown in Uhuru's leadership, which needs to be uprooted. "Those who hate Raila can claim it is him I'm referring as the bitter root, while those who hate Uhuru like me can call him the root, but my message is that I am supporting an agreement between Ruto and Uhuru," he told Word Is yesterday. The chorus of the song calls for urgent uprooting of the root. He sings in part: The bitter root is causing division among the Kikuyu community. Leaders, Kikuyu Council of Elders and church leaders, it is now upon you. A story is told of three cows that for a long time were grazing together in the field, but they ended up being killed one by one due to their foolish cunning. There is this bridge you are referring to as BBI. You all saw its repercussions. Nyoro, a one-hour-old governor, chasing his brother (Moses Kuria) in Kitui. Asked what his intentions are, Muigai said he was given the message by God to pass to Kenyans. "My message is home and the song has been embraced, that is why it is trending. If we don't organise ourselves and meet in the backstage, our children will hate and curse us," he said. He promises to release more songs as directed by God. "I speak the truth and I will continue passing the message according to what God wants me to," he said. This is not the first time Muigai has ruffled political feathers with a scathing song. He has other political songs like 'Kimendero' (Oppressors) and 'Tukunia' (Sacks), in which he claimed the President had dumped his deputy, William Ruto. "It is like aborting a seven-month pregnancy, which is risky and might result in the death of the mother," he sang.
