Wrangling between MCAs and the executive over the allocation of pick and drop-off points to matatu saccos has spilt out of City Hall. The executive accuses the legislators of interfering with its functions, picking out the assembly’s acting clerk Monica Muthami for censure. Muthami is said to have appointed Jeremy Kimathi to be issuing pick and drop off points and communicating the same to the National Transport and Safety Authority through a February 3 letter. The executive says that contradicts the County Government Act which disallows a member of the county assembly to directly or indirectly be involved in the executive functions. On February 7, Kimathi extended Expresso Limited Sacco route to cover Kiserian- Rongai-KNH-Kenyatta Avenue–Ambassador-Moi Service Lane–Railways-Kabiria-Dagoretti Market and Karen. “You are further reminded that only the vehicles picking and dropping passengers will be allowed into the terminus and the company or sacco will be required to look for their own holding ground,” he said. He also approved a route extension request by Latema Travellers Bus and Safaris Company Limited to operate Kangemi-James Gichuru-Lavington-Kawangware-Kabiria-Ngong Road-Kenyatta Avenue-Odeon. Last month, City Hall halted the issuance of licences to matatu saccos after realising that  420 unregistered saccos have been operating in the CBD. NTSA records showed that only 272 matatu saccos were registered.
