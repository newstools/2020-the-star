A man charged with defiling his 14-year-old stepdaughter will remain in police custody after the Makadara senior resident magistrate denied him bond. Court documents say the man defiled the minor between February 14 and March 12 in Marurui area Kasarani subcounty, in Nairobi. In an affidavit filed before Makadara senior resident magistrate Lewis Gatheru, police constable Maureen Wanzila said that he needed 14 days to detain the suspect at Kasarani police station pending investigations. Wanzila said that she is yet to fill a P3 form and to record a witness statement. “Your honour the suspect, in this case, was arrested on March 17, we do require more time to detain the suspect as we complete the investigations,”  she said. The suspect had asked the court to free him on bond since he is a sole breadwinner to his family. The prosecution objected, saying he might interfere with investigations owing to the fact that he is closely related to the complainant. Gatheru ordered the suspect to be remanded at Kasarani police station. The matter will be mentioned on April, 3
