The Mo Ibrahim Foundation has failed to find a leader suitable for is its Achievement in African Leadership Prize for the second year in a row. Former Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf won the prize in 2017 but the committee was unable to award any past leader in 2018 and last year. The 2019 prize committee chairman and 2008 winner Festus Mogae said Thursday that no one met the criteria to get the $5 million award spread over 10 years "It is awarded to individuals who have, through the outstanding governance of their country, brought peace, stability and prosperity to their people. Based on these rigorous criteria, the Prize Committee could not award the Prize in 2019," Mogae said. Foundation chairman Mo Ibrahim said that Africa is facing numerous challenges but leaders have failed to turn them into opportunities. "Africa is facing some of the toughest challenges in the world â€“ ranging from those connected to population growth and economic development to environmental impact," Mo Ibrahim said. He said the foundation was optimistic that they will be able to award the prize to a worthy candidate soon. The prize is awarded to a former democratically elected African executive head of state or government who left office in the last three after serving their constitutional terms. Former South Africa President Nelson Mandela bagged the inaugural honorary laureate in 2007. Other leaders who have won the prize are former Namibian President Hifikepunye Pohamba (2014), the ex-Cape Verde leader Pedro Pires (2011), the former President of Botswana Festus Mogae in 2008. The committee did not get a winner in 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013, 2015, 2016 and 2018. (edited by O. Owino)
