A Cabinet Secretary is said to be tactically pushing to have one of his longtime girlfriends appointed to a lucrative parastatal. A source in the ministry has confided to Corridors that the board had already shortlisted three individuals but was taken by surprise when the CS directed re-advertisement of the position. Those in the know say the CS has already directed the board to do all within their means to ensure that the lady is shortlisted in the next interview. *** An abrasive MP is the talk of town. Reason? It is said the woman has taken over mundane duties at a crucial ministry along Harambee Avenue. Staff at the ministry are distraught that the MP has relegated herself to the point of serving as a desk girl elbowing junior staff . Corridors understands that the MP could be in financial strain and has now resorted to be a puppet in press conferences and rallies . Junior staff were amused when she walked into the office and demanded to know what the visitors wanted from the ministry and quickly dismissed them. To her shock, the visitors told her that they were taxpayers and could not share with her the issues at hand as they were personal and could only be handled by the CS . Just how low can a honourable MP sink ? *** When religious leaders under the umbrella of United Clergy Alliance appeared before the Building Bridges Initiative last week, one man of the cloth made a rather peculiar proposal. He suggested that marathons should never be held on Sunday since its their day for worship. And when he was asked to suggest what should be done to those who worship on Friday and Saturday, he said the two days should be also free of marathons. But being a businessperson also, one wonders if the man of the cloth could give his employees a day off during a weekday just for them to participate in a marathon.
