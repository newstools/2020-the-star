 A man accused of forgery has been remanded at the Central police station in Nairobi because prisons are not admitting more inmates due to the coronavirus outbreak. Alvin Okulo Owino had absconded a court session in a forgery case. He was presented at the Milimani Law Courts on Wednesday following a warrant of arrest. The court conducted its proceedings under a tree owing to the Covid-19 lockdown that has left many Judiciary functions suspended. Owino is accused of forging a Local Purchase Order dated January 4, 2018 purporting it was from Smollan Kenya Limited for the purchase of 40 laptops valued at Sh3.5 million. He denied the charges and was released on a bail of Sh200,000. Owino then failed to appear in court for a period of one year and three months which resulted to the issuance of the warrant of arrest. The court heard that his father - Nicholas Owino - who was his contact person was arrested last Thursday and detained for failing to produce his son. But the accused yesterday told the court that he was not able to appear in court because he has been unwell and was admitted at Mater Hospital. He produced a document to support his claim but magistrate Zainab Abdul declined to touch it for fear of the Covid-19 outbreak. The document was held some distance apart as she read its contents. The accused’s brother who was also present said the family was not aware that Alvin was sick and admitted to the hospital. “We have our differences, I do not even know where he lives,” the brother said. The magistrate said the accused should have informed the court of his predicament. She said owing to him having failed to attend court, he is a flight risk and the remedy is for him to remain in custody until his case is heard and determined. Abdul ordered that Owino's father be released forthwith. The case will be mentioned on April 20.  edited by peter obuya
