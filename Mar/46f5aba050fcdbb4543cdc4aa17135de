Kenya Lionesses will play Colombia in a Rugby World Cup qualifier at the RFUEA ground next month. Colombia edged Brazil 23-19 at home over the weekend to set up a mouth-watering clash against Kenya. The winner heads to the repechage in June to meet other regional qualifiers at a venue to be identified by World Rugby. The Women's World Cup will be played in New Zealand next year. Kenya finished second to South Africa at the African qualifiers in Johannesburg in August last year. The team has been training since the beginning of the year and head coach Felix Oloo said they know what to expect from Colombia. "As a technical bench, we know what to expect from Colombia. They are a physical side who would want to dominate the setpieces and the collisions and so we must be wary of that threat,” said Oloo. Apart from qualification to the repechage, ranking points will be at stake for both teams with the Lionesses ranked 25th and the South Americans placed 29th in the world. Oloo termed the game as one of the biggest in the short history of the Lionesses. "It's a huge game with so many ramifications. It's a one-off game which means we cannot afford to lose the opportunity to progress to the next stage,” added Oloo. Oloo said the team will play build match amongst themselves ahead of the encounter. Meanwhile, April will be a busy month for rugby fans with the Enterprise and Kenya Cup finals. Elsewhere, the Impala will host a doubleheader as the Kenya Cup season enters the playoff stage this weekend. Hosts Impala will tackle Mwamba in the first playoff match at 2pm. The winner goes on to face log leaders Kabras in the semi-finals. Homeboyz will face Menengai Oilers in the second fixture with the winner facing champions KCB in the last four.
