Witemere slum residents in Nyeri will not pay water bills for the next one month to boost hygiene standards. The Nyeri Water and Sanitation Company (Nyewasco) in a statement signed by managing director Peter Gichaaga said the decision was made following consultation between the national and county governments. Governor Mutahi Kahiga said this was meant to provide clean water to residents to curb the spread of coronavirus. Frequent washing of hands with soap is one of the ways to prevent the spread of the virus. “All Nyeri residents require clean water to maintain high standards of sanitation, especially in the wake of the Covid-19,” the governor said. “I have directed Nyewasco to waive water bills for all residents of Witemere, which is a highly populated area.” County commissioner Loyford Kibaara visited the area and paid water bills for the prepaid water kiosk located in the informal settlements. Nyewasco set up a water kiosk in Witemere in August 2019 to sell water to residents at a low cost. On Wednesday, the Nyeri county assembly urged the executive to direct water companies to waive water bills for those disconnected after they were unable to pay bills. MCAs also called on the county government to ensure there is a regular water supply to homes that have piped water. Edited by A. Ndung'u
