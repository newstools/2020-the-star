There will be no development if leaders are subjected to one term in office, Kenya Chamber of Commerce and Industry Vihiga chairman Billy Nyonje said. He said the county will end up with many stalled projects that will not have an impact on residents. Nyonje addressed the press in his office in Mbale town on Monday. "There is a need to give our leaders a second chance to finish their work in office and their predecessors should be people who understand how the government of the day is moving," he said. He added that some leaders assumed offices with huge pending bills that bar first-timers from performing. The chairman said Governor Wilbur Ottichillo should invite the anti-corruption agency and DCI to investigate where the pending bills emanated from, adding that those in the office during that period should be held responsible. "The first term is like orientation in the office. Elected leaders need to rearrange themselves on what will be done with whom to work with, seek partners from various areas and so on. Â Then in the second term, that's when these leaders are now implementing their plans properly." Therefore, the outgoing official should be held responsible for any pending bills. He cautioned that if the proper projection is not done, the county would sink further into the current mess it is in. "Ottichillo should seek development partners to help him develop the county as he struggles with paying pending bills. Projection of Ottichillo's projects in the county will help this county grow first," Nyonje said. "Assemblies should also be of help with proper oversight to help the county to grow economically in all subcounties." Edited by R.Wamochie
