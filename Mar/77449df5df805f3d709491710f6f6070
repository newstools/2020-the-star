The IEBC said on Thursday it was not aware of Polycarp Igathe’s resignation as Nairobi deputy governor. The electoral commission said it never received a formal communication about his resignation. The commission was responding to the county assembly, which sought an advisory opinion last year after Governor Mike Sonko was charged and barred from accessing his office by the court. “On the vacancy in the office of the Deputy Governor, Nairobi county, the commission has not received any formal communication as to the alleged vacancy other than information in the media,” the letter signed by IEBC Director of Legal and Public Affairs Michael Goa reads. According to the letter, there was no resignation, meaning there is no vacancy in the office of the deputy governor. However, the same IEBC cleared Sonko’s deputy governor nominee Anne Mwenda to be vetted for a position they never declared vacant. Last month, a city ward representative put the electoral agency on the spot for allegedly clearing Sonko's deputy governor nominee without ascertaining whether there was a vacancy in the office. Minority chief whip Peter Imwatok claimed that Mwenda had been cleared for a seat that had not been declared vacant. Igathe resigned as Governor Sonko's deputy in January 2018 over what he said was "failing to earn the trust of the governor". Igathe had said that he wished to resign to avoid "abusing or betraying my oath of office to Kenyans, Nairobians and my family."  The seat has never been filled. Upon resignation, Imwatok argued that the governor ought to have communicated to the speaker who then would have written to the electoral commission regarding the resignation. He said the commission was quick to gazette a returning officer to clear the nominee before declaring the position vacant.
