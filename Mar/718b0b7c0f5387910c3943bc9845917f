Papa Dennis's twin brother Papa Simon says he will keep his brother's music alive. Speaking to Word Is on Wednesday, Simon said he will make sure the songs he recorded are released and video shot. "Papa was very hardworking and there are many songs still pending. I will make sure I shoot videos to keep his music alive," he said. Papa Dennis was found dead in Pangani last month. The cause of his death is still being investigated by the DCI. Simon said a month before Papa died, he had mentioned to him he was under some pressure and was not okay. "I encouraged him that everything was going to work. Little did I know he was to die that soon," he said. “We were shown how a person who has fallen from the second floor of a building looks like and if you compare that with how Papa Dennis looked on the night he passed on, they don’t match.”
