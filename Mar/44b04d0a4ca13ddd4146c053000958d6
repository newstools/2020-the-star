ODM party leader Raila Odinga has hit out at Deputy President William Ruto over his stand on storing his 'riches in heaven'. Without naming names, Raila who was speaking during Kiambu businessman Nginyo Kariuki's burial on Tuesday said people should also invest on earth. "Unity in diversity. We want to deal with this cancer of corruption.. that walking around in sacks of money in terms of harambees and investing in heaven here on earth. We want you to invest here on earth for development not for heaven because ultimately all of us will go to heaven," he said. "Kenya deserves a super league not a super league of corruption. We will not be distracted ...we want to ensure that tomorrow Kikuyu's work anywhere and Luo's work and marry here and be recognised as Kenyan and other tribes as well." In 2018, Ruto told off critics of his frequent countrywide tours and harambees, especially for churches. "Some people condemn me for going around, raising money here and there and in church. It’s up to them. I’m investing in heavenly matters. If you want to invest elsewhere, that is your right," Ruto said. Raila has always questioned the source of Ruto’s funds, which he has been donating in harambees across the country. The AU envoy also challenged Ruto to take a lifestyle audit, saying he is living beyond his means, as his salary is known.
