Kenya Lionesses are drawn in a tricky Pool 'C'for the inaugural HSBC World Rugby Sevens Challenger Series women’s event to be hosted in South Africa on March 28-29. Felix Oloo's charges will face Argentina, Scotland and Colombia in Pool 'C' in a tournament that brings together 12 teams that have qualified from all six world rugby regions. At stake is a coveted core place on the prestigious World Rugby Sevens Series for the 2021 season. Hosts South Africa are seeded first and face China, Poland and Mexico in a favourable Group 'A' while Japan, who have made three guest appearances on the HSBC World Rugby Sevens Series this season as part of their Olympic preparations, take on Papua New Guinea, Kazakhstan and Belgium in Pool 'B'. The Sevens Challenger Series is a new competition designed to boost Rugby Sevens’ development across the globe. Oloo termed the Lioness pool wide open and said his charges will be ready for the event. “Our girls have grown in leaps and bounds we have nothing to fear in playing our rivals. We want to give a good account of ourselves," added Oloo The team has been training since  January in readiness for the event as well as the Langford Sevens event in Canada in May and the Tokyo Olympics in July. Elsewhere, Shujaa's poor form in the World Sevens Series continued over the weekend in Vancouver, as they lost all their three preliminary matches on Saturday. Kenya lost 29-0 to New Zealand in the opener before going down 14-12 to Ireland despite tries from Vincent Onyala and Billy Odhiambo and leading 12-5 at one point. Matters went from bad to worse for Paul Feeney's charges when they lost 17-14 to Spain to finish bottom of the group. Collins Injera scored a brace with Sammy Oliech kicking over two conversions. Shujaa were due to play Wales last night in the classification match for 9th position.
