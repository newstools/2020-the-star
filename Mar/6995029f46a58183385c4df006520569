The National Youth Service is not allowing visitors into the institution apart from those providing essential services. Not even civilians staying within the units are allowed to move in and out of their residences without a good reason. Director General Matilda Sakwa said on Monday they had restricted movement in all 22 NYS units across the country, including its headquarters in Nairobi, as a precaution to prevent the spread of coronavirus. “No visitors. We still provide food etcetera to our servicemen and women as usual,” she told the Star. “We are limiting those coming in for obvious reasons. Only those performing essential and critical services are allowed in.” The NYS boss said the institution is taking the government’s directives on the coronavirus seriously. “This is a home to those living here,” Sakwa said. The NYS's 22 units have more than 60,000 servicemen and women. Sakwa said since they were not closing down, they must take drastic measures to keep the servicemen and women safe. “We are working with the health sector, police, and the national disaster team that includes the KDF. As an auxiliary to police and KDF, we can’t afford to close down. We are in the team that is on standby in case of a crisis in the country.” Sakwa said they had provided their servicemen and women with adequate clean water, soap and sanitisers in all the National Youth Service Centres across the country.
