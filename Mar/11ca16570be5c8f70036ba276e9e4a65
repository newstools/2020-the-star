 A woman who pleaded guilty to assaulting her four-year-old son and breaking his arm will serve two and a half years in prison. The decision by a Nanyuki court comes despite Immaculate*, the mother, appealing the sentence imposed by a lower court. She was charged with assault. She is said to have assaulted her child on an unknown date at Baraka within Laikipia county. As revealed in court documents, it appeared the mother had repeatedly tortured the child by biting him all over the body, leaving him with bleeding wounds. “She had also otherwise assaulted the child to the extent of breaking one of his arms, which necessitated taking the child to the hospital,” the affidavits read. While the assault was ongoing, a social worker at the Nanyuki Teaching and Referral Hospital was informed of the child’s injuries and sought to confirm. After seeing the child, the social worker confronted the mother who said she assaulted the child after the child’s father left her.  The social worker then reported the matter to Nanyuki police station leading to Immaculate's arrest. While delivering his judgement, Justice Joel Ngugi said, “It is difficult to understand how a mother who has carried a child in her own womb could be so beastly to the child who has done no wrong." He further questioned how Immaculate could blame her child for being left by the child’s father. “The sentence meted out to the appellant for the beastly assault on her own child was well-deserved.  It was not manifestly harsh or excessive, and this court has no reason to interfere.  This appeal against sentence has no merit and is hereby dismissed," Justice Ngugi ruled.
