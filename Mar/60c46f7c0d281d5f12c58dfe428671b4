Meru National Polytechnic on Monday was closed indefinitely after students went on rampage to protest the killing of a learner. Electrical engineering student Eugene Nyongesa is said to have been killed by criminals near Gheto area. Principal Geofrey Rukunja said the student appeared to have been hit in the head with a blunt object and then strangled. “His pockets were inside out, an indication they stole from him. The rampage is as a result of rampant insecurity in the area,” he said. Rukunja said the student buried his father last week. He said they held a security meeting two weeks ago with the area's deputy county commissioner over increased insecurity in Gheto area. The principal said that after other students learned of the death, they rioted and started destroying property, including burning kiosks and rental houses suspected to be criminal hideouts. They also barricaded two link roads – Meru-Nanyuki and Meru-Maua. "I don’t know why police are afraid of cleaning up Gheto area and flushing out those criminals. We have closed the school until further notice. Police have told us to close the school, so they can deal with insecurity,” Rukunja said. Meru county police  commander Patrick Lumumba told the Star they were trying to contain the situation. The students said security agencies did not act on the grievances they raised three weeks ago. In October last year a student from the institution was killed by suspected criminals. His body was found outside the door of his rented house in Kaithe. Edited by A. Ndung'u
