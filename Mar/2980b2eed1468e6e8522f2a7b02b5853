Hawkers and idlers have been told to stay away from Eldoret town to prevent the spread of Covid-19. County police commander Johnstone Ipara said on Monday that only those seeking essential services will be allowed in the town. He spoke at Eldoret central police station. Ipara said police officers have been instructed to arrest anyone defying the directive. “Starting today, we shall not allow people to loiter in the CBD unless they have come for essential services like medical check-ups, to buy food or have come to work,” he said. Earlier in the morning, a team of officers led by OCS Mike Lekailel drove round the town in a police Land Cruiser mounted with a loudspeaker telling people who have no business in the town to leave or face arrest. “Anybody found loitering within the CBD will be arrested and locked up in a cell,”  Lekailel warned. Meanwhile, 14-seater matatu operators in North Rift have hiked fares after they were restricted to carry only six passengers at a time. Chairman Fred Wamu said they had been forced to increase fares to cushion the matatu sector from collapsing. Those travelling from Eldoret to Kakamega will pay Sh400 up from Sh300. Passengers travelling from Eldoret to Kitale will part with Sh300 up from Sh200. Those travelling from Eldoret to Nakuru town will pay Sh600 up from Sh400, while the fare from Eldoret to Bungoma has been increased from Sh300 to Sh400. The county police commander asked the matatu operators to stick to the new fares until the situation normalises. Edited by A. Ndung'u
