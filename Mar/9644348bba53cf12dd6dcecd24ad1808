The closure of non-performing medical schools by a technical team of members from across EAC states is a major step since health personnel determine the welfare of the nation. Medical education calls for a profound change in the way it is taught and learned - a change which provides the welfare society needs, wherever a doctor practices. It is certain that medical education must be based on a healthcare system with global thinking and local implementation in an interconnected world. Governments and medical students need to implement cohesive strategies including pre-medical school outreach courses, admission policies that recognise diversity of geographical background and experiences, tuition and scholarship support to make medical schools affordable. Appropriated compensation for irregular working hours and provision of regular paid leave can aid in the motivation of the staff for better performance.  Nakuru
