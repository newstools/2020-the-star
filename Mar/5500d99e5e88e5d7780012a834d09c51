Kilimani, Westlands and Kibra residents are likely prone to contract the novel coronavirus. This was after the majority of contacts who were traced after getting in contact with the 50 patients who contracted Covid-19 were located. In the map seen by the Star on Tuesday, the majority of the contacts reside in Kilimani, Kibra, Westlands, Makadara, and Starehe subcounties. Other include; Kamkunji, (Embakasi East, West, Central, North and South), Roysambu, Langata, Kiambaa, Kajiado North, Kasarani. Only nine estates were identified for not having the contacts. They include; Ruiru, Mavoko, Kiambu, Kabete, Limuru, Kikuyu, Dagoretti, Kajiado East Health CS Mutahi Kagwe said from the 50 infected persons, the contact tracing had risen to 1, 426 people because Kenyans were flouting social distancing. With only a curfew currently being enforced, the county of Mombasa is particularly at risk as thousands of daily commuters at the Likoni ferry fail to maintain social distancing. On Monday, Kagwe announced that Kenya has recorded eight more coronavirus cases putting the country's total number to 50. The CS said Nairobi now leads with 37 confirmed Covid-19 cases followed by Kilifi (6), Mombasa (4), Kajiado, Kwale and Kitui with one each. More than 720,000 people have been infected across the world and around 34,000 have died from coronavirus. The government announced on Sunday that at least 1,000 medics will be hired in the next week to handle the rising number of coronavirus infection. The new medics include nurses, clinical officers, lab technologists and doctors, among others.
