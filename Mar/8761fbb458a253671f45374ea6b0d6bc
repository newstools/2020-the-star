Mandera Governor Ali Roba on Thursday said not much has been achieved in the war on al Shabaab. He was reacting to Wednesday evening's terror attacks in Jabibar, between Bambo and Rhamu town. In the first incident, a Land Cruiser belonging to Takaba police station that was heading to Mandera struck an improvised explosive device planted in the road. No one was hurt but the vehicle was extensively damaged. Shortly after, a Makkah bus heading to Mandera from Nairobi was ambushed at the same place and passengers ordered to disembark. A non-local mechanic who was in the bus was taken hostage and the rest released. Some passengers were beaten up. The mechanic is still missing. In a third incident, two vehicles heading to Mandera – one belonging to the Public Service Management CEC and a Land Cruiser ferrying miraa – were attacked. No one was hurt. Later, a canter believed to be carrying drugs from the Kenya Medical Supplies Authority (Kemsa) was stopped at the same spot. The driver and turnboy – both non-locals – were taken away. It was later reported that the lorry had been burned to ashes. The driver and the turnboy are still missing. Mandera county police commander Jeremiah Kosiom confirmed the attacks. He did not disclose details about the three people who were abducted. Roba said the four attacks happened in an area where there are plenty of security officers. “It is disturbing and unfortunate that al Shabaab continue executing their heinous acts. In these particular incidences, they did so for over three hours, undeterred by security forces," he said. "While the government has provided all the support we have asked for in terms of security personnel, it seems we are not making any progress." He said the county has been turned into a battlefield for foreign forces. "The interest of these foreign entities seems to have superseded that of Kenyans in Mandera,” Roba said. Edited by A. Ndung'u
