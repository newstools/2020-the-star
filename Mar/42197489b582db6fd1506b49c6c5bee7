The Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe has said that the seven patients with confirmed coronavirus cases are recovering well. The CS said that the seven are closely being monitored by the medics and their update will be issued. "The seven patients are in stable condition. We began the test today to see whether any of them might have turned negative," Kagwe said. The CS said that the government has screened 600,000 people who have made entry into the country. "We have screened over 600 people. We have tested 172 people out of which seven have turned positive," he said. Kagwe has also asked Kenyans to utilise the toll free line 719 to report suspected case. Also, the CS has asked Kenyans not to take the law into their hands by punishing people with suspected cases. He expressed hope that Kenyans will be reasonable and responsible. "For Kenya, we are confident of what we are saying. let us not look down upon ourselves. If we behave we will prove our critics wrong," CS said. On Wednesday, the CS announced that three new cases of the virus had been confirmed rising the number to 7. The CS said all the cases were as a result of importation especially from Kenyans who travelled from overseas countries. “The threat that we are now facing is from Kenyans who visited overseas countries.  As we contemplate on further measures, we are meeting at Statehouse with the executive and we shall be announcing a few measures we wish to take going forward,” he said.
