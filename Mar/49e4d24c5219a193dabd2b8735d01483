There was panic in Karagita in Naivasha after a flower farm worker was wheeled into the estate's health centre with coronavirus-like symptoms. An ambulance was dispatched to collect her but after a screening, it was established that she was suffering from the flu — to the relief of area residents. Nakuru county Health chief officer Samuel King’ori said the patient is stable and is undergoing treatment. “The woman was treated for the flu and is recovering in the health centre and there is no reason to get worried,” he said. Residents said water shortage in bus termini and lack of sanitisers are the major challenges in the fight against the spread of the coronavirus. Businesses including the matatu industry have been adversely affected. Trader Mary Wangari from the Naivasha open-air market said they were being forced to buy water and sanitisers daily. She challenged the county government to address the water problems so that they can maintain the set hygiene standards. “We have been forced to procure water at least twice in a day for cleaning our hands and we appeal to the county to assist us get sanitisers,” she said. Joseph Isah said that water was critical to stopping the spread of the killer virus. “We are making sure that all our customers wash their hands before entering the market but we need more water for this exercise to be successful,” he said. Matatus operators' chairman Stephen Mungai said the outbreak of the virus had left area residents in fear. Mungai said that business had dropped sharply with the number of travellers going down since the week began. “We are making sure that our vehicles are washed after every trip and we have enough sanitisers for our customers every time they are boarding our vehicles,” he said. Mungai attributed the drop in the number of passengers to the recent move by flower farms and hoteliers to reduce the number of their workers due to the crisis caused by the disease.
