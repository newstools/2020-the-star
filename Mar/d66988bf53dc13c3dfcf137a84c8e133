ODM party leader Raila Odinga termed the late Lawrence Nginyo Kariuki as a man who gained his wealth the hard way. While eulogising Nginyo during his burial on Tuesday, Raila said they met with him on many occasions including politics, where he said he was a multiparty fighter. "He was a great man. A man who was self-made who came from down and became what he is in life. If you talk about hustler, Nginyo is the person who is the real hustler," Raila said. He went on to add the handshake between him and President Uhuru Kenyatta will not be distracted. The former Prime Minister said that they are determined to end corruption in the country. "Nginyo believed that if we bring unity among our people and remove tribalism, Kenya can thrive," Raila said. He further described him as a stylish man who loved cleanness which was maintained even in his hotel. ANC party leader Musalia Mudavadi eulogised Nginyo as a peacemaker and a man who was ambitious for his country. He said Nginyo championed for multiparty democracy in the country.

Kiambu Senator Kimani Wamatangi said the county lost a great leader and a businessman. Siaya Senator James Orengo said the late businessman wanted a united country, calling upon politicians to shun bad politics. Baringo Senator Gideon Moi said Nginyo was a self-made man who gained his wealth through hard work.
