Kenya Cup playoffs are set for March 14  following the end of the group phase over the weekend. Homeboyz, who drew 22-22 with champions KCB at Jamhuri Park, finished third on the log with 67 points and will host Oilers who finished sixth. It is Oilers' first appearance in the post-season after gaining promotion to the top tier of Kenyan rugby last season. The winner of that match will face champions KCB in the semifinals on March 21st. Fourth-placed Impala will battle it out against fifth-placed Mwamba at the Impala Club. This will be the third meeting between the two teams this season with the Sarries winning the first encounter 26-24 and Mwamba making amends in the return leg, to grind out a  15-11 victory. The winner of this match will face table-toppers Kabras in the last four. Kenya Cup final is slated for April 4. Kisumu RFC and Western Bulls were relegated after finishing 11th and 12th on the log. Mwamba coach Kevin Wambua said the play-offs will be a different ball game. “It's anybody's game. I can't say there are favourite as victory will boil down to tactics and the error rate," he said. Wambua was, however, happy with the side's momentum having won three of their final group stage matches. They beat Kisumu 50-12, Impala 15-11 and Nondies 55-24.  “It's encouraging that the boys have stepped up and we are relishing the challenge," noted Wambua. Oilers thrashed  Quins 39-13 in their final pool match to seal their spot. Coach Gibson Weru was delighted performance shown by his charges. "Our target this year was to make the playoffs and the boys delivered in style," added Weru. Weru said they must step up the intensity when they face Homeboyz in a fortnight. "It will be tough. We know they are a quality side and we will relish the challenge," added Weru.  The Enterprise Cup quarterfinals take centre stage this weekend.
