Kibra residents are living fear of the spread of coronavirus because of a lack of access to clean water. “We have broken sewer lines, poor hygiene and we don’t have any clean water,” David Chelagat, a landlord, told the Star. A spot check by the Star found that there were no hand sanitisers in many public places. Water was provided without soap but no one was using it. Some residents wondered why President Uhuru Kenyatta decided to give them internet instead of food during a crisis. They said they cannot work from home. “How does a mason and the internet relate? Where can someone use the internet in masonry?” a resident asked the Star. In court premises, officials were apprehensive of interacting with journalists. “You may be coming from Mbagathi Hospital to mingle with the victims and now you are here to spread it to us,” a court official said. Insecurity was reported, with residents claiming thieves were taking advantage of the situation to steal from them. “Thieves know that they cannot be taken to court and the police cannot hold them for long,” Aisha said.
