Bien and Chiki have already tied the knot today. The two said their “I do’s” is a secret wedding in Lavington at 11am Friday morning. The couple misled the press telling them the long-awaited wedding was set for tomorrow. In a past interview, Bien told Word Is, he will not have a white wedding because to him that is colonisation as thus he will have a traditional wedding. The list of invited guests included Sauti Sol members, several media personalities and of course bother their families. “The reason why nothing has leaked is that all the guest have been instructed to leave their phones at the reception. So if you call any celeb and they are Mteja, jua tuu wako on lockdown kwa wedding ya Bien.” The reason the wedding did to take place last year was that Chiki’s family was not available. The invites and location were sent yesterday night and location sent. Initially, they had been told it was lunch then they were told what it was last night. His boys who form the dustbin crew were also invited like Nameless, Nyashinki .
