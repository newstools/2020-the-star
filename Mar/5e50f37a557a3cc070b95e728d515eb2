Over the past five financial years, poor revenue results have been blamed on the weak performance of the top five sources: rates, single business permits, parking, billboards and adverts, and building permits. Rates, which has been the best performing stream, drew Sh2.3 billion in 2013-14 against a projected Sh3.1 billion. In 2014-15, Sh2.6 billion was collected against a target of Sh2.8 billion. And in the following year, Sh3.2 billion was collected against Sh3.8 billion. In 2016-17, the sector performed poorly; just Sh2.3 billion was collected against a Sh5.5 billion target, and in 2017-18 Sh1.9 billion was collected against a target of Sh2.8 billion. Last year, Sh2 billion was collected against the projected Sh3.6 billion. The county had projected to collect Sh1.8 billion in parking fees in 2013-14 but missed the target by Sh300 million. It collected Sh1.5 billion. In 2014-15, Sh2 billion was collected against a target of Sh2.8 billion, while in 2015-16, Sh2 billion was collected against Sh2.6 billion. In 2016-17 the county set out to collect Sh3.5 billion but managed Sh2 billion. In 2017-18, Sh1.9 billion was collected against the projected Sh3.2 billion while last year Sh 1.9 billion was collected against a Sh3 billion target. The county missed its single business permits target by Sh100 million in 2013-14; collecting Sh1.5 billion against the hoped-for Sh1.6 billion. It was also slightly off the mark the next year, earning Sh1.8 billion against Sh2.2 billion. In 2015-16, Sh1.8 billion was collected against Sh2.8 billion, while the following year, Sh1.8 billion was collected against Sh3.6 billion. In 2017-18, Sh1.8 billion was collected against Sh3.2 billion, and last year, Sh2 billion was collected, creating a shortfall of Sh600 million. In 2013-2014, the county had hoped to get Sh 2.2 billion from building permits but only managed Sh760 million. The following year, the county generated Sh1.3 billion and Sh1.2 billion in 2015-16 against a Sh1.7 billion target. In 2016-17, Sh843 million was collected against Sh1.7 billion, while in 2017-18, Sh239 million was generated against a projected Sh1.5 billion. Last year, Sh1 billion was collected against Sh1.5 billion. From billboards and adverts the county surpassed its target in 2013-14, generating Sh693 million against Sh520 million, while in 2014-15, Sh676 million was collected against a targeted Sh700 million. The county generated Sh663 million in 2015-16 against Sh800 million, while Sh720 million was collected instead of the hoped-for Sh1.2 billion in 2016-17.
