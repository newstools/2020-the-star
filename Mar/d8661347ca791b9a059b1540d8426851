United States International University-A Spartans have been boosted by the return of striker Vivian Esimi following an ankle injury. The maverick forward has been on the treatment table for the last eight months. Esimi got injured during the Betty Tioni tournament in Nakuru in July last year. The goal poacher returned to training early last month. Coach Willis Okeyo said her return is welcome and timely after suffering 1-0 loss against Blazers last weekend. Okeyo hopes to unleash the striker against newbies Wolverines this weekend. "It is a plus for us to have Vivian back in the team. She has trained and even played during the Kenya Universities Sports Association games," said Okeyo. "I believe she will definitely play a part in the coming match going by how she has trained and the response she has shown since coming back from the long lay off." The tactician is planning to rotate his squad too in a bid to get the playing unit up and running. Okeyo, who doubles up as a Kenya Police midfielder said the team needs to start taking their chances if they are to produce results. "We create chances but converting them is our biggest problem. We also need to improve our marking. Since the team is comfortable in midfield, the forwards need to step up and help the team," he observed. To solve the goal-scoring quagmire, the tactician is planning to hand forward Sheila Nazi a debut. He observed that Perez Akinyi, who has been deputising in the absence of Vivian also needs to step up. "Perez is a good player but she needs to hit the ground running. With everybody back in contention, we should be good to go," he concluded.
