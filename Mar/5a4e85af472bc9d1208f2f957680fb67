The Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Council on Saturday announced it had suspended Dr Pranav Pancholi and Avane Limited Medical Clinic's licenses for six months for advertising fake Covid-19 test kits. In the letter by KMPDC chairperson Eva Njenga, Avane was also ordered to pay a Sh500,000 fine in two weeks. The council had on Monday raided Avane clinic after it claimed to sell coronavirus kits for Sh3,000. The council in company of police officer arrived at Avane Clinic located at Yaya Center where they demanded to see the kits on sale. Avane Clinic, a dermatology and medical spa, had run a poster on social media days after the country announced it’s first case of COVID-19. In the poster, the clinic said they were selling 1000 test kits out of which only 400 pieces were remaining. The COVID-19 rapid test kits they stated, is a selt-test for early diagnosis and gives results in just 15 minutes. “No specialized equipment or training required. Sh 3000 only, offer while stocks last,” screamed the purple-themed poster. The move came days after Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe issued a stern warning against business people profiteering off the pandemic. The country has now confirmed seven Covid-19 cases.
