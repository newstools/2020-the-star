Starlets coach David Ouma wants to have both the right players and the right attitude for the  African Women's Cup of Nations qualifiers against Tanzania. Starlets will face Tanzania in the first round set to be played between April 6 and 14. The first leg will be played away. Starlets concluded their participation in the Alanya Gold City Women's  Cup where Kenya beat Norther Ireland Ireland 2-0 in the opening match before losing against Chile and Ghana in 5-0 and 3-1 scorelines respectively. Starlets took home the bronze medal, behind Chile and Ghana. The team jets back today. "We have learnt valuable lessons in the tournament. At the world stage, we still have a lot of work to do. Our discussion is on how we can bridge the gap," said Ouma. "We face Tanzania in the AWCON qualifiers and therefore there's need to find the right players and attitude. However, I want to commend the players for the fighting spirit. Despite being in pre-season, they could still compete." Gaspo's Sheryl Angach won the best midfielder while debutante Silvia Makungu of Kariobangi North, also a midfielder, gave the tactician food for thought ahead of the qualifiers. "Sheryl winning the award shows we are in the right direction. Makungu showed hard work and caught the eyes of the scouts, who were asking about her. We need to maintain the standards by competing at the highest level."
