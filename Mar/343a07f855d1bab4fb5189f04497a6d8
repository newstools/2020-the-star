Expect arrests over the illegal sale of blood to other countries, Health CS Mutahi Kagwe has said. "There has been gaps within this sector and we have asked the DCI to intervene in the system. We understand that there are people who are selling blood immorally," Kagwe said. Kagwe noted that Kenya blood bank has dropped to 164,000 pints against annual demand of 1m units. "There is an investigation going on and we expect arrests to be made." Speaking to the media on Thursday, Kagwe said they want to ensure that the donation of blood and how to manage it, is put on the ICT framework. These include a Bill to govern donation, processing and distribution of blood as well as setting up of an ICT system to trace the movement of blood from the source to the final stage. But he noted that they will create a framework that will immediately embark on the changes as they wait for the Bill to be debated upon in Parliament. Officers of the Kenya National Blood Transfusion Service are believed to be part of a cartel siphoning blood donated by Kenyans and selling it to other countries including Somalia.
