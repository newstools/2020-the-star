Friday marked the start of the 7pm-5am nationwide curfew as part of the government's measures to deal with the spread of coronavirus. It was not a smooth start at all and scenes from Mombasa, Nairobi and other major towns painted quite a sad and worrying picture. Police brutality, stranded passengers and surging crowds at the Likoni ferry marred an otherwise good measure to deal with the spread of the disease. While the government is urging people to stay at home, it is not possible for all to work from home. This is more so for factory workers, Jua Kali operators, shop attendants and others whose work demands their physical presence. Going forward, employers should review working hours to enable employees to leave work early enough to beat the curfew. Early reporting, say 7am, or working over lunchtime and allowing employees to leave by 3pm could help tackle the problems witnessed last Friday. For those who have no business in town, stay at home to ease the traffic movement and the demand for passenger service vehicles. We expect better today from the police, employers and employees to enable all to be at home safely before 7pm.
