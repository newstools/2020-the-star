Kenya Sevens team are seeking to improve on contact and tackling ahead of the London and Paris events in May. Kenya sevens technical director Paul Feeney said since his appointment six months ago, the team has never had tackling sessions and have on most occasions focused on attack, defence and setpieces. "We haven't sort of not focused much on contact and tackling sessions because we have had little time to do that. Most players feature for their Kenya Cup sides on weekends and come to training on Mondays tired. Now with the league on a break for the next month,  it gives us time to horn our skill in that area,” he noted. The team will resume training on Tuesday next week after a mandatory two-week quarantine break from the coronavirus. Subsequently, Feeney asked the Kenyan rugby fraternity for patience after a dismal show in Los Angeles and Vancouver, where they bagged nine points from both legs. Shujaa now rank 12th on the log with 35 points after six tournaments. “ I have only been here for six months and you can't compare me with the likes of New Zealand, South Africa and Fiji who have had settled teams for the past three to four years,” noted Feeney. From six tournaments played, Shujaa have only made it to two Main Cup quarter-finals. The New Zealand tactician said he was impressed with the performances of Oscar Ouma, Sammy Oliech and Billy Odhiambo despite fans and pundits tearing into their performances in the last two tournaments. “I'm satisfied with their display. Oscar and Sammy have not played for the last two years while Billy has been out for a  year. It's not automatic that they will back to their best form and that is why we have to be patient with them and give them a chance,” he noted. Feeney said he was building his side for the Olympic Games in July. “Our target is to be in peak condition by the time we head to Tokyo and I believe our consistency and performance will be good enough to contest for medals come the games."
