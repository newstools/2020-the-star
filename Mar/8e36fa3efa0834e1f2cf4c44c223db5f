Nandi county will roll out 15 new ambulances at a cost of S1.2 billion to improve emergency healthcare throughout the region. They will not be attached to a particular hospital. “The ambulances will serve patients depending on whichever is near the emergency location,” Sang said. The Kapsabet Hospital used to handle 200 outpatients daily but it has doubled in two years. The county has already cut by 80 per cent the referrals of patients from the region to the Moi Hospital in Eldoret and other institutions outside the county. The upgrade of health services means kidney patients for the first time can get dialysis at Kapsabet County Referral Hospital. The hospital can handle more than 10 dialysis patients weekly. Dialysis machines lying idle have all been put into use and the kidney unit is handling patients from neighbouring counties like Vihiga. The Kapsabet Referral Hospital and other health facilities have in the last two years received 150 additional nurses and other staff. “We have also trained the staff on attitude change and also improved their capacity along with their welfare so that they can concentrate on serving patients with dedication,” CEC for Health, Ruth Koech, said. Koech said collections from the hospitals under cost-sharing had improved from about Sh40 million annually to more than Sh100 million after the county automated all operations. It attributed the increase in large part to automated revenue collection and management of drugs and other services. All subcounty hospitals will also have upgraded theatres and digital equipment like those for X-rays and MRIs. The county plans to complete the expansion and upgrade of all hospitals in two years. Power supply to the county hospital has been upgraded with additional generators to ensure there is no power failure. (Edited by V. Graham)
