The Kenya national swimming trials slated for April 9-12 at Kasarani have been postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic. The country was expected to use the event to pick a team for the World Swimming Championships in Abu Dhabi, UAE in December. Kenya Swimming Federation (KSF) acting chairman, Patrick Muyah, said they will look for new dates for the championship once they are given the mandate by the government to resume sporting activities. "Once we get the go-ahead, we will look for new dates and we hope by then, the pandemic will have reduced and everything would have gone back to normal,” added Muyah. He noted that a review of all swimming activities and events will be done on April 30 or as soon as the circumstances allow. "We ask the entire swimming community to put the welfare of the swimmers' coaches and officials first and create a safe environment for all in line with the steps taken by the government. They need to exercise prudence and responsibility until it is deemed safe to resume any training and competition,” he added. Muyah has asked swimming fraternity to observe the government directive in the wake of the deadly disease. “We encourage all to observe the government directive on self-isolation, hygiene, social /physical and global travel restrictions,” he added. He said Kenya's four swimmers to the Tokyo 2020 Olympics—Emily Muteti, Issa Abdalla, Danilo Rosaflio and Maria Brunhelener—will compete in the championship. “I expect them to compete by virtue of them being our best swimmers,” he added.
