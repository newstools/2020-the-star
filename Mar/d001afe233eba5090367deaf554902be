Safaricom has unveiled revamped PostPay plans that will offer customers bundled voice, data and SMS with no-expiry. The new plans will be available on a 30-day basis with any unused resources rolling over to the next month. The new proposition also adds the convenience of customers joining from the comfort of their phones, removing the need to visit Safaricom Shops and fill application forms. “We are being true to that commitment by making it simple for our customers to join the new PostPay and introducing a transparent way for them to view their usage,” Chief Customer Officer Sylvia Mulinge said. In a statement on Tuesday, Mulinge said customers joining the no-expiry PostPay, will have the option of choosing from plans that are within their predefined credit limits or topping up to qualify for higher limits. Available to all PostPay customers and Prepay customers looking to join PostPay, the revamped plans will be offered at five price points ranging from a Sh1,000 plan with 5GB data, 400 minutes and unlimited SMS, to a Sh10,000 plan that offers unlimited data, voice and SMS. Customers on the new plans will be able to use their voice allocation to make local calls across all networks and international calls to India, the United States, China and Canada. “We have big surprises for our PostPay customers in the near future where we plan to offer additional destinations for international calling and also unveil a device financing model where customers can get a device as part of their PostPay plan,” she said.
