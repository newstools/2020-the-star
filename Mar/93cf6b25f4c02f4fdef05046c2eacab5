Football Kenya Federation are set to determine in the course of this week the fate of the five Betway Shield Cup round of 16 matches which failed to kick off a week ago. The matches, which were scheduled to be played behind closed doors, did not take off as planned after the first case of coronavirus was reported in the country on the eve of the weekend the matches were supposed to be played. Among the clubs, who opted out citing the government's directive to suspend all public gatherings and safety of their players, are Gor Mahia who were to take on Posta Rangers at the Afraha Stadium. KCB were scheduled to play Wazito at Afraha Stadium while Bandari would have hosted Sofapaka at the Mbaraki Stadium. The clash pitting Kisumu All-Stars and Keroka Technical Institute did not kick off too after the latter failed to show up at the Moi Stadium, Kisumu. Fortune Sacco were to play Bidco United at the Kianyaga Stadium. However, the trio of AFC Leopards, Ulinzi Stars and Kariobangi Sharks stuck by the federation's directive to play the matches and consequently booked a place in the quarter-finals. Leopards edged out Ushuru 4-2 on post-match penalties while Ulinzi gunned down Migori Youth by a solitary goal. Sharks humiliated FC Talanta 4-1. The federation was keen to deliver their verdict on the five matches on Wednesday last week but according to their chief executive officer, Barry Otieno, the ruling by the Sports Disputes Tribunal scuttled their plans. "We will endeavour to clear the air on the confusion lingering over those matches this week possibly by Tuesday. "We would have done it last week but the SDT ruling complicated everything. "Some members of the committee handling the matter are drawn from the federation's Executive Committee and the court ruled that their tenure had expired. "We will, however, ensure we determine on their fate in the course of the week, " said the former communications and public relations boss.
