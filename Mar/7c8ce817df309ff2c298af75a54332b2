Kenyatta University are optimistic of staging exemplary performances in various disciplines as they seek to win the overall title for the ninth consecutive time at the 2020 Universities Women’s Games starting Friday afternoon. KU are the undisputed champions of the games and are gearing up to maintain the status quo at Africa Nazarene University as they mark the International women’s Day celebrated on March 8 annually. “I have got good progress reports from our coaches and we are positive our women teams will put up gallant fights leading to winning gold in their respective sports ad in turn retain the overall trophy. We are at the top of most KUSA Nairobi Conference league standings which gives us morale and confidence,” noted Litaba. The KU handball team will be defending their title and coach Geoffrey Barasa noted that his charges are well prepared and will leave nothing to chance. “It takes the efforts of each and every team to for the University to rank top so we are ready to go all the way. We have played several teams in our build ups including our men’s team, Kenya Defence Forces sides Ulinzi and Kahawa Baracks and several Boys’ High School teams. The girls are well polished and ready to roar,” said Barasa, formerly a sports officer at St. Paul’s University. In basketball, KU will be seeking to reclaim the title that the University of Nairobi snatched them in 2018 and made it back-to-back wins in 2019.
