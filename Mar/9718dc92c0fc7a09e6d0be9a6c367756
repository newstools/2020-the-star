Muslim leaders from Kwale want the national government to provide for citizens as they observe the directives issued in efforts to contain Covid-19. Led by the Supreme Council of Kenya Muslims acting chairman Hamisi Mwaguzo, they urged the government to help citizens, especially those who depend on hard labour to earn a living. "When you tell people to stay at home leaving them with nothing yet their daily bread comes from moving around, what will they eat?" he asked. Maguzo said as much as they are not opposed to the government directive, starvation could turn out to be another disaster. “Too many restrictions will result in something else," he said. The cleric said if necessary actions are not taken, crimes such as burglary might surge. They added that places of worship should be left to operate but under strict rules. Mosques and churches should be frequently fumigated and all followers displaying flu-like symptoms should avoid congregational prayers and stay at home, Maguzo said. Kenya Muslim National Advisory Council acting secretary general Sheikh Amani Hamisi asked the government to intervene and see that debt collectors extend the loan repayment period to cushion clients. “We have so many people who took loans from mobile apps, banks and many agents but this is not the moment to put pressure on them,” he said. Council of Imams and Preachers of Keya official Abubakar Omar advised landlords to ensure clients observe proper sanitation and report anyone who might show signs of Covid-19 at homes.
