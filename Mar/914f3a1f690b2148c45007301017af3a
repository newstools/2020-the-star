The bodies of two casual labourers who were buried inside a pit latrine they were working on in a Limuru school on Tuesday were retrieved on Wednesday. David Kibiro 35, and Peter Mbugua, 40, were constructing a foundation for a toilet on the 80-foot pit when loose soil collapsed. Kiambu county fire brigade worked with the police to retrieve the bodies. They were taken to Tigoni Hospital Mortuary. When the accident happened, co-workers at Rwaka Primary School in Kiambu county shouted for help, attracting villagers and pupils. "Other workers started screaming when they saw the toilet caving in with their colleagues. The two were covered by the topsoil," James Kibe said. Police and Ministry of Education officials were called to asses the situation. Area director of education Stanley Murage closed the school until the workers' evacuation was complete. “This can only be one or two days. There is nothing to worry about. We did not want our learners to be traumatised by the whole incident,” he said. Area MP Peter Mwathi has sent condolence messages to the two families. "It so sad to lose two energetic young men at ago in the same village. It is painful, let us all support and pray for the two families to have strength at this moment" the MP said. The legislator urged institutions and locals to wait for rains to subside before digging or working on latrines. “Let us look for ways of avoiding such incidents by digging toilets when it's dry or during the dry seasons" the MP urged.
