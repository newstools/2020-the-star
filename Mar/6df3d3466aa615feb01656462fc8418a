A voter in Mandera has opposed the nomination of Leila Abdi Ali as a member of the Teachers Service Commission. Ali Maalim argues that the candidate has a questionable educational background. He further claims the candidate is not a resident of any of the Northeastern counties — Mandera, Garissa, Marsabit and Wajir. The nominee's identity card shows that she was born in Mogadishu, Somalia, in 1979. The Education committee chaired by Tinderet MP Julius Melly on Thursday said she was fit to be vetted but Maalim argues she is unfit to represent the region. In her response, Leila said she is born of a Kenyan mother who delivered while on a trip to Somalia. "My grandfather Ali Kabati was a freedom fighter and was Thika mayor for 40 years. He was recently honoured for his efforts in the fight for freedom," Leila said. She says she was raised in Loitoktok and went to DEB Primary School, Loitoktok. Leila says she lost her parents at seven years and had challenges accessing education. "Our community did not value girlchild education," she said. "I had teachers who were supportive and there is evidence that I went through school," she said. The committee requested her to bring documentation of her parents' citizenship. She has dual citizenship — British and Kenyan. Leila says she is a graduate of UK's Leicester University. "My early life experience birthed my desire to promote education." Leila is currently a senior auditor at Becker Merali and once served as a revenue officer at Kenya Revenue Authority.  She is also involved in an NGO in Kajiado which places girls in school. Leila also chairs an audit committee at the Competition Authority. Edited by R.Wamochie
