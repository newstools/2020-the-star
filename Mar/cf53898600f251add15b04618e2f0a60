The Education ministry has been accused of ignoring the role played by members of the Kenya Braille Technicians Association in ensuring that the blind access education. “We are an important team without which blind students in Kenyan formal schools cannot access education. We translate learning material to braille and de-braille learners’ test answer papers for the examiners,” national chairman Dominic Mulei told the Star on Sunday. He censured the government for being insensitive to their plight and grossly underpaying them. There are 34 Braille transcribers in primary schools, colleges and universities. Braille transcribers are trained and qualified yet they earn peanuts because the ministry does not have a scheme of service for them, Mulei said. “Despite the donkey work we do, we earn between Sh3,000 and Sh15,000 a month.  We are the underdogs of the Kenyan education system,” he said. And to add salt to the injury, the wages do not come regularly. “We are only paid when grants are released to schools. At times the grants delay for up to six months. Ours is a dog’s life,” Mulei lamented. He called on the government to regard Braille transcribers as any other TSC employees, improve their salaries and also provide them with a scheme of service. The chairman said the government should improve their terms of engagement. “We do not want to punish poor blind learners (through industrial action). The government should address our plight,” Mulei said. He is based at Central Primary School in Kitui town. Kitui county director of education Adano Salesa said the association has never complained about their terms on employment. “All I know is that we have a number of them in our school. At no time have they ever raised a complaint,” Salesa said by phone. He promised to consult and give a comprehensive response to the issues raised.
