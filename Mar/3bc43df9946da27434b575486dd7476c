The government is in a dilemma – it has no funds to guarantee the enrolment to the university of thousands of students who sat last year's KCSE exam. The Treasury, according to the Education ministry, budgeted funding for 90,000 students, the same number of as those who qualified for university admission in 2018. However, those who qualified for university placement in 2019 were 125,000. The fate of 35,000 students is unknown. In January, Education Cabinet Secretary George Magoha announced that the government will admit all students who secured the university cut-off mark of C plus in the 2019 KCSE exam. It's now up to the Treasury to increase funding so that the 35,000 can join universities. The disclosure is part of the budget policy statement presented to the National Assembly Committee on Education on March 3. Essentially, the Education ministry wants an increase of Sh6 billion to its budget in the coming financial year 2020/21 to cater for the unforeseen growth. The earliest lot of new admissions is expected in September when the university academic calendar is rolled out. "The KCSE results for 2019 candidates was released after the resources allocated to the Education sector had been shared across various sub-sectors," the statement reads. The ministry also sought Sh1.3 billion to provide loans to students enrolling to the institutions this year. “The universities are currently underfunded and struggling to meet their financial requirements. In view of this we are requesting for additional Sh6 billion for grants and Sh1.3 billion for HELB loans to stabilise the universities and cater for the additional 35,000 students,” the policy statement reads. The government allocated Sh42 billion for students in both public and private universities in the 2019/2020 financial year. Out of the amount, Sh2.5 billion is given to the 40,000 students in private institutions while Sh39 billion goes to the 279,000 students in public institutions. Ideally, the government should pay 80 per cent for each student under the Maximum Differentiated Unit Cost while the remaining 20 per cent is shared between parents and universities. A total of 89,486 students qualified in 2017, 90,755 in 2018 and 125,000 last year. Public universities are struggling to stay afloat financially with the VCs blaming it on poor funding by the exchequer. The University of Nairobi is, for example, grappling with a Sh1.4 billion deficit.
