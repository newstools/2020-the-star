Street families in Mombasa want the county government to provide them with clean water and sanitizers. They say the county government has neglected them. Kapili Juma said they have only heard about coronavirus from passers-by. “The street is our home. I was born here at Makadara grounds and I have no other place to call home,” he said. “The county government appears not to be aware that we live on these streets. We have young children who eat and sleep out, so I am pleading with them to provide us with clean water and hand sanitisers.” Atanas Boaz who lives at Maboxini streets said the government only remembers them "when police come to arrest us". He complained that no one cares about their health and general well-being. Mary Danga said, "We are human beings and if this virus attacks us it will definitely get to other people because we interact with them on the streets.” Health committee chairperson Swaleh Kibwana told the Star on the phone that his team will meet health chief officer on Thursday to discuss how street families can be protected from coronavirus. Nominated MCA Fatuma Swaleh, the health committee deputy chairperson, said it was the duty of the government to protect everyone, but people should also protect themselves by taking precautions.
