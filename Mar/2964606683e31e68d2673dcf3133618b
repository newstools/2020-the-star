YouTube has announced the launch of the Stay Home #With Me. The campaign began with a YouTube music festival over the weekend. The festival will feature African artistes performing some of their hits via a YouTube live stream for their fans, who are currently practising social distancing in an effort to flatten the curve of new coronavirus infections in their communities. Fans will be enjoying free live performances from Nigerian and South African artistes, such as Aṣa, Simi, SeyiShay, Reekado Banks, Broda Shagi and Timi Dakolo on their respective YouTube channels. Content partnership manager for YouTube Africa Addy Awofisayo said, “The Stay Home #With Me online music festival seeks to support the well-being of our community, who are increasingly enduring this disease in isolation - a state that can affect people's mental, emotional and spiritual health."
