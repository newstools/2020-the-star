The Wire association recently launched the Women in the Built Environment Survey, which also saw women leaders get awarded. They also had an engaging panel discussion on 'Equality, Diversity and Inclusion in The Real Estate Industry of Kenya'. The event was in line with the International Women's Day theme #EachforEqual:Â Equality is not a women's issue, it's a business issue. The event took place at The Node, Jacaranda Hotel, Westlands, Nairobi.
