The Ministry of Health has reiterated that the government has only one central reporting system which is mandated to give information to the public regarding coronavirus. Health Director General Patrick Amoth said this on Thursday during the press address on Covid-19. This comes after Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya announced that Kakamega County had confirmed one case of the virus. “We have to appeal to the county governments that we have one central reporting system so that we are consistent throughout our reporting in line with WHO requirements,” Patrick Amoth said on Thursday. The DG said the case that was reported by the governor is about a patient who is already isolated at Mbagathi Hospital. He added that the patient is from Kakamega, which might have prompted the governor to report his case. He said that going forward, the ministry will scale up its testing capacity. The Covid-19 patients have increased to 31 following the addition of three more cases confirmed. Two patients from the three are from Kilifi while the other one is from Nairobi.
