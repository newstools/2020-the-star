There was drama in Parliament on Tuesday as MPs demanded that Eldas MP Adan Keynan leave the House over claims he had just arrived from London. Endebes MP Robert Pukose rising on a point of order, asked Speaker Justin Muturi to order the MP out for the sake of members’ health. “The commissioner just arrived from London, for the sake of the health of MPs, I ask you to order him to leave the chamber. This is a serious matter,” Pukose said. Muturi ordered the Eldas MP out and urged members who travelled recently to self-quarantine for 14 days. Earlier, Health CS Mutahi Kagwe confirmed another coronavirus case, raising the number to four. "The latest case was confirmed today at our national influenza laboratory..the patient travelled from London, United Kingdom," Kagwe said on Tuesday. "Tracing of persons who had been in contact with the person is ongoing." Addressing the media, Kagwe said tests for two out of the 22 people who were quarantined last week turned positive. "Confirmed cases are healthy, with no dangerous signs." Kagwe said everyone coming into Kenya from a country affected by coronavirus must self-quarantine or risk being jailed. "It is mandatory," he said. Kagwe said they have so far tested 111 people in Kenya since the pandemic shook the world.
