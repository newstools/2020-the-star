Residents of flood-prone regions of Nyando in Kisumu county have expressed fears that they could be displaced if rains pounding the area persist. They are also concerned that in the event of displacement, they would be given temporary shelter in crowded camps, despite the outbreak of coronavirus. By Thursday, areas within East Kano such as Achego, Katolo, Manyatta and Ayueyo had begun flooding. Caren Omanga, human rights defender, said they are unsure how they will go to the rescue centres whereas they are not supposed to be in crowded areas. Motorists have been warned to avoid the Ahero-Katito road which was rendered impassable due to heavy rainfall at the Ayueyo area. Road users were advised to instead use the Sondu-Kapsoit-Kericho road as an alternative. Ombaka chief Jacob Ongudi said flash floods had been experienced in the area, but they expected worse to come. The area is among those that are perennially worst hit by flooding in Nyando. Ongudi said if the situation gets worse, locals will be forced to relocate to the rescue centres. It will be difficult to enforce social distancing, he said. The administrator asked the county government to ensure that sanitisers, soap and protective gear are sent in large numbers in the area so that residents can maintain hygiene. Kisumu governor's press boss Aloice Ager said the county has enough rescue camps and that the disaster management teams were on the ground assessing the situation. Ager told the Star that there were some people that were still living within the camps after being affected by backflow from Lake Victoria as others integrated with family members. “What we are working on is how to manage their provisions, enforce social distancing and ensure proper sanitation,” Ager said. Early this month, more than 600 families were displaced in parts of Nyando after rising levels of water in Lake Victoria resulted in a massive backflow. (edited by o. owino)
