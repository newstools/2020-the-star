Highly-rated national team attacking midfielder Moses Ademba believes time is ripe for him to move to Europe after completing his studies. The Butali Warriors creative player turned down the opportunity to play in Germany with club VfB Stuttgart September last year, choosing to first get done with his degree in Electrical and Telecommunication Engineering at Multimedia University. Having graduated, the speedy midfielder is now open to a move abroad. However, such a switch could be impossible during the May transfer window due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. The attraction to play in better hockey facilities and under renowned tacticians leaves the player optimistic that he can hone his skills in the shortest time possible. "Last year was not the best time for me to go but I am more than ready to gain a different experience should another opportunity present itself. Germany remains my preference but heading to the Netherlands won't be a problem as well because they are advanced in terms of the game and have the best teams. I hope to improve my passing, vision and finishing because I am open to learning," he said. The 23-year old was part of Team Kenya to the Olympic qualifiers last year and also represented the country at the under 18 level in Zambia in 2014. He played in the Super League for Multimedia from 2014-2018 before signing forÂ  Butali in 2019 alongside Calvins Kanu, Amos Barkibir and Francis Kariuki. With the league expected to resume once the coronavirus pandemic is over, the diminutive player wants to better his last season's four-goal tally and hit double figures in terms of assists. "Retaining the league is a priority for the team. Individually, I would want to score as many goals as possible while providing assists for the forwards," said the former Friends School Kamusinga player.
