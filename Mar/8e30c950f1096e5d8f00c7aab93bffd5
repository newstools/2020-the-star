A Kitui priest who flew into the country on Monday has apologised for flouting the government's self-quarantine rules. Fr Nicholas Maanzo left his Kiara village home on Tuesday night and went to withdraw cash at an ATM. The Catholic priest said he was disturbed by reports he had arrived in the country from Italy. “I came from Ireland. It is totally misleading and a move to whip up public anxiety for the media to claim I came from Italy,” Maanzo said. He told the Star he was reprimanded by the Kitui Central police boss Nzioka Singi and threatened with arrest. He promised to stick to stringent self-isolation guidelines until the mandatory 14 days are over. The priest dismissed reports he went into a supermarket in Kitui on Tuesday night. “I went to an ATM and got some money but I didn’t go into Magunas supermarket because I found the facility closing and was not allowed in,” he said. “I will not leave my house again before the lapse of the 14 days. Besides, I am also planning to call medics to come and take my samples for testing just to confirm my health status.” On Wednesday afternoon, Singi - who was accompanied by county health officers - visited the cleric after reports emerged he had been seen in Kitui town on Tuesday night. “You are just lucky that you do not show any signs of illness. Health officers have confirmed that your temperature is okay and you do not suffer from illness. But you must know that you committed a serious mistake by leaving your home to go to town,” Singi told the priest. The police boss reprimanded the priest saying he had endangered the lives of the public. "Should it emerge that you are sick, you will be arrested and charged", he said. Edited by R.Wamochie
