We have no capacity to face coronavirus that has made its way to Kenya, Vihiga Senator George Khaniri has said. Khaniri urged residents to adhere to all precautions to curb the spread of the virus. "Medical experts have not yet found a drug can be used to treat or control the virus. Therefore, we need to remain vigilant on this matter," he added. Khaniri was speaking on Saturday at the funeral of Brian Aluda of Kenya Prisons at Mungabo Primary School in Vihiga. His remarks were backed by former Governor Moses Akaranga, who was also present at the funeral. Khaniri, later on, went to Esikhuyu PAG church in Emuhaya subcounty where he met women groups for a fundraiser. "Coronavirus is no joke. People have died globally.Â Let's take the precautions given out there for our own safety." He added that the virus would not have broken out in the country had the government banned flights earlier. There are two isolation rooms that will be used at Mbale Referral Hospital if the virus is detected in the county, the senator said. Edited by R.Wamochie
