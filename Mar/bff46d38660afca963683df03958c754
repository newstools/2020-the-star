  The Directorate of Criminal Investigations has been urged to expeditiously investigate defilement and rape cases in Machakos for victims to get justice. At the same time, parents and guardians should never negotiate with those who ruin girls' lives, Machakos Woman Representative Joyce Kamene said on Saturday. Kamene, who spoke at Machakos Women's Prison during the International Women's Day celebrations, said the courts dismissed many defilement and rape cases due to lack of evidence. She did not understand how suspects end up leaving the courts free men even after the DNA tests. Kamene said more than 10 students sat their Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education examination in a certain school last year 2019 when they were pregnant. "It was very disappointing.Â  Twelve of them were pregnant," she said. More than 1,000 defilement and rape cases were registered at Kathiani sub-county hospital last year. Deputy county commissioner Kennedy Nyamboga urged parents not to negotiate with the culprits and instead report them to the police. Nyamboga told the Star that only 14 of the registered cases have been successfully prosecuted. He called on local people not to make it difficult for the police by not reporting the incidents before the evidence is erased. "The problem is that they feel like they are shaming the community so they end up hiding these cases. They should not compromise a child's rights. Let them come out and help us to ensure justice is served," he said. Last year, 27 learners failed to sit their final exams due to pregnancies. "Some even delivered during the exams," the administrator said. No rape or defilement case has been reported since January. "We are dealing with last year's 1,115 cases. I urge the community to help us by not hiding the suspects," he said.
