The ethics agency has arrested former Kilifi Health chief officer Timothy Malingi and two others in connection with Sh23 million graft probe. The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission accuses Malingi, Cornell Otieno and Jackline Atieno of an irregular tender award and illegal acquisition of public property. Otieno and Atieno, who are married, are directors of Skyward Agencies Limited. Detectives from the EACC carried out two simultaneous operations in Miritini Mombasa where they arrested Atieno and Otieno and in Kitengela where they picked up Malingi. The three will be transported to Malindi on Tuesday where they will be arraigned. EACC Upper Coast regional office manager said the trio will be charged with Sh23 million graft during the construction of dispensary and two latrines in Vishakani, Kaloleni ward in the 2016-17 financial year. “The suspects will be charged with failure to follow guidelines and procedures of the Procurement Act on the proposed construction of dispensary block and a pit latrine at Vishakani, Kaloleni ward,” the official said.
