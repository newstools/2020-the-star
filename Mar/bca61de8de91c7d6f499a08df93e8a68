Mombasa government will hire 27 nurses to combat the coronavirus pandemic. An advertisement on the county’s website announced vacancies for a six-month contract. The nurses to be registered must have all the required documents to apply. The duties and responsibilities include assessing, planning, implementing nursing interventions and evaluating patients’ outcomes, providing health education and counselling patients and community on identified health needs, and ensuring a tidy and safe clinical environment. Candidates must have a diploma in either Community Health Nursing, Midwifery, Nursing, or Mental Health and Psychiatry. Additionally, the applicants should have a registration certificate issued by the Nursing Council of Kenya, a valid practising license from the council and a certificate of computer application skills. They must also satisfy the requirements of Chapter Six of the Constitution of Kenya. Due to the urgency of the situation, candidates have been asked to send applications online by 4.30pm Thursday. “Only those applying for the position of registered nurse will be considered. Fill in the online application form after reading the instructions inside the form,” the advert read. On the sidelines, the Covid-19 measures taken nationally – including reducing the number of visitors to patients in hospitals – have caused confusion at the Coast General Teaching and Referral Hospital as visitors are left stranded at the entrance. There is a notice at the hospital's entrance that states only one visitor is allowed between 12.30pm to 1.30pm. Edited by R.Wamochie
