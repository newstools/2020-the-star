Artistes have praised MCSK for distributing Sh37.5 million to musicians from licensing performance in public places. Some 60 per cent of the amount will be distributed through data from radio and TV airplay and 40 per cent generally to members, the Music Copyright Society of Kenya said. Speaking to Word Is, Jua Cali said it is a good step to even call for a press conference and announce such because there has never been a press conference in the past. "I would like to encourage other artistes who have not registered with MCSK to do so, so they can start making money as well," he said. Jua Cali then said transparency between the artistes and MCSK will help the industry grow. Nyashinski, who was among the top earners, took to Instagram to thank his fans, the TV and radio stations for supporting his music and told the other artistes that they could borrow loans from him. “To all the stations who play my music and all my fans who request for it... a big ‘Thank You’ for supporting and for giving my ideas a chance. I appreciate you. 😊❤️ To all the other artists, congrats and keep up," he wrote. Octopizzo commented, saying there has never been transparency. He thanked President Uhuru Kenyatta for supporting artistes after declaring content service providers will channel all payment of royalties. Sauti Sol were the top earners.
