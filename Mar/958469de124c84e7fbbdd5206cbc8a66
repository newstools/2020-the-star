The Kirinyaga government has rejected sanitisers it had ordered from two companies for failing to meet 75 per cent alcohol content. County procurement director Carilus Otieno said the sanitisers, which were delivered on Wednesday, Friday and Saturday last week, were declined after they were tested. The two suppliers, he said, will have to supply sanitisers with the required alcohol content within 14 days. Otieno said the Ad Hoc, Inspection and Acceptance Committee after examining the goods found them to be of lower quality than expected, hence declaring them unfit for use. “The Kirinyaga government is committed to guarding all residents against anything that would compromise their lives, especially during this time of the coronavirus outbreak. We cannot afford to put the lives of Kirinyaga people in danger by purchasing low quality sanitisers,” he said. The county government had contracted the two companies to supply it with the sanitisers in 500ml and 100ml bottles for provision to the county’s hospitals and other public institutions to prevent the spread of coronavirus.
