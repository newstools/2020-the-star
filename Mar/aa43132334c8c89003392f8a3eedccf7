Seven people suspected to have been infected with the coronavirus have tested negative, Kisii Health executive Sarah Omache has said. Omache said one person is in quarantine in Kenyere, Bobasi constituency, and samples have been taken for testing. “We are waiting for the results to confirm the status of the individual,” she said. She said residents should not panic because the Kisii administration has put in place necessary measures to combat an outbreak. The Kenya Medical Training School in Kisii has been turned into an isolation centre, she said. Omache urged residents to regularly wash their hands, avoid shaking hands and observe social distancing. “I'm urging our people to observe safety measures put by the government. We should understand that the disease is real,” she said. Meanwhile, Kisii County Governance Watch secretary Rachel Otundo has condemned police brutality against residents during the enforcement of the curfew. Otundo said the police should listen to the explanation given by residents for their failure to obey the curfew instead of applying force. "It is so disgusting to see the law enforcers brutalise people who struggle to beat the curfew deadline,” Otundo told the Star on the phone. She said the virus is real but the government and other stakeholders are determined to beat it. All citizens should remain disciplined and follow the regulations, she said.  (edited by o. owino)
