Severe actions taken by individual East African countries against the coronavirus are unlikely to work unless they are coordinated in the region, former presidential adviser Joe Nyaga has said. The former adviser on integration for President Uhuru Kenyatta on Friday commended some strict measures. But he said closing boundaries, which some counties have done, may not succeed at all. Nyaga was the minister for Cooperative Development He said the laws among the countries are related and the counties are also bound by the East African Protocol that allows daily trade among them. The politician said Kenya, Rwanda, South Sudan, Tanzania, Burundi and Uganda need to properly harmonise their actions and avoid recklessly passing the virus from one country “I urge the six Presidents of the East African Community and their specialists to hold an urgent summit to come up with a joint approach to ensure smooth coordination of the fight against the coronavirus, Nyaga said. “So when President Kenyatta tries to close the border alone but other counties in the same trading community do not, it's not going to work," Nyaga told the Star on the phone. He said it is better for the leaders to agree to work as a unit, noting that In Europe France, Germany, and some other countries are coordinating and  Germany has closed its border in close coordination with her neighbour France. Nyagaalso said the preventive measures must protect the poorest of the poor. He said there are complaints it’s only the rich who are being helped and questions arise why a hawker in Kibera,  who relies on manual work for a daily wage, is not directly helped. “There should be measures to helpet the person who lives from hand to mouth,” Nyaga said.
