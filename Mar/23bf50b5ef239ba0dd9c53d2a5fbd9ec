Last Friday, children were in school, weddings and funerals were going on as usual and businesses, though very worried, hadn't seen the worst. On Monday, all that changed to anxiety and worry. Businesses are facing job losses, even closure,s as they cannot visit their Chinese suppliers. The government confirmed on Sunday that three people had contracted the virus that originated from a passenger who had visited the US. That's how serious the situation is. Although they are many people (174,115) who have survived the virus so far, another 6,684 have died across the globe and countries that delayed preventive measures are grappling with it now. We must all support the government's aggressive efforts and those by county governments if we are to minimise deaths and economic pain of the disease. Most governors, such asÂ  Hassan Joho and Wycliffe Oparaya, and many industry chiefs have taken their cue from President Kenyatta and taken their own anti-virus steps. We must all develop a war-like mentality against the virus. Looking at how Europe, especially Italy, has dealt with the issue, it is clear a slight change in habits isn't enough. We must, therefore, prepare ourselves for eventual lockdown and support the government if the outbreak becomes widespread.
