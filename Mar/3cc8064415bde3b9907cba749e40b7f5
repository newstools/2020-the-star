The late administration officer Sergeant Kipyegon Kenei will be laid to rest on Saturday at Chemasis village, Nakuru. His death has attracted public interest and several politicians are expected to attend his burial. Deputy President William Ruto is among the leaders expected at his final send off since Kenei was among the security officers attached to his office in Harambee Annex. Kenei will be laid to rest even as the Director of Criminal Investigations George Kinoti continue to unravel the people behind his death. Addressing the media on Thursday, Kinoti said Kenei's death was well executed by the powerful individuals. "We have identified the persons of interest and that will be the focus of our investigation going forward," Kinoti said. Kenei's father challenged Kinoti on Friday to publish the names of those who delete information from his son’s phone. John Chesang wants the Director of Criminal Investigations to "make public its findings without censoring the truth". Chesang spoke during the funeral service of his son at Umash Funeral Home in Nakuru county. Kenei was accorded full police honors. His casket was draped in his police unit flag carried by eight officers in full ceremonial uniform. Mourners were moved to tears as they streamed past to view his body at the funeral. Ruto and his allies, as well as the public, have turned the heat on Kinoti over how he has handled the case so far. In a tweet, Ruto said on Friday that while the truth must be found on why, how and who killed Kenei, Kinoti should be professional and stop dramatising the probe. Kenei's body was found in his single room at a servant’s quarter in Imara Daima Estate, Nairobi. His mysterious death came amid investigations on the fake arms deal worth Sh39.5 billion that is alleged to have been carried out inside DP's office by the former Sports CS Rashid Echesa.
