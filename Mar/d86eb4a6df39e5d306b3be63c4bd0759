A multi-million gemstone value addition centre in Voi town lies unused three years after completion. The centre was to improve the mining sector as all mining trade was set to be carried out inside the facility. Taita Taveta Deputy Governor Majala Mlagui on Saturday expressed her disappointment in the delayed commissioning. She further asked the Ministry of Petroleum and Mining to fast-track operations at the facility and open doors to local miners. “We donated land for this project which was unanimously supported by our people. We have a very beautiful building and fantastic equipment but it’s sad that the facility is yet to start benefiting us,” Mlagui said. She said the centre will provide a wide range of services including stone cutting and polishing, banking, a gemstone laboratory and a buying centre among others. It is one of the government’s mining flagship projects. The Sh50 million mineral processing centre is the only facility in Kenya where value addition of minerals was to take place before the sale. The deputy governor was speaking in Voi during an artisanal miners workshop. She underscored the need to focus on Community Development Agreement Committees and Corporate Social Responsibility. Mlagui also urged the ministry to speed up the gazettement of CDACs to allow communities living in mineral-rich areas to benefit. “You need to emulate the Kishushe people who have moved with speed and ensured that their committee is gazetted. This will ensure they benefit from iron ore being mined in the area. The gazette notice has appeared today." She noted that the county government is committed to supporting artisanal miners through capacity building initiatives in collaboration with other development partners. Taita Taveta has various gemstones including Tsavorite, ruby, tourmaline, red garnets, green garnets, Tanzanite and iron ore. Other minerals are manganese and  limestone. Edited by R.Wamochie
