Top-flight side Kakamega Homeboyz have ended their more than a decade search for a shirt sponsorship after unveiling Mozzart Bet as their new partner. The club nailed down the bookmaker as their new sponsor for the next one year and will consequently bank Sh 20 million from the deal. The club chairman Cleophas Shimanyula said the windfall will solely go in improving the welfare of the playing unit and expressed hope that the betting firm will renew the deal upon expiry. The firm bankrolled 2008 league champions Mathare United last season. "I am proud to announce Mozzart Bet as our first shirt sponsor since the inception of the club in 2009. The money will go in improving the welfare of the players whose performances in the past have caught the eyes of the sponsor," he said. "I strongly believe that the players will work harder and contest for trophies.I also hope that the sponsors will renew the deal after the current one expires." With the club boasting of financiers, Shimanyula promised to revamp the communication's department which had been sidelined due to lack of inadequate funding. He also expressed confidence in arresting their poor start in the league which he attributed to injuries and illness in his camp in the new year. "We will revive the club's social media accounts and improve other departments which were inactive. I expect the club to perform well going forward as six out of eight players who missed the opening rounds have recovered from injuries and illness and will be available for selection," he added
