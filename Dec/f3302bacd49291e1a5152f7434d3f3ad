If he had any doubts when taking the job, the size of the task facing West Bromwich Albion boss Sam Allardyce became clear as his new club were outclassed by Aston Villa, slumping to a 3-0 Premier League defeat on Sunday. Reduced to ten men when captain Jake Livermore was sent off, West Brom created one chance during the game and have now conceded 29 goals and managed only one clean sheet all season. “I think that starting off and dreaming on the first goal was something I was not pleased about after four minutes. It’s a simple cross, not a great cross and we are ball-watching to go 1-0 down,” Allardyce told BT Sport. “We kept it tight and I was concerned whether we would keep our shape and we were trying, not that successfully, but the sending off has completely thrown it against us,” he added. Villa playmaker Jack Grealish tormented West Brom all night, and Allardyce said he would love to have the England international to help the Baggies in their battle against relegation. “He is an outstanding individual, one Aston Villa will be delighted to have. If we had a Jack Grealish, with all due respect to my players, we would stay up,” he said. There will be little Christmas cheer for the 66-year-old coach as he starts to prepare his second-from-bottom side to visit champions Liverpool, who beat Crystal Palace 7-0 on Saturday. “Anfield, an easy one next (Sunday), then two days later Leeds (United). We just have to try and make sure we do not do what we did today ever again, switch off and get a player sent off,” he said.
