The electoral commission on Wednesday launched the verification of BBI signatures. The IEBC said the 400 clerks hired for the process have taken their oath of secrecy and would begin the exercise immediately "The 400 clerks who were recruited for the exercise have taken their oath of secrecy and will begin their training shortly," IEBC said via Twitter. IEBC  called for applications for the posts of signature verification clerks on December 19. In a notice, IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati said 400 clerks were needed for the verification process. They will be paid Sh1,200 per day for the exercise. This will cost Sh480,000 per day. Applicants were to be  Kenyan citizens with high integrity,  with a form four certificate, computer literate, with data entry skills. Also, applicants were to be from Nairobi county, and if not, interested candidates should arrange for their own accommodation during that period, Chebukati said. The deadline for the application was December 24. The National Treasury approved Sh93.7 million funding to the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission for the verification of BBI signatures. Cabinet Secretary Ukur Yatani approved the amount after deliberations with IEBC managers. The IEBC sought Sh241 million from the Exchequer to review the signatures. The commission had indicated it would take about 85 days to verify the signatures if their request for Sh241 million was heeded to. The provision from the Treasury was to be used to hire and train clerks who will verify the signatures.
