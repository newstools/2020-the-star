Exiled lawyer Miguna Miguna has said the time has come for the country's capital to be liberated. He spoke on Monday hours after the Thirdway Alliance unveiled him as the party's candidate for the Nairobi governor by-election slated for February 18, 2021. Miguna expressed his gratitude to the party for nominating him to fly the party's flag in the upcoming gubernatorial contest. The fiery lawyer said there was a need to stand united as patriots, comrades and freedom fighters to liberate the capital from cartels and tyrants. "Let's mobilise and organise like no other time. The time is now. Nairobi must be liberated. Viva!" he said via a video shared across social media. "The cartels and their surrogates are trembling already, but the majestic people of Nairobi are happy and ready with their voters' cards. We are going to transform Nairobi into a first-class county and city." This comes a week after Miguna had on December 19 announced his interest to run for Nairobi governor's seat moments after the IEBC set the date for the by-election. Thirdway Alliance national chairman Miruru Waweru said Miguna is the best bet to reclaim the capital city from what he described as ineptitude. Waweru said the forthcoming by-election offers Nairobi residents an opportunity to correct 'one of the greatest political mistakes of our generation.' “Nairobi deserves leadership devoid of ineptitude, unbridled lust and gluttony for public resources which has defined it for the last eight years,” said Waweru. Waweru said Miguna is the right choice because he has consistently fought for including integrity, visionary and transformative leadership, elimination of corruption and development for all. Thirdway Alliance appealed to state agencies including the electoral commission to respect previous court rulings that affirmed Miguna's Kenyan citizenship.
