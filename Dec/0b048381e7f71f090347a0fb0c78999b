At least seven people were killed on  Tuesday afternoon after armed raiders clashed as inter-ethnic skirmishes escalated between Garissa and Isiolo. According to Lagdera County Deputy county commissioner Philip Koima, the victims succumbed to gunshot wounds after an exchange of fire. “An exchange of gunshots and attack by unknown raiders was reported within the Quri grazing area, a total of seven victims reportedly succumbed to gunshot wounds,” said Koima. Five of the deceased according to the official are from Lagdera sub-county while two are from Garbatulla in Isiolo County. Koima said preliminary investigations show that the victims of the attack may have been ambushed and shot dead while attempting to retaliate the killing of their kinsmen on November 29 at the same grazing area ( Quri). According to officials, police from Sericho Division have been dispatched to the scene of the incident to search and collect the bodies. Somalis from Garissa and Borana in the neighbouring Isiolo County have had long standing conflict. The latest incidents have raised tension. The incidents come just a day after both Garissa and Isiolo County commissioners convened a peace meeting in the same area with local leadership including Lagdera MP Mohamed Hire and area Garissa ward representative among other leaders. In the meeting, the two communities were urged to co-exist peacefully and share resources. The Government has vowed to pursue the attackers. Local leadership in the area has asked the government through the county security and Intelligence Committee to recommend establishment of a Police Post in the Eldere Division.
