The 2022 gubernatorial politics in Kitui played out during the funeral of a clergyman when Governor Charity Ngilu and Kenya's ambassador to Uganda publicly clashed over the status of the county’s health care. During the funeral of the founding bishop of St Stephen’s Ministry Rev David Kalua - the father of renowned environmentalist and founder of Green Africa Foundation Isaac Kalua - at Unyaa Primary School on Saturday, the two leaders tore into each other. Kiema Kilonzo criticised the quality of health care in Kitui, saying it was so poor that most sick people seek help in better equipped facilities in the neighbouring Machakos or Makueni counties. He wondered whether Kitui had been denied money from the Exchequer. The envoy who has made no secret of his intention to dethrone Ngilu in 2020 said: “I am a senior politician in this place but it pains me  that our people are  seeking medical care in Machakos and Makueni.” Addressing Senator Mutula Kilonzo Jnr who was present, Kilonzo posed: “Tell me Senator Mutula, have you denied Kitui county money for medical services? If you are giving us money, where does that money go? “I want to say this without any fear of contradiction. Madam governor you are my friend. Lakini kuna urafiki  na kuna utumishi kwa wananchi (But, besides friendship there is service to citizens). Service to mankind is service to God,” Kilonzo sais. But Ngilu swiftly told  Kilonzo to always check his facts before making public pronouncements  if he expected to be taken serious by people and regarded as truthful. “My brother, ask before you speak because when people tell lies people may not regard them as an honest leaders).
