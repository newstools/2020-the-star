BY WANGECHI WANG’ONDU  Widows, persons living with disability, school children and those in orphanages in Kirinyaga will get Christmas donations of foodstuff, face masks, sanitisers and sanitary pads from the county government. Governor Anne Waiguru on Saturday flagged of lorries carrying the donations to various destinations where they will be distributed to beneficiaries. About 2,700 beneficiaries including learners in 11 boarding schools with benefit. “The gifts will be distributed to the beneficiaries through the help of a county team led by CECs, county chief officers and directors to various schools within the county,” Waiguru said. She spoke after flagging off the donations outside her Kagio home. She advised residents to observe Covid-19 safety protocols during the Christmas festivities to curb the spread of coronavirus. The governor asked those in towns not to travel to their rural villages, warning such a move could spread Covid-19 to the elderly people in the villages. Kirinyaga has about 411 Covid-19 cases, including seven deaths. Waiguru said no patient has been admitted in the county isolation wards with those nursing the virus in home-based care. She said the county government will continue offering prevention training to the community and provide necessary items key to the fight against the spread of the virus. “It’s been a tough year with the pandemic at hand and as we get to the festive season, let's not throw caution to the wind. Let’s always enforce social distance, wear masks and sanitise. If you can try, keep off overcrowded places.”  Edited by P.O
