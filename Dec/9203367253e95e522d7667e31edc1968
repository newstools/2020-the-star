Tanzanian singer Vanessa Mdee and her lover Rotimi have released a romantic hit song, 'Love Somebody', in which she is featured as the video vixen. Inspired by the story of Adam and Eve, the song follows the real-life couple as they solidify their foundation and walk together with purpose. The song was released on Rotimi's birthday. Announcing it on Instagram, Vanessa said she is honored to be his eve in life and this visual masterpiece. "During the isolation period, we’ve spent every single day together, and to say we’ve grown is an understatement," she wrote. "We have been pruned, plucked, groomed, cultivated, restored. It’s been a beautiful experience and this is our new normal and every day in isolation with you sounds about perfect." Vanessa said the song idea came as they were having breakfast. "We caught lightning in a bottle with #LoveSomebody, there’s no other way to explain it. The inception of it was divine. God is love and love is God. This song represents that exactly and the world needs it desperately now." Rotimi on the other hand wrote, "No better way to celebrate my birthday than to spread the love with this beautiful song and lady." In July, Vanessa announced on her podcast 'Deep Dive with Vanessa Mdee' that she had quit music to embark on a self-discovery journey. She said she'd been living a lie, which drove her into alcoholism and depression. "I just wanna be an advocate for honesty and beauty, and being a sincere advocate for what facing your demons can do for you," she said.
