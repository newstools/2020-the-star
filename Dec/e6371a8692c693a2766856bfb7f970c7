China-based Kenyan singer, dancer and dance choreographer Ricki Stunner has released the video to his new dance song Chakara. The song is produced by Nigerian producer FroTribe. It is a banger, a nice way to usher in the festive season. Chakara is the name of a dance style created by Pato Dave and Ricki Stunner, both Kenyan dancers living in China. Stunner says the project was inspired by his love for dance. Having ventured into music, he finds it relevant and satisfying to sing and promote dance, he says. "To make people want to stand up and jam to good music inspired by Africa. The Afro-beats feel in the song came about as I tried to be diverse in my music and work with different people just for the love of music," he says His debut single Kwachu, produced by top Gengetone producer Marvo on the Beat, was released in July 2020.
