Kenya Cup chairmen have been left with unanswered questions on the resumption of the sport as the coronavirus contagion soars in the country. The clubs had hoped to start the competition on January 16 but as it stands they might have to wait longer and stakeholders are feeling the heat. Rugby was classified as a high-risk sport in as far as the spread of the virus is concerned in the latest Ministry of Sport directive. Most clubs had envisaged starting their pre-season this month with an intense four to six weeks programme of strength and conditioning to get the players in shape before the season starts in the New Year. Only Shujaa and Kenya Lionesses have been given the go-ahead to train in preparation for the World Sevens Series and the postponed 2020 Tokyo Olympics. Teams are allowed to be at the gym but contact drills like scrummages, lineouts and mauls are banned. Quins chairman Michael Wanjala said teams need a pre-season before the league can start and until that happens, they will have to wait. "The players need pre-season. We don't know what they have been doing in these eight months. We need to be guided by the Ministry of Sports on the way forward" noted Wanjala. KCB RFC chairman Xavier Makuba said there are grey areas which the union needs to address before the season kickoffs in the New Year. "Who is going to carry the cost of testing? Most clubs cannot afford it. One of our proposals was to have the players get tested at Kemri at a subsidised fee but the question of the duration — weekly or monthly— still lingers," noted Makuba. Impala vice chairman Charles Ngovi said the earliest the season could start is February next year depending on the severity of Covid-19. "As a rugby community, we must adapt to the Covid-19 pandemic. We are seeing how countries like New Zealand, Australia, South Africa and England are coping maybe we need to borrow a few things from there to localise them," said Ngovi.
