Residents of Kagwe area in Lari constituency thought cattle theft had been eliminated but the thieves struck again on Friday. Angry residents on Friday night torched a pick-up found carrying a stolen cow. The cow owner Daniel Kariuki said he woke up to sounds of the calf running around the home compound and decided to go out and check. "It was around 2am. I walked out but I saw my cowshed had been broken and the cow was missing. I raised the alarm and people came," Kariuki said. They launched a search and found the pick-up with the cow and five men along the Kagwe-Kamahindu road. The thieves tried to run away but the villagers caught them, roughed them up and set the pick-up on fire after offloading the cow. "We called the police and they arrested them," Kariuki said. The cow is worth Sh200,000. Deputy county commissioner Agnes Karoki told cattle thieves to look for another place as officers in the area are alert to their schemes. â€œIt is true this is an isolated case this year. I'm told dairy cows used to be stolen. This time around, this area is a no-go zone for such thugs. This was their first trial and it has failed," she said. Karoki asked locals not to take the law into their hands and destroy evidence, saying the pickup could have assisted the police with investigations. The administrator asked chiefs and their assistants to work harder with Nyumba Kumi officials to tighten security. George Waweru said many residents are tea and dairy farmers. Cows stolen in the area sold cheaply elsewhere, he said. "Our cows worth Sh200,000 are stolen, only to be sold at a throwaway price of Sh50,000. There is a quick market," he said. edited by o. owino)
