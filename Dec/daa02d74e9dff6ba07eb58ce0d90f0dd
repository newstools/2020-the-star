Kitui Governor Charity Ngiulu was among the dignitaries who condoled with former Kenyan ambassador to South Korea Ngovi Kitau as his mother Loise Kutula was laid to rest. Kitula, who died aged 118, was buried at her Ithookwe farm in Kitui Central subcounty on Thursday. The funeral held under strict Covid- 19 protocols was also graced by former Nairobi Deputy Governor Jonathan Mueke. The funeral service was held at the ACK All Souls Church Ithookwe in Kitui Central and presided over by retired ACK archbishop Benjamin Nzimbi. Ngilu eulogised Kitula as a person who set a good example in her community by how she brought up her family alongside her now-dead husband Timothy Kitau Malunda. The governor urged the people of Kitui especially women to strive to make a positive impact on the lives of others while alive. She said just like Kitula, women are pivotal in bringing up excellent families. Ngilu said women should always seek to advise each other just as Kitula, her neighbour in Ithookwe village, helped her with her political plans. Ambassador Kitau said his mother as a strict disciplinarian who brought up children who were respectful to and interacted well with other members of the community. The ex-envoy said her mother was a go-getter who would try things that were deemed impossible. He gave the example of Kitula venturing into sugar cane growing when other people doubted the crop would do well in the area. Kitau said his mother grew sugar cane at a farm in Mutikwa where he and his siblings had to toil under the watchful eye of the departed matriarch.
