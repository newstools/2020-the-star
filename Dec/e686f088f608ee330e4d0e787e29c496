Residents of Alego-Usonga constituency in Siaya county have resolved to have the electoral area divided into two. A meeting chaired by Siaya deputy county commissioner Eric Wamulevu at Karemo chief’s camp on Tuesday unanimously resolved to have  Karemo division become a constituency. Political and religious leaders and government officials were present. Boro and Uranga divisions will form the second area of representation. The leaders said that Karemo division, with a population of 105,300 people, deserved to become a constituency to be known as Alego with the headquarters in Siaya town. Boro and Uranga divisions, with a population of 119,000, will form Alego-Usonga constituency, with the headquarters at Boro trading centre. The participants had earlier engaged in a heated debate over the boundaries of the proposed constituencies, with residents from North Alego lamenting that they have, over the years, been used by politicians to justify their cause. While some wanted North Alego that falls under Boro division to be in Alego-Usonga, others said they were closer to Siaya town and it would not make sense for them to travel all the way to Boro for services and pleaded to be part of the proposed Alego constituency. Wamulevu said the question of subdivision of locations and wards will be deliberated in other forums. Edited by Henry Makori
