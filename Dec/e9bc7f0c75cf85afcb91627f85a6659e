The ethnic contempt case against Narok Senator Ledama Ole Kina has been adjourned to January. The adjournment was occasioned by the absence of the prosecution counsel who was said to be sick. The senator had been summoned to appear in court for his mention on pretrial directions on Wednesday. Ledama was present alongside his lawyer Omwansa Ombati. Milimani chief magistrate Roselyne Onganyo adjourned the matter and directed that the accused appear in court on January 19, 2021 for pretrial. In June, Ledama was charged with ethnic contempt following comments he made on February 19, 2020 during a live TV show. The senator is accused of uttering words that were intended to incite feelings of discrimination against non-Maasai communities living in Narok county. The charge against the senator states that “on February 19, 2020 at Jeff Koinange Live on Citizen TV in Nairobi, uttered words to the effect that Maasai issues will be articulated by Maasais! Not Manje...” According to the prosecution, the charges against Ledama are contrary to the National Cohesion and Integration Act No 12 of 2008. The senator denied the charges was released on a bail of Sh100,000. He has been warned not to comment about the case on any platform.
