The Kariobangi Sharks technical bench can afford a sigh of relief following the recovery of towering South Sudan central defender Kuol Chol. The youthful defender missed their last assignment against Western Stima at the Moi Stadium, Kisumu due to an injury picked two weeks ago at the Wundanyi Stadium during their match against 2009 champions Sofapaka. With the former Shield Cup set to resume training on Tuesday at the Utalii grounds after the brief Christmas break, Chol's presence will boost their options at the heart of the defence ahead of the return of competitive matches next week. Prior to the injury setback, the Kakamega High School alumnus had started all matches this season. "Kuol Chol has shaken off his leg swelling that saw him miss our last assignment and he will be back in training tomorrow as the team regroups after the Christmas break," announced the club on its Twitter account With the return of the former Chemelil Sugar player, coach William Muluya will be spoilt for choice thanks to the four central defenders who are available for selection. Apart from Kuol, Muluya will have the luxury of picking his pair from Goeffrey Shiveka,Samuel Olwande and Boniface Onyango.
