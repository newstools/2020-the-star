Members of criminal gangs troubling Nyamira residents over Christmas will be killed, county commissioner Amos Mariba has said. “You have all been hearing how criminal gangs have been taking advantage of curfew hours to trouble our people. We will no longer have time to take these criminals to court but to promote them [to hell] for the safety of our people,” Mariba said. The administrator spoke at the Nyamira prisons when he presided over the distribution of avocado seedlings to farmers over the weekend. He said groups of criminals have emerged and are giving residents sleepless nights. “Some of these gangs have got police attire and we are aware of that. But let it be a warning: we will not spare you but promote you so that our residents can have peace,” he said. Residents said gangs in various parts of the county terrorise them at night when police have retired from their regular patrols. “We are calling on the county commissioner to ensure more police officers are deployed in the area to beef up security especially at night since it is the time when gangs take over,” said Geoffrey Michael a victim of a night attack. In the past week, gangs have caused fear among residents in Nyamira town and its environs. Mariba said that police officers are on high alert and residents should not fear. “We have made arrangements to deal with the gangs that are rising in the county. We have had peace all along until recently when such activities have arisen again. We shall not relent but deal with them accordingly,” Mariba said.
