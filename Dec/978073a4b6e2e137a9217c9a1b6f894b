The National Olympic Committee- Kenya will change its name to Olympics Kenya after receiving approval from its member federations. Acting secretary general Francis Mutuku added that member federations have been briefed on the rebranding strategy. “We showed the General Assembly the new logo and the brand ID and they have subsequently approved it. Whatever IOC approves is what we will go with as a new brand of NOC-K,” he said. Moreover, NOC-K have purchased office space at Gallant Building in Parkland, Nairobi even as they wait for the completion of the NOC-K Plaza. “Since the lease for our current offices was due for expiry, we decided to purchase office space in which we will move to by January. We have shown the General Assembly an artistic impression of the office and will invite them to visit the office physically once we move in in January,” Mutuku said. The purchase of office space comes amidst the government’s efforts to complete the bailout of NOC-K Plaza. “Completing the bailout, taking ownership, renovating it and deciding on how much space to allocate us will take some time. This is why we decided to purchase an office space, not a building, in the meantime,” he said. One of the features of their new home will be a library containing textual, audio and visual records of Kenya's exploit in sports. "When you come to visit the offices, you will not be kept waiting. You will be able to see a gallery of photos of our past records in sporting history as well as videos on the same," Mutuku said. There will also be a boardroom with modern communication facilities that will serve as a conference centre to host meetings, he added.
