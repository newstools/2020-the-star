Christmas joy turned sad for a Mombasa family after their four-year-old grandchild drowned in a swimming pool in Diani, Kwale county. The boy had travelled from Mombasa with his grandparents for a Christmas vacation at Manyatta Resort hotel. County police boss Joseph Nthenge said lifeguards arrived too late at the scene. The child was pronounced dead at Diani Beach Hospital and the body taken to Mombasa. In a separate tragic incident, a 38-year-old man at Mazunguni village in Kikoneni died following a scuffle with a colleague. Mwafrica Malumbo Hamisi, the suspect, allegedly punched Bakari Salim so hard he fell on a rock and sustained a deep cut on his head. Salim was taken to a nearby dispensary for first aid and transferred to Msambweni Subcounty Hospital where he died. A police report says Salim had lost a lot of blood. The body was moved to Kwale mortuary. Police are holding Hamisi and will arraign him on Monday. They will charge him with murder.  (edited by o. owino)
