Boxing Federation of Kenya (BFK) are in the process of acquiring a new scoring system after the only one that existed in the country disappeared mysteriously. BFK communication director, Duncan 'Sugar Ray' Kuria yesterday said the federation had already placed a new order and the equipment is set to land in the country anytime soon. He added that nobody really knows about the whereabouts of the old system. Kuria said lack of a scoring system had proved costly after they were forced to shelve their initial plan of conducting a judges and referees training course. "We were initially meant to conduct a course for judges and referees but our plans were derailed due to the absence of a scoring system and as such, we opted for a coaching course," said Kuria. At least 20 local coaches including featherweight pugilist Nick Okoth and middleweight Elizabeth Adhiambo Andiego benefited from the coaching course that lasted for a week. Kuria further revealed that  the country was currently experiencing a dearth of qualified officials because the few officials who had undergone formal training had either passed away or were too old to be actively involved in presiding over bouts. "BFK found it necessary to introduce a course for judges and referees because the 13 officials the country had have either died or are now too old to officiate," said Kuria. Scoring in modern boxing is entrusted to three ringside judges seated some distance from each other and who are not allowed to consult or share their scores during bouts in order to avoid fixing. The judges carefully observe and register scores for each round separately. At the end of each round, each judge submits scores to the referee, who then hands them over to a clerk to record them and tally the final scores. Each judge must award 10 points to the winner of the round which informs the name  '10-point system'.
