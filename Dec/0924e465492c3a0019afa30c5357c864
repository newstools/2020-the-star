Kiambaa MP Paul Koinange has called upon leaders to avoid hatred among themselves to cultivate peace in the country. Speaking in Karuri on Monday where he held a prayer meeting with Kiambaa constituency clergy, Koinange said politicians should sit down with elders and speak about the future of their communities. “Leaders should know when there is no peace in the community there is no development and conflicts are very expensive. At the end of any conflict we lose a lot of money as a government which can be put to good use in different developments in the country,” he said. The chairman of the National Assembly Security and Administration committee said Kenyans should believe that there shall be peace in the 2022 General Election. “Kenyans should open up dialogue with one another and solve their differences so as to be in unity,” Koinange said. He called on leaders to stop hurling insults at one another. The leaders should also seek intervention of the church to solve issues. “Social media is being used of late to spread hate among Kenyans and it has brought division as most of the things posted are not true and propagate propaganda and will bring the country into chaos,” he said. He said that action ought to be taken against those politicians who engage in hate speech. “Rev Dr Samuel Kobia, the chairman the National Cohesion and Integration Commission, should make sure that whoever utters words that can bring any issues in the country, that can bring any insecurity or anything that can make anybody shed blood of the other, should be arrested immediately and taken to a court of law,” Koinange said.
