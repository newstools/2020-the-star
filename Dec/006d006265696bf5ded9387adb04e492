Plans to decongest Nairobi CBD continue to take shape with construction works underway at the Green Park terminus. The Green Park terminus located at the Railway club will be the drop-off and pick-up point for matatus plying Ngong Road and Lang’ata Road. "It has taken us about a month to start and reach where we are with construction works at Green Park. For the remaining bit, we may be through in a few weeks,” Nairobi Metropolitan Service director of Transport and Public Works Michael Ochieng said. At the Green Park terminus, the NMS has erected sheds for buses. They have been painted blue and grey. Ochieng said NMS will announce the actual date when matatus will be barred from accessing the CBD. This means that matatus will continue to transport commuters to the CBD until such a time when everything is ready for the implementation of the decongestion strategy. Apart from Green Park, construction work is going on at various termini. Construction works are also underway at the junction of Bunyala and Workshop Road. This will serve matatus using Mombasa Road – South B, South C, Industrial Area, Imara Daima, Athi River, Kitengela and Machakos. Matatus using Waiyaki Way will pick and drop passengers at Fig tree terminus. Matatus using the Thika Superhighway will terminate at the new Desai and Park Road terminus in Ngara. Muthurwa is expected to serve matatus from Jogoo and Lusaka roads. NMS also announced it will launch an integrated electronic system in the new  termini to be used by both matatus and commuters. The digital platform will notify matatu owners when PSVs can make their way to the termini and when commuters can be picked up and dropped off. NMS director general Mohammed Badi said decongesting Nairobi is among his top priorities.
