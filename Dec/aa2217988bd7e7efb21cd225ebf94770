West Pokot county is the final stages of setting up a nine-bed ICU for Sh80 million at Kapenguria Referral Hospital. The county has procured ICU equipment for seven beds and five ventilators. It already had some equipment. The unit will be launched next week. “This is a major boost to our healthcare system. Our county has moved from zero ICU beds to nine," Governor John Longyangapuo said on Tuesday after touring the hospital. The county already had two CPAP (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure) ventilators. “This signifies commitment to expanding our capacity as we continue to revamp our healthcare system," the governor said. A renal unit has been operating for a year, ending the long and expensive journeys for patients to other facilities. “Patients with kidney problems are no longer traveling over 150 kilometres twice a week to Moi teaching and referral hospital,” he said. The five-bed renal unit has reduced congestion at MTRH and serves patients from the North Rift.  The renal unit is catering for patients from West Pokot, Tran Nzoia, Elgeyo Marakwet, Turkana and Baringo counties, as well as Bukwo district in Uganda. Lonyangapuo said initially many patients had been forced to relocate to Eldoret to as they could not afford transport twice a week. “This unit has helped  reduce expenses since patients will be able to get services at home," the governor said. The renal services are carried out twice a week, eight sessions a month, and are a lifelong requirement unless the patient undergoes a kidney transplant. (Edited by V. Graham)
