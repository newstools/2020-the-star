The 2020 end of year Cabinet recess will commence on December 22 and end on January 3, 2021, head of Public service Joseph Kinyua has said. In a statement to newsrooms on Saturday, Kinyua said the recess will give members of Cabinet a scheduled break from weekly Cabinet Committee Meetings. "....and an opportunity to honour and spend the festive season with their families ahead of a busy and momentous new year," he said. However, during the Recess, Scheduled presidential engagements will continue uninterrupted. The Calendar of the National Security CouncilÂ  and the National Security Council Advisory Committee will also continue as planned. Kinyua said the Cabinet, Cabinet Committees and Technical Committees will not have any scheduled engagements. This is unless otherwise directed by the President for urgent business, cases of national emergency, or any other exceptional circumstances. Members of Cabinet (excluding those who are members of the National Security Council and National Emergency Response Committee on Coronavirus) shall be allowed to take leave from office, subject to the prior approval of the President. Kinyua said the 2021 Cabinet Calendar and Agenda shall anchor Kenya's Covid-19 Recovery Efforts by spearheading recovery and resurgence strategies for the enduring benefit of Kenya.
