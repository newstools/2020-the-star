The Migori County Public Service Board is auditing its staff records to weed out ghost workers, chairman Jared Kopiyo has said. Kopiyo told the Star on Sunday in Migori town that the audit will be carried out in all departments and will cover about 3,000 workers. “Migori had issues of ghost workers and ascertaining the exact number of casual labourers. This audit will help each and every staffer to be verified across each department," he said. He said once the audit is complete, the board will compile a report before the end of the month to be given to Governor Okoth Obado and the county assembly. “The report will be compiled by this month complete with a recommendation to each department and the entire county," he said. He said the human resource audit will help reverse the mentality that the county government is only a place where people come to draw salaries. “We want workers to know what they are meant to do and their remuneration to improve service delivery to wananchi," he said. The audit will also streamline the chain of command and communication among workers and wananchi across all 40 wards. "The report will help us in advising the county government on HR services and improvement areas to cover any loopholes found and strengthen good points," Kopiyo said. He said the report will outline demographics like gender, age, ethnicity, origin and those with disabilities. In July 2018, Migori declared 267 employees who did not turn up for staff headcount as ghost workers in a process led by Obado. “During the headcount, we had a total 3,345 employees in the payroll. Out of this, 3,078 workers turned up. We are yet to understand where 267 persons were during such a vital exercise and the county government can only term them as ghost workers who must be dealt with conclusively," Obado said when he launched the report. The governor said that of the 3,078 employees who turned up for the headcount, 31 had questionable credentials.
