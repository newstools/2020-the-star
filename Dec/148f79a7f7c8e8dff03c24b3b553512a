Farmers in Nyamira county have received more than 30,000 avocado seedlings to diversity production and increase incomes County commissioner Amos Mariba presided over the distribution of the seedlings on Friday and said tasty avocado is the most sought-after fruit because of its nutritional value. The seedlings were donated by the Interior ministry. "We still love our local varieties for their bigger sizes but the truth is they are valueless in the international markets," he said. The Hass variety, though small in size, takes the shortest time to mature and is in high demand globally, giving a very high economic return, he said. China has promised a ready market for Haas avocado because it also can be used to produce oil and make nutritional supplements. Director of prison farms in Kenya Patrick Kariri said the donation will help achieve food security and increase forest cover. "Nyamira county is a good ecological zone for growing avocado, but it remains underutilised and residents don't yet reap maximum economic benefits," he said. Farmers must explore other income streams to improve their lives, he said. Kariri said Nyamira GK Prison is one of the correctional institutions to implement a farming flagship project. The aim is to help rehabilitate inmates through agricultural training and generate revenue to support food security and nutrition. Avocado seedlings will also be sold to farmers at subsidised prices to increase prison revenue. County assembly speaker Moffat Teya said the county will partner with GK Prisons as a contracting facility to grow Hass avocado, usually procured at exorbitant prices due to high demand.
