The Kakamega government has reopened its headquarters after a three-week closure over Covid-19. Governor Wycliffe Oparanya announced the closure of the government offices on November 10 after a number of staff members contracted the virus. Only finance, enforcement, health and other essential services like the fire department have been operating, with staff working in shifts. Among notable personalities who succumbed to the virus in the county is former county chief of staff Robert Sumbi. He was buried 10 days ago. County secretary Jacinta Odhiambo in a circular dated November 30 announced the full resumption of operations at the county headquarters. â€œFollowing the closure of the county headquarters in a bid to contain the spread of the coronavirus, you are hereby informed that all operations at the headquarters have resumed effective November 30," a circular to all staff signed by Odhiambo read. She asked staff to strictly comply with the guidelines put in place to curb the spread of Covid-19. Workers have been asked to promote social distancing in offices, maintain workplace hygiene and safety through wearing of masks and frequent hand washing. They have also been encouraged to work in shifts where social distancing might not be feasible. Face-to-face meetings will not be allowed and workers have been asked to hold virtual meetings and adopt electronic submission of documents. The county assembly on Wednesday said it will conduct its business virtually to avoid the spread of the virus after a sizeable number of staff and MCAs tested positive for the virus. Assembly clerk Laban Atemba said last week that the assembly will only resume physical sittings after all staff have been tested. Edited by A.N
