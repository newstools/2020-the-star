Media Council of Kenya has lambasted Saturday's incident where a section of sports journalists were barred from covering the Kenya Premier League match between Ulinzi Stars and Gor Mahia at Nyayo Stadium. The council described the incident as a contravention of articles 34 and 35 of the constitution, which guarantee media freedom and access to information. "The council received a complaint from the Sports Journalist Association of Kenya (SJAK) that some of its members who are accredited by the Council were allegedly, without justifiable cause denied access by FKF to cover the Kenya Premier League match played on Saturday December 12, 2020. The alleged act of denying journalists access to a public event is a violation of their fundamental freedoms and rights established under the constitution," David Omwoyo, MCK CEO, said. The council has subsequently commenced investigations into the incident and invited FKF to provide their side of the story. "We therefore request you to provide the Council with information on what transpired to shed more light and enable us to resolve the matter. If you establish that a journalist or a media enterprise in in breach of the Media Council Act, 2013 particularly the Code of Conduct for the practice of journalism, you may file a complaint to the Complaints Commission," Omwoyo said. Saturday's standoff prompted SJAK to decree a media blackout on premier league matches and related activities until the issue is resolved. The Jamhuri Day match was the first for both sides, which are currently embroiled with the local soccer governing body over the StarTimes broadcasting contract. Both have refused to sign the contract on the basis that broadcasting rights belong to individual clubs who can then decide on what to do with them. Mathare United and Zoo Kericho — two other clubs opposed to the deal — have thus far been suspended from the league leaving their players and technical bench in limbo.  .
