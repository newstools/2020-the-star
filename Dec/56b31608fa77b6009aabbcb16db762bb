One in two mothers in Busia exclusively breastfeed their babies for six months as required, county nutrition coordinator Scholastic Nabade has said. Nabade said a lack of education has made several mothers underestimate the importance of breast milk to the newborns' wellbeing. However, she said, community health volunteers from the Health and Sanitation department are reaching out to women in the grassroots to bridge the gap. She made the remarks at the Matayos Health Centre during the launch of the Busia County Malezi Bora initiative. Public Health chief officer Jonathan Ino presided over the event. He was accompanied by the director for preventive and promotive services Dr Melsa Lutomia. Nabade said that failure by men to fully support their wives has meant most of them do not seek health services, especially during pregnancy. “Let the men ensure they are in the forefront in ensuring that expectant mothers attend antenatal clinics, deliver their babies in health facilities and practice exclusive breastfeeding as this should be a responsibility of both parents,” she said. She also emphasised the need for men to attend meetings organised to sensitise their wives. Such forums will give them the opportunity to understand whatever is required, she said. Ino encouraged families to take advantage of services offered in the county health facilities. He said that the goal of Malezi Bora programme is to increase the utilisation of routine health and nutrition services targeting pregnant women, children under five years of age and lactating mothers. “As residents of Busia, let us ensure that we make it a routine in our daily lives to access the health services,” the chief officer said. Also present was the prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV focal person Aquinatta Lumili, community health services coordinator Emmanuel Luvai and members of the health management team.
