Nairobians have been asked to suspend travel to their rural homes to avoid spreading the coronavirus to the elderly in the countryside. Government Spokesperson Cyrus Oguna said people should approach the festive season with the true meaning of being one another’s keeper. “Let us wear our masks, wash hands regularly, sanitise, avoid crowded areas and adhere to the public transport capacity guidelines,” he said. He spoke during a media briefing on locust invasion and government response, among other issues at KICC, Nairobi. "I know we love our parents very much. I ask our brothers and sisters that as we approach Christmas and we want to buy them gifts; let's buy our parents the gift of not visiting them if you truly love them,” he said. He said this may sound a bit insensitive but it is the reality. “You can send something to them using other means. If you really love your parents, do not visit them during this situation. The situation is real out there; we know what it can do if our parents are attacked by it. Stay away until the situation normalises. I appeal to our young people in urban centres to stay way."
