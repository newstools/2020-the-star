A woman who was arrested in Mountain View for hosting 44 teenagers in an alleged 'orgy' has been released from police custody. Millicent Kithinji and three others were to be charged on Thursday but police did not bring a charge. Police told the court they had not completed investigations. However, magistrate Muthoni Nzibe declined to give police more time and released them all on a Sh200,000 personal bond. The case will be mentioned on December 15 to confirm if police will be through with investigations. On Tuesday, Nzibe had directed police to charge them on Thursday but when they were brought to court, there was no charge sheet. DCI detectives arrested the 44 school children and Kithinji two weeks ago in a house at Nairobi’s Mountain View Estate. During the operation, the detectives seized various brands of alcohol and bhang. The children – 26 boys and 18 girls - were aged between 14 and 17 years. All are in primary and high schools. Kithinji, aged 41, was picked up for questioning by detectives based at Dagoretti. According to the DCI, officers seized different brands of whisky and vodka and bhang. Preliminary investigations revealed the children were from Nairobi, Kiambu Machakos counties.
