Members of Parliament allied to Deputy President William Ruto are currently at his Karen residence for a BBI consensus meeting. The Tangatanga legislators are said to be pushing Ruto to fashion a strategy that will either scuttle the referendum or neutralise the political consequences of the plebiscite. This is despite Ruto publicly pushing for consensus on contentious BBI proposals, which he says will avert a divisive referendum The DP is expected to later address the press at 2 pm from his official Karen residence. His loyalists are said to have been raised questions of a possibility for him to support the 'dynasties'. Behind the scenes, his associates are trooping to court with prayers that have the potential of throwing into disarray the entire process. Today's meeting aims at seeing the group adopt a common ground on the referendum bill with some quarters saying the group wants to give conditions that will see a 'No Consensus, No BBI' situation. On Tuesday Ruto while speaking in Nakuru said it’s still possible to achieve consensus even after the signatures collection was launched. “We must not have winners and losers. We can fashion a win-win and that is possible and it will be possible. I am very confident we will do so together,” the DP said. Ruto said there are politicians dying to turn the referendum into a political contest. “We have seen the ugly side of divided people and there are politicians, even on this issue of BBI, who are looking on how to divide people into camps so that they compete for certain outcomes. No. Let us look for a way to have all of us united. What will it benefit you to divide us to create enemies when we can agree?" he asked. Ruto’s think tanks believe his stand on the BBI could have implications for his 2022 presidential bid, with the referendum coming hardly a year to the General Election. PHOTOS COURTESY
