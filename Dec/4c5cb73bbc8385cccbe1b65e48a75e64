The desert locust situation is calm but an invasion is likely to happen from December 23. Agriculture Principal Secretary Hamadi Boga has said the swarms may cross to Marsabit county from southern Ethiopia. “We have been alerted that swarms are likely to invade Marsabit and we have sensitised our monitoring and control teams around Marsabit and Isiolo counties,” Boga told the Star by phone on Monday. The PS said the situation along the Coastal counties of Lamu, Kilifi and Tana Rivers is quiet as the swarms were sprayed with insecticides. “We have a base in Witu in Lamu county to help monitor the situation and take necessary caution. The swarms that were reported in the Coast region were sprayed, so the situation is under control," Boga said. The UN-Food and Agriculture Organization locust watch indicates that new swarms continue to form and threaten Kenya. The update showed that although immature swarms are yet to appear in Kenya, breeding is in progress on the coast and near the Tanzania, Somalia and Ethiopian borders. “Egg-laying and hopper bands have been reported. While control operations are underway, surveys should be conducted between Mandera and Turkana,” FAO said. Boga said most of the forecast depends on whether people on the ground in some of the affected countries like Ethiopia and Somalia are giving accurate data. This will enable the government to know how serious the situation will get. FAO said intensive survey and control operations should be maintained in Ethiopia and Somalia, and extreme vigilance and preparedness are required in Kenya. The PS said the country has enough chemicals to combat the locust upsurge and that two more aircraft are expected in the country to help in spraying. “We are waiting for two aircraft from Canada to support the spraying operations. This will add to the one spraying aircraft that is currently in the country. We are working on getting permits and having the two aircraft cleared,” he said.
