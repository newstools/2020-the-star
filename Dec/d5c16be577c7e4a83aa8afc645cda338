EACC officials will be allowed to sit in house committees that grill the executive on audit queries, Siaya county assembly Speaker George Okode has ruled. The move is to strengthen members of the public accounts committee as they seek answers to audit queries. Okode spoke during the swearing-in of Rosenell Anyango Odondi (Education) and Cleophas Ombogo (Finance) in Siaya town on Monday. The two will join Governor Cornel Rasanga's cabinet. The swearing-in ceremony was presided over by Siaya principal magistrate James Ong’ondo and witnessed by Rasanga. Okode asked the executive, including chief officers, to ensure due diligence in the execution of their work. “A time like this when we are staring at transition, we do not want a future where people who have served this county with honour for the longest time are called to answer to audit queries,” he said. The speaker said every public official has a duty to sufficiently respond to audit questions and avail records on time. Rasanga told the county executive committee members and the chief officers to ensure diligence while undertaking their tasks. He said governors often carry the blame whenever irregularities are committed and flagged during audits in their counties. “People think that governors are privy to improprieties and some dirty things that are done by unscrupulous county government workers. Such things are done by corrupt individuals behind the back of the county bosses," he said. Rasanga asked his officers to ensure they responded promptly to audit queries and avail the required documents on time. He said his government has formed a team to specifically handle audit queries to ensure operations run smoothly. He directed Ombogo to quickly put the finance department in order, saying the docket has been the major hurdle in service delivery.  Edited by P.O
