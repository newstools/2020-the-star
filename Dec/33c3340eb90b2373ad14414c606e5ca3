Gukena FM breakfast show presenter Njoki wa Mburu has explained why she left Kameme FM. Speaking on Kikuyu Diaspora media with Jeremy Damaris, the radio personality said she needed to grow. "Sometimes we all need growth and to come out from our comfort zones," she said. "If we do not want to move with time, you can become irrelevant. Yes, I was in a brand that was doing so well and I appreciate they nurtured me." Njoki said when she was approached to work for Gukena, she was suddenly faced with a tough decision. "I could not even eat since I was so worried about the decision that I was going to take." Njoki joined Gukena in 2017 and does not regret the move. Before making her decision, Njoki committed herself to God, prayed a lot, consulted her husband and a few confidants. "Murang'a Woman representative Sabina Chege is my close friend and she helped me in making the decision and finally I decided and I moved. I do not regret it since I know I moved for growth," she said. "I have learnt new things in the industry as we started from scratch but the break we took for two months shook our listeners while some even said I was retrenched." Njoki currently hosts the Gukena FM breakfast show, which she says is a dream fulfilled. "I did not want to do the breakfast show since I thought it was hectic and stressful but with God, I have done it almost two years." Njoki has been in the media industry for more than 10 years. Asked on whether she is planning to venture into politics, she said; "God knows about tomorrow. I never thought that a village girl like me would be listened to by the whole country. "I always want to commit my life to God since He has my plans. I always wish to impact society so much and if He says I will impact it through politics then, I have no choice."
