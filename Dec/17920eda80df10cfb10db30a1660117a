Police in Homa Bay are detaining chips trader for allegedly killing a customer after a confrontation over Sh50 change. Brian Omondi, 25, allegedly stabbed Dick Junior Opiyo, 23, on the neck with a kitchen knife in Makongeni estate in Homa Bay town after a confrontation over the balance. Opiyo died from his injuries at St Paul Hospital. Witnesses said Opiyo and a group of his friends went to buy chips from Omondi's kiosk. They gave the trader Sh100 and requested a portion for Sh50. The trader told the group to wait as he went to look for change from a nearby shop. Opiyo and his friends then began shouting and accusing the trader of dallying with their balance. “They were impatient and thought the trader was going to run away with their money. They turned angry, kicked away plates, poured out some chips which had not been sold before they pounced on the trader in fistfights,” a neighbour said. The trader is alleged to have used his kitchen knife to stab Opiyo during the confrontation. Asego assistant chief Tom Ondiek said one of the residents telephoned him to say that a group of youths were fighting the trader for delaying to get back a balance of Sh50. Ondiek said he found Opiyo had already been injured on his arrival at the scene. The suspect was arrested and taken to Homa Bay police station. Homa Bay subcounty police boss Sammy Koskey said Omondi would be charged after interrogation.  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
