The owner of a house in which 44 children hosted a party at Nairobi's Mountain View Estate was on Thursday charged with causing children to be in need of care and protection contrary to the law. Duane Njane Njengi was accused of willfully causing the minors aged between 13 and 17 years to be in need of protection being the owner of the house where they partied, drank alcohol and smoked bhang. He was also charged with exposing the children to the use of alcohol and drugs, including bhang. The prosecution said Njengi committed the offence on November 21 at Mountain View Estate within Westlands constituency. He was charged with another count of being found in possession of bhang weighing 30 grammes and with an estimated street value of Sh300. Being the owner of the house, Njengi failed to put in place measures to ensure that social distance of not less than one metre was maintained between persons within his house, the charge sheet says. He denied the charges before Milimani senior principal magistrate Benard Ochoi and pleaded for lenient bond terms. He was released on a bail of Sh200,000 with an alternative bond of Sh500,000. The case will be mentioned on December 17. According to the police, the 44 children were drawn from across the country. Police said they needed ample time to conduct investigations. The 44 children were released on November 23. None has been recalled to record statements. Police told the court there were third parties benefiting from pornographic images of the teenagers nabbed at the party. Detectives said they were tracking the accomplices.  Edited by P.O
