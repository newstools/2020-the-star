Kisii county Ford-Kenya chairman Job Nyakenyanya has rubbished his removal as inconsequential and vowed to remain put. Nyakenyanya was removed from his position on Sunday during a meeting of party officials chaired by Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang'ula in Kisii town. He was accused of backing a party faction led by Kanduyi MP Wafula Wamunyinyi. The Wamunyinyi faction purportedly ousted Wetang'ula as party leader in May. The case remains pending in court. Speaking to the Star on the phone on Wednesday, Nyakenyanya said his ouster was null and void. He said Wetang'ula has no moral authority to relieve him of his duties because he was suspended as party leader. “He has no moral authority to kick me out of the party in which he himself has been suspended. He has no powers to replace an elected official like me with an appointee,” Nyakenyanya said. Author Timothy Arege was picked to take over from Nyakenyanya in acting capacity. Wetang'ula, Ford-K deputy party leader Richard Onyonka and West Mugirango MP Vincent Kemosi met in Kisii to rein in errant party officials. Wetang'ula accused Nyakenyanya of working with rebels. “He has no share with us, we have found his replacement so he should move out to concentrate on other rebels,” Wetang'ula said. But Nyakenyanya said he does not recognise Wetang'ula as the party leader and thus his orders were inconsequential. He said he was elected by delegates from across the county and could not be replaced by an appointee. “Only through another election should it be decided if I should continue to be in office or not. Tell him (Wetang'ula) that I do not recognise his orders and I am still in office,” he said.  Edited by P.O
