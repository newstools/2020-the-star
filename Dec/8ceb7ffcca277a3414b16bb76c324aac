A hospital administrator and an ambulance driver at Emuhaya hospital in Vihiga are under investigation over missing Sh1000,000 personal protective equipment. Vhiga Health executive Amos Kutwa said security agencies have taken up the matter. Kutwa told the Star by phone that the hospital administrator allegedly colluded with the ambulance driver to sell PPE to private health centres and pharmacies within the subcounty at night. "When the officer in charge of the store reported on duty in the morning, he wasn't able to open the place as the locks had been changed," he said. "So they were forced to break in and to their surprise the PPE was not there. A quick search was conducted and we got most of them within the private facilities. They admitted the administrator supplied them.” The executive said the department was also carrying its investigations and will punish any culprits. “The governor has been raising the alarm on this several times and those involved will face the law to curb further theft cases within the department,” Kutwa said. He said most PPE was received from well-wishers such as Equity Bank, churches, and other stakeholders to help the public. Kutwa dismissed claims that the health team has been exposed to coronavirus, saying there are adequate PPE for staff handling Covid-19 patients. He said Vihiga was caught in the ongoing medics’ strike despite meeting most of their demands. “Promotion is a process and it needs a budget; we are working on it currently under the County Public Service Board and they are aware of it,” he said.
