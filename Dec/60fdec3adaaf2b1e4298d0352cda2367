The government has identified Elgeyo Marakwet as one of Kenya's top tourism destinations. Governor Alex Tolgos hosted the board of the Tourism Fund to promote investment in the sector. He said the Sh3 billion Kerio Valley cable car project should be implemented to attract tourists. Fund officials said it was feasible and they would seek private partners for investment. Board chairman Alphonse Kioko said all agencies in the tourism sector would meet in the county to develop the county as a 'product' for marketing by the Tourism Board of Kenya. “Elgeyo Marakwet is unique because it combines a mix of sports and actual tourism into one product. We have athletics tourism, paragliding tourism and visitors who come to view the spectacular landscapes," Kioko said. He was joined by the fund’s acting CEO David Mwangi and board members Biko Gwendo, Susan Ongalo, Peter Ngori, Kiprop Chirchir, Caroline Nganga, Abdulhakim Balala and state representatives to the board. Kioko said the Covid-19 pandemic was a major lesson to the country that had been relying on one tourism product, notably safaris to see wildlife. “Our traditional tourism products took a hit and we need to diversify so new products can plug the gaps caused by uncertainties like Covid,” he said. Kioko said a national committee had been formed under Tourism CS Najib Balala to unlock the tourism potential in the North Rift. Governors of the North Rift Economic Bloc had appealed to Balala for help. Tolgos called on Tourism Fund to assist in helping residents set up tourism-related businesses through affordable loans. He cited low bed capacity in the county and said some visitors ended going back to Eldoret. Present were Tourism executive Shadrach Yatich, acting county secretary Michael Sengech, Tourism chief officer Sharon Sirma and other tourism officials. (Edited by V. Graham)
