The Covid-19 positivity rate declined to 4.5 per cent on Monday, the lowest since the onset of the second wave. The World Health Organization says a positivity rate of five per cent or below for a consistent period of at least 14 days is a good sign for a country. The Health ministry announced that 46 patients were in intensive care units on Monday, 24 on ventilator support and 19 on supplemental oxygen. An additional three patients were under observation, CS Mutahi Kagwe said in a statement. “Another 26 patients are separately on supplementary oxygen out of whom 22 are in the general wards and four are in high dependency units,” he said. According to the CS, 850 patients were in health facilities, while 5,873 were under home-based care. Some 325 patients recovered from the disease, 256 from the home-based care and 69 discharged from health facilities, pushing the total recoveries to 76,060. The virus caseload in the country is 94,614 after 114 more patients tested positive from a sample of 2,507 tested in 24 hours. The new cases were all Kenyans except 14. They comprised 72 males and 42 females aged between nine months and 81 years old. The cumulative tests conducted to date are 1,011,025. “Sadly, five patients have succumbed to the disease, bringing the cumulative fatalities to 1,644. Our sincere condolences to the families and friends of those who have lost their loved ones,” Kagwe said. Nairobi registered 68 more cases followed by Kiambu with six; Mombasa with five; Busia, Nyeri and Kajiado had four each; while Bungoma, Meru and Kisumu had two cases each. Other counties that recorded new cases include Garissa, Kisii, Nakuru, Marsabit, Uasin Gishu, Kilifi, Nyandarua, Murang’a, Kericho, Vihiga, Taita Taveta, Isiolo and Embu with one each. “As we continue to fight the Covid-19 pandemic, I wish to thank all those health workers who have continued to render their services and chosen not to punish or abandon their compatriots at their hour of need,” Kagwe said.
