Kenya national basketball team coach Cliff Owuor has reportedly agreed terms with Rwanda Patriotic Army (APR) club. The Morans' coach — who tutored the team during the recent Fiba AfroBasket 2021 qualifiers in Kigali, Rwanda — will return to the side that he coached for 13 years before returning home to manage United States International University (USIU) teams. Owuor hinted that there was interference in the selection of national team players, which hindered his work. "We are a good team. In Rwanda we played well but played with a lot of distractions that did not allow players to settle and focus. We must address these issues," Owuor, who remained behind in Kigali, said. Owuor also bemoaned the delay in facilitating the arrival of foreign-based players in time to gel with local-based players. "Once this is done then there is need to have them in residential camp to internalize the plays and defensive tactics. If this is done, Kenya should be able to beat their opponents come February," he said. In Owuor's absence, the team will have to start work immediately under assistant coach Collins Gaya. "We cannot wait for January. There is so much happening during this month that we need to avoid and the best thing is to start after one week," Gaya said. Peter Orero, the Kenya Basketball Federation (KBF) Treasurer who also headed the delegation, said they will address crucial issues and prepare Morans adequately for the crucial February window. Kenya lost their FIBA Africa AfroBasket Group B qualifier going down 92-54 to eventual group winners Senegal, 83-68 to Angola before beating Mozambique 79-62 in their last match.
