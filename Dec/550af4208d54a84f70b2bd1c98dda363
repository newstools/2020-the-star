3,663 people died from road accidents since January marking a 9.4pc increase from 2019 statistics, IG Hillary Mutyambai has said. Addressing the media on Tuesday, Mutyambai said this was the statistics as at December 13, 2020. "The government will continue with the law enforcement operations by increasing patrol," he said. Accompanied by NTSA officials, Mutyambai said NTSA will monitor the fleet data of PSVs. "Any vehicles driven beyond the speed requirement will be impounded and a prohibition order issued," he said. He said there will be random driver checks, license validity verification among other operations. "This time we have 5,000 officers from prison, officers from NTSA to ensure that the festivities go smoothly without any hitches," he said. "...keep safe, keep rules and be compliant to all the guidelines. This is the cooperation I am asking from Kenyans."
