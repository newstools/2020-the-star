A family from Kunati village, Thangatha Ward in Tigania Central, Meru is in agony after their 79-year-old kin drowned in River Thangatha. Bernard M’Cimberia drowned in the flooded River in a suspected suicide incident. M’Cimberia’s family could not come into terms of the saddening loss of their beloved elderly man who is said to have been suffering from mental illness. Area Assistant chief Sabastian Kaugiria confirmed the incident saying it was a sad Christmas not only to the bereaved family but also the village in general. Kaugiria, who witnessed the retrieval of the body on Friday morning said the 79-year-old man is suspected to have thrown himself into River Thangatha after running away from his house. He said families should monitor those who are sick in their families. "I got a report from Patrick Njomo, a Nyumba Kumi member informing me there was an unidentified body on River Thangatha. I took the initiative to come to the scene and with the help of the family, we identified the body. The deceased had a mental illness," Kaugiria said. A neighbour Makena Kinoti said the deceased got lost on Thursday evening and they were shocked to discover his body on the River. The body was discovered by a passerby across the River. Kinoti said she in deep sorrow for the loss of a neighbour adding that the man had tried to throw himself into the same River on Wednesday but well-wisher’s rescued him. “We are in deep shock. We believe he was not killed before thrown into the River because he has been struggling with suicidal thoughts. This is the worst Christmas in our village. He was under medication on mental illness. We saved him on Wednesday from drowning after he threw himself. He has tried to take his life but quick intervention have been saving him,” she said.
