The Early Childhood Education in Wajir will be getting better as standards will be set for teachers and learning. In addition to getting terms of service, the county will prioritise providing learning materials, streamlining studies and building infrastructure. Chief officer for Education and ECD Yussuf Dayib said standards and priorities will improve the quality of learning. Speaking after meeting with trainee teachers of Wajir county ECDE college, Dayib said the teachers set the learning foundation and must be fully supported. Dayib said that the scheme will strengthen the foundation for children in lower classes. The importance of early childhood education cannot be overestimated, he said. “Just as construction of sites require a strong foundation, the same applies to our children. For this reason we have reviewed our curriculum so it is in line with the new system," Dayib said. Dayib said administration will continue looking into teachers; general welfare so they can offer their best without being disrupted by personal issues. “Children need personal attention from their teachers, and if the same teacher is not well remunerated it leads to divided attention hence low input in quality,” he said. Wajir Governor Mohamed Abdi last week said his administration was determined to improve on infrastructure and expand ECD centres to ensure all children are enrolled. He urged parents to take their children to school, reminding them education is free. Parents, especially in the remote, have been reluctant to take their children to school and instead have them look after livestock. Edited by Kiilu Damaris
