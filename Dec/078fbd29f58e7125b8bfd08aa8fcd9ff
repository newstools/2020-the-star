@alalmaurice Kisumu county has benefited from water projects worth billions of shillings from the national government. National Water Harvesting and Storage Authority chairman Erick Okeyo said most of the projects are aimed at controlling perennial floods and ending shortage. The projects include the Sh32 billion Koru-Soin Multipurpose Dam being implemented by NWHSA. Okeyo spoke during his coronation as a Luo elder at Kandaria in Nyakach subcounty. Lake Basin Development Authority Chairman Odoyo Owidi, ex-county executives Richard Ogendo (Trade), and Obiero Ogone (Education) and businessman Ochola Kamili were present. Others included elders and professionals from Nyakach led by 'Ruoth Ogai' Soklo Kobongo Sai. Okeyo lauded President Uhuru Kenyatta for appointing him to serve as the chairman of NWHSA. "The President has faith in me to deliver on the water development projects in the country,” he said. Okeyo also cited the water projects implemented at Pedo Primary School, Rakwaro Secondary School and Nyakach Girls High School. They each cost Sh8 million for water supply to schools and the community. Other water projects are Sh8 million Obugi Nam and Sh12 million boreholes in Nyakach subcounty. Some of the projects were funded by Lake Victoria South Water Works Development Agency. Okeyo also cited the Sh50 million dykes project at Ombaka in Nyando subcounty to control floods. He said Uhuru was committed to ensuring Kenyans access clean and safe water and to also control flood. Ochola and Owidi praised Uhuru for appointing Okeyo to chair the authority. “This shows that the President trusts you with the work. It is now upon you to ensure his agenda is fulfilled. He’s given you the job,” Ochola said.
