Malindi MP Aisha Jumwa and ODM secretary general Edwin Sifuna have been summoned by NCIC over reckless utterances. NCIC secretary Skitter Mbugua said the duo will appear before the commission on December 21, 2020. Sifuna is alleged to have made hateful utterances on December 11, during the by-election’s campaigns in Msambweni, Kwale County. NCIC said that such utterances might affect harmonious coexistence between the communities living in Kwale. Jumwa is also accused of the same utterances which she made while responding to Sifuna. The two have been asked to appear in person, failure to which, will institute contempt proceedings against them. On Tuesday, the commission's chair Samuel Kobia condemned the utterances made by the two leaders. " The Commission has commenced investigations. We urge Kenyans to exercise tolerance and allow the law to take its cause," Kobia said. Kobia added that such remarks might mutate to hate speech, thus disturbing the peaceful coexistence among Kenyans especially their followers. The chairperson has further said that the commission is working closely with the registrar of political parties to ensure that politicians who fail to meet chapter 6 requirements in the eye of the commission, the EACC, and the registrar of political parties to be barred from political office forthwith.
