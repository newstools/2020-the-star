Residents of Kamore village on the Naivasha-Mai Mahiu road have accused Nakuru county government of neglecting the area's roads. Speaking after a demonstration in the area, they called on the national government to come to their rescue as the area was no longer accessible through roads due to their poor condition. Peter Kaara, a  resident and former senior chief, Peter Kaara said the road was gravelled during the administration of the first President Jomo Kenyatta. “We were recently forced to part with Sh12,000 to have the road paved to enable us to bury a fellow villager at his homestead,” Kaara said. He said three people have died while being ferried to the hospital due to the poor state of the road. Local leader Francis Mwaniki said their farm produce, including milk, was going to waste due to the poor state of the roads. He said the worst-hit were pyrethrum farmers who were also unable to ferry their produce to the market despite being the main cash crop in the area. Mwaniki said most of the earth roads were washed away by floods, disconnecting several rural homes and in other instances expectant mothers have given birth by the roadside. The residents described the road as vital, connecting three counties, including Nyandarua, Kiambu and Narok counties. They called for the tarmacking of the road to help alleviate the suffering of the villagers and open market opportunities. The villagers also called on the government to intervene in a land row involving a private developer accused of having grabbed a five-acre farm set aside for a nursery school. Mariah Njenga expressed dismay after a nursery school was torched by unknown assailants a week ago.  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
