An 80-year-old man's body has been found in a thicket after disappearing for six days in Kibokoni village, Magarini subcounty. Luwali Karisa's decomposing body had deep cuts in the head and arms. Karisa’s son Baraka Luwali said his father went missing from home under unclear circumstances and he reported the matter to the police. Luwali said his father left home on Tuesday last week to collect his stipend for the elderly from the government. ''The village elder told me that my father excused himself to go and relieve himself in a thicket but he never came back,'' he said. Luwali said he went back to the police station on Monday and was informed that a body had been discovered at Kibokoni village. When he went to check, he discovered it was his father. He was naked. Maurice Katana, a brother to the deceased, said he was still in shock. Residents suspect the man could have been murdered somewhere else and dumped in the area. Juliana Daniels from Kibokoni said they do not know the deceased and cannot speculate but he could have been murdered elsewhere. Village elder Stembo Kaviha called on the security agents to conduct thorough investigations to establish the killers and bring them to book. He said murder cases were on the rise in the area and asked the government to enhance security.
