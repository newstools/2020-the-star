Vihiga Senator George Khaniri has said boundary disputes between counties can only be solved if a commission is put in place under Kenya’s constitution Article 188. Khaniri said the Senate, IEBC, and land commission could not amend county boundaries without following the constitutional procedures. He said some of the boundaries have got a long history that can not be traced for now but that should not be the reason to deny people services on the mentioned borders. “Let's find a silver lining that can get an interim solution as we wait for a lasting solution along with the affected counties,” Khaniri said. In a previous meeting with journalists Kisumu community secretary, Jotham Ondu said in 2016, there was a meeting in Maseno regarding the boundary dispute with representatives from both sides. He said a government surveyor namely Kirui produced a map no 1 of 1992, which defined the boundaries of Maseno Township, which was recently upgraded by Governor Nyong’o. However, Khaniri urged the county governments from both sides to ensure Maseno people from each end of the boundary get an equal share of treatment and  avoid cultural supremacy  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
