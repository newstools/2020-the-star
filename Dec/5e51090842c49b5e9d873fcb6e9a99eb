An MP from western Kenya is on the spot for allegedly holding night meetings with rival politicians to discuss the demarcation of a constituency ahead of its split as proposed in the BBI Bill. A local said the archrivals have been brought together by the clamour to amend the law and are now pushing proposals to serve personal interests. Locals have maintained they are all stakeholders in the matter and want to be involved in every discussion touching on the boundary review. Some are said to have vowed to reject the leaders in 2022 polls since they have clearly demonstrated their egotistical characters. A virtual parliamentary committee meeting degenerated into a shouting match between an ODM legislator and an MP allied to Deputy President William Ruto. The melee started when the ODM lawmaker, an ardent supporter of the handshake, told a witness appearing before the panel that his days were numbered. The MP told the guest to start packing his belongings because the BBI referendum will pass. The witness, who leads a crucial commission, appeared shocked and dismayed by the sentiments. But before he could utter a word, the Tangatanga legislator picked up the war, telling his colleague the witness was going nowhere and, instead, he and his BBI bandwagon should be prepared to go home in 2022. The argument went on for minutes before the chairman cooled things down. An MP from Nyanza is in panic after a group of parliamentary aspirants forged a united front to dislodge him in 2022. Members and associates of group are said to be rallying their respective clans and supporters to back the candidate they will pick to face off with the MP. However, locals are said to be wondering how they group will pick the person they will front without causing a fallout and still raise enough funds to take on the well-monied and experienced legislator head on.
