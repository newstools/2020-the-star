Kenya Lionesses hopes of qualifying for a maiden Rugby World Cup have received a major boost after World Rugby increased the participants from 12 to 16 for the 2025 edition. Africa which has one slot could have a second, putting the Lionesses in a strong position to qualify for the global extravaganza. In a statement by the global body which read: "The landmark decision, taken by the Rugby World Cup Board earlier this year, reflects World Rugby’s commitment to accelerating the development of the women’s game globally through its transformational women’s strategic plan 2017-25." Lionesses' team manager Camilyne Oyuayo welcomed the decision to expand the tournament and give a chance to smaller nations to play on the big stage. "It's a good opportunity and if we can put up robust structures and improve our talent pool, then we can be on the world stage,” said Oyuayo. The Lionesses are still in the hunt for the 2021 edition slated for New Zealand next year after their qualifier against Colombia early this year was postponed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The match will likely be played in April at the RFUEA ground. If Kenya beat Colombia, they advance to the final qualifying tournament slated for June where they will meet European and Asia teams. Should Kenya win they will play in their maiden World Cup and will face baptism facing hosts and champions New Zealand, Australia and Wales. Kenya missed out on the sole African ticket when they lost 39-0 to South Africa in Johannesburg last year. Oyuayo said the team is in high spirits and have resumed training ahead of the match against Colombia in the new year.
