Tiaty subcounty plagued by poverty and banditry has received Sh10 million to build its first secondary school. Kenya Pipeline Company on Friday donated Sh10 million to build Silale Mixed Secondary School. “This shall go a long way to end insecurity and boost children’s education,” KPC managing director Macharia Irungu said. The donation is part of its corporate social responsibility activities. Tiaty MP William Kamket received the cheque, terming it a "godsend". The area harbours bandits who terrorise neighbouring communities in volatile Kapedo, Baringo North and Baringo South subcounties. Tiaty is also known for widespread FGM and early marriages. The ward also lacks churches and mosques. Resident Moses Atuko said the new school will help open up the area and change people's mindsets about backward cultural practices. "The school is a dream come true. It will also address insecurity, which has been a thorn in the flesh for a long time," Atuko said. Medic Joseph Nakopir called on the government and partners to pay for more infrastructure. Kamket said efforts to transform the region through education have been rewarded and said he is optimistic the school will contribute to development. He pledged to inject more National Government Constituency Development Funds to support the school. KPC board member Jinaro Kibet said school enrollment is low due to cultural practices. He called on the government and partners to put up more rescue centres for victims and targets of FGM as well as schools. (Edited by V. Graham)
