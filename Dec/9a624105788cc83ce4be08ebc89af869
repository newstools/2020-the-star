Hotels in Naivasha have recorded low bookings ahead of the festive season, due to Covid-19. According to hoteliers, 2020 will go down as the worst year ever in which dozens of workers lost their jobs and revenue dropped sharply. Unlike previous years when the town was a hive of activity, business is at its lowest because of the curfew and closure of bars. A survey around major hotels in the town showed bookings are below 30 per cent. Heritage Hotel MD George Njuguna said they are, however, busy with conferences from various government institutions until Thursday. “After that, we shall be dealing with daily visitors as we do not have any visitors who have booked with us during Christmas,” he said. Nest Boutique proprietor Ronnie Muraya said their bookings were below 30 per cent but was optimistic that this would change in coming days. He attributed the low number of visitors to the harsh economic times caused by the pandemic and the stringent rules on movement and closure of bars. “The curfew definitely has an effect on the festive season, but we are all set to entertain our visitors during this period and hope for a better year,” he said. The New Year will come early for residents as ‘Pull-up and Chill' which will be organised off Moi South Lake Road will be held before curfew hours. One of the organisers, Billy Dush Muturi, said the party would start in the morning until 10pm as advised by security agents. “Despite the challenges we have faced this year, we shall have a party from midday to around 10pm to celebrate and hope for a better year,” he said.
