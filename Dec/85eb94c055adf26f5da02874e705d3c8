Americans have been cautioned against travelling to Kenya due to the rising number of Covid-19 cases. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Wednesday assigned Kenya a Level 4 alert, meaning there is a very high level of Covid-19 infection. This, despite the United States reporting more than 200,000 new infections by Wednesday as compared to below 85,000 cases in Kenya. In the advisory, CDC said American travelers should avoid all travel to Kenya. "Travel may increase your chance of getting and spreading Covid-19," the advisory read. It noted that before Americans travel, they should get get tested with a viral test 1–3 days before their trip. "Do not travel if you are waiting for test results, test positive, or are sick. Follow all entry requirements for your destination and provide any required or requested health information," it read. "During travel, wear a mask, stay at least six feet from people who are not traveling with you, wash your hands often or use hand sanitizer, and watch your health for signs of illness." Kenya is among other East Africa countries, including Uganda, Tanzania and Burundi that have been allocated Level 4 alert. Rwanda has a level 1 alert, meaning low level of the virus in the country.
