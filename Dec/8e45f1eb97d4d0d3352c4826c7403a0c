A human rights organisation has hailed the electoral agency for conducting a free and fair by-election in Msambweni constituency on Tuesday. Haki Africa deputy executive director Salma Hemed said the Independent Electoral and Boundary Commission strictly followed the law and electoral regulations compared to previous elections. “Our observation during the by-election is that this time the IEBC really tried to be open, organised and fair enough to give the actual results,” she said. The activist said the fact that no candidate disputed the results proves the credibility of the electoral process. Hemed said people were allowed to vote freely and assisted where possible. She said the live broadcast of the results helped build trust between the people and candidates. Hemed said by allowing various international partners to participate in the electoral monitoring process cleared possible doubts of any kind of rigging. “The existence of different key stakeholders revealed fairness in the voting exercise,” she said. During the by-election, Feisal Bader was elected MP. The contest attracted eight candidates.
