After a magistrate court acquitted businessman Humphrey Kariuki over tax evasion charges, he has stated that he is a law-abiding citizen and that he will continue to invest into his home country, Kenya. "I am a law-abiding citizen and I will continue to comply with the judicial process in the remaining two matters before the courts," he said. He added that despite the difficulties and reputational damage that he has faced over the past year and four months, as a result of these ill-founded allegations, he has continued to focus on building his businesses across Kenya and other African countries. "As a proud and dedicated African businessman, I will continue to invest into my home country, Kenya, and across the continent, firm in the belief that we can strengthen people through sustainable job creation, skills development and the creation of opportunities to build and develop new markets," he said. "I would like to thank everyone for the overwhelming support and positive sentiment expressed during this whole journey," he concluded. Magistrate Kennedy Cheruiyot on Tuesday acquitted Kariuki after the DPP failed to avail witnesses in court. Kariuki has three different cases touching on tax evasion. Two others are still pending before different magistrates.
