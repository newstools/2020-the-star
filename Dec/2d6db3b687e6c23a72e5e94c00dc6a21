What good is a blood bank without blood? Kajiado county has established its own blood bank at the county referral hospital. Governor Joseph ole Lenku on Tuesday appealed to resident to donate blood, saying that otherwise the bank will be meaningless. He also outlined his achievements. In an interview with the Star, he said the county is feeling the pain of Covid-19 and urged residents to take precautions seriously. He said though his government has established ICUs in major hospitals in  Ngong, Loitokitok and Kajiado, people need to exercise caution. “We have employed 250 doctors, nurses and clinical officers but that is not enough,” he said. The county chief also said his government will give bursary funds to needy students in late December for schools' opening in January. “When the schools reopen, the monies will have been received in their schools and cheques issued,” Lenku said. He said while Kajiado water-scarce, his government has constructed earth dams across the county. “For Kitengela, we are engaging with the Export Processing Zone Authority in Athi River to take over the distribution of Nairobi water," the governor said. He said the Nol-Turesh Water Company that gets water from Loitokitok has also improved and the neighbouring counties are satisfied. Edited by Kiilu Damaris
