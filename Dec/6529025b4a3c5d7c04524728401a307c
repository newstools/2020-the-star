The former BBI joint secretary Martin Kimani has assumed office as Kenya’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations, in New York. This comes following a virtual presentation of credentials to the United Nations Secretariat on Thursday. The virtual presentation of credentials was necessitated by the latest UN Covid-19 protocols. Before being appointed as Kenya’s Permanent Representative to the UN, Kimani was the President’s Special Envoy for Countering Violent Extremism and Director of Kenya’s National Counter Terrorism Centre from September of 2015. Kimani also served as Secretary for Strategic Initiatives in the Executive Office of the President from December of 2018. He has served as Kenya’s Permanent Representative to the UN at Nairobi, United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat) between December 2012 and September 2015. As Kenya assumes her tenureship of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) in January of 2021 for the 2021-2022 period, Kimani’s experiences will dovetail appropriately with Kenya’s stated Agenda at the UNSC. Kenya will seek to achieve its mandate at the Council within the context of four broad priority objectives, which are: regional peace and security, counter-terrorism and violent extremism, peace support operations, and climate and security. Kimani had also served as a Director at the Intergovernmental Authority on Development’s (IGAD) Conflict Early Warning and Response Mechanism in Ethiopia, from April 2011 until December 2012. President Uhuru Kenyatta made a number of nominations and appointments of ambassadors in October. The president also nominated three former IEBC commissioners as deputy foreign mission heads. Consolata Nkatha, Margaret Mwachanya, and Paul Kurgat have been nominated to be deputy mission heads for Rome, Islamabad, and Moscow respectively. The two resigned from the IEBC in April 2018, saying they had no confidence in chairman Wafula Chebukati.
