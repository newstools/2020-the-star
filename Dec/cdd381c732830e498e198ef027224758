The Kenya Bureau of Standards has maintained that all vehicles registered in 2013 will be rejected in the country by end year. This was even after used car importers pleaded with the government in November to extend the deadline. In a statement on Monday, Kebs managing director said the Certificate of Roadworthiness issued for vehicles whose year of first registration is 2013 will not be valid after December 31, 2020. “All vehicles issued with such certificates must arrive at the Port of Destination/Entry by December 31, 2020,” the Kebs MD said. He said the vehicles arriving at the port of destination past the given timeline will  be rejected at the expense of the importer. Kebs added that importers of used vehicles/secondhand motor vehicles including returning residents, diplomatic staff, and the general public that only Right-Hand Drive (RHD) whose first year of registration is from January 1, 2014, and later shall be allowed into the country from January 1, 2021. The agency said that vehicles exported to Kenya must comply with KS1515:2000, while vehicles from countries where Kebs has an inspection agency shall be accompanied with a Certificate of Roadworthiness issued by the agency. The importers said lack of ships led to delays in bringing in units, with some 2013 made cars expected to arrive later next year. Through the Car Importers Association of Kenya (CIAK), the traders appealed to the Kebs and the Industrialisation, Trade and Enterprise Development ministry, to allow them an extension of three months, to March 2021.
