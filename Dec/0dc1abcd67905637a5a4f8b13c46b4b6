A body with missing limbs was found in a thicket on Monday evening in Kiseveni village, Mwingi Central, Kitui. Residents suspected that the missing limbs, including hands, were eaten by wild dogs. They informed Kalisasi chief Titus Musili, who, in turn, reported to police officers. The cause of death was not immediately established. Mwingi Central subcounty police commander Peter Mutuma said the body could not be immediately identified, though it was suspected to be that of Maurice Kilolo Mbuvi, who went missing a month ago. In a separate tragedy, an accident on Mwingi-Garissa road in Kwa Muna area claimed the life of a passenger. The crash occurred after the left rear tyre of a Toyota Probox salon car burst, prompting its driver to lose control, thereby veering off the road. The vehicle had four passengers. Alphonse Kitema, 34, succumbed to his head injuries while being rushed to the hospital. Other occupants, including the driver, sustained soft tissue injuries and were treated and discharged. The car was towed to Mwingi police station.
