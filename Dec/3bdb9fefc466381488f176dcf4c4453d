Former Kenya Sevens skipper Humphrey Kayange has appealed to the Kenya Rugby Union (KRU) to improve the technical aspects of the game if they hope to rule both the sevens and 15's version in future. The former Mwamba captain, who is the athletes' representative at the  National Olympic Committee of Kenya (NOCK), said the federation should have a rugby philosophy spread at all levels from grassroots, community level and club rugby. “If we want to move rugby to the next level, KRU must rope in coaches and train them from lower levels considering the game has grown and it is being played all over the country. We all need to pull in one direction and take a few steps forward so that nothing is left hanging ahead of the next World Cup,” asserted Kayange. He said the country can't afford be left behind with the sport having gone professional over 25 years ago. "Rugby around the world is a highly professionalised environment and this is where Kenya should be moving. Things are changing around the globe and we don’t want to be left behind. We must embrace or adopt to the changes just like our rivals,” he said. Kayange said NOCK Elite Commission will help Shujaa and Lionesses prepare for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics next year.  “Both teams have already started their training and we hope to see the intensity go up in the new year,” added Kayange. Shujaa are lined up to play two tournaments in Spain in February as part of their  Tokyo Olympics build-up and the former skipper is confident they can medal in Tokyo this time round unlike four years ago when they finished 11th out of 12. “Our preparations will be much better this time round as the boys are ready to challenge for top honours and do the country proud, ”added Kayange.
