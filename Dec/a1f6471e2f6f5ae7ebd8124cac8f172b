Bishop Allan Kiuna says politics is not for him. Speaking to Word Is, the JCC minister said he is so peaceful serving God. "Why would I ever want to join politics? There are so many troubles there. I do not know what would make somebody who is having such wonderful people want to join politics," he said. Kiuna added that with all the insults and the madness going on in the political world, even if he was given a political position, he would turn it down. "I am so happy doing what God has called me to do. I am content living my life quietly as a minister. I have no stress with anyone and I can go to any place I want. You know when you join politics, it's like you donate your life for other people."
