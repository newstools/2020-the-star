Jesus Celebration Centre in Kisumu has been demolished as the county government continues to repossess grabbed public property. The demolition is part of the ongoing pursuit by the county government to reclaim the grabbed public land. These include parking lots, playing grounds, recreational parks and city houses. The church is built on part of the land meant for Moi Stadium. City acting manager Abala Wanga said the church management had been given notice to vacate the land. Wanga said they will not relent on the effort to reclaim all the grabbed or illegally acquired property. "We are not going to spare anybody who grabbed land, city houses and playing ground," he said. The city manager said that they are going after all grabbers irrespective of their status in the society. Wanga said the grabbers include former powerful politicians and councilors. They include influential persons in the city who have grabbed public land and built houses on them will not be spared. He asked those who grabbed or illegally acquired public property to willingly surrender them before forceful repossession. Wanga said they have embarked on a rigorous process of repossessing all the county property. The city also brought down structures on a land next to Tom Mboya Labour College which had been grabbed with various people including a former minister. On December 17, the city demolished Neno Evangelism Church and an extension of Mamba hotel which are located on the road reserve.
