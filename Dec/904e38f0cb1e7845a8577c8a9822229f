There is a heavy presence of police officers in the Nairobi CBD ahead of the debate of a motion to impeach Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko. Sonko is supposed to appear before a committee to give his side of the story in regard to three claims against him. He will appear at around 2:30 pm. There are fears the governor and his supporters may sponsor incidents of chaos to disrupt the planned events at the county assembly. Police say they have deployed patrols to deter any form of chaos and want the public to continue with their activities. Sonko is away in Diani, Kwale County with about three dozen MCAs as part of efforts to derail the motion. The governor is at loggerheads with the Nairobi Metropolitan Services over allocation of funds and has been terming it an illegal entity. He has been accused of gross violation of the Constitution, gross misconduct and abuse of office. Minority Leader Michael Ogada assured MCAs he will proceed with his motion and alleged their counterparts allied to the governor were broke and money was offered to them to withdraw the motion. He said he also had been offered money to withdraw the motion but refused. Ogada denied claims MCAs had been coerced into signing the notice of motion to impeach, saying everyone acted independently.
