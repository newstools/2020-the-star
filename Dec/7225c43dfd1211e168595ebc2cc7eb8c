The planned Law Society of Kenya Special General Meeting scheduled for Saturday has been stopped by the High Court. Justice Pauline Nyamweya suspended the impugned Special AGM pending hearing of the case. Lawyer Gad Aguko moved to court on Wednesday asking the court to stop the meeting, saying it was not approved. He said the agenda includes a motion to ratify the removal of CEO Mercy Wambua, which he called illegal. He said the agenda does not have the required approval of the LSK council. In her ruling, Judge Nyamweya suspended any notices on the Special General Meeting. "The leave granted herein shall operate as a stay and suspension of the Special General Meeting that is scheduled to be convened on December 5, 2020, or any other day as contained in any Notices Requisitioning the intended Special General Meeting, pending hearing and determination of the case,” the court ruled. Aguko argues that Havi is acting without the approval of the council to sanction the collection of signatures to approve the scheduled meeting. “The president, acting illegally and without jurisdiction as a one man-council has proceeded to authorise the convening of the SGM when the meeting ought to be done by the council as a whole,” court papers read. Aguko says the LSK Act provides that signatures to support the convening of an SGM have to be submitted to the LSK CEO who then submits the request to the LSK council for approval. He argued that names, admission numbers and signatures of those supporting the SGM have not been verified by the council as required to confirm that they are practicing advocates. He says Havi acted outside his powers when he instructed acting CEO Collins Odhiambo to proceed with organising the meeting despite the fact that the society has a legally appointed person as its secretary. The judge directed the parties in the matter to exchange documents  before the hearing on December 17. (Edited by V. Graham)
