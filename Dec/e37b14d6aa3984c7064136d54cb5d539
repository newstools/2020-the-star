The government will set up a team to seek a diplomatic solution between Kenya and Somalia, Spokesman Cyrus Oguna has said. This was after Somalia cut its diplomatic ties with Kenya citing constant violation of Somalia’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. Somalia Minister of Information Osman Dubbe announced that Mogadishu will in the next seven days withdraw all its diplomats from Kenya. Addressing the media on Tuesday, Oguna said the Kenyan government will not follow the same route taken by Somalia. “We are a higher nation, we cannot do the same thing Somalia has done. If we do so it will look like revenge hence, we will let the IGAD and Comesa take control of it,” Oguna said. Oguna spoke on Tuesday at KICC, Nairobi, while briefing the nation on locusts’ infestation situation, among other issues affecting the nation. Ministry of Foreign affairs told the Star that Kenya had not received any official communication from Somalia about cutting its diplomatic ties. The Ministry said it could only take up the matter once officially notified. Kenya appeared to strengthen its ties with the self-declared country Somaliland. President Uhuru Kenyatta even welcomed the Somaliland President Muse Bihi on Monday at State House, Nairobi, where they discussed the bilateral trade between the two countries. The Somaliland president also met with the AU convoy Raila Odinga where they discussed security and development issues. He said that payment of the healthcare workers employed by the Ministry of Health under the Universal Health Coverage (UHC) program, and those on short term contracts following the Covid-19 pandemic has been addressed.
