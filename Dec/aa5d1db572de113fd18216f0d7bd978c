Youth and women's groups in Kitui on Tuesday received Sh68.25 million from the national government to empower them economically. Public Service, Youth and Gender CAS Rachael Shebesh distributed the cheques to beneficiaries in Kitui Stadium. The money was from Uwezo Fund, Youth Enterprise Development Fund and Women Enterprise Fund. She said her ministry has more funds that should be given out to women and youth groups. Shebesh said a sizeable amount of the money would be channelled to Kitui to supplement Governor Charity Ngiluâ€™s efforts to empower residents. The CAS praised Ngilu's administration for coming up with a number of innovative initiatives to boost residents and the county's income. Among the initiatives is the setting up of the Kitui County Textile Centre (Kicotec), the Kwa Kilui Stone Crusher and Kitui Pharma Centre. Kicotec produces apparel, while the stone crusher produces ballast. The Kitui Pharma Centre produces disinfectants, sanitiser and other non-pharmaceutical materials for use in hospitals. The products were previously sourced from outside the county. Ngilu praised the national government's efforts to empower women and youth through the distribution of revolving funds to help them boost their economic wellbeing. She called on women and youth to use the funds prudently. Shebesh also praised Governor Ngilu for mentoring women leaders in the country and called on Kenyans to support the BBI process, which she said will make their lives better.
