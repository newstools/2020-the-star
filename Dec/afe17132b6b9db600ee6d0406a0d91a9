A 54-year-old woman has been hacked to death over witchcraft allegations at Zayoni village in Matuga sub-county. The deceased Bintihassan Mwadiya was found lying dead with her face buried in the ground after being killed by unknown people. Her body and the back of the head had multiple deep cuts that exposed flesh. Kwale police confirmed the incident. According to the police report, the area chief Munyaka Mugandi alerted the security officers about the murder. So far, no one has been arrested. It is barely three weeks since a 70-year-old woman was hacked to death at Mazeras in Kinango within Kwale County. The cases of the elderly killing have been on the rise since January in the county. County Police Commander Joseph Nthenge has warned the locals against taking matters at hand. Police have launched investigations and the body was taken to Kinango mortuary for postmortem.
