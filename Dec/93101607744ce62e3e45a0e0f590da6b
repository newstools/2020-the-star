All public transport vehicles on the Lamu-Garsen road must travel in a convoy escorted by armed police officers. A county security meeting reiterated the directive following an attack on a Border Patrol Unit vehicle at Nyongoro area on Sunday. Police suspect al Shabaab insurgents were responsible. Lamu county commissioner Irungu Macharia said on Tuesday they are aware some PSVs had been travelling at night without security. Other vehicles, mostly matatu shuttles have been on the roads very early in the mornings without security. “It's imperative that we all stick to the rules and avoid being sneaky and reckless. Public vehicles must stick with the convoys. No travelling at night. We are commencing arrests, don’t say we didn’t tell you,” Macharia said. He said police were pursuing a list of notorious drivers who have been openly flouting the rules and endangering lives. “We shall arrest and charge you with deliberately endangering lives plus we shall also withdraw the vehicle licence and ban you from the road immediately,” he said. Scores of lives have been lost to attacks by the Shabaab insurgents on the road since 2014. The ban on night travel on the road and the directive to travel in a convoy was introduced in July 2014.
