The Kenya Cup league scheduled to start on February 13 will adopt one-way format. This means thee league will only feature 11 matches between February and May  with the semifinals and finals set to follow in subsequent weekends. This was resolved during a meeting, which attracted league/fixtures committee and Kenya Cup and championship sides. Sources who attended the meeting said the club chairmen said they were keen to start the campaign with most clubs having started their preparations. " The chairmen revealed that teams are  training in groups to conform to the Covid-19 restrictions with forwards and backs training on alternate days," said the source. If the league does kick off  in February, clubs will be required to start their pre–season and strength conditioning phase in January to get ready for the league kickoff. The sources said most other team sports have the plans in place and rugby can't be left behind. "If we keep postponing, something else may crop up and we will never play. All the clubs are abiding by the various Covid-19 protocols in accordance to the Ministry of Sports requirements,” the source added. The league restart, the sources said is likely to help the Shujaa and Simbas in the various international assignments like the Tokyo Olympics and Africa Cup fixtures. "It will be a big boost to our national teams as the players will get the much needed playing time ahead of the assignments ahead," he added. Clubs have not played any rugby since March following the onset of the pandemic with the leagues having been cancelled due to time constraint. Kabras topped the 2019-2020  standings with 74 points followed by champions KCB with 71 . Homeboyz, Impala,  Mwamba and Menengai Oilers finished in the playoff positions. Western Bulls and Kisumu were relegated and will be replaced by either Strathmore Leos, Mean Machine, USIU, Egerton Wasps or Northern Suburbs in the new season.
