Walter Keverenge, Bernard Ogutu, Albert Okech and Whycliffe Mbarani Muviza are workers of Mitsumi Computer Garage Ltd. They pleaded not guilty before Milimani senior principal magistrate Bernard Ochoi. Robbery with violence carries the death penalty. The four are accused of robbing Daksha Patel of $150,000 (Sh 15 million) at gunpoint at Mitsumi Business Park Computer Garage Ltd in Westlands, Nairobi, on December 7. The complainant was taking the money to a bank in Westlands. The stolen money was recovered after a police operation in Kawangware, Mathare and Kangemi. The prosecution did not oppose the bail application by the accused. Ochoi released them on Sh2 million bond with a similar surety or Sh700,000 bail. The case will be mentioned on December 18.
