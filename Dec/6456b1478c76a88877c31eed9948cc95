Bungoma Governor Wycliffe Wangamati has criticised Kakamega Senator Cleophas Malala for allegedly 'disrespecting' elected leaders. "We don't need a leader from Kakamega county to come to Bungoma and belittle us. We must be respected because we were publicly elected and have the mandate of the people to serve them," he said. Wangamati spoke during the burial of Mama Agnes Ngoya in Khaoya village, Kanduyi constituency. Last Sunday at a service at the Christ the King Catholic Church, Malala blasted Wangamati and Kanduyi MP Wafula Wamunyinyi terming them traitors in Ford Kenya. His sentiments triggered chaos at the church. Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang'ula, Senate Speaker Kenneth Lusaka and Malala were forced to leave the scene after youths who were angered by the senator's sentiments pelted them with stones. Malala had accused Wamunyinyi and Wangamati of being the greatest impediment to Luhya unity. "The greatest impediment to Luhya unity is our Luhya brothers Wamunyinyi and Wangamati who are seated here with us," Malala said. "Wetang'ula, your problem is seated next to you (Wamunyinyi). Wetang'ula, your problem is Governor Wangamati, who is here with you." Malala said he was ready to 'be hired as a mercenary' to protect and champion the Luhya unity. "For anyone planning a coup in order to be party leader they should go for presidency, are you Wamunyinyi fighting to own Ford Kenya or do you just want to continue being the Kanduyi MP?" he asked. "We don't want to be auctioned as Luhya community, let's unite and speak in one voice. Let ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi and Wetang'ula lead us, we must have a presidential candidate come rain come sunshine." Bungoma Deputy Governor Charles Ngome and Wamunyinyi asked Malala to stop visiting Bungoma and fanning party wars.
