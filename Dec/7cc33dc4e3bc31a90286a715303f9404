Harmonize has joined the list of artistes who earn more than a million shillings for a stage performance. Over the weekend, 'Jerusalema' hitmaker Master KG was in Dar es Salaam for a concert. Harmonize made a surprise appearance and revealed how much he is usually paid for a stage performance. "Let me tell you, whenever you see Harmonize on stage, it means he has already been paid $25,000 (Sh2.5 million). But I am here for my G, my guy (Master KG)." Harmonize is among the richest artistes in East Africa. He became famous after being signed by Diamond's record label Wasafi, where his music fan base grew. Later on, he quit and started his record label, called Konde Gang.
