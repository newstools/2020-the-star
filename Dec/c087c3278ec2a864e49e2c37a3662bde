A severe water shortage has hit several villages in Lamu county owing to the prolonged drought in the region. The affected areas are Kiangwe, Madina, Bahamisi, Bar'goni, Mkondoni, Kwasasi, Magogoni, Manda Island and Mokowe. Residents say they have developed sores and rashes on their bodies after drinking dirty salty water. Others have reported teeth discolouration after using the salty water. The boreholes and wells in these areas have since turned saline forcing locals to use the salty water. They have appealed to be supplied with fresh water until the drought is over. The occasional supply of fresh water from the nearby military and police camps is not enough. For several weeks now, residents of these areas have also been left at the mercy of private fresh water dealers who ferry fresh water via boats and sell it to them at high prices. They have appealed to the county government to intervene and supply them with fresh water using water. “There are just a handful of boreholes here and in all of them the water has turned salty because of the drought. We are urging the county government to intervene and establish a permanent solution to the water challenges here considering this is the same scenario every year,” said Joseph Oduor of Manda Maweni village. Locals have been trekking for hundreds of kilometers daily to reach fresh water sources. Residents of Lamu East have to cross over into adjacent Lamu islands to get fresh water. This is cumbersome as they have to carry around jerry cans of water for each trip. “Its impossible to drink salty water with this hot sun. Some of us have opted to shuttle between here and Lamu island weekly to get water. It’s very expensive and uncomfortable,” said Fatma Shirazi of Mkondoni in Lamu East. Edited by Henry Makori
