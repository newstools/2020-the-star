Farmers have appealed to the government to come up with a permanent solution to the perennial flooding of River Tana that leaves them destitute. They blame the flooding on the spillover of KenGen dams in the upper parts of the river. The farmers dread heavy rains in Mt Kenya and the Aberdares as they result in the ruin of their livelihoods. They say they are a frustrated lot since their pleas to the government and local politicians are hardly heeded. The farmers are grateful to non-governmental organisations and aid agencies like Oxfam and Arid lands Development Focus for always providing assistance. Mohamed Hussein is an Oxfam-funded project beneficiary in Tana River. The British aid agency is running a pilot project to restore farming activities after flooding and the locust invasion early this year left farms bare. “Vegetable farming is our backbone. We are left destitute every time floods sweep away our crops,” Hussein said. He is the chairman of Abafodho group of farmers in Tana River county. Aldef, which is assisting flooding victims, recently gave 25 farms in Tana River Sh38,400 each. Farmer Fatuma Ibrahim said the recent floods washed away farming machinery engines. Canals that supply water to more than 200 farms along the river were also destroyed. “We ask the government to solve the recurring floods menace. We can no longer feed our families since the farms have been ruined,” Fatuma said. She said they have lost hundreds of mango and orange trees. “We have been given seeds by Aldef but we can’t access the farms because they are flooded. The government should help us,” Abdi Hussein, another farmer said.
