Wazalendo's fast-rising star Richard Njuki says he has a point to prove in the Super League next season before he merits playing in the top tier. The 20-year old was to be promoted to the Premier League in this year's Covid-19 disrupted season but illness and loss of form denied him the chance to convince selectors. Njuki plays for Wazalendo Masters team. The former Musingu High School vice captain scored eight goals to rank fourth in the scoring charts but wants to lift the top scorers' gong this time round. With illness now behind him and the body back in shape as he continues training, Njuki believes 2021 could be crucial in his development as he seeks to fulfill his dream. "Being advised to play another season in the second tier next year is like motivation to me. I want to double my tally and be named the top striker in the Super League," he said. "With the little experience I have gained, I will be ripe to play in the Premier League after next season." "I developed complications in January this year. Was diagnosed with pneumonia, I lost form and weight as well, making it hard for me to break into the first team. I have fully recovered now and raring to go," said Njuki, who was part of  Team Kenya to the Youth Olympics in Argentina in 2018. He scored three goals in Buenos Aires and that experience really helped him, as he says: "I have tried to play like a world class player since then. Looking at my age and the number of goals I have scored is no mean feat. There's however a long way for me to go."
