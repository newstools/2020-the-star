Eldas MP Adan Keynan on Thursday led his constituents in planting over 3,000 trees in Elnur town. The drive, which is in line with the Greenfication of Eldas Constituency Programme, was sponsored by the Equity Bank Foundation and the Adan Keynan Foundation. "The programme was started a few years ago and if adopted by all, it will go a long way in turning our dry and barren land into a productive and habitable place," Keynan said. He encouraged other constituencies in arid and semi-arid areas to plant trees. “Climate change is more serious than sporadic terror attacks since it affects food security. We should invest in programmes with climate change in mind," the MP said. Equity credit manager Denge Waqo said the only way to win the war against the effects of climatic change was by planting trees. “We envision partnering with schools' managements to plant more trees,” he said. Residents praised the initiative. “As an elder, I congratulate our MP for leading by example. This is certainly good work that we should all support. Let others emulate and conserve the environment,” Abdihakim Didow said. Two years ago, a similar drive was held in the area. A total of 7,000 trees were planted then.
