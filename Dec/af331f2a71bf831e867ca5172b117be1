President Uhuru Kenyatta will take a one month break to celebrate the Christmas holiday. In a circular by the Ministry of Foreign affairs, Uhuru will be out of the office from December 15 to resume January 16. "The ministry has the honour to inform you that H.E the President will not be available for any official/public engagements including phone calls unless they are emergencies," a circular to Heads of Diplomatic Missions said. According to the circular, any request towards the head of state should be made through the Principal Secretary or his designated representative. "The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Kenya avails itself of this opportunity to renew to all Heads of Diplomatic Missions, the United Nations Agencies and the International Organisations in Nairobi, the assurance of its highest consideration," read part of the circular. The ministry also complimented the missions for having pulled through despite the current Covid-19 pandemic. The ministry said the pandemic necessitated virtual engagements which increased the workload manifold making it even more complex.
