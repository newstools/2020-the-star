Children from Okiludu in Teso South Sub County have every reason to smile after Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong purchased for them face masks ahead of schools reopening on January 4th, 2021. The children received the governor's masks offer with jubilation when the county chief hosted his neighbours at his Okiludu residence on December 28th, 2020. Earlier, the governor witnessed the youth display their prowess in a dancing competition with parents in attendance acting as referees to pick on the winners; it was a thrilling moment as the youth displayed what they are made of in terms of talents. The Governor urged the children to observe Ministry of Health Protocol by wearing their masks all the time while in public `places, observing social distance and washing hands with soap and running water. "Schools will be reopening at the time when the country is facing possible third surge of the Coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic. Your failure to observe the protocol might spark off these surge," he said. In order to prevent parents from the pandemic, the Governor gave each one of them some money to purchase the masks noting that the fight against Covid-19 is a concerted effort and not only the Ministry of Health. HE Ojaamong urged county residents to rally together in the new year and share successes and challenges, urging his neighbours that he is always available for them; he thanked them for accepting his invitation to have lunch with him. Chief Officer, ICT and Communication, Lydia Nabwire thanked Okiludu residents for honouring the Governor's invite, noting that HE Ojaamong is the man of the people.
