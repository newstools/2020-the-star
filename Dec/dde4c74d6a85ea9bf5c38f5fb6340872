City 20.12.2020 (17:15) Tottenham Hotspur welcome Leicester City on Sunday in the Premier League. Spurs are the league leaders with 25 points, but third-placed Leicester are not far behind in third spot. The Foxes are just one point behind the league leaders and can go top after a win against Spurs if other results go their way. Tottenham Hotspur were involved in one of the most memorable title races in 2015/16 when Spurs were beaten by Chelsea to hand the Foxes the title. Leicester have looked like they can take the title race down to the wire again and Spurs are also looking impressive this season. Leicester City would have been in a better position if it wasn’t for their two league losses in their last four Premier League games. However, they have recovered well with two wins from their last two games. Their task won’t be easy against a Tottenham side that currently boasts the best defence in the league.

Leverkusen remain the division’s only unbeaten team as they sit in first place after 12 games for the first time since 2009/10— a season in which they played out a 1-1 draw with Bayern in the 13th round. This Leverkusen side will have no fear, especially as they’ve netted 4+ goals in five of their last seven competitive home games. They’ll be in the mood for revenge after Bayern beat them 4-2 in the 2020 DFB-Pokal final and having scored before the 30th minute in four of their five Bundesliga home games this term. Bayern Munich have netted an average of three goals per top-flight fixture this term - their best average at this stage since 1976/77. However Bayern’s average of 1.5 goals conceded per Bundesliga match after 12 rounds is also their joint-worst across the past 39 seasons. The 30-time German champions travel here as favourites though, but have conceded in all six opening Bundesliga road trips the first time they’ve done that since 2006/07.

Consequently, Benevento have lost just one of their previous five SA matches none of which produced over 2.5 goals with only two seeing both teams score. Genoa managed a 2-2 draw against an impressive AC Milan side last time out, but despite that they are still enduring SA’s worst current win-less run. Genoa’s paltry average of 1.0 goals scored per SA game this term hasn’t helped, neither has the 2.0 on average per game they’ve conceded. The visitors are winless on the road this SA season netting just twice so far. At the other end they’ve conceded nine goals (1.8 on average), although two-thirds came in their first away league outing at Napoli (6-0). Whilst six of those nine goals they let in arrived after HT, Genoa have still conceded the opener in 60 percent of their travels.
