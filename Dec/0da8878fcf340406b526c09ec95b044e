The electoral commission has set March 23, 2021 for the Machakos Senator by-election. The seat fell vacant following the death of Senator Boniface Kabaka. Political parties intending to participate in the by-election have up to Monday next week to submit names of persons contesting in the primaries. “A public officer who intends to contest in the by-election shall resign within seven days of the declaration of the vacancy by the speaker,” IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati said in a notice of the by-election. Political parties will be required to present candidates for the election by January 18, 2021, having resolved all disputes arising from the primaries. Direct nominations will also close on the same date; with parties required to submit names and symbols they intend to use during the by-election. Candidates, the IEBC notice reads, will present their nomination papers on January 25 – for political party candidates, and January 26 – for independents. Political bigwigs are thus headed for a busy year with the commission setting campaigns for the seat from January 25 to March 20. Camps are already shaping up in the axis of President Uhuru Kenyatta, ODM leader Raila Odinga, and Deputy President William Ruto. The sides are already tipped for a battle in the Nairobi governor race and two MP by-elections. ODM has pulled out of the city vote. The party did not present candidates for primaries. But campaigns are in top gear for the Matungu and Kabuchai by-elections set for March 4, 2021 .It is shaping into a contest between the Ruto axis and western bigwigs Musalia Mudavadi, and Moses Wetang'ula. Raila’s party has declared interest in the Matungu MP vote.
