Lamu county elders have raised concern over increased suicide cases in some parts of the county. They have called on the county government to make plans and deploy psychiatrists and counsellors to speak to residents of the affected villages. The elders identified areas such as  Mulei, Wiyoni, Mpeketoni, Matanya, Majembeni, Faza, Hindi and some parts of Witu as most affected. Speaking during a meeting, Lamu elder Mukhtab Seif said the cases had increased sharply during the Covid-19 pandemic and it was tiresome to bury  suicide victims. “Covid-19 has changed many lives for the worst and people are stressed. Many have given up and taken their lives but we are here to send a message of hope.We hope the county sends some counsellors before this gets out of hand,”Seif said. The elders noted that many people are undergoing stressful times occasioned by loss of jobs, inability to do meaningful businesses, increased marital pressure and many others due to the pandemic. They said there is a need for people to understand that problems are not permanent and that better days are coming. The elders said many people have been pushed into depression, stress and mental disorders are finding it hard to walk away from them. “I don’t remember a week that has gone by without burying someone who committed suicide because of this or that problem. If psychiatrists aren’t sent here, these villages’ population will be almost zero by the time Covid-19 is over,” elder Sharif Ahmed said. The elders have asked the county government to also ensure adequate psychological support is provided to locals through frequent campaigns.  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
