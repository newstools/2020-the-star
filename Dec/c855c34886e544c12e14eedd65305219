Kwale police are detaining two people after being found with weapons often used by terror suspects. The duo were intercepted by the traffic police on a roadblock at Tiwi in Matuga. Two Machetes were recovered, one had a red scarf on it. Police have identified the suspects as Hussein Sure Mohammed and Sylvester Cherono. They were heading to Ukunda from Mombasa. According to county police Commander Joseph Nthenge, the two reside in Diani. They were travelling in a probox like vehicle. Their motive for carrying weapons illegally is not known. The arrest comes some few days after the Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang'i promised to scale up security when he visited the county. This follows the built-up tension caused by the Msambweni campaigns ahead of the by-election and festive seasons. The county security has however assured of enough safety and order. The two will be taken to court on Monday. Police have launched investigations.
