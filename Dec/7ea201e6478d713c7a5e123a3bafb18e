Irate villagers at Riana, Bonchari in Kisii County have torched and killed an elderly woman on suspicion of being a witch. Area chief Edward Moenda said the 70 year-old Salome Gechemba Ongoro died on Friday evening at the scene after she sustained severe burns. The body has since been moved to Kisii Teaching and Referral Hospital Mortuary for postmortem. Moenda said the deceased was suspected to have bewitched a high school student who died as he washed a bodaboda outside their home on 11th this month. The Genda high school student, Ronald Opore, is said to have sustained injuries when he lit up the washer to clean up the motorbike. He died on the spot. Police have since begun a manhunt for all those involved in the incident. Chief Moenda condemned the rising incidents of extrajudicial killings in the area even as he urged wananchi to exercise restraint "We we have left it to police to start from here and ensure the perpetrators are brought to book," the administrator told the Star by phone. Kisii County Police Commander Jebel Munene said investigations have been launched with view to arresting the perpetrators. "We will bring all that are involved into the dock immediately they are apprehended , we have are already begun the hunt for them," he said.
