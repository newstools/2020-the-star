The festive season is here and with it comes the usual travel and merry making. The Christmas mood easily leads one into overindulging and overspending, but this festive season is different. There is little to celebrate due to the ravages of Covid-19, which has leftÂ  joblessness, sickness and death in its trail. Though there is light at the end of the tunnel following the discovery of vaccines, we are still in the tunnel. The country has gone through the first wave and just when we thought the infection rate was reducing, we were hit by the second wave that proved to be more devastating in terms of fatalities. It is for this reason that we should not drop our guard even as we make merry. Kenyans love reconnecting with their ancestral homes during Christmas and many are likely to travel upcountry. The travels and get-togethers are potential super spreader events and come January, the infection rate could skyrocket. The best thing, therefore, would be to spend Christmas where you are, unless you really have compelling reasons to travel. Observance of the laid down protocols such as keeping off crowds or large family gatherings, sanitising and washing hands and putting on a mask must not be broken. Apart from protecting yourself against Covid-19, it will also be prudent to spend wisely for January is always one of the longest months.
