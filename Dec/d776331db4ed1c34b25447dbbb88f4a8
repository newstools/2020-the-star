Interior CS Fred Matiang'i and ODM leader Raila Odinga led dignitaries and government officials in mourning Nyamira Governor Nyagarama. The leaders converged at Nyagarama's funeral service at the Nyamira Primary School Grounds to pay their last respects to the county boss during the state burial. Among the leaders present at the funeral were Chief Justice David Maraga, governors Wycliffe Oparanya (Kakamega), Anyang' Nyong'o (Kisumu), James Ongwae (Kisii), Cyprian Awiti (Homa Bay), Okoth Obado (Migori), Wilbur Otchillo (Vihiga), Hillary Barchok (Bomet) and Cornel Rasanga (Siaya) among others. MPs at the ceremony were led by Vincent Kemosi (West Mugirango), Joash Nyamoko (North Mugirango), Shadrack Mose (Kitutu Masaba), Richard Onyonka (Kitutu Chache South), Ben Momanyi (Borabu) and a number of MCAs from both Nyamira and Kisii County. President Uhuru Kenyatta who was expected to lead mourners was not in attendance but was instead represented by CS Matiang'i. Nyagarama's remains had earlier arrived at Riamanoti Primary School near his home on Thursday morning. The body arrived aboard a Kenya police chopper at 9.30 am accompanied by three other choppers with family members and Borabu MP Ben Momanyi. The governor succumbed to Covid-19 related complications at Nairobi Hospital last Friday. He was 74 years. Nyagarama was elected on an ODM ticket and was serving his second term in office. Interdenominational prayers were held on Wednesday where leaders euoligised Nyagarama as a true leader who was dedicated to serving the residents of Nyamira and Kenyans at large. After his burial on Thursday, Deputy governor Amos Nyaribo is expected to be sworn in early next week to take over from the departed governor.
