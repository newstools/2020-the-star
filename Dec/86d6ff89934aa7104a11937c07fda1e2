Kenya Basketball Federation (KBF) will go to the polls on January 23, according to assistant secretary Ambrose Kisoi. He said the exercise will start with the branch and commission elections on January 4. A week later, the branches, the commissions and the teams will then submit the names of two delegates each with only one allowed to vote. All the aspiring candidates will return their forms to the already constituted five-man election panel on January 15. The elections were earlier planned for April but were called off following the outbreak of corona pandemic. Only two candidates had expressed their interest in the top position. Of all the branches affiliated to KBF, only Nairobi Basketball Association (NBA) had conducted their polls and elected new office bearers. Kisoi asserted that once the election is done, the federation will then sit down and draw a programme of activities for the year. “Once we have everything in place, we will then sit and plan our activities for the year. The earliest the league games can start is February 6,” he said. On the national team, he said they will meet this week to plan on how the team can assemble for training ahead of their FIBA Africa Afro-Basket second window. Kenya are only a win away from returning to the continent’s top championship since 1993 following last month’s qualifiers in Kigali Rwanda. During their first window played in Kigali, Kenya beat Mozambique 79-62 but lost 92-54 to Senegal and 83-66 to Angola in their Group ‘B’ ties.
