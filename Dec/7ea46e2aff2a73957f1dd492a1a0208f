Diamond's mum Sandrah says she has ever slapped her son for bringing different women to her. Speaking to Wasafi Media, she said she is not manipulative like many think, but she is not happy when her celebrity son keeps exchanging women. "Mara sijui huyu, mara kesho huyu. One day I became angry and beat him up." Asked the kind of woman she would want her son to date and marry, she said one who is very disciplined. "I want a woman who loves our religion, is concerned with family and they understand themselves as well. Sio mke tu yeyote." She said she is not aware if Diamond is currently in any relationship. "So far I have not seen one. I also do not want to be close to any of his women unless he tells me this is the one. I also do not want any kind of nonsense, so she should be respectful." She allegedly beat Diamond's baby mama Hamisa Mobetto a few years ago. She said things started going south between the two after Hamisa called reporters when she went to see her in hospital after she gave birth to her son Dylan, something that led to Diamondâ€™s mother getting insults on social media.
