Governor Wilber Ottichilo has urged Vihiga residents to re-elect him in 2022, so he can 'finish what he has started'. He said his first few months after he was elected governor in 2017 were the worst because there were no structures in place and there was a bloated wage bill. "My first three months in office were hell on earth after being ranked the poorest performing governor countrywide. The ranking caught me off guard but I could be number one in service delivery if you accord me a second term to finish what I have started," the county chief said. He said the rankings shocked him, and he was unable to face the electorate. “From number one MP countrywide to the worst performing governor. What was I to tell the people of Vihiga over the ranking?” Ottichilo said. He spoke on Sunday at Vokoli Salvation Church, where he attended a service. Ottichilo said that in the past three years he has been in the office, he has tried his best to transform Vihiga. “In the recent ranking we were in position 11 and that shows that we have taken a step in the right direction,” he said. In education,  Ottichilo said, the county was ranked position two countrywide after Murang’a and in agriculture, the county was number eight. “We shall soon be ranked position one countrywide,” he said. He was in the company of his chief of staff James Otari, Public Service and Administration executive Pamela Kimwele and Education executive Henry Lumbasio.
