President Uhuru Kenyatta on Saturday attended the consecration of Rev Calisto Odede at Citam Karen. The event is a card, invite-only session, though others are welcome to follow proceedings online through the Citam platforms. Odede takes over from Bishop David Oginde who served as the third presiding bishop of Citam for a period of 10 years. A sermon was delivered by South African cleric Rev Frank Chikane. Odede previously served at Nairobi Baptist Church and was picked early this year to take over the leadership of Christ is the Answer Ministry. He now becomes the fourth presiding bishop to CITAM which has more than 2o churches. In his tenure, Oginde criticised and lauded the government at equal measures. During the launch of the Building Bridges Initiative report at the Bomas of Kenya, Oginde asked Deputy President William Ruto and ODM leader Raila Odinga to end their enmity for the sake of the nation. Oginde pleaded with the politicians to allow the current proposals to lay a foundation for the future of the nation. Odede is a graduate of Kenyatta University and Trinity International University.
