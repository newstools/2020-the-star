A police officer who allegedly obstructed the ongoing Building Bridges Initiative signature collection exercise in Bomet County Cop has been charged and released on a Sh20, 000 cash bail The officer identified as Peter Langat is said to have torn the document and threw into a nearby stream at Lelekwe village in Kipreres in Bomet east. Area sub-county police commander Francis Gikeri said the matter was reported by an assistant chief that while in the process of collecting the signatures from the residents the visibly drunk officer who was on his pass leave approached him and requested to append his signature. He said after the administrator handed the document to him to append his signature, he plucked off two pages containing names and signatures before throwing the whole booklet away. “The administrator, however, retrieved the booklet which was already soaked in water and brought to the station where he reported the matter…we immediately sent officers to his home where they managed to arrest him,” Gikeri told the Star. Following the incident, Gikeri pointed out that, the exercise became suspended in the area. His motive, the police boss, said remains unknown. Investigations into the matter, he added, were ongoing before the suspect is arraigned in court. He stated that they intend to prefer charges of malicious damage of government property, obstructing the chief from performing his duties, and even drunk and disorderly against the suspect. While warning anyone against engaging in such acts, the police boss termed it as a crime that was punishable. “We want to warn the residents against interfering with the ongoing process being carried out by the public servants in their areas…when you dislike the process just leave the administrators do their work,” he said.
