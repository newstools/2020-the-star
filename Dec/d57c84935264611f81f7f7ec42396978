A court has advised a man accused of beating and injuring his mother to buy and slaughter a goat for her during Christmas, so she can forgive him. Embu principal magistrate Henry Nyakweba told Morrison Gitonga that buying a goat for his mother Judy Gitonga would soften her heart, and she might eventually withdraw a case she has filed against him. “Just sweet-talk your mother and buy her a goat for Christmas and by the time you come back here she will have softened and forgiven you,” he said. Nyakweba told Gitonga it is wrong for one to beat a parent, no matter what wrong he or she has done. He said the best thing one can do is to apologise. Gitonga was charged with assaulting and causing his mother actual bodily harm on Sunday following a quarrel over an unknown reason in Rutune village, Embu North subcounty. He denied the charge, saying he can never beat up his mother. He asked the court to terminate the matter. However, the magistrate said the matter can only be withdrawn if the complainant directs so. He said the hearing will continue to the end. The magistrate released the accused on Sh10,000 and a surety of the same amount or Sh5,000 bail. The hearing of the case is set for March 31 next year.
