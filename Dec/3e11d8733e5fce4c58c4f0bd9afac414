A Baringo boda body lobby plans to issue job identity cards to all riders to weed out unlicensed schoolgoing children joining the business. Baringo Central Bodaboda Riders Association chairman-elect Bernard Kibichii said the move will keep children off the transport business and stem rise in accidents. "Notorious schoolboys are the ones breaking the traffic rules and causing frequent road accidents," Kibichii said. He spoke in Kabarnet on Thursday after he was reelected in a poll overseen by the Independent Electoral and Boundary Commission. "We cannot continue allowing young schoolboys to continue tainting the image of boda boda riders," he said. Kibichii said the teens flooded the business after schools were closed down following the outbreak of the coronavirus in March. He said Baringo Central had about 600 riders but the number has shot up to more than 2,000. "Parents are to blame for assigning their sons motorbikes thinking they are helping to keep them busy and to make some little income, little do they know they are ruining their lives," Kibichii said. Kibichii said that they are committed to cleaning up and reclaiming the dignity of the industry. He called on his colleagues to report any cases of malpractice. "We should all desist from engaging in cases like drinking and driving and sexually abusing our customers," he said. Constituency returning officer Timothy Kirui urged the boda boda riders to observe the stipulated traffic regulations. Alex Koech was elected vice-chairman, James Kipsaina (secretary-general),Â  Dennis Korir (treasurer) and Boniface Kiplagat (vice-secretary).
