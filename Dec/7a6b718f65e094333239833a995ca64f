Diamond Platnumz's manager Babu Tale has denied claims that he killed his wife, Shamsa Kombo. Speaking during an interview withÂ Clouds FM, he dismissed the claims saying they were started by jealous people. Tale said he loved his wife and she loved him too. "People who say that I killed my wife by sacrificing her to black magic are just propagandists. I really loved my wife and I could never go against the marriage institution by breaking it all in a bid of chasing leadership and power." Tale's wife Shammy, died in June. The cause of death is yet to be made public. News about her death was broken on social media by Diamond's family members who condoled with the deceased's family. "WCB label's (manager's) wife and mother of his children Hamis Taletale @babutale, Shammy died earlier today," Diamond's mother, Mama Dangote, wrote.
