Top government officials including the President, Deputy President William Ruto and ODM leader Raila Odinga are set to attend the burial of Nyagarama next week. Nyagarama was elected on an ODM ticket and was serving his second term in office. He is the fourth governor to die in office. The first was Nderitu Gachagua of Nyeri in February 2017, then Wahome Gakuru (Nyeri) in November 2017 and Joyce Laboso of Bomet in July 2019. Nyagarama's deputy Amos Nyaribo will take over for the remainder of the term.
