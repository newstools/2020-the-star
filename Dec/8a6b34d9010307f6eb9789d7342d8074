The Orange Democratic Movement has announced plans to field its candidate in Matungu Constituency by-elections scheduled for March 4, 2021. The party National Elections Board (NEB) chairperson Catherine Muyeka Mumma announced on Thursday through a statement, a day after IEBC gazetted the mini-polls. She has invited ODM interested candidates to submit their applications to the party headquarters by end of Monday, 21 December 2020. Interested applicants can access application forms from the headquarters or download them from the party's website www.odm.co.ke. The party will also field candidates in five wards that will be having by-elections on the same date. The electoral commission chair Wafula Chebukati said that Matungu by-elections will be held alongside five wards that were affected. These include Huruma (Uasin Gishu), Hells Gate, and London (Both in Nakuru), Kiamokama (Kisii), and Kitise/Kithuku (Makueni). Matungu seat was left vacant following the death of Justus Murunga Makokha. The late Murunga was Amani National Congress (ANC) member, led by Musalia Mudavadi. Matungu by-election is expected to stir up a political contest between Mudavadi and Raila, who have dominated the politics in the Western Region. Deputy President William Ruto is also expected to step in, after his ally in the concluded Msambweni by-elections Feisal Bader won, beating ODM man Omar Boga. The late area MP was also a close ally to the DP and attended most of his functions.
