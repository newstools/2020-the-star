Harambee Starlets' playmaker Cynthia Shilwatso believes she is now ripe enough for a starting role at Spanish women's top division side EDF Logrono Feminino. Coach Gerardo Garcia Leone introduced Shilwatso in the 65th minute during their 1-1 draw against Sporting Huelva at the Estadio Municipal de la Gaunas on Sunday an improvement for the Kenyan who got just 10 minutes in her previous involvement. It was Shilwatso's third match of the season, having also turned out for the side when they edged Levante 2-1 and in their 1-1 draw at Espanyol on November 22 when she came on to replace Grace Asantewaa in the 80th minute. Speaking to the Star on Monday morning, the 21-year-old, who thrice clinched the Kenyan Women Premier League title with Vihiga Queens, says it won't be long before she penetrates into Logrono's starting lineup. "At the moment I can say I have greatly improved both in training and in games. I'm really working hard to penetrate into the first team and I believe I'll soon make it," said Shilwatso. Shilwatso has endured more time on the bench since she arrived at the club and her excitement was evident on Sunday when she took to her Facebook account to post her action pictures immediately after the match. 'Everything comes at the right time, be patient," she wrote on her wall. Lograno are currently placed eighth on the log on seven points after one win, four draws and three loses. Shilwatso was unveiled by the side on September 16, exactly a fortnight after she had signed a three-year deal. She is among a host of Kenyan players who have secured attractive deals abroad. Harambee Starlets forward Mwanahalima Adam recently sealed a six-month deal with Israel top tier side Maccabi Holon.
