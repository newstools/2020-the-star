Doctors have demanded that the Ministry of Health take responsibility and clear all the outstanding bills of Dr Stephen Mogusu. Mogusu died on Monday. The 28-year-old medic who was attached to a Covid treatment centre in Machakos died after contracting the virus while on duty. Reports indicate the medic left a bill of almost Sh800,000. "I have been in touch with the family and they had to fundraise for Sh200,000 as deposit for admission to the ICU. Mogusu has left behind a bill the family is not sure how to clear," KMPDU SG Chibanzi Mwachonda said on Tuesday. The doctors have hit out at politicians who claim their demands are unrealistic, saying they will not embark on a suicide mission. This is after ODM leader criticized health workers for going on strike, saying they took an oath to protect lives and should not watch as Kenyans die ofÂ  Covid-19. Speaking in Kisumu county on Monday, Raila appealed to doctors to be understanding. "It's not only doctors who are dying... we are also in a hard position economically... this is not the time to hold the government at ransom," he said. However, KMPDU chairperson Samuel Oroko said, "We have seen governors coming out to defend themselves instead of looking for solutions. It is insensitive when Kenyans are dying and people are busy collecting BBI signatures, pulling huge crowds that are super spreaders of the virus."
