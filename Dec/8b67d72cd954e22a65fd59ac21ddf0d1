A Nakuru court has ordered the reinstatement of Egerton University Vice-Chancellor Rose Mwonya. The VC had moved to court to seek a judicial review following the University Council's decision to send her on terminal leave barely two months to the expiry of her term on January 12, 2021. She is set to officially retire on January 12, 2021, after attaining the mandatory retirement age of 70. But on Monday evening, the Nakuru court suspended the decision pending the hearing of the case. Justice Hellen Wasilwa ordered that the matter be heard inter partes on December 10, 2020. In the orders made, the decision to replace Mwonya with Professor Kibwage was also suspended. In 2018, the council suspended the VC onÂ allegations of financial impropriety. Mwonya was asked to stay away for 90 days pending investigations over the alleged gross misconduct. But later a court reinstated her and asked her to resume her position. Mwonya, the first-ever female Vice-Chancellor of Egerton University, took over from Prof James Tuitoek in 2015 to become the fifth VC of the institution.
