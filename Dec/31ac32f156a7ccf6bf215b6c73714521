As the Nairobi Metropolitan Services rushes to complete Green Park terminus, operations have already started at the newly built dispensary. The dispensary will offer emergency medical assistance for commuters and matatu operators. NMS on Monday announced that the dispensary was already functioning and the medical practitioners had attended to six patients. Green Park terminus located at Railways Club will be the drop-off and pick-up point for at least 110 matatus plying the Ngong and Lang’ata routes. This terminal will be functional once the NMS directs all matatus out of the central business district to help in decongestion. In an interview with the Star last week, NMS director-general Mohammed Badi estimated that at least 3,000 people use the terminus daily. "The dispensary is done and we are currently looking for funds to equip it. Once the terminus is launched, the dispensary will be running," he noted. Badi and acting Nairobi Governor Benson Mutura on Monday toured the Green Park terminus in the company of MCAs. Mutura was taken through various facilities within the modern terminus like the nursing room, ablution block and washrooms, supermarket, police post and a restaurant. Badi noted that design issues and consultation with stakeholders caused the delay in commissioning the terminus. A modern restaurant and a mini-supermarket will also be built to offer services to passengers and matatu crews. Two modern ablution blocks will also be set up, one at the drop-off point and another at the pick-up area. Badi said they are determined to make the ablution blocks hygienic and user-friendly to everyone, including the physically challenged and children. Once completed, the Green Park design will be replicated in the other termini that NMS plans to construct along Workshop Road and in Westlands, Landhies–Muthurwa and Globe Roundabout.
