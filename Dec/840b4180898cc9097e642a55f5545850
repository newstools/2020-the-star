@alalmaurice Some 9,629 university, driving school and technical college students have received cheques worth Sh68.5 million from the Kisumu administration. Deputy Governor Mathews Owili said 5,296 of the beneficiaries are girls. Owili handed over the cheques on Thursday at Mama Grace Hall in Kisumu. He said the county used strict and transparent methods to pick the beneficiaries. “We picked them through public vetting by the ward committees and home visits and background checks,” he said. Owili appealed to the beneficiaries to work hard and excel in their studies to set an example for others seeking similar support. “The only way to thank Governor Anyang Nyong’o and the county government is to excel in your studies,” he said. The Kisumu County Education Fund was established in 2016 to assist bright but needy students in various institutions to access education. “When we took office in 2017, we escalated it to a higher level with even more beneficiaries despite challenges of delayed remittances from the exchequer,” Owili said. In the financial year 2016-2017, the fund supported a leadership and mentorship programme for the 2016 Form 1 scholarship beneficiaries to give them a firm moral foundation. In the same financial year, the fund supported an additional 280 scholarship students who joined Form 1 in 2017. Further, 70 students who enrolled for coxswain training at the Maritime Training Centre were supported. Some 11,902 students from colleges, secondary schools, universities, special schools, and driving schools were also funded in 2017. Owili said in 2017-2018 the fund supported 280 more scholarship students joining Form 1 in 2018. Another 13,629 students from colleges, secondary schools, universities, special schools, and driving schools benefitted. Last year, the fund supported 350 scholarship students in Form 1. Another 14,629 college, secondary school, university, special and driving school students were funded. Owili urged education stakeholders, particularly head teachers to ensure students are safe from the Covid-19 pandemic. “Let us ensure both the teachers and pupils adhere to the Covid-19 protocols. We should combine efforts to kick out corona from our schools and colleges,” Owili said. The deputy governor said the education sector has been hit hard by the virus. “Many pupils and students have not been to school since March this year when the first case of COVID-19 was reported in the country,” he said.
