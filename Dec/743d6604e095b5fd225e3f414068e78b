A police officer was arrested after he shot dead his friend during an argument in Gigiri. The motive of the murder is yet to be known. The constable based at Gigiri's Nyari Police Patrol Base is in custody following the death of his civilian companion on Tuesday night, police said. He used his AK47 rifle to fire 10 bullets at the man, who was in his car parked at the station after an argument. When other officers rushed to the scene, they found the body of the victim at the driver's seat of his Toyota Probox. Witnesses said the officer, who had earlier been chewing miraa with the victim, was disarmed and arrested. Nairobi police boss Rashid Yakub said detectives have launched investigations to establish the motive behind the killing. “We are yet to know the motive of this incident but our officers are talking to him,” he said. He termed the incident isolated, adding the suspect is in custody. The victim was a regular visitor to the station but it is not clear if he was an informer or a friend. The body was taken to the mortuary.
