Kisii University vice chancellor John Akama has said the country's future could be bleak as a result of declining scholarships for Kenyan youth. Akama was speaking at the Kisii Cultural Centre in Kisii during the unveiling of Beaten Odds, an autobiography of Stephen Mabea, 85, a former teacher and education officer. It was co-authored with journalist Joshua Araka. The vice chancellor accused university and college students of using much of their time on unimportant social media content at the expense of serious book learning. He said social media may have come at the right time but it has slowly edged out that spirit of book reading that was existing among young people. “The situation is getting acute and I urge you to return to the old good days when students could read and acquire knowledge through study‚” he said. Akama said even with the launch of the book, fewer and fewer scholars in the country were writing books. "It is a serious concern that can only be addressed by a change of mind and heart among our scholars who should start writing books even for posterity's sake," he said. Stephen Mabea urged young people to write storybooks for young readers. He said writing books requires serious intellectual engagement that is now lacking among the young. Journalist Araka has written two books, Peppered Path: Chronicles of the Idler and Korondo-Panic. He said despite social media, Kenyan youth can rise and seize the moment to grow their intellect with book learning. Nyamira Senator Okong'o O'Mogeni, the chief guest, delivered a virtual address. In attendance were Mabea's former pupils including his son Zablon, former Lands commissioner Sarah Omache, now Kisii Health executive; and Francis Rosana, a retired senior accountant.
