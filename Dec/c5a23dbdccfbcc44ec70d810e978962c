Hifadhi Talanta Africa has launched the Impact Gospel Awards, which aim to grow youth and provide them with suitable role models. To foster meritocracy, a craft committee deliberates on nominations from the public and settles on a final list, from which the academy board will pick winners to be announced at a gala on December 6 at the Serena hotel. Corporate strategist and HTA founder Violet Wanjala said the awards stand for integrity, or being the same person on and off stage. "As Christians, we are light and salt of the earth, we are not called to fit in but to stand out," she said. Organisers said this is not a popularity contest. Nominees for artiste of the year include Evelyn Wanjiru, Gloria Muliro, Kanji Mbugua, Mercy Masika and Reuben Kigame.
