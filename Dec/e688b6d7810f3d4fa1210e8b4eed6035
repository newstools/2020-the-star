Health CS Mutahi Kagwe on Wednesday made a tour to several hospitals under construction by the Nairobi Metropolitan Service (NMS) to inspect their progress. The NMS is set to construct 24 new health facilities in informal settlements in the city at a cost of Sh2 billion by the end of February 2021 in an effort to improve access to healthcare. Kagwe visited Uthiru level 3 hospital where he met Maganda Wanja, who donated her land for the construction of the community hospital. He then toured Kiamaiko level 2 hospital and Ushirika level 3 in Dandora before making an impromptu visit to Mama Lucy Kibaki Hospital on Kangundo road. The CS then visited Soweto level 2 hospital located in Kayole. Target areas include Kibera, Githurai, Viwandani, Majengo, Kayole Soweto, Kawangware, Korogocho, Mathare, Mukuru kwa Njenga and Mukuru Kwa Reuben among others. Plans are also underway to elevate Mama Lucy Kibaki Hospital to a level five health facility. “In my next 100 days, I intend to achieve building 24 fully functional hospitals in Nairobi’s informal settlements. The development comes at a cost and we must ensure we do not go back to where we came from,” Mohammed Badi said while taking over as the NMS DG. The project was officially commissioned by President Uhuru Kenyatta in August by witnessing the groundbreaking for the construction of a 16-bed capacity hospital at Muthua in Uthiru and Kianda in Kibera as well as a 24-bed facility at Maendeleo Village in Mukuru Kwa Reuben. All the facilities are expected to be completed by February next year for official handover to the government. According to NMS Health services Director Dr. Josephine Kibaru, 19 out of the 24 health facilities will be built from scratch while the rest would be rehabilitated.
