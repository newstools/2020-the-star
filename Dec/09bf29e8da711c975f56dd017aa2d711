Two Lithuanian nationals enroute to Dubai have been arrested with 2kg of heroin at JKIA. Stendelis Rokas(20) and Brencius Karolis(30) had concealed the heroin at the bottom of their suitcases. "The highly addictive hard drug was found during the procedural search on travellers' belongings," DCI said on Friday. They are both in custody as suspects of trafficking in narcotics, with further investigations ongoing before arraignment. A month ago, Kenya Revenue Authority intercepted concealed heroin and bhang that were being smuggled through an international courier service provider at JKIA. The heroin originated from Juba, South Sudan and was destined to Cambodia whereas the bhang had originated from Kasese in Uganda and was destined to France. Both consignments were separately intercepted after they were detected while passing through the non-intrusive scanners. Heroin makes the brain produce feel-good dopamine but after the tolerance is acquired a higher dose is needed to function. The drug has become cheaper, purer and more easily available. Users often take it as part of a cocktail of other drugs, often at parties.
