Midfielder Samantha Mewis has been named the 2020 U.S. Soccer Female Player of the Year, capping a year in which she excelled for clubs in the U.S. and England, in addition to the U.S. National Team. Mewis, 28, played in eight of the nine games for the US national team, starting six and scoring four goals, all coming at the 2020 Concacaf Women’s Olympic Qualifying tournament, where she posted consecutive two-goal games against Costa Rica and Mexico. She also played well in the NWSL Challenge Cup for the North Carolina Courage before moving to England, where she joined Manchester City in August. She played 17 matches for Manchester City and scored six goals—three in the FA Women’s Super League, two in the FA Cup and one in the Champions League. Mewis helped lead Manchester City to a 3-1 win over Everton to claim the FA Cup, becoming just the second American woman -- and third American -- to score in an FA Cup final, joining Carli Lloyd (2017) and Christian Pulisic (2020). “It’s obviously a huge honor to be a part of the list of players that have won this award in the past,” Mewis, the 17th member of the U.S. National Team to win the honor, said in a statement.
