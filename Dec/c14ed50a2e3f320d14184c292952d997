Starring: Gal Gadot, Chris Pine, Kristen Wiig, Pedro Pascal, Robin Wright, Connie Nielsen The film starts with a flashback of when Diana was still a young girl and competed against older and more experienced Amazonian warriors. Diana is disqualified for taking a shortcut during the competition. Fast-forward to 1984, decades after the events of the first film, Diana is working as an anthropologist at the Smithsonian Institute by day and fighting crime as Wonder Woman by night. Diana meets Barbara, her new insecure co-worker, who begins to idolise her. Maxwell Lord visits the Smithsonian in search of a mysterious stone that grants wishes. Diana and Barbara unknowingly use the Dreamstone to make their own wishes come true. Diana wishes to see Steve, the pilot she rescued and fell in love with. Barbara wishes to be powerful and beautiful just like Diana. When Maxwell becomes the embodiment of the stone, Diana might have to give up the love of her life once more to save the world. The film is the sequel to 2017's Wonder Woman. Unlike its predecessor, this film lacks the allure that enchants the audience with the Amazonian magic. Making the film 3D was an unnecessary move by the studios. If the plot is not right, not even the best cinematography can save it. It is interesting to see comedian Kristen Wiig cast in a villain role. Compared to her previous characters, which are usually quirky and fun, it is unconvincing as a viewer to see her in an anti-hero role. The film is anticlimactic and makes us wonder if a third instalment is necessary. Star rating: 3 stars
