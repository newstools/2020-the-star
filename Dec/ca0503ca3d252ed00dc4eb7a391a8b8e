President Uhuru Kenyatta has sent a message of condolence to King Mswati III and the people of Eswatini following the death of the country’s Prime Minister Ambrose Mandvulo Dlamini. The 52-year-old Prime Minister died while undergoing treatment in a South African hospital. In his message of encouragement and comfort to King Mswati, Uhuru said Kenya stands with the people of Eswatini as they mourn their departed leader. “ Dlamini was an industrious and devoted leader who was committed to improving the wellbeing of his fellow countrymen. It is unfortunate that we have lost such a great leader at a time like this," Uhuru said. “May the Almighty God comfort the Prime Minister's family and the people of Eswatini as they mourn their kin and leader." The president said Kenya will forever cherish his contribution to human development especially in the banking and telecommunication sectors where he served successfully for many years before becoming Prime Minister. Uhuru assured the King and the people of Eswatini that Kenya stands with them at this difficult period of mourning. Dlamini was moved to South Africa on Dec.1, to “guide and fast track his recovery,” from COVID-19. At that time, Masuku said Dlamini was stable and responding well to treatment. Dlamini was appointed prime minister in November 2018, following his position as the chief executive officer of MTN Eswatini. He had worked in the banking industry for more than 18 years, including being managing director of Eswatini Nedbank Limited.
