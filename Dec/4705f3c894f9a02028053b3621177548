More than 2,000 residents of Lokwamos in Turkana East are fleeing to Nakukulas following bandit attacks that claimed the life of a four-year-old boy. Governor Joseph Nanok and other leaders are demanding the government to use force to rid the area of bandits. "Even if it means bringing in KDF, let them come and camp in the region for at least a year for peace to prevail," he said. Lochakula chief Joseph Esinyen said residents are fleeing for fear of more attacks from Pokot bandits. On Tuesday last week, bandits with Ak47 rifles raided Lokwamosing village in Lokori/Kochodin, shot dead a four-year-old boy and drove off a herd of animals. Security officers camped in the bush and recovered at least 200 goats and 500 sheep. Turkana county police commander Samuel Ndanyi said four people were injured during the 3am raid. They were taken to Lokwamosing dispensary. Security officers have been deployed to track down the bandits and recover more livestock. Two weeks ago, a Form 1 student was shot dead after bandits attacked men gathering firewood in Kapedo. Nanok said the security team has done its best but that's not enough and more security forces are needed in the region. "We want the government to use to solve insecurity in the region,” he said. He said a place like Lokwamosing in Turkana South enjoyed peace for a long time but now residents' lives and property are in danger. Turkana county commissioner Wambua Muthama said the security team is doing everything to ensure residents are safe from bandit attacks. “We had peace in the region but the moment we held a peace meeting in Karbanet, Kapedo, with leaders in Baringo and Turkana counties we experienced bandit attacks. A day after a peace meeting, one person was killed." (Edited by V. Graham)
