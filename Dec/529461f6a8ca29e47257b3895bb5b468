The Ford Kenya faction led by Kanduyi MP Wafula Wamunyinyi plans to field independent candidates in Matungu and Kabuchai MP by-elections. Making the announcement, Bungoma Deputy Governor Charles Ngome said if the wrangles in the party persist, none of the two factions – the one led by Wamunyinyi and the other by Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang’ula – will field a candidate using the party ticket. “We better field independent candidates in the two constituencies. Nobody will vie using the Ford Kenya ticket until the leadership wrangles are resolved,” Ngome said. He was addressing mourners during the burial of Mama Agnes Ngoya in Khaoya village, Kanduyi constituency, Bungoma county. Ngome said there will be no one to sign the papers from parliamentary nominees because both Wetang’ula and secretary general Eseli Simiyu are in opposing camps. “Unless we have elections in Ford Kenya through the National Delegates Conference, nothing will take place in the party”. Wamunyinyi, who is Kanduyi MP,  called on Wetang’ula to withdraw the case in court and allow the NDC to proceed. “He’s just clinging on to court orders. He will eventually be kicked out. We need fresh leadership in the party, and he knows that his time is over,” the lawmaker said. Wamunyinyi said they will continue to fight for the independence of the party to ensure its growth. “We need to have it attract more members. We need to make it grow its tentacles beyond Bungoma county,” he said. Bungoma Governor Wycliffe Wangamati said he supports the Building Bridges Initiative project because it will create three more constituencies. Tongaren, Bumula and Kanduyi will be split to create more constituencies.
