@ppcheti Lamu leaders have asked the government to set up a maritime college in the county to train youths for jobs in the Lapsset project. Woman Representative Ruweida Obbo, MPs Stanley Muthama (Lamu West) and Athman Sharif (Lamu East) said on Monday that the college will directly supply labour for the port. They said the college will work for Lamu port as Bandari college does for Mombasa port. “It's just realistic that the Lamu port has a college as a sure way to ensure a steady supply of the labour force, be it manual or skilled, just like the Mombasa one. It will also be a guarantee that our youth get to be employed at the port after training,” Muthama said. Shariff called for the speedy rehabilitation of the Mpeketoni and Kizingitini technical training centres. Early this year, the national government announced it had set aside Sh110 million for the upgrade of the two TVET institutions. The leaders also want the Lamu Port Corridor Development Authority to honour a pledge by former President Mwai Kibaki to train 1,000 youths to work in the Lapsset project. They were to be recruited in five groups of 200 youths over five years. “So far, only two tranches have been recruited and trained, with some already having graduated from various colleges and institutions. There is still at least 600 left to go. No one is telling us when that will be,” Obbo said. They want all the remaining youths absorbed at once to speed up the process. “The process is taking forever. By now, the 1,000 ought to have already graduated considering the process started in 2012,” Obbo said.
