Maragoli elders have urged the community to ensure their children undergo traditional circumcision to uphold their culture. The elders said those who have been circumcised in hospital will not be allowed to lead the community. The elders spoke after conducting prayers at the Mulogoli shrine in Madzu location of Vihiga constituency on Saturday. This year's circumcision rituals were suspended due to the strict health protocols to contain the spread of coronavirus. Area assistant chief Reuben Amyunzu however faulted thje elders for the gathering, saying health guidelines were compromised during the meeting. Amyunzu said Covid-19 has changed the way of life and that it is time people in the villages start coping with the new normal. “You can’t fight the government with the new state orders in place to combat Covid-19,” Amuyunzu said. Journalists were barred from accessing the shrine with authorities not allowing the scribes to take even photos. Authorities in Vihiga county also suspended football tournaments in Luanda and Emuhaya constituencies that were organised as part of the Christmas celebrations. Emuhaya MP Omboko Milemba said they were engaging the administrators to ensure the events proceed under tight Covid-19 safety protocols. “We are in talks with the governor and county commissioner to see how we can work hand in hand to ensure these tournaments are not affected,” Milemba said.
