The Syokimau railway terminus will be linked to the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport to ease traffic delays and promote railway services. Transport CS James Macharia on Monday announced the government was in talks with their French counterparts to finance the project. “We have another railway project that will connect the Syokiamu station to the airport,” Macharia said. The project will involve the construction of a new line from the Syokimau terminus over Mombasa Road into the airport. Macharia did not state the cost but said both Kenya and the French governments had agreed on the funding and that implementation will start soon. The CS said the upgrading of the country’s railway network was an investment Kenyans should be proud of as it had taken 122 years for it to happen. “In Kenya, we now have a railway system which we can be proud of. Before the SGR, no major investment had been done in the country in the railway network for a whole 122 years. The railway line from Mombasa to Nairobi was constructed in 1885,” Macharia said. On Monday, Kenya Railways, through the Nairobi Commuter Rail Service, commissioned operations for a new train service linking the city centre and the airport. Passengers who will use the JKIA express route will pay Sh500 for each ride. The launch of the service follows the commissioning last month of the DMUs by President Uhuru Kenyatta. The President assured the rail track will be extended to the airport. Macharia on Monday praised the intercity service. Plans to link the Syokimau terminus and JKIA was first mooted in 2017 before Kenya Railways conducted feasibility studies. The new line will provide services for people leaving the Syokimau terminus into the city centre and those connecting to the terminus from the city centre.  Edited by P.O
