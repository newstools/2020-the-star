Minor amendments have been proposed for the draft Kenya Swimming Federation (KSF) constitution. The amendment proposals will be presented during the Special General Meeting scheduled for January 9 which will be conducted virtually. Roselyn Njeri, one of the stakeholders who have been pressing for change in the sport, said the draft constitution is a good document that captures the aspirations of the stakeholders. "I believe we have a very good document which we hope will be passed in the new year with minor adjustments,”she noted. Nominations for the elections will be held on January 15. The election will only featured paid up affiliates, who have been active for the past two years. Currently, only Nairobi and Mombasa are legible to take part in the polls. Majority of the counties and clubs are yet to align to the Sports Act but plans are underway to give temporary licences to vote during the polls. Other highlights of the draft constitution will see athletes (male and female ) represented in the executive committee. There will also be  two coaches (man and woman), who will sit in the executive committee. Head of Sports Dispute Tribunal John Ohaga said the rest of the election road map will be disclosed in the new year. “We are on the right track and other details of the election process will be released in the new year,” added Ohaga.
