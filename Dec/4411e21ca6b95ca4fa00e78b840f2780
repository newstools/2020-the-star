Three children of the same family in Mukinyai farm in Elburgon, Molo sub-county in Nakuru drowned at a deserted quarry on Saturday evening. Area assistant chief, Zacchaeus Mwarari said the three, a 15-year-old girl and her two brothers aged 11 and nine years had gone to fetch water when the youngest slipped into the pool. The administrator said the other two jumped into the pool in a bid to safe their sibling but they all perished. “Unfortunately, the neglected open quarries have taken three lives, this is the first incident although there are many such quarries that hold water throughout the year,” he said. Mwarari urged quarry owners to cover or fence unused mines to avoid such incidents in the future. “We have had cases of drowning in River Molo which runs across this farm with the latest one being at Migaa nd it has never happened in the open quarries,” he said. He said the government was going to marshal covering up of the deserted quarries while at the same time creating awareness on the lurking danger. It took the efforts of divers from Salgaa, to retrieve the bodies which were later taken to the Molo Sub-County hospital mortuary.  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
