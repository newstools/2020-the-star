 Kitui MCAs have rejected a lawyer and an IEBC official appointed by Ngilu as members of the selection panel to pick nominees for the county public service board. Lawyer Moris Kimuli and Linah Kilonzi had been appointed by Ngilu to serve in a five-member selection panel to recruit board members. The county assembly committee on appointments found the two unsuitable citing technicalities. During a plenary sitting on Wednesday,  MCAs endorsed the rejection of the two even as they approved three other members. The ward representatives approved the nomination of Nicodemus Kisengese as chairman of the selection panel with Marcs Kilonzo and Charity Musyoka as members. Assembly Majority leader Peter Kilonzo said although the rejected nominees presented sterling performances during vetting and scored beyond the set pass marks, MCAs had no choice but to reject their nomination. He said Kimuli was dropped because he did not present a certificate from the Credit Reference Bureau and another from the Higher Education Loans Board Helb as required. Linah Kilonzi was disqualified because she was serving as a public officer at the Independent Electoral and Bounaries Commission. The Majority leader said those sitting in the selection panel must not be public servants. Minority leader Alex Nganga who represents the interest of Ngilu’s Narc party supported the reports. He said it was upon the governor to look around for suitable people. "Kitui does not have a shortage of professionals who can replace the rejected nominees. We are not only interested in nominees who are qualified but who meet all the aspects of the law,” Nganga said.
