Mangoloma, a village in Mwingi Central, is engulfed in grief and shock after a man was brutally murdered by his two sons. On the fateful day two days ago, one Steven Mutua Ngui arrived home in the evening, disagreed with his wife Kalekye Mutua and a scuffle broke out. In the process, their two sons aged 24 and 22 joined the fight to defend their mother as their father was armed with a machete. They overpowered him and he fell down. Mwingi Central subcounty police commander Peter Mutuma said one of the sons—not identified—picked an axe and cut him several times in the head. Mutua succumbed to his injuries on the spot. His body was moved to Mwingi Level 4 Hospital mortuary after police officers visited the scene, awaiting postmortem. The mother, his two sons and daughter were arrested. In a separate incident in Mwingi town, Jacob Nzuki died in an accident after he hit a heap of murram left on a road under construction. He lost control of his motorbike and landed in the middle of the road, suffering head injuries. He died on spot and his body was moved to Mwingi Level 4 Hospital mortuary and his motorbike towed to Mwingi police station awaiting inspection.
