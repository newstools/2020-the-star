DNA samples have confirmed that former Matungu MP Justus Murunga is the biological father of one the children he sired with his mistress-Agnes Wangui. Wangui had claimed in court papers that she had sired two children with the deceased. One is a boy aged seven years and the other a girl aged three years. Pathologists M Mwangi and Dr. PM Maturi said based on the DNA samples generated from swab samples obtained from the two children, there are 99 per cent chances that Murunga is the father of one - the girl. The DNA test excluded the seven-year-old boy. Wangui and Murunga have known each other for seven years. Their first encounter was in 2012 when he was a supervisor at Embakasi ranching, while Agnes was a businesswoman engaged in selling beverages and snacks within Sewerage area, Ruai. Murunga would occasionally send her money. In addition, Lawyer Danstan Omari yesterday said he will be filling a succession case and although the DNA results for the boy are negative, he is a dependant who the late supported. "The mother will be declared a wife for the purpose of succession and because there is no will they will be entitled to equal shares of the estate," he said. Murunga died on November 14 while being rushed to hospital after collapsing at home. His body is lying at Lee Funeral Home.
