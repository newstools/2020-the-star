The Busia administration plans to upgrade several access roads in selected towns across the county to bitumen standards. Set to be tarmacked are the Amagoro Primary-Aleles-Eden Rock, Adungosi Market access, Funyula town CBD and Bumala market backstreet roads. Infrastructure and Energy executive Okwara Ekirapa said during pre-tender site visits that the project will be a life-changer to the communities of the towns. The project will open up access to the different social facilities around the selected areas, with other remaining towns targeted in the next financial year. The roads once upgraded will increase the bitumen roads done by the county government of Busia to 14.2 km. Ekirapa was accompanied by Public Works and Roads Assembly Committee chair John Oganga. The Marachi West MCA lauded the governor for initiating a historic project which will transform Busia county.
