Deputy President William Ruto has eulogised doctor Stephen Mogusu as a brilliant and selfless medic. Mogusu was affiliated to Stablehealth Medicare Clinic, a private hospital in Kitengela. His death brings to 13 the number of doctors who have died of coronavirus since the pandemic struck Kenya back in March. At least 26 nurses and nine clinical officers have also died. In total, the pandemic has so far killed 1,531 Kenyans. "We are saddened by the loss of ....a selfless medic who was dedicated to delivering critical care and support to our country during this Covid-19 crisis," Ruto said. Via Twitter on Tuesday,  Ruto said his death, and that of other healthcare workers is a demonstration that the country must deploy all its energies and resources to protect and save the frontline heroes. "...Kenyans too must be protected from this ravage. Our thoughts are with Mogusu’s family, their loved ones and colleagues at this sorrowful moment. Rest In Peace," he said. Fighting to breathe through machines in the ICU ward at Kenyatta University Teaching Research and Referral Hospital,  Mogusu made an impassioned plea to his colleagues: save yourselves. Mogusu went on to detail the pain and suffering he went through, saying not even a full pocket would replenish one's gasps for oxygen when needed. “Usually I'd write and write bu[t] today I just want to say save your miserable selves from these institutions. You'll live to earn again,” he said. Mogusu was only 28 years old and had a bright future ahead. But as he battled Covid-19, he had also not received his salary for five months. He lost the battle to Covid-19 on Monday, according to Kenya Medical Practitioners Pharmacists and Dentists Union. The union said: "At the time of his death he had not received his salary for five months, had no insurance and his young family left with no compensation. Too steep a price for patriotism.”
