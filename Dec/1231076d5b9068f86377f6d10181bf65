A fisherman from Homa Bay died on Wednesday night after a fishing boat capsized at Kinda beach in Lake Victoria. The fisherman, identified as Tom Mariwa, drowned at 10pm after the boat hit a rock and capsized. He was in the company of three others who managed to swim to safety. Homa Bay county beach management unit chairman Edward Oremo said the accident occurred as the fishermen were returning from their expedition in Kiwa Island and Nyandiwa beaches. “We’re mobilising Nyandiwa beach fishermen to help us retrieve the body,” he said. Oremo urged fishermen to avoid conducting their fishing activities during the night. He appealed to the government to fast-track construction of a rescue centre in Mbita. “Let fishermen abide by fishing regulations to avoid such accidents in the lake,” Oremo said.
