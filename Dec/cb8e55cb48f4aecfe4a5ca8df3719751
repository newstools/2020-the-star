Jamhuri Day Celebrations which comes on December 12 will be the second national holiday opened to the public this year since the pandemic struck the nation on March 13, 2020. However, the government has announced that Health ministry guidelines have been put in place to ensure that the Covid-19 measures will be observed. Interior PS Karanja Kibicho through a statement to the Regional Commissioners said that the celebrations will only be marked at the Nyayo Stadium in Nairobi, unlike previous celebrations where each county organized the same. “The Ministry is organizing for Jamhuri Day Celebrations at Nyayo Stadium. No other National Day celebrations shall be held in the country,” Kibicho said. He said the celebrations will start at 8 am and will culminate in the live address from the President, who will be at the venue. The PS has urged all the regional commissioners to advise members of the public to remain at home and follow the proceedings on radios, televisions, and on social media platforms. However, the ministry has not given communication on the number of people who will be allowed into the stadium. During the past Mashujaa day celebrations which were held at the Gusii Stadium in Kisii county, about 4,500 people were allowed into the 20,000-capacity stadium. Others followed the event live from the Kisii Golf Course and on the screens, which were mounted outside the stadium and on various places within the town. This comes as the number of Covid cases in the country continues to soar as well as deaths related to the virus. By Thursday, the Ministry of Health confirmed a caseload of 86,383 and 1,500 deaths. The country registered the highest number of recoveries on Thursday, which was 11,324. This brings the total recoveries to 67,788.
