Police officers on leave have been recalled to provide maximum security as the festive season kicks off. IG of police Hillary Mutyambai said this on Monday during his weekly engagement with the members of the public via Twitter. Mutyambai said police have enhanced patrols across the country. “The police will have enhanced patrols. All officers on leave have since been recalled to give sufficient backup. Also, because of the uniqueness of the season, a multiagency team is put in place to enhance security,” Mutyambai said. The majority of Kenyans are expected to travel upcountry to join their family members during the festive season. Mutyambai urged Kenyans to ensure they adhere to the Covid-19 protocols even as they travel. "...police officers will take action against anyone contravening Covid-19 protocols," he said. This comes as police and NTSA continue with crackdown on PSV vehicles violating traffic rules as well as Covid-19 guidelines. The exercise is meant to promote road safety for both commuters and drivers as the Christmas festivities nearby. Several vehicles and motorcycles have so far been impounded and motorists charged for various violations. The number of accidents has risen since January; most of them involving boda boda riders, their passengers, and pedestrians. Also, NTSA has partnered with six counties in an effort to reduce road carnage. They are Makueni, Nairobi, Nakuru, Kericho, Kisumu, and Kakamega counties. The government launched a road safety campaign dubbed ‘Usalama barabarani’ on October 28 in partnership with the European Union (EU) to reduce road accidents. According to NTSA, there were 3,337 fatalities in 2018-19, compared with 3,567 in 2019-20, a difference of 230. In 2018-19, 5,687 were seriously injured as compared to 7,158 in 2019-20, a difference of 1,471.
