The Supreme Court has directed three counties seeking its  advisory opinion on BBI to first seek Attorney General Kihara Kariuki’s advice. In a virtual hearing, Deputy CJ Philomena Mwilu said the counties must first obtain the advice of the AG before turning to the apex court. Kericho and Nandi MCA’s last month asked the Supreme Court for an advisory opinion on the expected BBI referendum. Last week, Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana asked the apex court for the same advisory. Judge Mwilu gave them seven days each to seek Kihara’s advice on the issue. The AG has seven days to advise them. The Makueni boss wants to know whether a bill containing a proposed amendment should only be limited to an amendment of a single issue of the Constitution. The Nandi and Kericho MCAs want to know whether county assemblies are obliged to conduct public participation when considering a bill to amend the Constitution through popular initiative. “In the first-ever advisory opinion the court gave, we were very clear that an advisory opinion of the Supreme Court can in no way replace the advice of the chief adviser of government.” Njoki said. She said this was in order to avoid state organs rushing to the Supreme Court when they ought first to have sought the AG's advice. “The Supreme Court cannot replace the office of the AG and it’s important that a party coming to us ought to first go to the AG to seek their advice. If they have issues, then they should come to the Supreme Court," she said. Justice Mwilu consolidated both reference letters and they will handled as one petition when they come back to court. She said the court will consider whether to admit amicus curiae participation. Present in the court were Justices Smokin Wanjala, Mohammed Ibrahim and Isaac Lenaola. The matter will be mentioned in January next year on a date to be communicated to parties on Thursday. (Edited by V. Graham)
