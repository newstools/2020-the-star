Nyamira county Health executive Douglas Bosire has said they will rally support for BBI signatures with a target of 100,000 by Wednesday. Bosire and County Secretary James Ntabo urged the residents to support the document, saying the 35 per cent revenue allocation to counties, the Ward Development Fund and an additional constituency in Nyamira are among many good proposals contained in the report. “Our Governor John Nyagarama has joined hands with other leaders to ensure that the BBI goes through and we are encouraging our people to come out and append their signatures on this matter,” Bosire said. County Secretary Ntabo said the county officials led by all the CECs are sensitising the residents on the importance of supporting BBI, as agreed by the county officials. “Our cabinet has decided that we should support the drive by encouraging our residents to join leaders in supporting BBI. We are supporting the document, but the county commissioner and his deputies will handle the collection of signatures so ours is to sensitize our residents on the importance of supporting BBI,” Ntabo said. Last week, leaders across Nyamira county led by Nyagarama, county commissioner Amos Mariba, Borabu MP Ben Momanyi, Woman Representative Jerusha Momanyi and West Mugirango MP Steve Mogaka mobilised residents to append signatures for a referendum.
