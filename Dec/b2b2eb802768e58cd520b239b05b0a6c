JCC Bishop Allan Kiuna and his wife Rev Kathy Kiuna are celebrating their 26th marriage anniversary in Hawaii. Speaking to Word Is, Bishop Kiuna said they prefer to create memories together on their anniversaries. "The more we are getting older the more we want to share time just the two of us. We have learnt that when it's intimate, it becomes better and more memories can be created." Bishop Kiuna encouraged couples to do activities together with what little they have. "It doesn't have to be expensive. You can go to Ngong and take nyama choma. It is not about money but creating memories." Kiuna said he is grateful to his wife for being his friend. "She is the only woman who could have coped with my madness. She is godsent. "Be friends with your spouses. Kathy has been my friend and whether we have people around or not, we can just sit alone and laugh, so continue being my friend." Rev Kathy shared a message on Instagram thanking God for giving her a wonderful husband. "He still gives me butterflies. I have been with you almost half of my life, and if anything has changed, it's that my eyes sparkle more, my smile has grown wider and my heart has grown more fond of you." She then thanked her husband for being her best friend, a shoulder to lean on, the reason behind her smile and her helping hand on "my weak days". "My spiritual covering, my husband and lifemate. Marriage may not be a walk in the park, but you make the walk worth it. I could do life all over again with you."
