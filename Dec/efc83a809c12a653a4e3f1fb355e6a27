Sabina Kerubo, a senior policer linked to death of a Star journalist, was found dead in her house at Komarock area, Machakos on Tuesday. Police reports indicate that her boyfriend reported the incident at KBC police station, prompting area sub county police commander and criminal investigation boss to visit the scene. She was found lying on a mattress at the floor of the single-roomed house, dead. “The deceased mother Elizabeth Kwamboka, who resides along Kangundo Road, came and alleged that the deceased had previously refused to stay with her due to drunkenness,” a report filed at KBC police Station under OB No 17/22/12/2020 reads in part. Police say the body looked weak and emaciated and that remains of beer bottles were found in the house. Last year, Kerubo appeared in court over murder of the then Star correspondent Erick Oloo. In a case love gone sour, Oloo had been found dead at her rented house in Ugunja, Siaya on November 2019, with reports saying she conspired with her brothers and an unknown man to beat Oloo to death at her house. At the time, Kerubo was Ugunja Police Station deputy OCS. She was transferred from Western to the headquarters to attend counselling.
