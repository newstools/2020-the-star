Teaching is often regarded as a less rewarding but demanding profession. But after a long wait, John Gomes Piedad, who came to Kenya from India in 1959 to teach at the age 25, got state recognition on Jamhuri Day. President Uhuru Kenyatta awarded the 86-year-old educationist the Order of the Grand Warrior for his contribution to the country’s education sector. “This award is in recognition of distinguished and outstanding services rendered to the nation in various capacities and responsibilities,” the citation read in part. Gomes did not only teach but also paid fees to students from poor families. He also made an indelible mark by championing the building of schools. And even when society was heavily conservative and barred girls who had become pregnant from attending classes, Gomes would allow them back a month or two after they gave birth. Allowing the young mother to go back to class empowered them to support themselves and their children. And true to self, Gomes still sponsors children from poor backgrounds to pursue education, with the conviction that a person's education is a light gift to society. From 1960 to 1992, alongside his wife Annie Gomes, who was also a teacher, he has traversed the country teaching and building schools. He married Annie seven years after arriving in Kenya and both have been teaching for 32 years. Some of the schools include Mugoiri Girls, Karima Boys, Gaichanjiru Secondary School, Nyeri High School, St Mary’s Karumande Boys, Kiburia Girls, and Moi Equator Girls, Nanyuki. Some of his students and alumni at these schools include politician Martha Karua, senior advocate Waweru Gatonye, Ambassador Stephen Karau, Equity Bank founder Peter Munga, among others.
