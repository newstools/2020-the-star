 An infant was killed on Saturday evening after a truck rammed into a shop at Kaburengu trading centre in Kakamega county along the Eldoret-Malaba highway. One-year-old Cornelius Wangusi was playing with his friends outside the building when the accident occurred. Wangusi's friends and the shop owner escaped unhurt because they ran for their lives, leaving the child standing in front of the building. Matete subcounty police boss Thomas Ototo said the truck driver lost control of the vehicle as it descended the steep Chimoi slope and veered off the road, ramming into the nearby building. He was ferrying construction materials to Webuye. He said his officers have launched a search for the truck driver who vanished after the accident. The body was removed from the scene and taken to Webuye County Hospital mortuary. The Kaburengu junction is one of the black spots along the busy Eldoret-Malaba highway. In August, eight people died after a truck transporting building materials rammed into a 14-seater matatu. Another 14 people, including women selling wares by the roadside, were injured. In 2018, a fuel tanker rammed into a 14-seater matatu that was picking passengers in Kaburengu, killing all the nine people on board on the spot. The tanker driver and his co-driver also died.
