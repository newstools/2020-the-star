Siaya Woman Representative Christine Ombaka has said women will have four seats to vie for even if the proposal to scrap her seat in the legislature is passed. Ombaka said women can contest for the presidency, or MP, governor, Senate and MCA seats as the Building Bridges Initiative proposals strengthen them. She said the roles women played in the National Assembly have been moved to the Senate, dismissing the notion that the document has disadvantaged them. Addressing journalists in Alego Usonga while launching a modern market at Sidundo, Ombaka said residents should focus on how BBI will bring more money to the grassroots. “The bigger amount of resources will be directed to counties unlike before and that is the beauty of BBI document,” Ombaka said. She said those who are confusing Kenyans about the ills of the BBI document should wait for another chance for a constitutional change and present their views. “There is an opportunity in future to amend the Constitution and even the president has alluded to the fact that the Constitution is subject to amendment,” Ombaka said. She said the BBI process is not the final whistle about changing the Constitution as any law in any country is never a final document. Ombaka encouraged women who wish to join politics that there is more space and it does not matter one's background.  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
