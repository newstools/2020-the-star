Local hoteliers lead by Kenya Coast Hoteliers Working Group Chair, Hasnain Noorani have applauded government’s intention to secure 24 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines worth Sh 10 billion from Gavi Alliance which is expected in early next year. Players in the industry hope they will be among the first beneficiaries of the vaccine. “These promising developments on the vaccine front have sparked optimism to hoteliers that the pandemic’s end may be in sight,"MD PrideInn Hotel Hasnain Noorani said. "But if the market trends that immediately followed positive vaccine news are any indication, hospitality and travel industry sectors in Kenya and beyond will benefit a lot more than others." The travel and hospitality sector has so far been one of the biggest casualties of the pandemic since the beginning the year. “Countries will now feel comfortable opening their borders to vacationers once that vaccine is rolled out,”he said. “News on the vaccines showing high efficacy rates in their clinical trials has lifted hopes for the hospitality and travel industry recovery, " sales director Farzana Zahir said. Closed borders, curfew orders, companies cancelling business travel, and a general fear of catching the highly contagious virus brought travel to a halt. “The government’s willingness to procure and administer 24 million doses of the vaccine which is expected in Kenya in January is good news for local hospitality industry which had been severely affected,” he said. This festive season, bookings especially from domestic tourists have been positive contrary to what was expected, below 15 percent occupancy. While travel hit the brakes in March till July when lockdown was lifted, PrideInn has seen an average of 10 percent to 15 percent growth in bookings. With the climb in bookings, the distribution of who is traveling is different, with industries like health care, manufacturing and retail making up a greater proportion of travel.
