By WANGECHI WANG’ONDU Kirinyaga Deputy Governor Peter Ndambiri was on Friday conferred an honorary degree of doctorate of philosophy in Theology by the Breakthrough International Bible University, Nairobi. Ndambiri was feted for exemplary services accorded to the church, his county residents and the community. He has offered counselling services and competently handled family vices. Ndambiri expressed his gratitude for the honour. He said the university had appointed him its patron. “I’m a psychologist having majored in family therapy. Through my training and experience, I have been able to reach out to many families, many churches and carried out beneficial projects within the region from where my work was noted and now honoured,” Ndambiri said. He said the university has a vision of bringing sanity into the church and was taking strategic measures to get rid of rogue clerics. “This campus intends to bring together all churches and through the alliance of bible colleges we intend to have a system where we will have self-regulatory systems through which, under one umbrella body, the government can be able to deal with churches." Ndambiri said the move will contain the spread of false doctrines and aid in hunting down crooks and those violating laid down regulations. “There are those hiding behind sheep's skin and masquerade as men of God. Unfortunately, they are on a mission to defraud unsuspecting faithful and carry out other dubious activities. We hope with this body in place, that will stop,” Ndambiri said.
