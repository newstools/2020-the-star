Senators will start hearing the case of the impeached Nairobi County Governor Mike Sonko on Wednesday. The Senate Speaker Ken Lusaka said this through the gazette notice on Tuesday. The sittings shall be held in the Senate Chambers, main Parliament Buildings starting at 9am. Sonko was controversially impeached on Thursday with 88 MCAs said to have voted in support of a motion tabled by Michael Ogada. However, 59 MCAs allied to Sonko, and who were with him in Kwale during the Thursday afternoon session claimed the assembly staff illegally cast votes on their behalf. The governor will face the 67 senators after the Senate Majority Leader Samuel Poghisio declined to give a notice of motion for the formation of 11 members to investigate allegations against him. Lusaka had said that the system will help reduce congestion in the chamber as a precaution to protect members from contracting Covid -19. “In line with the Covid-19 guidelines, I have determined that it is indeed imperative that we hold a hybrid virtual sitting to accommodate our colleagues who are not in a position to attend and participate physically.” The lawmakers will comprise the integrity of the parliamentary proceedings and called on him to shelve it. The speaker added that Sonko's case will be the only agenda before the House, after which senators will go to recess up to February 9, 2021.
