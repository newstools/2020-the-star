Two people suspected to have links into the murder of a 20-year-old woman in Eastleigh have been detained for 14 days pending investigations. Abdi Mohammed Siyat alias Jamal and Najma Ali Mohammed were detained by a Milimani magistrate's court following a successful application by the prosecution. Police said they needed more days to complete investigations into the death of Sumeya Sadik, who was waiting to join university. Through an affidavit, detective Kennedy Wainaina said Sadik was taken from her house and later brought back dead allegedly by one of the suspects. The two were arrested on November 27 in Eastleigh and detained at Muthaiga police station. “The respondents are being investigated for the offence of murder contrary to Section 203," Wainaina said. He told the court that Sadik left her house in Eastleigh to join Siyat and Najma for a hangout on October 10 at about 5pm but was later brought back appearing unconscious at around 7pm. Preliminary investigations, the detective said, established that the suspects were seen picking Sadik in a car that was being driven by Siyat. The suspects allegedly left her unattended, without taking her to hospital or informing the neighbours or relatives what had happened. The police said it is the neighbours who saw the suspects carrying Sadik who rushed her to the hospital where she was pronounced dead. It is said that immediately after the incident, the two switched off their phones, which were later switched on at Lang’ata cemetery. The officer said that they want more time to find out the movements of the deceased during the day when she disappeared. They also want to establish where the deceased ate pizza and a drink before she succumbed. The two were remanded at Muthaiga police station until December 10.
