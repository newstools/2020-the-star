The hearing of the Willie Kimani murder case has been adjourned to Tuesday after the court heard that Lawyer Cliff Ombeta has tested positive for Covid-19. Ombeta represents Fredrick Leliman and Stephen Cheburet, the first and second accused in the case. Judge Jessie Lessit has directed that Ombeta sends to court the official results on Tuesday. The court was told that Ombeta was in contact with a client in Malindi who tested positive and is admitted in hospital. Ombeta went for the Covid-19 test on Sunday and the results have been released today when then the court was in session. In October, the hearing of the case was once again adjourned after one of the accused Cheburet also tested positive for Covid-19. The case was to be virtually heard with links from the Kamiti Maximum Prison. Cheburet said he was unwell. All the other four accused persons were present in court except Cheburet who asked the court to adjourn the matter. Ombeta communicated with him via zoom and he told Justice Lessit he had been tested five times with all the tests turning positive for Covid-19.
