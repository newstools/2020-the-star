The county government of Vihiga has set aside Sh1 million to rehabilitate Kavugoi forest to protect the Tiriki culture. The chief officer for Environment Richard Boiyo said forests are important to Tiriki culture. “These forests were there during our fore-parents and there is a need for us to protect them and determine the value of our culture via them,” he said. The chief officer spoke at Munzatsi grounds in Hamisi where 200 boys graduated from childhood to adulthood. He said culture is a unifying factor for the Tiriki community. The Tiriki traditional initiation ceremony took place in phases due to Covid-19 restrictions. Boiyo said the county government supports culture fully through the ministry of sports, culture and gender. While addressing the initiates, he urged them to stick to the teachings and uphold the respect of society. “Education is key and as much we embrace our culture we need education to strengthen it,” he added. The chief officer said the county has set up cultural centres that will store artifacts and the histories of each community. “We  have already done that in Tiriki West and Maragoli hills. Tiriki Cast should allocate a piece of land for the same,” Boiyo said. He further said communities like the Bunyore and Terik will have the same cultural centres in the coming financial year. “We are in the process of protecting our shrines for our cultural history,” he added.
