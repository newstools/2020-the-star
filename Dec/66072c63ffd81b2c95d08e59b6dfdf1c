Two children died on Monday night after a fierce fire razed their house in Majengo slums, Nanyuki town. The children, aged four, and one and a half years were sleeping at 9pm when several houses in the area caught fire. They were trapped inside their wooden house. It is not clear what caused the fire. Residents accused the county government of Laikipia of not responding swiftly to the fire that gutted all houses. Resident Isaac Oduor said they did not salvage anything. Oduor said the government should prioritise helping its people. Mary Muthoni said the fire spread quickly. "We have not seen the mother of the two children," Muthoni said.
