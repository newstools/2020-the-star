Kisumu Chief Magistrate Hillary Oduor was found dead in his house in mysterious circumstances in Nairobi. The body of Oduor was found in his River Bank estate house in South B estate, Nairobi. His friends said he looked “troubled” in the past days. This is because of alleged issues with his employer. The cause of the death is however yet to be known but an investigation is ongoing, police said. Some of the major cases the magistrate handled was that in which apostle James  Ng’ang’a of Neno evangelism was charged with dangerously driving after his car crashed head-on with a Nissan in 2015 in Limuru killing a woman. The case is still pending in court after he was acquitted by the magistrate and the prosecution appealed. A female friend who lived with him told police she came home on Thursday and found the door locked from inside. She had left him in the house. On trying to look through the bedroom window, she saw Oduor seemingly asleep but with foam in his mouth. He was motionless then. It was then she called police who arrived and broke in and confirmed Oduor was dead. Police said the body that had no visible injuries was moved to City Mortuary pending investigations. Oduor served the Limuru Law Courts, Nakuru and later Kisumu where he was the chief magistrate. Police said they were waiting for a postmortem examination to determine their next cause of action. Makadara head of DCI Henry Kiambati said the autopsy is planned to establish the cause of the death. “We will know what killed him soon after the autopsy is done on the body,” he said.
