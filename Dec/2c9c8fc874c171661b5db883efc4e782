A police officer, three guards and a housekeeper charged with neglect to prevent a robbery at the home of Nairobi businessman Manu Chandaria will remain in custody until Boxing Day. Milimani principal magistrate Zainab Abdul said he will make his ruling on whether to release Jared Obanga, Stephen Omwenga, Juda Wafula and Jackson Nalondo. The prosecution opposed the release of the suspects on bail, saying they might interfere with witnesses. Prosecution counsel Peter Muhia said they were also a flight risk and may abscond court. “The case is of public interest. The accused persons should be detained for their own safety since their accomplices are yet to be arrested,” Muhia told court. The defence, however, told the court that they have a constitutional right to be released on bail and that they are not a flight risk. The four are accused that while on duty at Chandaria's residence, they failed to use all reasonable means to prevent the robbery of Sh700,000 and jewellery worth Sh1.7 million. They allegedly committed the offence on December 14 at 1.30am at Chandaria's house along Muthaiga Road in Starehe. The four have been remanded at Pangani police station pending a bail ruling on December 26. Obanga is a police officer attached as a security guard to the residence of Chandaria while Omwenga and Wafula are guards from G4S security firm. In an affidavit filed in court by investigating officer Godfrey Munene, he said on December 14 the suspects jointly with others not before the court broke into the house of Chandaria and while armed with a pistol stole the cash and valuables.
