Some 200 journalists will undergo training on how to cover Covid-19 disruptions. The training is meant to boost the capacity of journalists currently facing professional challenges while reporting on Covid-19 amid massive job losses in newsrooms. Launched on Thursday, the virtual training was commissioned by the Kenya Union of Journalists, Unesco and the European Union. It is meant to instil adherence to the professional code of conduct. “Journalists are playing a very critical role during these difficult times, which requires them to continuously upgrade their skills and ensure adherence to the professional code of conduct,” said Erick Oduor, KUJ secretary general. The 200 MCK-accredited journalists will be drawn from 50 media institutions across the 47 counties. They will consist of those working for TV, radio, newspapers and digital media, with focus on community media. The journalists will be taken through the code of conduct to ensure they respond to public concerns and correct Covid-19 errors promptly. They will also be trained on intrusion into grief and shock, especially when covering victims and survivors of Covid-19. “Covid-19 has aggravated injuries inflicted by technology in newsrooms and there is a need to improve skills and capacity of journalists to generate content that is not offensive to professional code of conduct,” Oduor said. The media is required to remain professional given the sensitive nature of the Covid-19 pandemic and the trauma surrounding it, he added. According to the Code of Conduct of Practice of Journalism in Kenya, accuracy and fairness are a requirement for all journalists when handling matters of public interest such as Covid-19. “The training will pay attention to journalists working within the communities to work without bias or stereotype and diversity of expressions, opinion, and ideas in context, especially in the campaign to contain the spread of the coronavirus,"  Oduor said.
