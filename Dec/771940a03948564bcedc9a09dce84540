The care package comprises the provision of medical kits and essential medicines, teleconsultations with a doctor and nurse, nutritionist and mental health consultation Britam currently insures hundreds of rides daily on Little with its digital accidental trip insurance that protects riders against hospitalisation, disability, and ambulance expenses. The introduction of telemedicine is a value-added-service to the existing and new customers of this product. Speaking during the launch, Britam MD Benson Wairegi said that with millions of smartphone users in Kenya, the firm is betting on digital channels and partnerships to increase insurance penetration.
