The drama and intrigues surrounding Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko's impeachment case continued on Tuesday in court as another judge is alleged to have 'disappeared' from a Zoom session. It is alleged that Justice Nzioki Wa Makau who was hearing the matter disappeared from the zoom session at around 4pm and was a no show past 7pm. Last week, judge Makau issued orders stopping the impeachment process. The case was taken to Judge James Rika who recused himself on the day Sonko was impeached. Judge Rika recused himself after matters got heated court between the lawyers representing both parties. On Monday, principal Judge Maureen Onyango directed that the matter be heard on Tuesday by Justice Makau. However, when the county assembly lawyers appeared in court on Tuesday, they made an application for Judge Makau to recuse himself from the case, accusing him of being biased in the matter. The county lawyers allege that the judge left the Zoom without giving directions to parties regarding their application and they were still on the Zoom as late at 7pm waiting to see if the judge would return.
