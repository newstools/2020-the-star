More than 200 residents of Napuu village, Lodwar, say the Napuu irrigation scheme will save Turkana from hunger and starvation. Farmers spoke while harvesting watermelons and green grams at the scheme supported by the Kerio Valley Development Authority. For many years they have been depending on relief food from the government and NGOs for survival. Since the Kerio Valley Development Authority started supporting irrigation schemes they they are now planting crops for food security. Farmer Peter Ejore of Napuu village said the Napuu irrigation scheme has the potential to feed all residents in Turkana if it’s well utilised. “In Turkana county we are not poor and there is no hunger. The problem has been lack of knowledge about farming. "We have been trained well by KVDA on how to plant and harvest crops, now we want to market our produce," he said. He said desert locusts had destroyed crops but they replanted and now are harvesting. No one is supposed to die from hunger in Turkana because they have the potential to grow crops for food security, he said. The only problem is lack of priority from the leadership, he claimed. Ejore urged government expand the farm land to accommodate more people willing to farm. Farmer Esther Lochodo said since KVDA came up with the Napuu irrigation scheme, residents have benefited from clear water, electricity and enough food. They are now supplying watermelons to Lodwar, Kakuma, Lokichar, Ditale and Eldoret at Sh250 each. They expect to get Sh1 million from watermelon sales to businesses. KVDA regional manager Samuel Kigen said the Napuu irrigation scheme is a pilot scheme to make the Turkana residents realize the importance of agriculture. Then they won't depend on relief food and pastoralism, he said. The scheme provides job opportunities for youth and women. (Edited by V. Graham)
