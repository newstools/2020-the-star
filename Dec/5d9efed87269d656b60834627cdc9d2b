The government has assured Kenyans vaccination against the Covid-19 will start early next year. The announcement came as Covid-19 death toll in the country hit 1,639 on Sunday after six more patients succumbed to the disease. Kenya has settled for the Oxford Vaccine because it can be stored easily, with the Ministry of Health saying it will be one of the frontline vaccines that will be used in the country. Clinical trials for the vaccines are still going on at Kilifi Kemri Wellcome Trust, with the teams in charge saying the initial data has shown good results. “The kind of vaccine that we are looking for will have four parameters. It should be a vector carrier, WHO pre-qualified, cost-effective and one that fits within our existing cooling system of 2 to 8 degrees," acting Health director general Patrick Amoth said.
