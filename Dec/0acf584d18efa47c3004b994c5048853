The government will roll out Huduma Centre services to all sub counties, Public Service and Gender PS has said. PS Mary Kimonye said the government is committed to ensure all services are closer to mwananchi. The Huduma Kenya is a one-stop shop service delivery programme provides different channels for integrated government services to the public. The programme was created to offer governmental services in a single unit dubbed Huduma centres. Kimonye, who spoke at Nyambene Forest, Miciimikuru section in Tigania East, during a tree planting exercise on Saturday, said Kenyans must take individual responsibility in planting trees in farms to achieve 10 per cent tree cover by 2022. “We have over 13 million tree seedling in the eastern region lying idle. If all citizens within the region devote to planting a single tree, the 13 million will be covered,” she said. Meru ecosystem conservator John Njoroge and Tigania Central deputy county commissioner rallied residents in planting trees for conservation. Njoroge said many depends on rivers and four dams that draw their water from the Nyambene and hence their duty not to cut trees. She commended Meru people for planting trees and entrenching a culture of conservation and protection to existing forests. “Meru has the highest tree cover at 18 per cent tree cover in the country. They are a good example to the rest of the country but don’t relax, plant more to attain the 25 per cent agenda of conservationists,” Kimonye said.
