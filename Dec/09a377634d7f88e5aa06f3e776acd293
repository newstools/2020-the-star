Deputy President William Ruto on Wednesday held a meeting with Msambweni Constituency grassroots leaders led by the newly-elected MP Feisal Bader at his Karen residence in Nairobi County. Also present at the meeting were MPs Khatib Mwashetani (Lunga Lunga), Nixon Korir (Lang’ata) and former Starehe MP Margaret Wanjiru. The DP said the Msambweni by-election opened a new chapter in Kenyan politics. "It is no longer about the big name that we carry. Not the people in power that we are connected to. It is about our hard work, commitment and how we address the issues and aspirations of the ordinary people," Ruto said. Bader was on Tuesday sworn-in as a Member of Parliament days after clinching the seat. The short swearing-in ceremony was presided over by National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi. Bader who contested as an Independent candidate trounced Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) candidate Omar Boga after garnering 15,251 votes against Omar’s 10,444. Bader said he will focus on completing the late MP Suleiman Dori's agenda. The MP-elect said he was grateful for the support of Ruto and his allies had given him. "The DP stood with me when ODM humiliated me. His close allies like Johnson Muthama, Boni Khalwale, and Hassan Omar have been here with me all through to ensure that I won. I know I can not repay them but will always pray for them," he said. The by-election which arose following the death of Suleiman Dori was seen as a battle between DP Ruto and ODM leader Raila Odinga. Ruto threw his weight behind Bader after the ruling Jubilee Party announced that it would not field a candidate. Ruto supported Bader as part of a strategy to test his political clout at the Coast. Shortly after Bader's victory, Ruto congratulated the MP-elect saying the win cemented the trust in God and the people. "Democracy and people power has triumphed. Watu was Msambweni Mungu awabariki!" Ruto tweeted.
