A man from Embu has been jailed for 35 years for defiling his 11-year-old daughter five years ago. The man was sentenced by Siakago principal magistrate W. Ngumi. He has 14 days to appeal the sentence. The man was charged with sexually abusing his daughter on March 24, 2015, in Mbeere South. She was 11 years old at the time. He was also charged with an alternative offence of indecently touching his daughter. The man was also charged with battering his wife after she reported the defilement case to the police. Seven witnesses testified against the man. The court heard that the mother had visited another village to see relatives and left her three children – the girl and two boys – under the care of her husband. The father went to the girl’s bedroom in the middle of the night when the boys were asleep, carried her to his bed and defiled her. The man allegedly warned the girl of dire consequences if she told anybody about her ordeal. The girl, however, reported the matter to her deputy head teacher, who in turn told the mother. The girl's mother reported the matter to the police but the man went into hiding. He was arrested three years later. It was reported that he battered his wife for reporting him to the police. The assault case against his wife is still pending in court. Delivering the ruling, magistrate Ngumi said the prosecution had proved its case beyond any reasonable doubt and the complainant had testified against him. “I find that a deterrent sentence should be meted out against the accused person to deter others and to make him understand the responsibility as a father,” he said.
