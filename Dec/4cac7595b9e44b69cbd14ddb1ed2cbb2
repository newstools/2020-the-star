Gor Mahia assist coach Patrick Odhiambo has admitted that Shield Cup holders Bandari are in hot pursuit of his services. The soft spoken Odhiambo has emerged as a top target for the Coast based club who were rendered coach-less after Ken Odhiambo was headhunted by Sofapaka. While Bandari were widely expected to hand the mantle to veteran tactician and instructor Twahir Muhiddin who serves as the technical director at the club, sources indicate that Odhiambo is poised to take over. The former Sony Sugar coach who joined Gor in June last year said negotiations between him and the dockers were at an advanced stage and it was just a matter of time before decamping. Besides attracting interest from Bandari, he revealed that another top flight club was eyeing his signature. "They have approached me few weeks ago and I can confirm that the negotiations are at an advanced stage. Football is business and it is normal for players and coaches to get offers. There is also another club which plies s its trade in the league which has been talking to me from time to time but we haven't agreed on anything, " he said Odhiambo in the meantime conceded that poor preparations cost them the humiliating 6-0 defeat in the hands of CR Belouizdad in the first leg of the Caf Champions League's opening round played last weekend. Gor were thrashed by the Algerian champions leaving their chances of gracing the tournament's group stages for the first time hanging on the thread. " We did not prepare well for that match and we ended up losing to the hosts. The players were affected by off the field issues bedeviling the club and it was tough for them to give one hundred percent performance," he added
