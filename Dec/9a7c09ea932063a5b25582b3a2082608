Nairobi is making another attempt at decongesting the Central Business District by banning the entry of matatus. The plan to do so next year is welcome on many fronts but may fail like the previous attempts without a proper alternative in place. City residents have previously been forced to trek long distances — sometimes in the rain — because the plan has not been well thought out. The chaotic scenes witnessed in the past can be avoided if the planners put in place proper alternatives in the form of BRT. The lack of alternatives means that commuters will have to find their own means to get into the CBD with most forced to walk. A proper BRT system would ensure that this is not the case and would also help in the decongestion caused by private vehicles. The major reason that many Nairobi residents who drive prefer using their cars into the CBD is because of the lack of a reliable and efficient public service system. In the weeks to come, City Hall and the NMS must therefore come up with a BRT system that ensures not only those who rely on PSVs are served but that those with cars can feel comfortable not driving into the CBD.
