Kibiwott Kandie has smashed the world half marathon record while winning the Valencia Half Marathon on Sunday morning. The 24-year-old Kenyan, who finished second at the World Half Marathon Championships in Gdynia, Poland, in October, bounced back to form in the Spanish city. Kandie clocked 57:32 bettering the previous mark set by former World half marathon champion Geoffrey Kamworor at 58:01. Jacob Kiplimo of Uganda came second in 57:37 with World under 20 10,000 meters champion Rhonex Kipruto placed third in 57:49. Alexander Mutiso came fourth in 57:59 . The first four finishers dipped under 58 minutes Kandie, who was running his fourth half marathon of the year, began to push the pace in the 14th kilometre, bringing the leaders through 15 kilometres in 41:10, with fellow Kenyan Rhonex Kipruto and Jacob Kiplimo of Uganda, the reigning world champion over the distance, on his shoulder. Over the next five kilometres Kandie and Kiplimo took turns with the lead until the 21st kilometre when Kandie made his decisive move.
