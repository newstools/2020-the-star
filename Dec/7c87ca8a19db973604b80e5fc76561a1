National Super League outfit Migori Youth suffered a major blow after coach Robert Ojienda resigned. Ojienda tendered his resignation on Monday,  saying he wanted to take a break from the game. “I have ended my relationship with Migori Youth. I enjoyed my time there, leading them to a fifth place finish last season. I’m not immediately available to take over any team because I have one or two commitments,” he said. He said the team’s management was putting too much pressure on the squad. “They also gave us unrealistic targets of qualifying to the Kenya Premier League which is not possible because we lost the entire first team. The current players have never played in NSL or even Division One or Two,” said Ojienda. He added: “We had good pre-season despite the management not fulfilling some of our requests. I told the management to give us at least four games before setting targets but they were adamant.” Migori Youth was scheduled to play Ushuru at Migori Stadium over the weekend but the game was postponed at the request of the taxmen. The club’s chairman Abdi Aziz said the coach has not officially tendered his resignation. “I just saw his text but you know one cannot resign via text. He didn’t give me the reason why he made the decision but I want to meet him and discuss the issues,” said Aziz.
