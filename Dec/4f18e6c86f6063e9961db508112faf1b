Twitter has expanded its policy barring hateful speech to include language that dehumanizes people on the basis of race, ethnicity and national origin. In a statement on Thursday, Twitter said it will also continue to surface potentially violative content through proactive detection and automation. "We will require Tweets like those below to be removed from Twitter when they are reported to us," Twitter said. "We will also continue to surface potentially violative content through proactive detection and automation." Twitter warned that if an account repeatedly breaks the Twitter rules, they may temporarily lock or suspend the account. "While we encourage people to express themselves freely on Twitter, abuse, harassment and hateful conduct continue to have no place on our service," Twitter said. "We create our rules to keep people safe on Twitter, and they continuously evolve to reflect the realities of the world we operate within," it said. In July 2019, Twitter expanded the rules against hateful conduct to include language that dehumanizes others on the basis of religion or caste. In March 2020, they expanded the rule to include language that dehumanizes on the basis of age, disability, or disease. The Twitter Rules help set expectations for everyone on the service and are updated to keep up with evolving online behaviours, speech, and experiences we observe.
