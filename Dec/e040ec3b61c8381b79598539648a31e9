Deputy President William Ruto has maintained that Kenyans need a multi-choice referendum. The DP said the multi-choice referendum would be the best way to allow Kenyans an opportunity to choose what they want and reject the issues they don't agree with. He gave an example of Liberia which is having an upcoming referendum on three issues. " It is actually the best way we can fashion our referendum," Ruto said. Talking about the multiple choice referendum that has been castigated by critics, Ruto maintained it will give Kenyans real choices. "It is possible to give Kenyans a structured referendum with various issues ," he said. "We will largely have six areas and Kenyans can vote on each of them," he said. Ruto said there is a narrative that Kenyans are unintelligent and cannot make choices from an extra seventh ballot with more variables. "We keep underestimating the intelligence of Kenyans and think that they are fools," Ruto added. He said through his robust grassroots network, he knows that no one can underestimate the intelligence of Kenyans to make a choice from multiples. Regarding the collection of signatures, Ruto said the questions in the referendum can be fashioned. Ruto said the promoters of BBI should go on to collect signatures because that is the easy part but stressed that there are issues that should be addressed including the Ombudsman which the Judiciary has disagreed with "If we are going to ask today how many have read the text of BBI, very few have, and we are rushing this because we think they don't matter."
