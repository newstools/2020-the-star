The Directorate of Criminal Investigation has raised concern over the rise in online fraud in the country. According to the directorate on Thursday, the rise in this crime is due to the increase in online shopping for Christmas festivities. DCI said many innocent Kenyans have already fallen victim of the online swindlers. The online retailing has increased over the period of the Covid-19 pandemic "We therefore advise the public to take precaution while engaging in online business dealings, to avoid falling prey to online scammers and fraudsters," the DCI said in its Tweet. "We further appeal to all shoppers to shop from trusted online vendors and be wary of a growing trend where fraudsters mimick websites belonging to established vendors and defraud them." DCI has urged the public to be on guard when dealing with doorstep deliveries and be careful on who they choose to make deliveries to their houses. "As a safety precaution, turn down deliveries from agents who show up at your door without your request, as they may have an ulterior motive." the DCI said.
