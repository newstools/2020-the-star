Medical workers will be the first group to receive the coronavirus vaccine as a protective measure due to the risks of their work, Vihiga Governor Wilber Ottichilo has said. Ottichilo said medics are on the frontline battling the pandemic and there is an urgent need for them to be vaccinated first to continue offering services to the public. The county boss said Kenyan has settled on a vaccine and will be in the country by February 2021. “Once the government is through with medics, persons aged 55 years and above will receive the vaccine to protect them,” Ottichilo said. “The government chose those two groups first because they are at a great danger from the Covid-19 pandemic.” He said the immune system of elderly people is low and there is a need for them to be protected. Ottichilo spoke in Esirabe village in Luanda subcounty where he attended the funeral of Moffat Lukose, the father-in-law of Nominated MCA Rebecca Ochiel. The governor said bodies should be collected from the morgue late in the evening and buried the following morning. “As the chairman of Covid-19 committee our protocols are that we collect the body in the evening and bury it in the morning under Covid-19 regulations,” Ottichilo said. His remarks came after Emabungo MCA Moses Opole blamed the county for not giving equal opportunities to all people of Vihiga county. “The poor families within this county are being told to collect their bodies in the morning and bury them that very morning as compared to well-off families,” Opole said. He urged the Covid-19 committee in the county to treat all county residents equally without looking at their social status. Edited by Henry Makori
