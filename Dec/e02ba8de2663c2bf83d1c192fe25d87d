Residents of Madogo and Maroro in Tana River county have urged the Kenya National Highway Authority to erect speed bumps near black spots on the Garissa-Madogo road. Matatu driver Hussein Kone on Thursday told reporters that two black spots on the road have claimed several lives in the past few months. On Tuesday, for instance, three boda boda riders were killed when their motorbike rammed into an oncoming bus, some 2km from Garissa town on the Garissa-Nairobi highway. The rider and two passengers died on the spot and the motorbike was damaged. A witness said the boda boda rider was trying to overtake a Toyota Probox saloon car near a bend and rammed onto the Nairobi-bound bus. Kone said Kenha should mark the two sites as blackspots and put speed bumps and signage to warn motorists and boda boda riders plying the route. “Boda boda riders are paying the highest price. Over 90 per cent of the accidents involve riders. Something must be done now before we lose more lives,” Kone said. He said the accident could have been avoided if the section of the road had bumps, urging the riders to be careful. Kone asked the police traffic department and the National Transport Safety Authority to hold regular meetings on road safety. “I also blame the boda boda riders for being reckless. They overload their bikes and not only speed but also overtake other motorists on sharp corners and from the wrong side,” he said. Kone said that the majority of the riders are unlicensed and do not understand road safety regulations. “I am sorry to say some of these riders are below 18 years and have no identification cards and driving licenses. We must get rid of these riders to make our roads safe‚” Kone said.  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
