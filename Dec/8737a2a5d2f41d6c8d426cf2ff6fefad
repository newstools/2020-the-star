Agriculture CS Peter Munya has said the ministry is happy with the efforts put in place to control locusts in Garissa county. “We shall continue monitoring to improve the capacity of the counties and ensure active programmes are in place for both locust and drought mitigation," the CS said. Munya spoke during a visit to Garissa Governor Ali Korane. He said mitigation of the negative environmental and social impacts associated with the use of pesticides was a major concern, but the chemicals used to spray the locusts were approved after they were found to be ‘effective and safe’. Governor Korane urged the national government to strengthen the county's capacity to carry out surveillance, monitoring and control of the second wave of desert locusts in the region. The governor said a new invasion had already been reported in Nanighi, Kamuthe, Garissa Township subcountry and surveillance was ongoing within potential sites in Dadaab, Balambala and Fafi subcounties. He thanked the national government for its support in surveillance helicopters, well strategically free control aircraft, a trained desert locust control team and four KDF vehicles mounted with sprayers. Present were Garissa county commissioner Meru Mwangi, county secretary Abdi Sheikh, Agriculture executive Mohamed Shale and Garissa National Drought Management Authority coordinator Abdinoor Dubow.
