IEBC is calling for applications for the posts of signature verification clerks ahead of the BBI verification process. In a notice on Saturday, IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati said they will need 400 personnel for the verification process. They will be paid Sh1,200 per day for the exercise. This will cost Sh480,000. Applicants should be Kenyan citizens with high integrity,  hold a form four certificate, be computer literate, have data entry skills and must be available for the entire period. Also, applicants should be from Nairobi county if not, interested candidates should arrange for their own accommodation during that period, Chebukati said. The deadline for the application is December 24,2020 and applications must be done online. The National Treasury approved Sh93.7 million funding to the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission for the verification of BBI signatures. Cabinet Secretary Ukur Yatani approved the amount after deliberations with IEBC managers. The IEBC sought Sh241 million from the exchequer to review the signatures recently presented by the BBI Secretariat. The commission had indicated it would take about 85 days to verify the signatures if their request for Sh241 million was heeded to. The provision from the Treasury was to be used to hire and train clerks who will verify the signatures. Thirdway Alliance party secretary-general Fred Okang’o poked holes in the quest for Sh241 million, saying the process would cost less if simplified.
