Chief Justice David Maraga is yet to constitute a bench to hear and determine a case filed by economist David Ndii seeking to scuttle BBI. On Monday, when the matter came up for mention, the parties were informed the bench has not been constituted, meaning another mention will be scheduled. Judge Anthony Mrima directed that the case be mentioned next Monday to confirm compliance. On November 30, Justice Mrima said the petition filed by Ndii raises substantive questions of law and as such warrants an expanded bench of the High Court. He referred the matter to the CJ for formation of the bench. The petition was filed on September 16. Ndii, Jerotich Seii, James Ngondi, Wanjiru Gikonyo and Ikal Angelei want the High Court to determine three key issues. They include whether the basic structure of the Constitution can be amended. “An amendment to the Constitution cannot be made that had the effect of overthrowing or obliterating the Constitution itself. Simply put, the Constitution’s basic structure is infringible,” the petition filed through lawyer Nelson Havi stated. President Kenyatta and ODM leader Odinga have been pushing for amendment of the Constitution as recommended by the Building Bridges Initiative. BBI calls for amendment of the Constitution to change the Executive to create the position of Prime Minister and two deputies, among other fundamental changes. The five have sued Attorney General Kihara Kariuki, National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi , Senate Speaker Ken Lusaka and the  Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission. The effect of the petition, if granted, is to eventually ensure a referendum through BBI goes not go thorough. The petitioners say since 2013, Parliament through various bills (some debated, others not) has been repealing the Constitution under the guise of amendments. The activists want the court to declare that Parliament cannot pass any laws that alter the basic structure of the constitutional foundation. (Edited by V. Graham)
