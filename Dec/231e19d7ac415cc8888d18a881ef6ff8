The government on value addition in tea farming so it can compete with global tea sellers, Agriculture CS Peter Munya has said. The CS said the Tea Bill will enable the country to come up with a hub ensuring ensure farmers practice value addition within eight years. It will be able to compete with Sri Lanka, the only country practicing value addition in tea, he said. Value addition - instead of cheaper bulk sales - involves  processing, branding, quality certification and accreditation Kenya sells more tea in volume than Sri Lanka but earns less. “We have proposed we progressively undertake value addition of our tea over eight years from when the new law takes effect," Munya said. He was speaking to tea farmers in the Limuru Highlands Zonal Association at All Saints Kamonde ACK church in Tigoni in Limuru constituency in Kiambu county on Wednesday. He was with ministry officials who educated farmers from Redhill, Kentmere, Riara and Cianda farms. Kenya consumes only five per cent of what it produces and exports the rest. Munya also said the Bill eliminates a lot of taxes so farmers and other stakeholders can get higher profits. The CS urged the Senate to pass the Tea Bill. The National Assembly has already approved it. Munya said LHZA produces 15 million to 17 million kilogrammes of annually, which is valued at Sh4 billion. Farmer Paul Mburu asked the government to work with the county government since the road cess collected from tea factories has never been used to rehabilitate roads. “During the council times, KTDA used to collect cess funds and our roads were repaired, But since devolution, our roads have never been repaired," he said.
