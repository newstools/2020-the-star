Biashara Sacco Society on Wednesday donated assorted foods and Sh100,000 cheque to cancer patients in Nyeri. Sacco chairman Kamau Njamuku said the donation was part of its corporate social responsibility. It was also meant to give thanks to God after the Sacco thrived in business despite the Covid-19 pandemic. “The main objective of today was to give thanks to our God because of bringing us this far. Coronavirus has ravaged the country and the world economy but he has been with us,” he said. The year, he said, has had various challenges and many of their customers who are business people are among those adversely affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. Though business has not been good, Njamuku said, the Sacco managed to disburse 88 per cent of targeted loans. The chairman spoke when he handed over the donation to Nyeri Hospice CEO Stephen Musya in the outskirts of Nyeri town on Wednesday. Nyeri Hospice takes care of those who are terminally ill. The sacco has been giving food donations to needy families yearly during every festive season. Edited by Henry Makori
