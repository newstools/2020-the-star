Acting Governor Benson Mutura has signed the Governor’s warrant that gives the Treasury green light to release the money to the county. Former Governor Mike Sonko had refused to sign the warrant leading to a stalemate of operations in the county since October. The governor’s warrant is a document the authorizes withdrawal of funds from the County Revenue Funds. The warrant also gives the green for the implementation of the Nairobi City County Budget FY 2020-21 of Sh 37. 5 billion, this being uploaded in the IFMIS . In the budget, Nairobi Metropolitan Service was allocated Sh 27.1 billion, City Hall Sh8.4 billion and assembly Sh2 billion. By Mutura signing the warrant, this means that once the money has been released to the CRF thus county and assembly staff will be paid their salaries . Both the executive and the assembly had been surviving on vote of account since June which amounts to sh 8.5 billion thus 25 per cent of the annual budget.
