Services at Kakamega public hospitals were Tuesday disrupted as the health workers' strike entered its second day. Nurses and clinical officers have since Monday stayed away from health facilities to demand supply of adequate PPE, employment of all medics on locums and contracts, payment of risk allowances and promotions. A spot check revealed that services at all 177 health facilities in the county were affected, with those seeking treatment opting for private hospitals. Others sought over-the-counter prescriptions. At the general hospital, 265 nurses stayed away and only 37 nurses serving on contract and those on locum reported on duty. The county government has a total of 1,330 nurses. The county government has however denied that services have been affected by the strike. It ruled out any engagement with the health workers unions, instead hinting at the possibility of engaging retired medics on contract to offer services. County Health executive Collins Matemba said all health workers demands have been addressed. “We have given the health workers adequate PPE, and they are already receiving promotion letters. Unions were hell-bent to paint the health department negatively yet it's one of those rated as performing well compared to other counties,” he said. Kenya National Union of Nurses Kakamega branch secretary Renson Bulunya said the strike was successful at 95 per cent. In Busia county, patients remained unattended in wards as 600 nurses and clinical officers stayed away. Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong on Monday appealed to the striking medics to give dialogue a chance to resolve issues they were raising. Edited by A.N
