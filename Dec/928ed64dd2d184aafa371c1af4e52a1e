A police officer based at the Siyu police post in Lamu East has committed suicide under unclear circumstances. The body of police constable Calif Mumo Rodgers,24, was found dangling on a tree with a nylon rope around his neck just a few meters from his duty post. The deceased officer who hails from Mbitini sub-location in Kitui county had only worked in Lamu for less than a year. The incident was confirmed by county police commander Moses Murithi who said investigations have commenced finding the exact cause of the officer’s suicide. The commander used the moment to advise members of the public to avoid making hasty decisions including committing suicide and instead seek out spiritual leaders and elders for advice. “One of our officers at Siyu police post committed suicide. He has not worked here for long and so we are trying to find out what could have provoked such action. We also want to see if there is any foul play,” said Murithi.’ In a suicide note found inside the officer’s pocket, the deceased indicated he was afraid of being ‘sacrificed’ by some individuals in the area. "Siwezi Enda Tolewa Kafara Faza 21/12/2020 and I have been assured by Siyu residents such that I will be taken to Faza to be offered as kafara due to the fact that I did not bring any stuff to Mwanake Sabus mother while I was coming from the home. That's why I have decided not to have this happen to me while alive. Thanks in advance," read his note. This is the first-ever case of a police officer committing suicide in Lamu.
