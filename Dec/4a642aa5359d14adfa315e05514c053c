Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has discredited charges levelled against him, terming them flimsy, inaccurate and witch-hunt thus dead on arrival. Through lawyer Harrison Kinyanjui, Sonko pleaded with the senators to throw away the case, adding that it does meet the threshold of removing him from office. He said the charges are allegations aimed anchored on witch-hunt and malice and should therefore be thrown out. While making opening remarks, Kinyanjui submitted that Sonko has been furnished with evidence supporting charges against him while other allegations touch on cases pending in court. “If a man should be denied audience when they are faced with accusations and then sentence passed against them, isn’t that violation of the Constitution?” Kinyanjui posed. Kinyanjui claimed that the county assembly, which voted two ago to remove the governor from office, did not follow the standing orders and the constitution. "The procedure must be lawful. There is not proper motion on the senate to warrant inquiry into allegations against eh governor. The county assembly violated all the rules and laws. Let this motion go back to the county assembly," he said. He was responding to MCAs who said Sonko is rogue, extravagant and plunderer of public resources and should go home. Through their lead lawyer Ndgewa Njiru, the ward reps claimed that Sonko has failed the leadership and integrity tests and brought disrepute to the office governor. “He has not only violated article 6 of the Constitution and acted in a manner that is sumptuous to the people of Kenya,” Njiru said. The lawyer said the county boss has practiced extravagance by using public money to fly his daughter to the US. “We have presented overwhelming evidence how the governor has plundered the resources of this country. Resources of Wanjiru. Resources of hustler nation,” he reckoned. “In France, a revolution was triggered by extravagance of the king. If it happened in 16th century, why should it nor now?”
