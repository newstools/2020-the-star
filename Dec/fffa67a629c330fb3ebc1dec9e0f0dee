Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka has been tasked to seek audience with President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM Raila Odinga over Kitui’s apparent exclusion from BBI benefits. The leadership of Kitui expressed reservations about exclusion in the BBI process in a meeting attended by 10 MPs, Senator Enoch Wambua and Governor Charity Ngilu at Wiper House on Monday. “We note with great concern that Kitui county was not allocated an additional constituency, even though the county is most deserving due to its population of 1.14 million people and vast land area of 30,570 square kilometres," leaders said in a statement after the meeting. “We had a meeting with the Wiper leader and Governor Ngilu over our misgiving and exclusion of Kitui from BBI benefits. Wiper leader and Ngilu were asked to seek out and petition the President and Raila on behalf of Kitui,” Kitui Central MP Makali Mulu said on the phone. Kalonzo’s communication chief Denis Kavisu released a statement that confirmed that the meeting happened. It was further resolved that even with Kalonzo and Ngilu in the forefront, Kitui leaders should seek consultations to ensure interest of the county as expressed in the forum were captured in the final BBI amendment. "We may  drop  the clamour  to have Kitui split into two counties  to create Mwingi county. However we  feel that  Kitui should get at least one new MP in the BBI proposals," Mulu said. The Wiper meeting also  resolved that the ndengu (green grams) crop be included as one of the cash crops to benefit from the proposed Cash Crop Stabilisation Fund.
