Meru politicians have welcomed the BBI proposal that seeks to give the county two additional constituencies. The county currently has nine constituencies: North Imenti, South Imenti, Central Imenti, Buuri, Tigania East, Tigania West, Igembe Central, Igembe North and Igembe South. Leaders on Monday said the additional constituencies will come with more financial allocations for residents. North Imenti MP Rahim Dawood said the aditional of constituencies will increase National Government-CDF funding to more than one billion shillings which will spur development. Igembe North MP Maoka Maore said had been fears that Meru would not benefit from the creation of more constituencies in the BBI despite its huge population. "There has been fear that Mt Kenya should not have many MPs in Parliament and when boundaries reviews are done. In Igembe, we should be having four constituencies from as far as the 2010 review. South Imenti has a population of more than 220,000 and in Igembe Central, we have 222,000 people," Maore said. They were speaking during the launch of the BBI signature collection drive at the county headquarters. Buuri MP Mugambi Rindikiri said his constituency is vast and needs to be divided into two. In South Imenti, Gedion Kimathi who lost to MP Kathuri Murungi has said he run in the constituency to be created by the BBI. He is the county chief of staff. He called on residents to support the BBI as a new legislator will bring development to the people. Nyaki West MCA Martin Mworia said more constituencies should be split for proper representation.
