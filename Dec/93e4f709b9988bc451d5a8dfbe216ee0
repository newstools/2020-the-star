The Directorate of Criminal Investigations has sought a court order to detain three suspects who allegedly robbed businessman Manu Chandaria in his home on Sunday. The three include police constable Jared Obanga and security guards Stephen Omwenga and Juda Wafula. They were arrested on December 14, detained at Huruma police station and booked in for robbery with violence. The three were arraigned on Tuesday before Makadara chief magistrate Heston Nyaga but did not take plea as police sought 14 days to detain them pending investigations. In an affidavit filed before the court, constable Godfrey Munene attached to DCI Starehe said that he is investigating a case of robbery with violence. He said Obanga is a police officer attached as a security guard at the residence of Chandaria, while Omwenga and Wafula are security guards from G4s security firm. Munene said on December 14, the three jointly with others not before the court, broke into the house of Chandaria and while armed with a pistol, stole Sh700,000 and jewellery valued at Sh650,000 plus other unknown property. “In the meantime, investigations into the circumstances and facts surrounding this robbery have commenced since the DCI took up the matter yesterday,” he said. Munene said he needs 14 working days to detain the suspects, who will help him arrest other suspects at large. He also said he needed more time to record witness statements, revisit the crime scene and get an inventory of exactly what was stolen. The defence, however, objected to the application, saying the prosecution does not need the respondents to be in custody to complete investigations. Nyaga granted them four days, saying that 14 days was unreasonable. The matter will be mentioned on December 21.
