Fresh from competing in Valencia Half Marathon, Dorcas  Tuitoek Jepchirchir is bracing up for the BOclassic 10km race in Bolzano, Italy on Thursday. Dubbed New Year’s Run, Jepchirchir is hoping to win the  title or finish on the podium after missing the World Half Marathon in October in Gdynia, Poland. “I started my preparations for this race,  immediately after the Valencia Half Marathon and my target is to finish on the podium. I want to use the event as a  spring board to the World Cross Country Championships in March next year,” said former Poddeborn 10km champion. Jepchirchir made her debut at the 2019 Istanbul Half Marathon, finishing second in a personal best time of 66:33. She went on to finish third at the Copenhagen Half Marathon in 66:36. “I have done well in half marathons and 10km races and I want to maintain this going forward,” she said. She said being axed from the World Half Marathon team last year was her worst nightmare. “It was the worst experience in my career after I had invested a lot in training. I have, however, overcome that and I am now focusing on my race this week,” she lamented.
