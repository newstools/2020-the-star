A Nairobi resident has moved to court seeking to stop Acting Governor Benson Mutura from assuming office on grounds that he does not have a degree certificate. Benard Olango argues that Mutura does not hold an academic degree from any University and is therefore not competent to hold the office of the Governor. He wanted to stop the swearing-in of Acting Governor Benson Mutura but says since Mutura is already sworn in, he should be restrained from assuming office and performing duties. Olango says that Mutura should be barred from executing any authority as Acting Governor pending hearing of the petition“Swearing in of Mutura as the Acting Governor is in breach of section 22 of the Election Act and article 181 and 182 of the constitution,” Olango argues. He says he stands to suffer grave risk and prejudice as a voter in Nairobi City County should Mutura assume office. Olango has sued the Chief Justice, The Senate, The Speaker and the clerk of the County Assembly.
