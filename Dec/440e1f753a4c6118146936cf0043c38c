Interior ministry CS Fred Matiang'i has said the government will regroup and organise the burial of Nyamira Governor John Nyagarama. Nyagarama died at the Nairobi Hospital due to Covid-19 complications. He was put on life support on Sunday night and his family was called in on Monday after his condition deteriorated. "...he has been unwell and his sons and daughters are all here. We have just arrived here and we will regroup and see what we can do," he said. Addressing the press outside lee Funeral Home on Friday, Matiangi said the family will have their plans  before they can liase with the government on the same. "It is very sad. Nyagarama was a decent man and he was everyone's father and elder.. " Matiang'i said. Matiang'i who was mourning the governor said he was calm, and had a strong sense of unity in the county. "Let us keep together and pray for this family that the lord may strengthen them," he added. Nyangarama, 74, was taken to the hospital three weeks ago when he tested positive for coronavirus. He was immediately admitted to the Covid-19 ICU “as he required a lot of oxygen”. “He was a patient on increased oxygen demand. He stayed in the Covid-19 ICU under the care of doctors and nurses who are dealing with the coronavirus cases,” a source familiar with the governor’s treatment said. After 21 days of being managed by medics, a final test was done on him last week. It came out negative. Doctors reportedly recommended that Nyagarama be transferred to the normal ICU to proceed with close medical monitoring as his lungs had suffered "multiple failures".
