President Uhuru Kenyatta is set to receive Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed on Wednesday. Uhuru will receive Abiy in Moyale, Marsabit County, at the start of the Ethiopian leader's two-day official visit to Kenya. In Moyale, the president and the prime minister will tour and officially open the Moyale One Stop Border Post (OSBP). "On the same day, the two leaders will visit Lamu County where they will inspect the ongoing construction of the new Lamu Port, an anchor project of the Lamu Port-South Sudan-Ethiopia-Transport (LAPSSET) Corridor," spokesperson Kanze Dena Mararo announced. In June, Ethiopia allayed fears that infrastructure projects with her Northern neighbours will affect investment decisions on the Lamu Port South Sudan-Ethiopia Transport (Lapsset) Corridor project. The country secured a $1.2 million (Sh127.8 million) grant from the African Development Bank (AfDB) for a feasibility study on a planned Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) link to Sudan. The railway line will have an extension to Port Sudan on the Red Sea. Its strengthening ties with Djibouti which has opened trade links and the use of its ports and that of Eritrea, coupled with existing good road and rail network towards the North , is feared could see Ethiopia abandon the Sh2.5 trillion Lapsset project.
