A new five star hotel has opened its doors in Karen, Nairobi, despite a general world disruption of the hospitality industry triggered by Covid-19. Hermosa Garden Hotel situated in the leafy suburbs of Karen is a serene hospitality spot with a rich flora and fauna, making a home for a variety of species of birds. General Frederick Emmerich described the facility as  home away from home especially for the family. “We are open for this holiday season and we are asking those who want to have a special holiday this year to come to Hermosa and sample our delicacies, mainly Kenyan cuisine,” he said. The menu includes local delicacies like mutura, sweet potatoes and seasonal vegetables. The team at Hermosa is bullish about the future of hospitality in Kenya. “Coronavirus is here with us so we must learn how to live with it,” said director Elizabeth Mungai, responding to a question on their confidence to open whilst many hotels are closing. The over 30-room facility is a luxurious expedition in the heart of Karen and has a playground for children and a swimming pool together with a sauna. “One of our targets is  conferencing and we have gone every step to make sure that Covid-19 social distancing protocol is observed,”  Emmerich said. The architecture is eco-building with as much natural light in the rooms and conference hall as possible. The hotel management says their services are pocket-friendly.
