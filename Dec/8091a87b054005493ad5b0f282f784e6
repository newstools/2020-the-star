ODM leader Raila Odinga, Wiper's Kalonzo Musyoka and Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi were Wednesday expected to hit the campaign trail to drum up support for candidates in the Msambweni by-election. Coast leaders including governors and MPs have thronged the constituency ahead of the poll to elect the area Member of Parliament to be held on December 15. ODM deputy leader Ali Joho has been campaigning for the party's candidate Omar Boga. Joho has fought off Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya who is backing Independent candidate Feisal Bader. Nyali MP Mohammed Ali and his Malindi counterpart Aisha Jumwa will also be touring the area to campaign for Bader, who enjoys the support of Deputy President William Ruto. The last few days have brought Mombasa governorship hopeful Suleiman Shahbal, former Mombasa Senator Hassan Omar among others to the area. Shahbal, who has run for Mombasa governor's seat twice, campaigned for ODM's Boga. On Wednesday, Mvurya led Bader's campaigns at Lemba, Ukunda then went to Zigira. The ODM team took its message to Msambweni, Ramisi, Kinondo and various areas. Mvurya said Bader was the right person for the Msambweni people as he has a good agenda for the residents. "By guiding him, I am sure I will achieve the records I set as governor in Kwale," Mvurya said . Shahbal condemned Governor Mvurya's utterances meant to deny Joho space to engage in politics in Kwale. The seat fell vacant after the demise of Suleiman Dori in March. Eight candidates will battle out for the parliamentary seat.  (edited by o. owino)
