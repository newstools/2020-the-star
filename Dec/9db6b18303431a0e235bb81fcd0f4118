 Many students who depend on CDF bursary might fail to resume learning when schools reopen next week due to lack of fees, an MP has said. Homa Bay Town lawmaker Opondo Kaluma on Tuesday asked the National Treasury to quickly disburse National Government-CDF cash so learners who depend on bursaries can benefit. He said constituencies have not received funds for six months now. “Since the budget was passed, Treasury has not given out any money. We are worried as leaders because we have many students who depend on CDF bursary for their schooling,” Kaluma said. He asked the Treasury to prioritise money meant for bursaries to ensure students do not waste learning hours after staying at home for months due to the coronavirus pandemic. The lawmaker also warned that President Uhuru Kenyatta’s directive on infrastructure and provision of face masks might not be attained ahead of reopening. During the State of the Nation Address, Uhuru appealed to MPs to chip in from their CDF kitties to address gaps in learning institutions in line with Covid-19 protocols. "Public day and boarding schools are overstretched and as a result, the learners are congested in classes and boarding facilities," Uhuru said. “Currently there is an urgent need for construction and equipping of more classrooms, dormitories and other amenities to further facilitate ease of learning of our children,” he added. The government aims to construct at least 12,500 classrooms and related school facilities under new cost-effective guidelines to be developed jointly by the ministries of Education and Transport. Last month, MPs sitting at the NG-CDF committee warned that CDF funded projects might grind to a halt expressing fears that it will be a tall order implementing the President's directives.
