Burnley vs Everton Saturday 3:30pm Burnley and Everton were both beaten last weekend but have a chance to make amends when they meet in Saturday’s early kick-off. The Toffees created plenty of chances, though, and remain in the top half of the table and are therefore fancied to return to winning ways. Everton have just one win from their previous five Premier League games, losing four, and whilst Premier League away favourites have an 80.56 per cent unbeaten rate ahead of this game week. Everton’s poor recent form could continue as they are the only side to have lost twice as an away favourite. Worryingly, they’ve also failed to keep a clean sheet since Match Day One, and have conceded four goals from outside the box this term. The visitors haven’t drawn away this Premier League season and they’ve conceded exactly twice in each of their last three such fixtures. Starting well could be crucial as the ‘Toffees’ have a perfect league away record after scoring first, and only Manchester United’s Premier League games have produced more first-half goals on average than Everton’s 1.8. Burnley haven’t lost as many games in their opening nine top-flight fixtures since 1888/89. Furthermore, they’ve failed to score in a league-high 67 per cent of their Premier League matches, whilst nine of 17 conceded goals came after the 60th minute. The Clarets suffered their usual thrashing at Manchester City while Everton slipped to a 1-0 defeat at home to Leeds.

One game ended in a tie and zero games were lost at home. Leipzig are the only team to have stopped the 30-time German champions from scoring during Hansi Flick’s 53-game tenure, after they held them 0-0 in the last head-to-head held here. That tenure has seen Bayern score almost four goals per Bundelisga match — the highest average of any coach in the division’s history. It’ll come as no surprise then that the 31 goals Bayern have scored after nine rounds this season equals the division record set back in 1974/75. A 1-1 draw in Bayern’s last home league match did end their 100 per cent Bundesliga home record this campaign though (W3, D1), one that saw them lead at half time in all three wins. However, Leipzig have struggled on the road, registering just one league win so far. An average of just one goal scored per road trip has been the biggest issue and doesn’t instill confidence as Leipzig seek their first ever goal in an away head-to-head.

A 2-0 win over Atalanta last time out was Hellas Verona’s sixth Serie ‘A’ game from their previous eight to produce under 2.5 goals. Each of those six also witnessed Verona fail to score before half time, whilst four produced a goalless first half. Cagliari’s matches have been full of goals with five of their last seven  Serie ‘A’ producing over 3.5 goals and witnessing both teams score. With only two half time clean sheets from nine  Serie ‘A’ games this season, Cagliari have been prone to conceding the opener, although that hasn’t always stopped them gaining a positive result. However, Cagliari have struggled on the road and lost their last two away games.
