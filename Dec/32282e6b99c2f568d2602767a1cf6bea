ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi and Cotu boss Francis Atwoli along with several Luhya MPs met in Busia on Sunday for what insiders describe as 2022 power talks and BBI strategies. They met at the home of Senator Amos Wako, where they also discussed Luhya unity. Mudavadi and Atwoli have not been pulling in the same direction politically in the recent past, however sources say some political leaders pushed for the two leaders and some Luhya MPs to meet in Busia as part of strengthening the push for unity behind the BBI. Neither Mudavadi and Atwoli commented on the details of the meeting. “As leaders we can meet as we always do and this was one such opportunity,” Mudavadi said. Others at the meeting included Kakamega Senator Cleophas Malala, MPs Tindi Mwale (Butere), Aseka Miradi (Khwisero), Sakwa Bunyasi (Nambale), Alfred Agoi (Sabatia) and Beatrice Adagala (Vihiga Woman Representative). Atwoli had indicated that he may back opposition chief Raila Odinga to succeed President Uhuru Kenyatta while Mudavadi said he will run for President in 2022. Unity between Mudavadi, Atwoli and Ford Kenya boss Moses Wetang'ula could potentially change the political trends in Western Kenya where Deputy President William Ruto is attempting to make inroads. Mudavadi has been engaging in a series of meetings with key leaders, including Uhuru over his plans to take a stab at the presidency in 2022. The Western leaders will later attend a fundraising at ACK St Peters church in Busia.
