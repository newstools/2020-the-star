Women Premier League side Gaspo FC are hoping for more goalscoring opportunities after beefing up their frontline. Team manager Edward Githua believes that the new signings will enable the side to mount a title charge and dethrone champions Vihiga Queens. "We have made decent signings in attack because we felt it was a letdown last season. The team is ready for the new season and we are targeting top spot to avoid more games during the playoffs," Githua said. Among the new attackers in Gaspo's ranks are Liseche Stella from Kibera Girls Soccer Academy and Rhoda Nafula from Wiyeta. Making a comeback to the side is Diana Wacera, the immediate former captain of Mathare. However, it is the signing of prolific striker Mercy Airo that might prove to be a masterstroke for the team. The immediate former Kisumu Starlets forward amassed 30 goals in last season to emerge second best in the charts. Nonetheless, Githua expects a tight battle for the title considering that the other top contenders have not been resting on their laurels. "Every team has reinforced. Thika Queens have improved, Kayole Starlets have signed almost 15 players and that tells you the competition won't be easy," he noted. Gaspo open the season against Zetech Sparks at Ruiru grounds. Six teams, three from each zone, will qualify for the playoffs to determine the title winner.
