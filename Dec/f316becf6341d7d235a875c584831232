Chickens are dying by the thousands from Newcastle disease in Kitui county. Prices are falling and desperate farmers are slaughtering them for early Christmas dinner before the birds drop dead. The county is racing against time to vaccinate and rescue chickens not already infected by Newcastle disease. “The highly deadly disease has caused havoc countywide but we have adequate human and other resources," Agriculture CEC Emmanual Kisangau said on Monday. "We are curtailing poultry deaths. Officers are administering jabs and educating farmers on how to ward off the disease," he said. Viral Newcastle disease infects domestic poultry and other birds with a  respiratory infection. Fatality is usually 100 per cent. It can infect humans with flu-like symptoms and eye inflammation. Agriculture officers have been dispatched to hot spots. Chickens have died in huge numbers, especially in Mwingi North subcounty, where the disease was reported for the first time more than a month ago. “I had up to 100 chickens but the disease cleared out all my poultry including chicks," Kimanzi Musili of Kwa Nguru trading centre in Kyuso said. "I have to restock. Many neighbours also lost their chickens," he said. Poultry prices have plummeted. “Merchants are buying chicken at a throwaway price. I sold a number of chickens at Sh200 apiece, instead of the usual Sh500," Musili said. Muthengi Kaivu said he is slaughtering healthy chickens every day for early Christmas dinners. “I would rather my people eat the meat than watch my chickens drop dead one by one,” Kaivu said. Mwingi North subcounty administrator Stephen Matei said the disease had struck Kyuso, Itivanzou and Mivukoni villages in Kyuso ward. The first case was reported in Kyuso town nearly a month ago. Farmers said once birds show signs of infection they drop dead within hours. (Edited by V. Graham)
