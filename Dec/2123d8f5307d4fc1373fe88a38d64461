More than 500 health workers on contract in Nakuru have joined the striking nurses and clinical officers, disrupting services at public hospitals in the county. The medics promised to stay away from work until their demands for better employment terms, medical cover and safe workplaces are met. The health workers had continued working as their colleagues in other counties went on strike. The Nakuru county health department had maintained that services were running smoothly through the contracted employees as the others were away. The medics' spokesperson Emmarvelien Ondaro said contract workers did not have medical cover and Covid-19 allowances. She wondered why the county did not remit deductions for health insurance from their payslips to the National Health Insurance Fund. Ondaro said it was regrettable that there was no one to cater for their medical bills in case they got sick yet their money was being deducted. “We have been offering services just like our colleagues on permanent employment yet the employer does not even give us the basic working tools such as quality personal protective equipment,” Ondaro said. She said the workers would not return to work until their safety was assured. Ondaro said contract nurses, clinical officers, laboratory technicians, pharmacists and record keepers have been working diligently despite not having been paid for several months. The county government had promised to upgrade their work terms to permanent and pensionable by December 7, but this has yet to been implemented. The workers camped at the county headquarters seeking an audience with the bosses.  (edited by o. owino)
