Deputy President William Ruto is headed towards outright opposition to the Building Bridges Initiative and the referendum that we expect sometime next year. But he is aware that it is too early to do that because we are not in the campaign season yet. The BBI signatures, whose collection ended just the other day, is yet to be taken to the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission for scrutiny and verification. From there, The Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill, 2020, has to get the approval of at least 24 of the 47 county assemblies before it is taken to Parliament for consideration. It is after all these processes that a referendum date can be set and Kenyans vote on the proposed amendments. So it is still too early for DP Ruto to declare that he will outrightly oppose the referendum. I don’t think he will announce his opposition to the Bill until it is clear that we are going to a referendum, and the date is set. It is only then that he can make his stand known. It would be premature for him to oppose the Bill at this moment. The moment he declares that he is opposing the Bill, he shall have severed links with his boss, President Uhuru Kenyatta. He shall have drawn the battle lines and there will be no turning back. He cannot be seen to oppose his boss and still continue to serve as Deputy President. If he gets to a point of declaring ‘NO’, then he will have known that there is no turning back and he will not go back to government. That is why he is trying to buy time and look for other ways of pushing for his agenda without really being seen to be so antagonistic towards his boss.
