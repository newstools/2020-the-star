National Assembly Health committee chairperson Sabina Chege wants all frontline health workers provided with medical cover. She said those who were employed on contract at the onset of the pandemic should also be covered until their contracts expire. "We know that when someone is employed under contract, they do not get medical cover but since we have put them on the frontline, we need to ensure they are covered," Chege said on Tuesday. She said the committee has called for a meeting with the Ministry of Health, the Council of Governors and the unions on Thursday to iron out arising issues. This follows a strike by nurses and clinical officers. Health workers started their strike on Monday. "We had given the ministry 14 days to resolve the issues raised by health workers, and we want to establish how much of the resolutions are yet to be implemented so that we know the way forward," Chege said. She said the health docket falls under county governments and appealed to governors to prioritise the needs of health workers. Chege spoke at Ngutu Primary School during the launch of teenagers mentorship programme dubbed the Eagles Movement. The programme was established in partnership with Safaricom Foundation following an increase in teenage pregnancies in the county. "We realised that some girls fell pregnant after being lured with money to buy sanitary towels, and we wrote to Safaricom Foundation for funding," Chege said. Under the programme, over 15,000 boys and girls will receive 'dignity packs'. The girls' packs will contain sanitary towels and underwear, while boys will receive underwear and soap. The teens will then use their parents' mobile phones to text a certain code that will confirm their receipt of the pack and allow them to access counselling services. "The teens can ask any question regarding reproductive health and access psychological counselling because we have put psychologists on standby," Chege said.
