Kenya Power has announced outage in sections of Nairobi as a result of a technical fault. The power situation is affecting parts of Industrial Area, Mombasa Road, Embakasi, Imara Daima and the Eastern Bypass. "A fault on our system at the Embakasi substation has caused interruption of electricity supply. This is being addressed," KPLC said. "We apologise for the current situation." Two weeks ago, Several estates in Nairobi experienced a power outage. The outage affected Karen, Kabete and Ngong Town substations. Consequently, areas left in blackout include Karen, Ngong, parts of Dagoretti, Uthiru, Kawangware, Loresho, Lavington, Mountain View, Kangemi and adjacent areas. Months ago, Kenya Power shareholders profit dropped. The power distributor announced a 92 per cent drop in full year 2019 net profit to Sh262 million from Sh3.3 billion the previous year. This was attributed to an increase in the firm’s cost of buying electricity from power producers. During the review period, non-fuel purchase costs increased by Sh18 billion to Sh70.87 billion. Finance costs also rose from Sh7 billion to Sh10.3 billion due to increased levels of short-term borrowing to bridge cash flow shortfalls and unrealised foreign exchange losses.
