The Council of Governors has asked the national government to intervene to end the health workers' strike. The nurses and clinical officers strike entered its third week on Monday. Doctors have also joined the strike after talks by the government and Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Union failed. Council chairman and Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya said county governments lack the capacity to address some of the demands made by the medics. The governor said, however, county governments have addressed most of the demands by health workers apart from the issues of risk allowances and the health service commission. "The demands being made by health workers such as risk allowances and having a commission to handle health matters can only be handled by the national government and not counties," he said. Oparanya said the Salaries and Remuneration Commission must be involved for counties to be able to pay health workers risk allowances. He said county assemblies cannot pass laws to effect such expenditures. "We want the national government to come out clear and help counties by dealing with issues raised by medics and which are being handled by county governments," he said. Oparanya spoke on Saturday at Sanandiki Primary School in Bungoma county during the funeral service for Kabuchai MP James Lusweti. Senate Speaker Kenneth Lusaka, governors Wycliffe Wangamati (Bungoma) and Wilber Ottichilo (Vihiga), senators, MPs and MCAs were among those who attended. Governors have declined to engage the striking medics in any talks on their demands, insisting they have addressed most of the issues being raised. Some have initiated the process of hiring new health staff to replace striking ones. Health CS Mutahi Kagwe at the weekend warned striking workers to return to work to avoid losing their jobs. He said the medics violated a court order that directed them to return to work.
