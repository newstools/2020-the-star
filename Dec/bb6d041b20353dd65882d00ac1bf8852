Leaders not keen on fighting corruption are the ones opposing the Building Bridges Initiative process, Ganze MP Teddy Mwambire has said. He said among the BBI recommendations is the speedy prosecution and conclusion of corruption cases. “The BBI has recommended that Chapter Six on leadership and integrity be changed to boost the fight against corruption by strengthening relevant institutions. If you look at those against the proposals, you will realise that they are leaders with questionable character,” Mwambire said on Monday. Speaking in Ganze, he urged leaders in the Coast region to support the process. “If there is a region that should push for these changes, then it should be the coastal region. We have few resources that need to be beefed up and this is the chance we have," Mwambire said. He said some Coast leaders are being used by other leaders to oppose the report for their selfish interests. “I'm the secretary to the Coast Parliamentary Group and we have leaders who say one thing when we meet and change tune immediately after the meeting. We need to stand with our people by supporting this report.” Ganze resident Janet Kazungu said those opposing the constitutional changes are not sincere. “When they say Kenyans will be overburdened, do they ever think of the bigger wards and constituencies we have at the Coast? We want new constituencies and new wards,” she said. In Kilifi county, Ganze constituency collected over 19,000 signatures to endorse the BBI report.
