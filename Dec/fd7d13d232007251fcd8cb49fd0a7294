A United Nations commission has voted to remove cannabis from a list that categorized it as one of the most dangerous drugs. Cannabis had been categorised alongside heroin and other opioids for being highly addictive and highly liable for abuse. They were also labelled as being particularly harmful and of extremely limited medical or therapeutic value." The commission recognized that the plant is having medicinal value after the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs approved a recommendation from the World Health Organization on Wednesday. There are at least two active chemicals in marijuana that researchers think have medicinal applications. These are cannabidiol which impacts the brain without a giving a high and tetrahydrocannabinol which has pain-relieving properties and is largely responsible for the high. But with the recommendation, cannabis is no longer classified as among the most harmful substances and are acknowledged as having medical benefits. CNN reported that the cannabis will still be subject to restrictions. The commission voted 27-25 to reschedule cannabis and cannabis resin. The United States, the United Kingdom, Germany and South Africa were among those who voted in favour, while countries including Brazil, China, Russia and Pakistan voted against. Members also rejected other four other recommendations from WHO about cannabis and its derivatives, which included removing extracts and tinctures of cannabis from Schedule I status and classifying a psychoactive component of cannabis, tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC.
