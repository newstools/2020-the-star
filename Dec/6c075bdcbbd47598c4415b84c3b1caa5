Doctors will withdraw their labour effective Monday after talks with the government collapsed. In a public notice on Saturday, KMPDU said this was due to unresolved issues after eight months of engagement. The cadres of doctors that will be on strike from December 21, include; Medical officers interns, pharmacists interns, dental officer interns, medical officers. Others are; Pharmacists, dentists, medical specialists and all medical superintendents. Nurses and clinical officers have been on strike since Monday last week to demand, among other things, comprehensive medical cover and personal protective equipment. Even with the strike looming, Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe has sounded a warning to striking health workers to resume work or face the sack. Kagwe said the courts had stopped the strike to allow room for negotiations noting that the government has continually engaged health workersâ€™ unions over the issues raised. "I can confirm that my Ministry and that of Labour and Social Protection continues to engage with union officials to find an amicable solution to the issues that concern their members. Kenyans can now enjoy their holidays without anxiety and fear of seeking unavailable services in our public facilities as it should be," he said.
