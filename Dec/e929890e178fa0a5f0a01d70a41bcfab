More than 2,600 vulnerable people including street urchins in Kisumu have benefited from a feeding program. Businessman Joshua Oron on Thursday fed the beneficiaries drawn from estates in Kisumu Central as part of his Christmas gift to the less fortunate families. Dr Oron, who eyes to unseat Kisumu Central MP Fred Ouda, said the feeding program is an annual exercise to enable the needy people to celebrate the festive season. He called on well-wishers to support the less fortunate in society. "These are our brothers and sisters. We must be there for them. Just give the little you have to them," he said. Apart from the feeding program, the beneficiaries were also given face masks as the country continues to grapple with the Covid-19 pandemic. Oron also donated foodstuff to vulnerable families in Manyatta, Obunga and Nyalenda slums to cushion them against the tough economic times due to the Coronavirus. The businessman with interest in the hotel industry and health sector rallied residents to ensure they strictly adhere to protocols by the Ministry of Health to avoid contracting or further spread Covid-19. "The disease is still here with us. It requires a collective responsibility to win the war on Covid-19. Let us be very cautious as we celebrate Christmas," Oron said.
