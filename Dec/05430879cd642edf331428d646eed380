The ODM Party has fined 12 Nairobi MCAs a total sum of Sh9.25 million over misconduct after disciplinary hearings. A letter from the partyâ€™s Secretary-General on Thursday revealed that the office had received a report by the disciplinary committee in the hearing and determination of cases of misconduct by members of county assemblies from Nairobi, Bungoma and Nyamira. Eight of the 12 elected MCAs have also been suspended for a period of between three to six months and de-whipped from all committees at the assembly. The elected MCAs from Nairobi are Laini Saba Ward rep Cecili Ayot, Lower Savannah MCA Nicholas Okumu, Utalii MCA Wilson Ocholla, Maurice Gari (Nairobi West) and David Okello (Huruma). Others are Redson Otieno (Ngei), Jared Okode (Mathare North) and David Mbithi (Viwandani). The elected legislators have also been barred from holding any office in the ODM party. For the nominated MCAs, the party has been urged to initiate a recall. They include Hafsa Khalif, Nimo Haji, Caroline Mayunzu and Millicent Akinyi. Sifuna revealed that the report and recommendations will be tabled at the NEC meeting which will be convened at the end of the month. This comes two days after Jubilee Party also put on notice two nominated MCAs for failing to pay monthly remittances since October 2017 amounting to Sh170,000 each. At the same time, three nominated MCAs were suspended from the party for three months and de-whipped from committees for six months.
