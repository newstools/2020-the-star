Kenya can handle its issues and no foreign donors should meddle in them, President Uhuru Kenyatta has said. Uhuru appreciated the support of development partners in achieving the country's development goals. “You must always remember that Kenya has its owners and its owners are 50 million Kenyans,” Uhuru said. He added, “Please, I ask you to refrain from interfering in or telling us or trying to direct us in which way we should go.” Uhuru said that Kenya is sure about where it is heading and the donors should only join to support her endeavours. He spoke on Friday when he presided over the groundbreaking ceremony for the G47 Ugatuzi Tower in Hurlingham, Nairobi. “Do not interfere because we shall not allow for you to dictate to us which direction to be taken; that should be up to Kenyans,” he said. Deputy President William Ruto said that the G47 Towers will consolidate all the devolution players in one building, hence enhancing their efficiency. The President also said that the Devolution CS's offices should be moved to the building once it is completed. Uhuru hailed healthcare workers who are at the forefront in battling with the deadly virus. The G47 Towers will house the Devolution Museum. Governors have proposed to name the museum for Uhuru in honour of his commitment to supporting devolution during his tenure.
