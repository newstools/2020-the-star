Musician Nameless Mathenge at the weekend travelled upcountry to celebrate his parent's 56th anniversary. This has been a particularly challenging year for the family. Nameless's father underwent brain surgery a few months ago as well as hip replacement. Speaking to Word Is, Nameless compared the moment to the life-threatening situation that got him admitted in the High Dependency Unit three years ago. "My mum was so stressed seeing him helpless, but I remember my wife being in the same situation when I was in the hospital three years ago," he said. "When I see God giving us another chance, I appreciate life more and live to the fullness." Nameless says he is grateful to God that his father is recovering. He wrote on Instagram; "It's been a tough year for my Dad but we thank God he is recovering well and to see him and my mum grow old together and stand together through the ups and downs of marriage is a blessing and an inspiration!"
