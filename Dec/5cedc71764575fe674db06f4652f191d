Wiper party National vice chairman Victor Swanya has insisted that former vice president Kalonzo Musyoka will not play second fiddle to anyone in the 2022 presidential election. Swanya said those trying to woo the Wiper boss to support any other candidate for the next presidential contest, should be at assured that Kalonzo will contest the country's top seat. In a swipe at allies of Deputy President William Ruto who on Tuesday called for Kalonzo to drop his ambitions and cobble an alliance with the DP, Swanya said no amount of intimidation will force the Wiper leader out of the race. He said the Wiper party boss has already been cleared by the party to seek the highest office in the land in 2022. "Any intimidation to make him surrender or support any other person has no room because we as the party leadership, members and the country is behind him," Swanya said. In a statement, Swanya said Kalonzo is best suited to take over from President Uhuru Kenyatta for guaranteed sound governance of this country. "We can only ask those people who think they want to woo him to their side to cross over for serious discussion how to join him to form the next Government," he said. "Obviously their clamor to woo him to their side is a pregnant testament of Kalonzo's sure servant leadership that country is yearning for," Swanya added. Swanya said Kenya will not make any mistake to make election decisions on lured financial influence which he noted has no economical impact on their families and the county. "'Once beaten twice shy' saying will be true for the choice of the next leaderships in coming elections 2022 in our country" he said. On Tuesday Ruto's allies asked the Wiper boss to cross over to the Tangatanga wing saying the DP is the country's presidential front-runner. However, Kalonzo's confidants have curiously reacted to the remarks saying they amount to ridiculing the Akamba Nation.
