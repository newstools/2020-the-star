The MTV Africa Music Awards (MAMAs) are back. The awards, which showcase the ultimate in African culture, music and creativity, will be held in a reimagined virtual format in partnership with Uganda in February next year. The event will celebrate African talent across 20 award categories. The awards celebrate African and international talent and achievement. The MAMAs will recognise and reward musicians, trailblazers and those who are shining a light on the continent's diverse talent and creativity by instilling a positive impact on African music and youth culture over the previous year. Uganda will be hosting the awards for the very first time. "The awards are an extraordinary African cultural experience, and we understand the important role it plays in driving awareness, cross-culture education and profiling the continent's rich leisure tourism offerings on the international stage,‚Äù said Godfrey Kiwanda, State Minister for Tourism, Uganda. The awards ceremony will feature vibrant performances from leading African and international artistes and will also showcase some of the biggest cross-genre and cross-border collaborations. An additional category like 'The Alone Together Best Lockdown Performance', recognises outstanding performances that took place virtually by celebrating artistes who took to streaming services to share their music and unite society during the unprecedented 2020 lockdown. The nominees will be announced this month, and music lovers will have their say by voting for their favourite stars online. First staged in 2008, the MTV Africa Music Awards has recognised the talent of musicians, achievers and personalities from across Africa, rewarding iconic artists and game-changers, such as our very own Wahu, Lupita Nyong'o, Nameless and Diamond Platnumz. In 2009, the awards were held in Kenya, a year after they were launched in South Africa.
