A matatu tout who head-butted his colleague and knocked out his three teeth over a parking space was Tuesday charged with assault. Anthony Wainaina was charged before Kibera senior principal magistrate Charles Mwaniki with causing grievous bodily harm to David Ndung’u. He denied the charges. The charge sheet says he committed the offence on November 23 in Ngara. According to the police investigations, Ndung’u, a Kenya Mpya Sacco tout, collected his teeth after the fight and later reported the matter to the Parklands police station. The three teeth will be used in court as exhibit. Wainaina was released on a Sh400,000 bond and an alternative cash bail of a similar amount. The case will be mentioned on December 14 for a pre-trial.
