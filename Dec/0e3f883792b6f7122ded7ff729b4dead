Bishops have called 2020 one of the worst years in recent memory and urged the government to focus on economic recovery next year. Poverty has worsened throughout Rift Valley due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The clergymen led by chairman Wilson Kurui and Catholic Bishop Dominic Kimengich of Eldoret said on Monday the pandemic had hurt many Kenyans. They said it was time for politicians to set their selfish interests aside, put the country first and recovery strategies in place. Kurui said Kenyans should also pray for God's intervention to wipe out the Covid-19 pandemic. “This has been a very challenging year. Covid brought us to our knees and we thank God for bringing us this far. We pray for the souls of those who could not make it," he said. “Many families have literally nothing to eat as we approach Christmas and we should help those in dire need," Kurui said. Bishop Kimengich said many families in the country are starving due to measures to control Covid-19, which have disrupted business and other activities. He said Christians and all Kenyans should share food and other resources to keep families from starving at Christmas. Chairman of the Muslim Preachers and Imams in the region, Abubakar Bini, said political leaders should stop obsessing over the BBI referendum while most Kenyans face life-threatening challenges. North Rift bishops also blamed parents for neglecting their responsibilities, resulting in teen pregnancies and other problems that can ruin their lives. Chairman of the region's clergy, Bishop Kurui, said many parents had allowed teenagers to loiter and engage in immoral behaviour that could cause them to drop out of school. He urged parents to be closer to their children in December and prepare them to return to school in January. (Edited by V. Graham)
