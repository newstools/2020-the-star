Early Childhood Development Education teachers in Busia have been encouraged to be passionate about their work to not only improve the lives of their students but also themselves. ICT chief officer Lydia Nabwire said teaching offers a great platform to influence other people's lives positively. "Make an unending improvement on yourself. Upgrade yourselves, and with the competency-based curriculum improve the whole world through children," she said. Nabwire spoke in Budalang'i during a thanksgiving ceremony in her honour by ECDE teachers from the region. She said during her tenure in the ECDE directorate, the county ensured every public primary school in the county had at least two county employed ECDE teachers. "We also improved infrastructure, learners' welfare, supplied seats to all public ECDE centres, procured curriculum designs and instructional materials," she said
