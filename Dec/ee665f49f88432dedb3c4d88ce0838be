ODM party secretary general Edwin Sifuna has said the party will regroup and move on after failing to secure the Msambweni seat in the concluded by-election. The mini poll attracted eight candidates but the main contest was between the ODM candidate Omar Boga and the Independent candidate Feisal Bader, who enjoyed DP William Ruto’s support. The outcome saw Bader being declared a winner after garnering 15,251 votes against Boga's 10,444 votes from all the 129 polling stations. Sifuna congratulated the winners in all the by-elections which were being conducted by IEBC, though failed to mention the name of Feisal. “Congratulations to all winners in yesterday's by-elections especially the ODM party candidates in Kisumu North and Dabaso Wards. We came up short in Msambweni and Wundanyi /Mbale but we regroup and forge ahead. Thanks to all our teams everywhere for the great effort,” Sifuna said. After the win, Bader said he was grateful to the people of Msambweni for giving him a chance to serve them. He said that his predecessor Suleiman Dori was a great MP who was loved by many and it would be unfair for him to come up with his own agendas without completing what the late had started. "I want to promise the people of Msambweni that I will fulfill all the promises but during my first days as their MP, I have to see that what my good friend Dori had started is accomplished," he said. Wiper's Abdurahman Sheikh was a distant third with 790 votes followed by Hamisi Mwakaonje Liganje(UGM) with 230 and Marere Wa Mwachai Mwarapayo(NVP) with 300.
