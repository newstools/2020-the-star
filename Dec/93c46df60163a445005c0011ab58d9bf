Nzoia Sugar chairman Evance Kadenge believes their poor start of life in the new season is due to lack of a head coach. The club was set to announce a new gaffer from the shortlisted trio of former Bandari assistant coach Ibrahim Shikanda, former Harambee Stars boss James Nandwa and Leonard Odipo before the season kicked off in late November. The club has been without a head coach from March after parting ways with Collins Omondi on grounds of poor performanceÂ in the past season. Since Omondi's exit, the sugar millers have been under the tutelage of his assistant Sylvester Mulukurwa and goalkeepers trainer Peter Mwaura whom Kadenge praised for leading the club thus far. Kadenge rubbished earlier reports that the club had settled on Shikanda, saying lack of a coach had played a massive role in their slow start. This, he said has seen them fail to register a win in the opening five rounds played so far. The club has gathered three points out of a possible 15 "Contrary to reports doing rounds on social media, we have not hired a new coach yet.We were supposed to appoint one out of the three who made it to the final list but the Human Resource management is yet to give us a name. As a former coach, I strongly believe we are performing poorly due to lack of a coach. We have talented players who require guidance to get us positive results and I urge the management to hasten the process and give the team a new manager in the new year ," he said
