Some 150 bright and needy students in Kanyamwa Kologi ward in Ndhiwa constituency on Tuesday collectively received Sh1.2 million in bursaries. The money was raised through the partnership of Kochieng Unity and Development Forum and Homa Bay county secretary Isaiah Ogwe. The community organisation's coordinator Joshua Mamra said they joined hands to help the students to continue with their education when schools reopen on January 4. Speaking at Dunga Primary School, Ogwe said the Covid-19 pandemic had worsened the economic situation for the students. But they had come together and raised more than Sh1.2 million. “Education is the only gift we can offer to these children. Most of them are bright but they can’t succeed in education due to lack of fees,” he said. Mamra said the CBO has been soliciting funds from well-wishers to support the learners reach their education goals. He called on leaders from Homa Bay to support students from vulnerable families. MCAs Nura Odongo (Kasgunga), Eliphalet Osuri (Ruma Kaksingri), Julius Nyambok (Homa Bay Central), Juma Awuor (Homa Bay East) and Joash Achieng (Homa Bay West) were present. The ward reps said they are working with other leaders to ensure the students get support.  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
