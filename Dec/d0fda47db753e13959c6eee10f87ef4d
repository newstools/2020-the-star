The Judicial Service Commission has dismissed a petition against three Supreme Court judges that sought their removal over claims of bribery and gross misconduct. In a letter to four law firms representing the judges, JSC secretary Anne Amadi said the allegations levelled against justices Mohamed Ibrahim, Smokin Wanjala and Njoki Ndung’u were unsubstantiated and lacked evidence. Jared Ongeri filed the petition at JSC last year accusing the three of gross misconduct and violation of Judicial Code of Conduct after they delivered a majority decision in the Wajir governor's election petition. He claimed  Justice Wanjala received Sh75 million to influence the outcome of the case that was before the top court at the time. Wanjala denied the claims and in response sought to have Ongeri give the names of the banks, branches and accounts from where the money was withdrawn and where it was sourced. “I am equally eager to have the allegations investigated so my name is cleared and my reputation saved,” he said in response. Ongeri also claimed that Justice Ibrahim received a bribe but the judge argued that he made the decision in the Wajir case independently and without being influenced in any way. But Amadi said even after Ongeri was given an opportunity to prove the allegations, he failed to furnish the judges with particulars as requested and present any evidence to support his petition. “The petition and the judges responses were tabled before the Judicial Service Commission on November 11 this year and upon consideration, the commission noted that Ongeri further declined to proceed for the oral hearing of the petition as scheduled,” the letter reads. The commission resolved that the allegations raised were unsupported, subsequently dismissing the case. (Edited by V. Graham)
