Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya and Lunga Lunga MP Khatib Mwashetani put aside the county’s succession politics to secure victory in the Msambweni by-election. The Jubilee members, both who ditched ODM in 2017 joined independent candidate Faisal Bader’s camp to beat Omar Boga who ran through their former party. Bader was supported by Deputy President William Ruto and a host of MPs allied to the Tangatanga faction of the Jubilee party. He garnered 15,251 votes against Boga’s 10,444. United by the by-election campaigns, Mvurya and Mwashetani’s differences about who should be Kwale governor in 2022 were briefly forgotten. Mwashetani has declared his interest to replace Mvurya in 2022. But the governor has endorsed his deputy Fatuma Achani to take over. Mvurya’s support for Achani is pegged on an alleged deal struck by elders from the Duruma and Digo communities who are the majority in Kwale. The two communities promised to support each other to retain the seat. The county chief also believes Achani is the best bet to finish the job they started together. The succession politics has made Mvurya and Mwashetani trade barbs in public. During the Mashujaa Day celebrations in Lunga-Lunga, Mvurya turned down Mwashetani’s request for a fair ground on the succession. The MP asked the governor to step back and let him compete with Achani without his interference. “As a father, I think it is better if you don’t support one child and be fair enough to give us equal opportunities so residents decide through votes,” Mwashetani said. But Mvurya told the MP he was too late as the seat is already reserved for Achani. When the campaigns intensified the two joined hands to kick ODM out of Msambweni. It remains to be seen whether their new-found comradeship will last. The governorship contest has also attracted assembly speaker Sammy Ruwa, Former Knut chair Mudzo Nzili, PS Hamadi Boga and Chai Lung’anzi.    Edited by Kiilu Damaris
