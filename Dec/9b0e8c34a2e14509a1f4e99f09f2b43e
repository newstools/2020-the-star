Kenya international striker Chris Wokila is ready to fight for a spot in the national men’s hockey team. Wokila last played for Kenya in 2016 during the World Hockey League 1 series in Ghana and was the shining light in the Kenya Hockey Union Premier League in 2019, bagging the top scorer award after finding the back of the net 13 times. The 25-year-old also won the Magharibi Michezo Awards trophy. He relishes competition from Festus Onyango who was runner up top scorer and Wazalendo’s Sutcliffe Usagi who won the inaugural HockeyKE awards. Others are—KCA University’s Arnold Marango, who tormented teams in the Super League and the evergreen Danston Barasa who has been a revelation for the Fidelis Kimanzi-coached Wazalendo. Butali duo of Moses Ademba and Derrick Kuloba as well as Robinson Omutekete and Douglas Nyerere who play for Western Jaguars and Sailor respectively, can also play in attacking positions. “All those who have been called up are equally good and there’s healthy competition. I need to work extra hard to convince the selectors that I deserve a chance. It’s good to be back to the national team fold and I endeavour to prove myself.” The Greensharks deadly forward said Kenya should reign supreme in the African Cup of Nations qualifiers slated for Nairobi from January 18-24, 2021. “Nothing but the best results is what the team should fight for. Kenya need to qualify to improve their ranking continentally and globally. It’s a pity that teams like Ghana are ahead of us. We have to return Kenya where it belongs.” The team started training on Sunday and have the opportunity to sharpen up their skills twice a week. With just a month before the tournament, Wokila urged the players to quickly adjust and get back to the rhythm. “We are coming from a difficult period and the best thing is to work as a team, training hard and be match ready because we have little time.”
