Msambweni by-election winner Feisal Bader been sworn-in as a Member of Parliament. Bader was on Tuesday sworn in days after clinching the seat. The short swearing-in ceremony was presided over by National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi. Bader who contested as an Independent candidate trounced Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) candidate Omar Boga after garnering 15,251 votes against Omar’s 10,444. Bader said he will focus on completing the late MP Suleiman Dori's agenda. Speaking to NTV after the win Bader said he was grateful to the people of Musambweni for giving him a chance to serve them. He said Dori was a great MP who was loved by many and it would be unfair for him to come up with his own agenda's without completing what the late had started. "I want to promise the people of Msambweni that I will fulfill all the promises but during my first days as their MP, I have to see that what my good friend Dori had started is accomplished," he said. "It has been a tough campaign period amid coronavirus perhaps being the longest campaign period. But for over seven months,  I had confidence that I would win but I could not underestimate my opponents," he said. Bader said the campaign period is now over and the people of Msambweni have spoken and their will must prevail. The MP-elect said he was grateful for the support of Deputy President William Ruto and his allies had given him. "The DP stood with me when ODM humiliated me. His close allies like Muthama, Khalwale, and Hassan Omar have been here with me all through to ensure that I won. I know I can not repay them but will always pray for them," he said He said though the contest was a tough competition, only one person would win. "I want to reach out to my friends to join hands with me and bring the ideas they have on the table so that we can serve the people of Msambweni," Bader said.
