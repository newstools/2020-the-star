Thugs broke into Magarini MP Michael Kingi's house and stole valuables in broad daylight in Serena area, Malindi town. It is alleged that the thieves raided the house at around 11am. They broke the door of the rental house and made away with many valuables. Speaking to journalists in Malindi on Friday,Â  Kingi said the thugs stole mattresses, beds, gas cylinders, sufurias, plates and everything within sight. ''I got a phone call from the wife of my landlord in Malindi at my rental house at around 12:30pm. She informed me that there was a tenant who had called and informed him a door had been broken and some things removed,'' he said. Kingi said he sent his boys since he was in Nairobi preparing to catch a flight to Malindi and they found the door was broken and properties stolen. The legislator still does not know the motive of the thugs because they stole so many things from the house. ''It's like they had a plan to take everything from the house but they failed because the fridge was almost gone as they dragged it and abandoned it at the door,'' he said. Kingi said he immediately called the police and sent his allies to the station to record a statement and they immediately took action. He thanked the police for the quick response as they sent officers who went to the house and commenced investigations. ''I believe that soon we will know who broke into the house and stole the properties or who is using the thugs to steal,'' he said. The MP said in the apartment they are three tenants and he has stayed there for many years even before being elected as MP. Edited by Henry Makori
