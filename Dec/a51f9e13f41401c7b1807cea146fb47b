Stern action will be taken against Kisumu city staffers who report to work late, spend several hours out of the office and leave work early, acting manager Abala Wanga has said. In a memo to heads of departments, Wanga directed staffers to adhere to all the rules of the County Public Service Board or they will be punished. “All the staff should report in the office by 8am, break for lunch at 1 pm to 2pm and leave the office at 5pm except those working in essential services whose jobs require [them] to report earlier and or leave late above hours,” he said. Wanga directed quick action on assignments, letters and documents submitted to departments in order to improve service delivery. “It has come to my attention that letters, assignments and documents in the offices are delayed for long without any actions taken,” he said. He said the turnaround time for all the assignments should be a maximum of two days. Letters must be acted on within the day of receipt. However, urgent letters that require emergency response should not take more than one hour. The city manager said reports, payments, procurement and contracts should be analysed, consulted on and acted upon within a day. Wanga requested county secretary Godfrey Kigochi to advise executive members, chief officers and any other agency that all correspondences to the city should be referred to his office. “It has been noted with a great concern that some officers have built a tradition of corresponding directly with city staff without due respect to the office of the city manager,” he said. In a letter dated December 2, and written to Kigochi, Wanga has also directed all city staff to correspond through his office. (edited by o. owino)
