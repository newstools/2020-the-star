The lives of residents of Kivou ward in Mwingi Central subcounty are about to change for the better with the construction of 130 water pans. Mwingi Central MP Gideon Mulyungi in collaboration with the Kenya Irrigation Board launched the project. Every homestead in Kivou village will get a water pan for irrigation and other home use. The national government has funded the project for Sh200 million. The project will greatly reduce the water shortage in the area and save residents the long distances they walk to fetch the commodity. Speaking at Kivou village during the launch of the project, Mulyungi thanked the national government for initiating the project that will make the village water sufficient. He called for the expansion of the project to cover the entire constituency. “What we need most is water and this project has come in very handy and it will aid in irrigation,” Mulyungi said. He asked the government to expand the project to more needy areas of Nuu, Sosoma and Ukasi where locals wake up as early as 5am and spend the whole day searching for water. The MP urged the county government of Kitui to allocate more money to water, which is a devolved function. “If the county government can complement the efforts of the national government, water shortages in Mwingi would be permanently solved,” the legislator said.
