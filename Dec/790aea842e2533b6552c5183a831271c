I believe ODM leader Raila Odinga is a bit acceptable in the Mt Kenya region because of the handshake. This is particularly so in places such as Nyandarua, where he has been previously perceived as an enemy of the people. For a long time, people there believed he was sabotaging President Kibaki’s administration through what was popularly known as consultations. Every time the President wanted to do something, the former Prime Minister would say he was not consulted. You also remember the issue of the Northern Collector Tunnel in Murang’a county, which he vehemently opposed. These are some of the issues that made the people of the mountain believe that he was a bad person. The handshake has neutralised that perception to some extent and the people have softened towards him. However, it is important to note that does not necessarily mean they will buy his political ideology. This is because in the 2022 ballot, the region does not have a presidential candidate and it would be very hard for him right now to create what I would call an organisational infrastructure. This means having people on the ground, boda bodas, priests, chairmen of saccos, among others, who would marshal people to come out to the last man to vote for him. Already, he has been surpassed by Deputy President William Ruto, who is always in the villages in Mt Kenya. That is why Raila’s most important aspect of his political message in the region is based on his unity with President Uhuru Kenyatta and the reforms they are bringing through the BBI. However, when we talk of political alignments, I feel the people are yet to fully buy Raila as a brand. They have been closely associating themselves with Ruto because he has been traversing the region almost every weekend. When Raila visits, people would want to know more about the BBI. He would also be warmly received because people are mature politically and tolerant. The political analyst spoke to the Star on the phone
