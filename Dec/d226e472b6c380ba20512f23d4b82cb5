Senate Speaker Kenneth Lusaka has gazetted a special sitting on Wednesday to hear charges levelled against impeached Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko and determine the method of prosecuting the ouster motion. The gazette notice published Monday states that members shall meet at the Senate chambers in Nairobi on Wednesday at 2.30pm. “The business to be transacted at the sitting shall be hearing of charges against Mike Mbuvi Sonko,” the notice reads. Lusaka said the sitting will be in accordance with Standing Orders and receipt of notice from Nairobi county assembly speaker of the approval of a motion to remove the governor from office by impeachment. Members of the county assembly last Thursday voted to impeach Sonko. Some 88 MCAs voted in favour of the motion, surpassing the two-thirds threshold required for the removal of the county boss. “The business specified in the notice shall be the only business before the Senate during the special sitting, following which, the Senate shall stand adjourned until Tuesday, February 9, 2021 at 2.30pm in accordance with the Senate calendar,” the notice added. During the sitting, the clerk of the Senate will read out the charges against the governor to the House. Thereafter, senators shall decide whether to appoint an 11-member committee to investigate the charges against the governor or the matter prosecuted before the plenary as stipulated in Section 33 of the County Governments Act. Sonko is accused of abuse of office, violation of the Constitution and gross misconduct. His refusal to assent to the budget was at the centre of the impeachment. Sonko declined to approve the budget, saying there was no way MCAs could allocate Sh27 billion out of the Sh37.5 billion budget to the Nairobi Metropolitan Services.
