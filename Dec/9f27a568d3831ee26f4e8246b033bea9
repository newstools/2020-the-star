Roots Party of Kenya has joined the crowded race for Nairobi governor and will sponsor a candidate to succeed impeached Mike Sonko. Party leader Prof George Wajackoyah on Tuesday unveiled RPK candidate Isaac Chege Njuguna who will battle it out with more seasoned politicians. Njuguna is a businessman, a scientist and an alumni of Alliance, Nairobi, Strathmore and City University in London. Njuguna’s opponents include exiled lawyer Miguna Miguna of Thirdway Alliance of Kenya and former Starehe MP Bishop Margret Wanjiru. On Monday, Jubilee Party cleared former Dagoretti South MP Dennis Waweru and Ms Agnes Kagure to battle it out for its party’s ticket. ODM on the other hand cleared its Women's League president Beth Syengo and former Homa Bay gubernatorial candidate Sam Wakiaga for its primaries. Speaking to the Star after issuing a nomination certificate to Chege, Wajackoya said Kenyans will chose its youthful candidate who is not tainted. “This is a young man who understands the plight of Nairobians. He can be trusted to bring the social change that the city is yearning for,” Wajackoyah told the Star. He described their opponents as “recycled” and the usual game players who resurface every election cycle. “Some of them are just being imposed on voters,” Wajackoya claimed. He said they are determined to win the seat and should not be underestimated by any of the parties. “We know what Nairobians need and how to sort out those problems. We will win the elections,” he said. Roots pary has also sponsored a candidate for the upcoming Matungu by-election. Wajackoyah, a renowned academic who rose from a street boy to become a high profile lawyer, has also been eyeing the presidency. The Nairobi gubernatorial contest is promising to be a tight contest. Wary of the high-stakes in the battle, President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga are said to be working on a compromise candidate to fly the handshake flag. Edited by Henry Makori
