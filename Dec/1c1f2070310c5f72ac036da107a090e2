Malindi Town MCA David Kadenge's wife has died after she was electrocuted at her home. Witnesses said Racheal Kadenge was operating an electric sewing machine when she touched live wires. She died on the spot. The body was taken to the Malindi Star Hospital mortuary. Relatives, friends and colleagues of the MCA were left in shock following the sudden death. They thronged Malindi Star hospital in disbelief at the accident. MCAs Adamson Mwathethe of Shela, Sammy Ndago (Shimo la Tewa), Nixon Mramba (Kakuyuni) were among the first to arrive to comfort their bereaved colleague. Mwathethe called on Kenya Power to investigate the matter and ensure the family is compensated for the loss. The MCAs said many people have lost their lives from electric faults in Malindi and called on the authorities to find a permanent solution. “We are still in shock. She is said to have been in good health but had an accident,” Mwathethe said. Michael Kadenge said his brother had called him and informed him of the death. He called on the Kenya Power to come to clear and tell the family what caused the death of his sister-in-law.
