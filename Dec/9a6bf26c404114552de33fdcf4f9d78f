Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu has condemned the act where a Mwingi man allegedly set on fire his house where his wife, together with his two children died following the incident. Ngilu, who had visited the family members on Thursday, condoled with the family assuring them of support to cater for the burial expenses. “This incident is very saddening where a whole household has been wiped out and the county government will support the family and the only daughter who has been left alone,” said Ngilu. She also urged locals to seek counseling whenever they undergo hard situations to avoid such horrific incidences. “Let people confide in church leaders and other counselors to avoid such terrifying incidences as even taking lives of innocent children is very disturbing,” added Ngilu. On the fateful day two days ago, Paul Mwai who according to neighbors had been having domestic wrangles with the wife, set his house on fire which was locked from inside. His 42-year-old wife and two children died on the spot while Mwai died this morning while receiving treatment at Mwingi level 4 hospital according to Mwingi Central Deputy Sub-county police commander, Nicholas Mutua. Family wrangles have been sighted as the possible cause of the mysterious fire in a suspected suicide. According to eyewitnesses, the mysterious fire broke down around midnight, and neighbors were woken up by wailing in the house which had already caught fire and upon rushing to the scene they only managed to save the husband before the house caved in. The incident was confirmed by Kavuvwani location Chief Mwinzi Muvengei, also urging residents to remain calm as investigations to unravel the cause of the fire are underway. Bodies of the three were moved to Mwingi Level IV hospital mortuary awaiting postmortem to determine the actual causes of their deaths.
