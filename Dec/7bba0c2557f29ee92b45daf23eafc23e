Kericho county nurses and clinical officers are back on the job full time and have been promised PPEs in the Covid-19 pandemic. They ended their go-slow on Friday after signing an MoU to continue working while their grievances were being addressed. Kericho Governor Prof Paul Chepkwony on Sunday told the Star health workers agreed to end the go-slow over delayed payments and  allowances after modalities on payment was concluded last week. Nurses and clinical officers in Kenya have been on strike for eight days on Monday. Doctors may join them on Monday. On Saturday a middle-aged man died outside Kericho Nursing Home, after staff at Kericho Level 4 hospital allegedly turned him away. He died at the entrance before he could be treated. The widow took the body to a private morgue near the nursing home. During swearing-in of Kericho Public Service Board member Ziphora  Koech on Thursday, Chepkwony announced the MoU. He said striking nurses and clinical officers had been going on with duties, despite the challenges facing them during the Covid-19 pandemic. He said the county assured them of being first provided with PPEs. Chepkwony said Kericho was the only county where medical workers had agreed to resume full-time work while waiting for their grievances to be addressed. He told health workers to ensure no patient was turned away since all health facilities are well equipped with drugs and PPEs. (Edited by V. Graham)
