Gor Mahia assistant Captain Phillemon Otieno has unreservedly apologized to their fans and Kenyan football fraternity following the embarrassing 6-0 defeat at the hands of CR Belouizdad in Algeria on Saturday. Gor were thumped by the Algerian champions in the first leg of the opening round leaving their hopes of making to the group stages Caf Champions League for the first time in limbo. For the Kenyan champions to qualify to the group stages, they will be forced to score seven goals unanswered goals in the return leg. Should the Algerians who have one foot in the pools prevail, Gor will drop to the Confederations Cup. Otieno who skippered the team in the absence of the injured Kenneth Muguna said despite the humiliation, the team picked valuable lessons they intend to implement going forward. “On behalf of fellow players, l would like to apologize for the loss against Belouizdad. It’s football and we learnt our lessons. It’s a wake-up call for us to pull up  if we want to achieve our goals for this season,” noted the former Ushuru player on the club's portal. The travel-weary Gor who are scheduled to jet back Tuesday went four goals down at halftime before soaking two more goals in the final period. They host the reverse leg on January 6 at the Nyayo National Stadium.
