Newly-crowned world half marathon world record holder Kibiwott Kandie is planning a stab at the 10,000m Olympic title at the rescheduled 2020 Tokyo Olympics. Kandie is now hopeful of glory on the track although he has never run in the 10,000m race before. "I have run 10,000m in training but I never took it seriously. But I know that I have the tools to succeed on track and that is why I will be seeking a slot in Team Kenya to Tokyo," Kandie said. Nonetheless, Kandie believes that competing against seasoned athletes in 10,000m will be no child's play. Consequently, the man who broke Geoffrey Kamworor's half marathon record at this Sunday's Valencia Marathon has planned a rigorous training session ahead. "The key thing is to be committed in training and to work hard. It will not be easy but if I work hard for it, then I am confident of good results," Kandie said. Kandie set a new world record of 57:32 to smash the previous 58:01 mark set by his compatriot Kamworor at the 2019 World Half Marathon Championships in Copenhagen, Denmark. Second-placed Jacob Kiplimo of Uganda clocked 57:37 as he lost out to the man he had beaten to the World Half Marathon title in October in Gdynia, Poland. Not satisfied with this feat, Kandie is dreaming big about his world record. "My next target in the half marathon will be to break this new world record by reducing it to 56:00. I know that it will not be easy to achieve but with hard work, it is possible," Kandie said. He dedicated his new world record to himself considering the sacrifices that he has had to make in pursuit of it. "I started training for this marathon seven weeks before. It meant that I had to cut out a lot of things so that I could concentrate," he said. Kandie will now take a break for the festive season as he prepares for an assault at different events next year.
