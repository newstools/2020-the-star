The annual All Africa Music Awards (Afrima) have announced the postponement of the seventh edition of the awards ceremony to next year due to the Covid-19 pandemic. In a statement, the organisers said the decision to postpone the event, which was scheduled to start today and end on the 6th, was made meetings with stakeholders. "The health and safety of the community of Afrima stakeholders are of utmost importance to the organisers." The statement indicated that many of the award nominees and delegates travel from different parts of the world for each edition, and fully understanding the risks involved with such movements, the suspension of the 2020 edition is the only prudent course. The annual awards, organised in collaboration with the AU, rewards creativity, while promoting the African cultural heritage.
