Most Kenyans believe the new year will be better than 2020, a new study indicates. The study by Infotrak, released on Thursday, showed 61 per cent of Kenyans are strongly optimistic 2021 would be better compared to the year ending. The study showed an overwhelming majority – 95 percent of those interviewed – felt 2020 was the most difficult year in their lives. The study carried out between December 27 to December 29 also indicated that 95 per cent of those interviewed feel 2020 has been very difficult. The study released on Thursday had 800 respondents with 3.5+/- margin of error. Most Kenyans listed unemployment, high cost of living and access to healthcare as their major concerns. About 44 percent of those who said 2020 was the most difficult year cited financial instability as the biggest reason for their response with 24 percent having lost their jobs, 21 percent had their business collapse, while two percent either lost a friend, colleague or relative. Coast region led in the number of those disappointed by 2020 with 72 percent saying they experienced extreme difficulty, followed by Nyanza region with 64 percent. Sixty-two percent of Nairobi residents listed 2020 as their worst year, 61 percent of respondents from Western and Eastern also admitted to experiencing extreme difficulty. The situation slightly dropped in North Eastern (60 percent), Rift Valley (59 percent) and Central Kenya (54 percent). The year also had many people not celebrating the festivity as they used to with 77 percent saying they were unable to spend this festive period as they have in the past. “A total of 61 percent unable to celebrate this festive period as they would have liked due to financial constraints,” Infotrak’s Walter Nyabundi said as he released the research findings.
