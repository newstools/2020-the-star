Police in Lamu are investigating allegations that a soldier working in the region eloped with and married a KCPE exam candidate. Lamu police boss Moses Murithi said his office had received the reports and are doing everything to unearth the truth. He warned that public officers engaging in sexual relations with schoolchildren will face dire consequences. “The matter is currently under investigation. No one is above the law and if indeed the soldier is found to be on the wrong, we shall apprehend and charge him in a court of law. The rights of children shall be respected by all,” Murithi said. The KDF officer is said to be attached to the Bargoni camp in Lamu west. Last week, residents of Hindi town took to the streets to protest against a rise in defilement and gender-based violence. The protesters cited the issue of the KDF soldier marrying a candidate and walking around scot-free as a clear sign of impunity on the authorities. They accused police of doing little or nothing to deal with defilers and called for the arrest of the officer. Murithi said a probe had already been launched into the conduct of the officer long before the protesters took to the streets. “We already had the information and were already midway with our investigations. We are still into it and we promise prompt action if he is guilty,” Murithi said. A report by the Director of Public Prosecutions Office in Lamu shows Hindi has been leading in defilement cases since 2015.  (edited by o. owino)
