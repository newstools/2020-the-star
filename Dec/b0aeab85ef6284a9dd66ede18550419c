Impeached Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko could know his fate as early as next week when senators convene to consider his ouster by the county assembly. Senate Speaker Kenneth Lusaka said he is consulting Majority Leader Samuel Poghisio and his Minority counterpart James Orengo on when to convene a special sitting to consider the matter. This after received a notification from the Nairobi Speaker Benson Mutura on the assembly's resolution to impeach the embattled county boss. "I have received the notification and the relevant documents. I am now consultation to see if we can convene a special sitting next week because the law requires that we consider this matter within seven days of notification," he said. The Senators broke for a long recess last Tuesday and are expected to resume plenary sittings on February 9, 2021. Some 88 MCAs on Thursday voted to impeach the controversial governor who is battling corruption cases in court. Only two of those who participated voted in favour of Sonko. Sonko is accused of abuse of office, gross violation of the Constitution and gross misconduct. His refusal to assent to the budget was at the centre of the impeachment. S Sonko declined to approve the budget, saying there was no way MCAs could allocate NMS Sh27 billion out of the Sh37.5 billion budget.
