Kenya Women Premier League outfit Kayole Starlets have landed a sponsorship deal with a local firm, Rolling Cargo. The Nairobi-based firm will chip in with transport and food for squad members during the entire 2020/2021 season. Starlets wrapped up the previous season in 12th position and the sponsorship, albeit small, could inject some zest in their quest for their first league title. Starlets head coach Joshua Sakwa expressed gratitude to the firm, saying the deal was a big relief for the side that has been facing serious financial difficulties. "We really appreciate their goodwill. It has become quite rare for sponsors to come on board these days and especially during the Covid-19 period," said Sakwa. The club have had a mixed season in their opening two encounters. The Starlets got off to a flying start with a 4-0 thrashing of neighbours Mathare United at the Stima Club on December 13. Starlets, however, found the going tough in their subsequent tie where they crashed 1-3 to league debutantes Ulinzi Stars at the Utalii grounds on December 20. Sakwa, however, attributes their second poor show to inexperience. "We lost seven key players to our rivals in the last transfer window. We only managed to sign a player from Zetech and another one from Mathare. The rest came from our academy side so you can imagine how inexperienced they still are as far as top flight football is concerned," said Sakwa. Asked how come it is the same squad that shone against Mathare, Sakwa said that at the time they came up against the soldiers, all their players had already returned from a military duty.
