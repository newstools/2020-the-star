Willy Paul is not a happy man folowing the release of his latest album, 'Song of Solomon'. The controversial singer took to his Instagram page to blast fellow artistes for being jealous and hating on each otherâ€™s projects. Pozze said local artistes have not helped him push his project and have remained silent. He said if he were to die artistes would praise him and say he was talented, yet they cannot do that when he is still alive. He told them not to attend his funeral or even post about him when he dies. Willy Paul also sent a shout-out to those who have helped publicise his album. After the rant, one of his followers asked whether he does the same for fellow artists. "Wewe umesupport nani? Ushawahi post album ya artiste mwingine?"
