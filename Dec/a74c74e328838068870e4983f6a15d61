Machakos Senator Boniface Mutinda Kabaka booked a hotel room in Nairobi, ordered food and drinks and was joined by a schoolteacher. He later vomited, collapsed and was rushed to Nairobi Hospital ICU where he is still unconscious after surgery. The schoolteacher, Nthenya Muli, who was at the scene where he collapsed could face attempted murder charges, a Nairobi court was told on Monday. She was ordered detained on Monday for seven days, lest she flees or tries to interfere with the crime scene at the hotel. The senator collapsed on Thursday last week in Kilimani at 3Dee Apartments. Milimani senior resident magistrate David Ndungi agreed to give DCI detectives seven more days to continue detaining Muli. The prosecution told the court Senator Mutinda had driven himself to the apartment-hotel in Kilimani along Elgeyo Marakwet Road in the afternoon. He booked a room where the suspect joined him at about 3pm. The court heard the senator had looked well when he checked in and ordered food and drinks. The magistrate said, "It is necessary to detain the woman who was with the politician at 3Dee Apartments for a while to see if the senator would improve.” The court was told the politician collapsed after he was joined by Ntheya. Food and drinks were served by the staff. The senator was rushed by an ambulance to Nairobi Hospital where he was admitted in ICU. Surgery was performed on December 4 but he is still unconscious. The court was told police are investigating attempted murder. The magistrate said the nature of the offence being investigated might “tempt” Ntheya to flee. He said the fact that the crime scene is a public place means she could interfere with investigations if released. Ndungi said there is a compelling reason to allow police more time to investigate before making any decision. The case will be mentioned on December 14. (Edited by V. Graham)
