Mary J. Breid Cunningham believed it was better to give alms through education than by giving food or money. So the nun, one of the Loreto Sisters, dedicated her life to girls' education. Sister Mary taught in Kenya for 73 years. She died on December 18, aged 99. She was buried at St Austin’s Cemetery on Tuesday after a Requiem Mass at Loreto Convent Msongari Chapel in Nairobi. Born into a family in Northern Ireland, she did her primary and secondary studies in a convent. She later joined the Sisters of Loreto. When she turned 26 in 1947, she came to Kenya to teach. She docked in Mombasa and for the next 73 years, she devoted herself to teaching, especially girls in Catholic schools around the country. An announcement from the Institute of the Blessed Virgin Mary, known as the Loreto Sisters, said: "Sr Mary J. Breid Cunningham went peacefully to God.” She taught in Loreto institutions in Eldoret, Mombasa, at Loreto Valley Road and Loreto Msongari. In an interview published by the sisters in 2018, Cunningham said she taught all subjects. A matron, counsellor, foster mother to her students, class teacher, head of department, she did it all. “Sr Breid will be greatly missed by her Loreto Sisters, family, pupils and friends,” the announcement read. The Loreto Sisters arrived in Kenya in 1921 and will mark their 100 years of presence in the country next year. The Sisters of Loreto website says Sr Cunningham and her colleagues have taught between half a million and a million girls. The exact number is not known. “The pioneer Loreto Sisters educators were all Irish and came here after periods in India and Australia. They started the first school for African girls in East Africa in 1936 in Loreto, Limuru,” the site reads. When the sisters arrived in Kenya, they faced a culture that did not value formal education and rejected girls' education. “They changed [that] culture,” the site reads. (Edited by V. Graham)
