Fearing a possible leak, Nema has directed the Kenya Pipeline Company to rehabilitate its fuel pipeline submerged by flooded Lake Naivasha. An uncontrolled leak would be an environmental disaster. “We have issued an order to KPC to rehabilitate the pipeline and ensure it’s in perfect condition as any leakage would spell doom for this critical lake,” Nema  director in Nakuru Solomon Kihiu said. He said on Tuesday Nema is keenly monitoring the pipeline in vast flooded  Kihoto estate after the lake overflowed, raising fears of a leak. The pipeline is two metres under water. It carries thousands of litres of diesel and other fuel every day. “Since lake levels started rising, we have seen hotels, flower farms, latrines and homes flooded and this could adversely affect the lake,” he said. Pollution from submerged latrines is already a problem. Chairman of the Lake Naivasha Water Resource Users Association Enock Kiminta said water levels were rising by the day. “Water from this lake is very corrosive and we fear it might affect the metal pipes," he said. Kiminta said any major leak could cause an environmental disaster. “The fuel pipeline leaked around Mzima Springs led to a massive environmental disaster last year and we don't want this to happen here,” he said. The Nakuru county government and the state have announced plans to resettle legal landlords whose houses have been flooded by the rising lake in the past few months. (Edited by V. Graham)
