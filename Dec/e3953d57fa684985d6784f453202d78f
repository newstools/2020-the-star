The government has warned of a possible spike in Covid-19 cases during the festive season despite a declining positivity rate in recent days. On Thursday, the Ministry of Health announced the highest number of recoveries in a day, after 11,324 patients were discharged, raising the number of recoveries to 67,788. From the number, 11,177 were from the home-based care programme while 147 were discharged from various hospitals. The ministry noted that the positivity rate has been on a downward trend in the recent days, with the rate now standing at 12 per cent. On Thursday, 1,253 more positive cases were confirmed from a sample size of 10,170, representing a positivity rate of 12.3 per cent. However, the WHO recommendation is that a country registers a positivity rate of five per cent or less for a consecutive period of 14 days to be on the right track. “We have seen for the last several days that although our positivity rate had shot up to very high numbers of 18 to 20 per cent at some point, we have been seeing that positivity rate fall down to levels of about 12 per cent or so,” Health Chief Administrative Secretary Rashid Aman said. “We seem to be on a gradual decline and we hope that we will be able to maintain this. The only challenge that we may face is that we are getting into the festive season and this is a time when the spread of the virus can be accelerated.” He called on Kenyans to be cautious and take personal responsibility by avoiding gatherings. Some 1,200 patients remain admitted in various health facilities with 7,755 on the home-based isolation and care. Seventy-three patients were in the intensive care unit, 31 of whom were on ventilator support and 42 on supplemental oxygen. Another 77 patients were separately on supplemental oxygen out of whom 61 were in the general wards while 16 were in the high dependency unit. Unfortunately,  16 more patients succumbed to the disease, raising the fatality to 1,500.
