I have listened to what the Deputy President has said and the thing is we have already progressed. I think the DP has no idea what’s happening. I think he was making conditions for leading the 'No' camp and he is a coward who doesn’t want to say the truth—that he wants to lead the 'No' campaign. But on our part, we are progressing. We have collected more than four million signatures and we want to present them to the IEBC either on Friday or Monday. The train has already left and it’s far off. The things he was saying are time-barred. He appears uninformed and he needs to come to the BBI secretariat for orientation. The issue about the Bill is done; we are now collecting signatures and going to the IEBC and so forth. To begin with, it’s not a must for Kenyans to listen to his views. Collection of views from Kenyans was done over a period of two years. Was he out of the country? I don’t know why he didn’t go to the group that was collecting Kenyans’ views. Secondly, no one has barred him from initiating his own Constitution review process. If he feels there are important issues he wants to amend that have been left out, let him collect one million signatures and take them to the IEBC so he can also amend the Constitution if he is not contented with the current proposals. But, Kenyans’ views were collected for two years, collated properly and we are now in the signature collection phase. He cannot come today and take us two years back. This is a coward who does not want to say he wants to lead the 'No' camp. If he wants to lead the 'No' camp, let him say so instead of giving too many senseless conditions.
