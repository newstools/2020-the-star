Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang'ula has told ODM leader Raila Odinga to stop his calls for the resignation of IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati. Wetang'ula dismissed calls for Chebukati's resignation as self-centred. "No one should be allowed to choose a referee in a game. Let Chebukati and other IEBC commissioners carry on with their work without any interference," he said. The Bungoma senator said the government should give Chebukati's commission enough money to effectively undertake its role. "He must lead the BBI verification exercise and man the by-elections in Kabuchai and Matungu constituencies without outside forces interference," Wetang'ula said. The senator spoke at Kimaeti Catholic Church in Bumula constituency during a fundraiser. Kiminini MP Chris Wamalwa and his Kimilili counterpart Didmus Barasa were present. "It is just the other day, the BBI signatures were taken to IEBC headquarters for verification and the budget given to them. How then can you ask for their resignation?" Wamalwa asked. Barasa asked Raila to stop undermining the commissioners and let them work independently. "Odinga is not a senior government employee to force anyone to go. IEBC commissioners are doing a good job and they should be left alone," he said. The lawmaker pledged to lead anti-BBI meetings in Bungoma county to ensure it is defeated. "BBI has nothing good for Kenyans. We can't pass it to help a few people who have different problems that should be addressed before it is passed." The legislators' remarks come after Raila took issue with the electoral agency commissioners for demanding 'too much money' for signature verification. "They are demanding too much for the verification of the signatures, they should be content with the little they have been given," he said. The agency was demanding for Sh241 million while the National Treasury has released Sh93.7 million.
