Nyeri county's revenue declined by 12.7 per cent in 2019-20 to Sh525 million from Sh601 million the previous year. Governor Mutahi Kahiga said the shortfall in the revenue was due to the havoc wreaked by the Covid -19 pandemic. “With the outbreak of the pandemic, the county granted several waivers on the market and public service vehicles parking fees, cess and land rates to cushion businesses,” he said. The county expected to receive about Sh9 billion in the 2019-20 financial year to finance its operations. The funds included Sh5.4 billion as equitable share, Sh2.5 billion conditional grants, Sh1 billion own-source revenue. Another Sh1.1 billion was the balance from 2018-19 financial year. The governor said on Wednesday that Nyeri has recorded 966 cases of Covid-19 from a sample of 4,701 translating to a positivity rate of 21 per cent. Thirty-three people have died, translating to a case death rate of 3.4 per cent. Kahiga spoke during the State of the County Address at the assembly. About three weeks ago, Kahiga said he had also suffered from Covid-19, but recovered after undergoing treatment in isolation for about three weeks. The governor told the assembly that his government has undertaken various measures to control the spread of the virus. These steps include the treatment of patients and a Covid-19 fund to help vulnerable families. Senior county officials took a three-month pay cut, with the money sent to the county Covid-19 fund. The county also re-allocated Sh30 million through a supplementary budget to support Covid-19 programmes and give relief to micro, small and medium enterprises. The Health department has spent Sh2.6 billion on recurrent expenditure and Sh108 million on development to boost the health sector's preparedness to fight Covid-19. “This represents 92 per cent absorption of the total budget allocated in the financial year under review translating to 30 per cent of the entire county budget,” Kahiga said.
