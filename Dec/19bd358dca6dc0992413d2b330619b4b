Mathare United women's team head coach Mary Adhiambo has attributed the side's slow start to the season to inexperience. Adhiambo, who also serves as Harambee Starlets assistant coach, says most of her players are of school-going age and making their maiden appearance in top-flight football. "It boils down to inexperience. Most of our players are very young and it's only our captain who is above 25 years," said Adhiambo. The Slum Girls crashed 4-0 to Kayole Starlets at the Stima Members Club on December 15 with Christine Ngoisi and Foscah Nashivandah scoring a goal apiece to cap off a Lesley Were brace as Kayole made clear their intent for the season. Mathare suffered their second straight lose of the season at the hands of Kibera Soccer Ladies who saw them off 2-0 at Stima Club. Adhiambo has, however, challenged her players to try and live up to the billing and blamed their poor run on their strikers' inability to fetch enough goals. Adhiambo says although her midfielders have impressed in the two matches they have played so far, the defenders have collapsed under pressure and the strikers have always proved timid in front of goal. "We will work on our defending; our strikers are creating some chances but not utilising them. We shall work on weaknesses," she added. Mathare have another uphill task ahead of them against Makolanders Ladies at Stima Club on January 9 in Round Three fixtures of Zone A. Adhiambo, however, says she's not under any pressure to mount a challenge for the title in the top tier this season. "We've discussed with the team and agreed that we should concentrate on maintaining our slot in the league first before we can start fighting for a decent finish," she said. The coach also says she is eager to see more of her players donning the national team colours. Although Mathare have produced several high quality players who have landed deals with other top tier clubs, it currently boasts only one national team player, Lucy Akoth among its ranks.
