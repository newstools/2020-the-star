The funeral service for former Chief Justice Evan Gicheru was held at St Francis, Karen, on Thursday. Gicheru, who died on December 25, was 79 years old. He will be buried on Thursday. Gicheru was the longest serving CJ. He served between 2003 until 2011. Former Attorney General Amos Wako reminisced on his early days with Gicheru when they studied at Alliance High School. His first encounter with Gicheru was on January 14, 1960 during Form One admissions. "We were lined up before the renowned educationist Carey Francis," Wako said. During a ritual during parade where Francis would point at a student and he would introduce himself, Wako said he was standing next to Gicheru and was eager to hear his name because he was the "brownest" person he had ever set his eyes on. "I had never seen such a brown person in Western and at the same time he looked very brilliant and serious." When Francis pointed his finger at Gicheru, he said his name was Johnson Evan Murage. The name Gicheru started being used more prominently during registration for exams, where he used his surname. Wako reminisced his peaceful relationship with Gicheru, when they shared a desk. "He was the best desk mate." Wako eulogised Gicheru as a man who distinguished himself as a person who exercised judicial independence. "His proper judicial temperament, integrity and courtesy to all were well known. He was one of the very few judges who were incorruptible and independent," he said.
