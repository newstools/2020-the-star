At least four passengers died on Thursday morning after two vehicles they were travelling in collided head-on. Among them were two secondary school students. The accident occurred near Ringa Primary School in Kipkelion East, Kericho county, on the Kericho-Nakuru highway. The bodies were taken to Kericho Level 4 Hospital mortuary, while survivors were immediately hospitalised. The accident involved a Probox matatu and an X-Trail car, according to Kericho police commander Silas Gichure. The total number of people in the two vehicles could not be immediately established. Gichure said the Probox driver was overtaking another vehicle and in the process collided with an oncoming X-Trail, which was heading towards Nakuru. The wreckage of both vehicles was towed to the Londiani police station. Gichure said the driver of the Probox was speeding and was unqualified. The driver of the X-Trail car escaped soon after the crash and was being sought by the police.
