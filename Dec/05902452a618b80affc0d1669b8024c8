A guard was charged and killed by a buffalo on Tuesday in the vast Kedong Ranch in Naivasha. Ranch operations were temporarily halted. The man managed to kill the buffalo with a panga but he died before he could be rushed to hospital. Wildlife attacks have been increasing in the past few weeks, especially around Hell's Gate and Mt Longonot national parks. The attacks have been attributed to the closure of wildlife corridors, animals' search for pasture and increasing settlements around game parks. The latest attack occurred as the farm guard was walking home through the ranch. Witness John Rokon said the animal seriously injured the man in the chest and back as he struggled to fight it off. His screams brought ranch guards who fired in the air but did not scare the buffalo. “The deceased had a panga that he used to defend himself and in the process he and the wild animal died from injuries,” he said. Rokon said the high number of buffalo roaming the ranch is a threat to residents. And in Mai Mahiu town, a 32-year-old man committed suicide by hanging himself from the third floor of the family house under construction. Resident Joseph Njoroge said the man had been taking  psychiatric medication. “After years of failed treatment, he tied a rope to the roof and took his life," he said. (Edited by V. Graham)
