There was tension on Tuesday during the Dabaso ward by-election following reports of intimidation and voter bribery. Security officers who had been deployed to man the by-election were forced to disperse a crowd that had gathered outside Dabaso Primary School polling centre. Police moved in to disperse the crowd after youths threatened to beat up former MCA Barke Mohamed and two others. Barke left. Trouble started after Kilifi North MP Owen Baya claimed there were youths from Nairobi being used to intimidate voters. Baya said they would not allow anyone to intimidate their candidate and called on the security forces to do their work effectively. Only two candidates are battling for the county assembly seat. The contest is between Dickson Karani of ODM and Emmanuel Changawa of the Movement for Growth and Development. At Mijomboni Primary School polling station, ODM youth coordinator Nyundo Samir almost clashed with Abdulrahman Omar, a former Ganda MCA who is supporting Changawa. "We have heard that there are people dishing out money but let them be warned. If we see them, they will regret," Samir said. Nyundo called on voters in Dabaso ward to vote and go home and wait for the results to be announced. Dabaso ward seat was declared vacant after the court nullified the election of Changawa following a successful petition by Karani. The ward has 12,620 registered voters and 22 polling stations.
