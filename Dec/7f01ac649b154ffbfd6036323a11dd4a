Police have warned of possible heavy traffic today around Kenyatta National Hospital due to the graduation ceremony at the Kenya Medical Training College. Most of the more than 2,000 students are expected to graduate, bringing their relatives and friends to the event hence causing heavy traffic. Police want motorists to avoid the area because the event will have a spiralling effect on other roads. Traffic personnel have been deployed to roads there to direct motorists. More other security personnel have been deployed to address cases of pickpockets and other forms of insecurity. However, it is not certain if the crowd will follow the Covid-19 protocols. The WHO recommends people should wear a mask indoors and outdoors and do a one-metre distancing. Last month, scientists warned there is a 'troubling lack of evidence' that face masks prevent Covid-19 infection. It backs up a major study from Denmark which found they don't protect people who wear them.
