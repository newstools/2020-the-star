A Kisii University professor who was at the heart of a nasty family fight over land has died. In 2014, Thomas Ombuya Omao Getabu was in a family feud involving the division of ancestral land as an inheritance among his siblings by his mother, Bathsheba Mogiti Omao. In a Kisii Environment and Lands court, Getabu, his mother and two siblings sued his sister Julia Kemunto and two non-family parties in the struggle over the land in Nyamira. Court papers showed their mother had evenly divided the land among the siblings but Julia subdivided her portion and sold it so she could buy land and settle elsewhere. This angered the rest of the family, hence, the feud and lawsuit. Julia sold it at Sh3 million, however, the family said she had no right to sell the land as it was still registered the name of Mogiti, the family matriarch, as ancestral land. However, Mogiti, changed her mind in court, withdrawing from the suit, denouncing it and saying she had been misled. Mogiti asserted that she witnessed the sale agreement between Kemunto and her buyer. With this development, professor Getabo and his two siblings remained in the suit as the plaintiffs. The court ruled against them, holding their sister had the right to handle the land as she wished. This was not Getabu's only legal battle. Again, in 2014, he sued Nyamira county government for sacking him, claiming termination was unfair. He sought more than Sh13 million in compensation for lost salary and allowances. He was awarded one year of salary compensation and three months in the notice before sacking. Getabu is survived by his widow Martha-Jane Morangi Ombuya and four children. They are Duke Nyabicha, Lydia Gesare, Dr Job Nchogu and Jared Nyangâ€™au, a student at Meru University. He will be buried on Friday at Mekenene village, Mwongori Settlement Scheme in Nyamira county.
