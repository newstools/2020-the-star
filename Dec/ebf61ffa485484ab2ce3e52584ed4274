A former Kisumu MCA has defended Kibos Sugar Factory, saying the firm has been unfairly targeted with mudslinging. Former Masogo/Nyangoma MCA Samuel Ongou on Wednesday said Kibos has benefitted local communities and that it was time for residents to defend the factory. He said those with issues against the firm should reach out to the management for an amicable solution. Ongou said Kibos Sugar Factory has employed  more than 5,000 people and it would be unwise for leaders to fight such an investment. The former Kisumu county assembly Majority leader asked cane farmers to defend the factory saying it has held the local economy since state-owned Muhoroni Sugar collapsed. Ongou spoke at the Kibos Sugar Factory during the launch of distribution of hand sanitiser to schools with Muhoroni subcounty. The factory intends to supply all the 176 schools in Muhoroni with 17,600 litres of hand sanitiser ahead of reopening in January. The company corporate affairs manager Joyce Opondo said they were doing the distribution as part of their corporate social responsibility. She said each school will receive 100 litres of hand sanitiser. Both public and private schools will benefit. Muhoroni subcounty education official George Keenya said the donation will boost preparations for the full reopening of the schools next year. Keenya said most schools lack the basics to fight the spread of Covid-19.  Edited by P.O
