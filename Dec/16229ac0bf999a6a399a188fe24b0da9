About 30 per cent of children below two years of age are at risk of dying from preventable diseases due to their parentsâ€™ ignorance. According to data from the Health ministry, 68 per cent of mothers took their babies for immunisation in 2018, 72 per cent in 2019 and 67 per cent as at the end of November 2020. Their children are at risk of suffering from preventable diseases such as diphtheria, hepatitis B, rotavirus infection, measles-rubella, tetanus and the flu. Isiolo, Meru and Laikipia have been identified as counties where most mothers do not attend antenatal clinic and do not take babies for immunisation. The factors contributing to this include lack of awareness by some parents, lack of resources to reach residents in far-flung areas and lack of health facilities closer to the people. Meru Health records officer Robert Kanoti said they may not meet their target of immunising 39,964 children below the age of one year in 2020. He said the number of home deliveries had increased to about 38 per cent. Mt Kenya East and West Anglican Church of Kenya representative David Nderitu said the Covid-19 pandemic has worsened the situation. He said Mt Kenya region ACK has partnered with the county assembly and Meru Health department to raise awareness on immunisation in Meru, Isiolo and Laikipia counties. Other factors that hindering immunisation in Meru include poverty and lack of resources, unemployment, lack of enough staff and drugs in hospitals and cultural beliefs. Meru Community Health Strategy coordinator Benjamin Kobia said the county has dispersed at least 3, 000 community health volunteers to assess the situation. Edited by Kiilu Damaris
