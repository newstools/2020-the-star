Deputy President William Ruto on Thursday attended Msambweni MP Feisal Bader's homecoming party. Bader was on Tuesday last week sworn-in as a Member of Parliament days after clinching the seat. The short swearing-in ceremony was presided over by National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi. Bader, who contested as an independent candidate, trounced ODM candidate Omar Boga after garnering 15,251 votes against Omarâ€™s 10,444. The by-election which arose following the death of Dori was seen as a battle between Ruto and ODM leader Raila Odinga. Ruto threw his weight behind Bader after the ruling Jubilee Party announced that it would not field a candidate. This is the first time for the DP to set foot in Msambweni since backing Bader. Bader vowed to support Ruto in his 2022 presidential bid. Bader said Ruto supported him in his hour of need when he wanted political assistance. He said the only thing that he can give back to the community is service to the people and rallying behind Ruto. "I was an orphan but Ruto decided to back me up, I won't forget that and from now on henceforth we will support you, " he said. He spoke at Dr Babla Secondary School ground in Ukunda. Bader said he won't take the win for granted promising to use his power to serve the locals diligently. He narrated his ordeal in ODM, saying he was thrown out. Lunga-Lunga MP Khatib Mwashetani said come next national campaigns the hustler name will reign. Others present were Governor Salim Mvurya, his deputy Fatuma Achani, Lunga-Lunga and Kinango, MPs Khatib Mwashetani and Benjamin Tayari, Nakuru Senator Susan Kihika, Kandara MP Alice Wahome among other national leaders.
