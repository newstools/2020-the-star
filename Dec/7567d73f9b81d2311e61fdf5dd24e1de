President Uhuru Kenyatta has called upon the youth in the society to be at the forefront in cultivating good virtues in the society. Speaking on Monday at the KICC, during the launch of the Kenya ni Mimi Youth initiative, the president said in his opening remarks that youths have been used for many years to cause violence in society. Uhuru said that the youth are the majority in the society and should not wait to be given leadership opportunities, but rather grab them. He said that the BBI will also ensure that the youth as well as the women in the society are included in the leadership. “One of the critical components of the BBI is to ensure that we entrench the law, Bills that will ensure that the youths are adequately catered for. That is why we need the youth policy going out so that we ensure that the youth are the center of any developmental program in our country,” Uhuru said. He added that, “That is why we are saying we want our young people also involved in the decision-making bodies all the way from the County Assembly to the National Assembly “Please, avoid being the people depending on handouts. From the leaders…instead, be able to confront your leaders and tell them what you need to be helped with in order to create your handouts," he continued. Uhuru said that by doing so, youths will be in a position to stop gender-based violence and FGM in society. The president added that the gender-based violence in the country has increased since the pandemic. He also challenged youths to lead in fighting FGM by using the applications, where they will notify the authorities who will take the action.
