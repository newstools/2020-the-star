Attorney General Kihara Kariuki has been directed to respond within 14 days to an advisory opinion on BBI filed by Nandi and Kericho county assemblies at the Supreme Court. In a virtual court session, the Supreme Court deputy registrar enjoined the AG in the matter that was filed last week. The two county assemblies petitioned the Supreme Court seeking an opinion on the planned BBI referendum. The apex court has given the AG 14 days to respond to the reference letter by the MCAs from the two counties. Thirdway Alliance has applied to be enjoined in the case as an intervener and the court has allowed any other person who wants to be enjoined in the matter to make such applications. The case will be mentioned on December 16. The MCAs want an opinion on questions relating to approval of a constitutional amendment bill by county assemblies among other matters. "The first question concerns whether county assemblies are obliged to conduct public participation when considering a bill to amend the Constitution through popular initiative," the statement reads. The assemblies want to know whether MCAs will be allowed to amend the bill to "align with their contribution as well as to incorporate views received from the public during public participation." They also sought to know whether the passage of the bill requires a simple majority, two-thirds or other method of determination. On Monday, Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana also wrote a letter seeking an advisory on the same issues. Kibwana wants the Supreme Court to advise whether a bill containing a proposed amendment to the Constitution should be limited to an amendment of a single issue. He wants the court to advise whether national or county government or state officers can be promoters of a popular initiative and whether it is constitutionally acceptable for a state officer to use public resources to finance and seek support to amend the Constitution.
