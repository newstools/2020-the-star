Governor Wycliffe Oparanya has told Kakamega residents not wait to read the whole BBI document so they can append their signatures because he has read it for them. “I don’t want to see people coming here telling my people to go and read the document. Why did you choose me?" he asked. "If I gave you old mamas a document of over 200 pages, will you read, finish and make a decision? You chose me to lead and direct you and I know this is good for all of us." "I just urge you to append your signature and when voting comes vote in support of the BBI,” Oparanya said. The governor spoke on Monday in Bukhungu Stadium during the launch of BBI signature drive. He asked the national and county government officers to spearhead the process of collecting BBI signatures in the county. The county chief said the two levels of government are working together to ensure the success of the process, which he termed "transformative" for the country. "Assistant chiefs and ward administrators will be at the forefront of the process of collecting signatures," Oparanya said. He urged residents to support the process because it will help more resources trickle down to devolved units to spur economic growth in health, agriculture and education. "I appended my signature to support the BBI. I urge all Kenyans to sign to enable us to reach one million signatures." He said with the Constituency Development Fund, the Ward Development Fund and the resources allocated to counties, growth will reach the grassroots. "If BBI is fully implemented it will improve healthcare, agriculture sector and the education sector. To support this, every Kenyan should sign up and vote for BBI," Oparanya said.
