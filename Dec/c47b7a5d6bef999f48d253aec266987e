Former Tetu MP Ndung'u Gethenji has failed to appear in court for the second time to take plea in a forgery case. Gethenji was expected to plead to the charges on Tuesday, but he told the court through his lawyer Ishmael Nyaribo that he is mourning his mother-in-law. “My client is bereaved as he lost his mother-in-law. We are seeking the court to defer the plea to December 14 and allow him time to mourn the death of his mother,” Nyaribo told the court. The matter came up for mention before Milimani chief magistrate Martha Mutuku. The prosecution, however, opposed the application for deferral, saying the accused should plead to the charges. The prosecution said that the last time the matter was mentioned, the MP said he had been exposed a Covid-19 patient. His legal team has yet to supply the court with any supporting documents. “When the counsel addressed the court virtually in the morning, this issue was not addressed and we expected the accused to be in court today,” the prosecution said. However, Mutuku deferred plea taking to December 14 and directed that Gethenji produces documents to prove that his mother-in-law is dead. Two weeks ago, the ex-MP’s plea-taking was deferred after his lawyer said he was in isolation and is taking precautionary measures against Covid-19. "He is willing to abide by the DPPs directions," the lawyer said. According to the charge sheet, Gethenji, with intent to deceive forged minutes of a meeting held by Kihingo Village (Waridi Gardens) Management One Limited. He allegedly committed the offence on November 21, 2018, in Nairobi.
