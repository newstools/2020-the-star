The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission on Wednesday came under fire after publishing an erroneous tweet. The polls agency, while announcing the launch of signatures backing the proposed amendments to the Constitution, used the phrase ‘burning bridges’. “Happening now: The launch of the Burning Bridges Initiative Supporters Verification Exercise at the Bomas of Kenya,” the tweet read. The tweet, which was part of a thread, was hurriedly deleted, but not without the attention of Twitter users who took screenshots of the same. The error elicited reactions from among users, some expressing their ire at the commission and accusing it of showing signs of not backing the BBI process. ODM political affairs secretary Opiyo Wandayi said: Here are other reactions: Some tweeps called for the disbandment of the electoral commission, saying the tweet could be surmised as an indirect attack targeting President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga. The two are behind the Building Bridges Initiative, which followed their March 8, 2018 handshake that ended the tension of the 2017 polls. During the launch of the verification of BBI signatures, the IEBC said 400 clerks hired for the process have taken their oath of secrecy and would begin the exercise immediately "The 400 clerks who were recruited for the exercise have taken their oath of secrecy and will begin their training shortly," IEBC said via Twitter. IEBC  called for applications for the posts of signature verification clerks on December 19.
