Deputy President William Ruto now says the country is broke. The DP said the country is facing a financial crisis and the country has been forced to negotiate rescheduling of the due loans with lenders like IMF. "In a situation where the country is in a financial crisis, we are in the middle of a pandemic...." Ruto said in an interview with Citizen TV on Thursday night. The DP said there is no hurry to amend the constitution at a time when the country is hit with the coronavirus pandemic. Ruto said he doesn't want the country to travel the path of 2005 referendum that triggered tribal tensions. He said the president, being the symbol of national unity, has no luxury to run a divisive referendum. "Let us have a multiple choice to do away with the contest of us vs them," he said. He added, "We have discussed that whatever it takes, we will not just allow a divided country..." Ruto insisted that he has no conditions to the president but will do whatever it takes to have a consensus-driven referendum. Ruto has defended his push to restore the 47 woman representatives in the National Assembly. "Instead of nominating a whole 100 women, why can't we allow the woman representatives to be elected and brought back to the National Assembly?" "After the elections we can now discuss nominations which can be less than 50. It is good for women to be elected rather than being nominated.
