Western leaders have warned of tough times ahead owing to delays in disbursing money to counties and huge public debt. Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong, ANC Leader Musalia Mudavadi, Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli, Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa, Busia Senator Amos Wako and a host of MPs raised the red flag during a fundraiser at St Stephen's ACK Church Busia. Ojaamong said operations in the county government have been paralysed due to delays in releasing funds to counties. â€œThe last disbursement to counties was in August," he said. He told Atwoli to talk to health workers planning to go on strike to rescind their decision and adopt dialogue. Mudavadi urged religious leaders to offer special prayers for the country to overcome the challenges it's facing. Eugene urged Western leaders to unite. "If we speak in one voice, we shall be heard."
