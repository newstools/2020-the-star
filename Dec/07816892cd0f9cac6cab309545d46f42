The United States seeks to advance its national security and economic prosperity interests by helping strengthen economic stability, security, health, education, environment, rule of law, and democratic governance in Kenya, as well as by countering violent extremism and combatting wildlife trafficking. As part of U.S. global leadership, the United States is supporting Kenya’s efforts to contain the COVID-19 pandemic through training and research, equipment, testing, and supporting health, water, sanitation, education, employment, and food security needs.
