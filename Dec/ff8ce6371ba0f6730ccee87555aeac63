Squatters living on Mazrui Trust Land in Kilifi are increasingly getting anxious over the delay in surveying and adjudication of the 4,319 acres, a lobby has said. Haki Yetu Organisation on Wednesday said residents have been patiently waiting for the government to honour its pledge to resettle 1,300 squatters in Kilifi county in 2020. Haki Yetu executive director Father Gabriel Dolan said in a statement that although President Uhuru Kenyatta’s plan to resolve land issues in the Coast region is commendable, the pace at which it is being done is creating doubts. He wants the President to give residents title deeds as Christmas gifts. The government’s Rapid Response Initiative had said it intended to issue at least 90,000 title deeds to squatters in the coastal region by the end of 2020. Out of these, Kilifi county was to get at least 23,000 title deeds. Father Dolan said, “The community within the Mazrui Trust Land is still seeking information on how far the Rapid Response Initiative has gone in issuing the 23,000 title deeds by the end of 2020. In which areas in Kilifi county are the 23,000 title deeds likely to be issued?” The Catholic priest said it was important that the government provides updates on the steps it has taken in the initiative. He said the Building Bridges Initiative, which Uhuru and his handshake partner Raila Odinga are pushing for, has not mentioned land issues. “That was the main concern of the people of the Coast when they submitted their views to the task force. Will the President address these issues as a Christmas gift, as time is running out on his promises?” Father Dolan asked.
