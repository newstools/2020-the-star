The Kiambu government has started a crackdown on unlicensed liquor outlets. Subcounty administrator Selina Muriithi said the crackdown, which started in Juja on Tuesday, will also weed out those violating the Alcoholic Drinks Control Act and Covid-19 protocols. She said the county government will shut down all outlets that have not acquired the 2020 operating licences and kick out of business those violating Covid-19 protocols. Muriithi said those operating without proper licences should stop immediately and wait until January to apply. “All illegal wines and spirits joints will be closed and the same fate will be handed to operators selling liquor before or after the stipulated hours,” the administrator said. Muriithi spoke to bar owners and liquor outlet operators in Witeithie. “If you are operating a wines and spirits outlet that is selling its product apiece, kindly stop. Only wholesale operators selling bulk products will be allowed to do business,” the administrator told the operators. Witeithie senior chief Muchui Muiruri and OCS Martin Murimi said they will not relent in enforcing the presidential order on the sale and consumption of alcohol. Some operators have welcomed the crackdown, saying illegal outlets that have mushroomed in the area are giving them unfair competition. “This is a great initiative that will level the ground of doing business and ensure that our businesses thrive amid the pandemic. Legitimate operators have been adhering to all rules and regulations set for the sale and consumption of brews, but their business is being tainted by the infiltration of illegal operators,” operator James Wakahiu said. Area MCA Julius Macharia urged the government to look for ways of cushioning bar operators who have been adversely affected by Covid-19. “Most of these operators have been driven out of business,” he said.
