Nyamira Governor Amos Nyaribo has pledged to speed up the construction of Manga Stadium. The construction which started six years ago stalled last year. “Manga Stadium is one of the county's flagship projects which I intend to complete in the two years I will be in office,” he said when he was sworn in on Tuesday at Nyamira Primary School grounds. Gusii sports legends director Alfred Momanyi welcomed the new governor’s resolve and appealed to him to allocate funds for development of sports. Speaking on phone, Momanyi said: “As sports stakeholders, we are happy that the new governor has pledged to complete the construction of Manga Stadium. It is disheartening that in Nyamira County, we don’t have a running track.” He said Kiendege, Nyamaiya, Magwagwa and Ensoko should equally have murram running  tracks . “Nyamira is an athletics power house but due to neglect, the region is no longer producing athletes. I want to make a special appeal to Nyaribo to allocate funds for sports development,” said Momanyi who founded the first athletics camp in Nyamira. The veteran coach said Gusii sports legends — a group that brings together retired and active athletes— is willing to work with the county government of Nyamira and Kisii to revive athletics. “Next year, we plan to meet Governor Nyaribo and his Kisii counterpart James Ongwae because we want to partner with the counties in reviving athletics,” added Momanyi. The legends have been organising and sponsoring annual cross country events at Getacho, Kebirichi and Kebabe. However, this year, the events were were not held due to the coronavirus pandemic. Momanyi is confident  the events will be held next year.
