Rice farmers in Wamumu ward in Mwea, Kirinyaga county, have expressed fears of losing their harvest due to the poor state of roads to their farms. The farmers accuse the National Irrigation Authority and the county government of failing to deal with the situation. They have threatened to stop paying the licence fee of Sh3,000 per acre of rice, should the roads not be improved. Their complaints come months after the irrigation authority entered a partnership with the county government to rehabilitate roads within the rice-growing areas. Stanley Munene, one of the farmers at the W3 section, said he pays much more to transport rice to his home. He says farmers who are financially constrained have to carry their produce on their backs. “I’m forced to hire a tractor to carry the harvested produce as the donkey cart cannot pass through the murky paddy. From Sh100 per sack that we pay as transport cost, now I have to give Sh300 or Sh500 per sack due to the bad state of the roads,” he said. Edited by Henry Makori
