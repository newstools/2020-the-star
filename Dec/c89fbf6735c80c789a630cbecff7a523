World 800m bronze medalist Ferguson Rotich might have come late into athletics but he is not thinking of quitting any time soon. Rotich, who started his running career at 23 is optimistic of bringing an Olympic Games medal for next year's Tokyo Olympics. Speaking in his home county of Kericho, Rotich said his consistency has put his name above all else and that he has some unfinished business in the two-lap race will surprise his doubters. “I started my running career as a young boy in school, competing in high jump and 4x400m relays just for fun. But after failing to get an opportunity to further my studies after completing high school in 2010, I decided to take up athletics seriously and joined a camp that nurtured my talent,” said Rotich. In the short term, Rotich said his eyes are set on a medal at the delayed Olympic Games. “Next on my agenda is an Olympic medal in Tokyo next year. I want to do something great before switching to another discipline,” he added. He said he wants to be like his mentor, world 800m record holder David Rudisha. Rotich was part of the Kenyan relay team that won the 800m relay title at the inaugural World Relays Championships in the Bahamas in 2014 alongside Sammy Kirongo, Jacob Kinyor and Alfred Kipketer. In his first Olympics in 2016 in Rio, Rotich said he was in top shape but encountered small problems that affected his mental awareness and thus failing to medal. “I did not win but I was so happy that the title was won by a Kenyan, Rudisha,” he said. “I thank God for the gift he gave me. I also believe in myself especially while training and that is why I have been consistent for long.”
