The Vihiga government says plans to achieve a 10 per cent county forest cover by 2022. Environment chief officer Richard Boiyo assured that they are on course to realise the target. "We are engaging various stakeholders in the county to help us achieve this,” Boiyo told the Star by phone. “Some of the stakeholders we are engaging are the communities around the forests. We are educating them on the importance of preserving these forests." They are partnering with Equity Bank, middle colleges, the Kenya Wildlife Service and the Kenya Forest Service. Boiyo spoke after leading a tree-planting drive organised by Equity Bank Mbale branch. He urged residents to make a habit of planting trees. The value and purpose of trees are vast and their existence is vital for our survival, he said. The county has put in place measures to promote sound environmental conservation. Equity Mbale branch manager Jane Ogutu said the exercise is part of a countrywide initiative by the bank to plant 35 million trees in marking its 35th anniversary.
