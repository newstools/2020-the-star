A boda boda rider has been sentenced to life imprisonment after he was found guilty of defiling a minor in Karachuonyo, Homa Bay county. Kevin Omondi Otieno, 22, was convicted by the Oyugis law court after he was accused of defiling a 10-year-old girl at Kamwania sub-location in Karachuonyo. The convict committed the offence on December 4, 2019. Four witnesses who testified narrated how the rider lured the minor who was his passenger during the time the offense was committed. Otieno was found guilty on Wednesday by senior resident magistrate Celesa Okore. The rider was also found to have committed an indecent act with the minor where he intentionally and unlawfully touched her private parts. In delivering the judgment, Okore said the evidence produced before the court proved beyond reasonable doubt that Otieno defiled the girl. The accused person pleaded with the court to allow him serve the sentence under probation saying he lost his mother while still in remand and would wish to witness where she was buried. He was taken to Homa Bay prison. The court gave the convict 14 days to appeal.
