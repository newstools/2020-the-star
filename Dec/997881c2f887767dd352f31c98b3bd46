Veteran coach Bob Oyugi has warned the Football Kenya Federation of taking the game on a downward spiral after years of small gains made, particularly the confidence of sponsors. Singling out the decision by FKF to bar Mathare United and Zoo Kericho from the top flight league, the former Harambee Stars and Gor Mahia tactician noted that with the current trend, sponsors will cease investing in small clubs. “We have seen what the rise of Zoo Kericho to the Premier League has done for the development of football in Kericho and the surrounding counties. With clubs sponsored by sugar milling counties falling away, it is the support of counties that would have been relied upon. However, with the current situation, it does not bode well for the future of small clubs,” Oyugi reckoned. The Kefoca secretary challenged the FKF National Executive Committee led by Nick Mwendwa to let clubs in on the details of contracts signed on their behalf. “The trend worldwide is clubs are managing their own leagues with the blessing of the federation not vice versa. Being a young man, Nick should be at the forefront of modernising our game not taking it back,” he charged. The youth development tactician further scoffed at the decision by the federation to bar certain media houses from attending league matches. “It’s not only unconstitutional but also signals there is something amiss that FKF want to keep away from the public eye. It’s time authorities and stakeholders intervened,” he concluded.
