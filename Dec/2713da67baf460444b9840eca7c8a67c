The Nyandarua administration has set up an agency to promote trade and coordinate investments. The Trade Development and Investment Authority will also advise on policies, programmes and plans to attract investors. The authority will help expand existing economic and industrial ventures within the county and provide capital and training to businesses. The administration hopes the agency’s work will help create jobs and boost Nyandarua’s economy. Nyandarua Governor Francis Kimemia said the agency will help the county enter into partnerships with the private sector to invest there. “This now paves the way for much-awaited public-private investment partnerships. It will facilitate local and international investors to engage in business within the county,” Kimemia said. He spoke at the county headquarters on Thursday during the swearing in of a five-member board which will manage the authority. The members are Maina Gitura (chair), Mary Nyambura, James Mwai, Joyce Nderitu, and James Gichuhi. The team was sworn in by Justice Charles Kariuki who is based in Nyandarua. "We want to do things professionally and that is why we have appointed a team of experts to manage the new office. We want to encourage more people and companies to invest here. This way, we will have more funds collected locally as well as providing jobs for our people" he said. Kimemia said that the county has signed multi-billion-shilling agreements with local and international investors interested in afforestation and climate change-related programmes. Others will take up urbanisation programmes to make Magumu Market in Kinangop a commercial hub. Another group of investors is interested in agriculture and agro-processing industries. The authority will oversee the investments. Kimemia called on the authority to encourage more investors in the agriculture sector as Nyandarua is an agricultural hub with thriving potato and milk sub-sectors.  (edited by o. owino)
