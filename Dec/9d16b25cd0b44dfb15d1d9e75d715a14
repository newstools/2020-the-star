The BBI ignored governors' demands for pensions for second-term county bosses who will leave office in 2022. Governor Alex Tolgos of Elgeyo Marakwet said the pension plan was  bypassed in the BBI report, now a Bill likely to go to a referendum. Public servants' pension plans are not considered a constitutional issue. "As second-term governors, we wanted pensions included in the BBI recommendations so we benefit after retiring but that was not possible," Tolgos said. Governors back BBI because of its benefits to people and devolution - it calls for increased allocations of 35 per cent - not for personal gain, he said. “There are many other benefits for the country and there is always another chance for improvements," Tolgos said. He is the chairman of the BBI drive in Rift Valley. Tolgos is among the majority of North Rift governors who are serving their second and final terms. Others are Jackson Mandago of Uasin Gishu, Josphat Nanok  of Turkana and Patrick Khaemba of Trans Nzoia. Tolgos said counties will benefit from BBI's recommendation for increased funding. He said though BBI did not adopt some issues proposed by governors, the document will improve the 2010 Constitution to serve Kenyans better. Meanwhile Governor Mandago of Uasin Gishu, businessman Bundotich Kiprop Buzeki and Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi pledged to ensure peace and unity between communities prevails despite political differences. “We all have to value peace and reject anyone who may want to cause animosity or chaos here in Uasin Gishu or elsewhere," Buzeki said.
