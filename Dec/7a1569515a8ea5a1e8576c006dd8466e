A Labour Court has suspended Egerton University Council's decision to send the institution's Vice-Chancellor Rose Mwonya on terminal leave. Justice Hellen Wasilwa sitting in a Nakuru court suspended a letter by the council that purported to send Mwonya on leave with directions to hand her role as VC to professor Isaac Kibwage. The letter is dated November 13 this year. Mwonya through Senior Counsel Otiende Amollo told the court that decision to send her on premature terminal leave was unlawful. "The council is determined to hound me out of the office without any regard to their illegal actions," she says. On May 2019, Justice Monica Mbaru delivered a judgement suspending a letter dated September 7, 2018 issued to Mwonya. The court in that judgement held that the council had no jurisdiction to purport to conduct disciplinary proceedings over her on grounds that the proper appointing authority was the Cabinet Secretary for Education. The decision of the court effectively reinstated Mwonya as the VC of the university. The council being aggrieved challenged the decision which is currently pending at the Court of Appeal.
