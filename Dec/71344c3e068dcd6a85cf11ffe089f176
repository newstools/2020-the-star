The Garissa administration has commenced a 21-day clean-up of the town's major streets and a sensitisation drive of residents on proper waste management practices. Workers will desilt storm drainages, collect garbage, clear bushes and remove debris from the pavements of the main roads. Urban Planning county executive Abdi Omar called on the community to have a greater sense of civic pride in their local environment. Omar encouraged the residents to dispose of litter responsibly. “This exercise is part of our efforts to keep Garissa municipality clean and instil the habit of good sanitation practices among the citizens,” he said during the clean-up. Omar also issued a one-week ultimatum to owners of stray livestock to take their animals off the streets or risk heavy penalties. “The owners of stray cattle have a week to take them off the streets or risk paying hefty fines for the release of their animals from our holding grounds,” he said. He said his department would take measures against those who will not comply with the directive. The directive follows complaints from traders in Garissa town that goats, donkeys and cows roaming the streets destroyed their wares. Small-scale traders last week urged the national and county governments to take action against owners of hundreds of livestock roaming in town and market. They said they have been incurring huge losses as livestock eat their vegetables and fruits. Garissa municipality CEO Abdinoor Ole Hussein criticised the littering of garbage in the open and emphasised the need for proper waste disposal to promote a clean and safe environment. “We cannot do this task alone, let us work together to make our town clean at all times,” he said.
