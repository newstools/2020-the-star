Keroche heiress Anerlisa Muigai says the death of her sister Tecra taught her to live a free life. Tecra died in May from head injuries after falling off the stairs of a private house in Lamu, where she was staying with her boyfriend Omar Lali. "Love harder and live life as life is too short...so short it scares me. Let no one tell you how to live," Anerlisa posted on Instagram. "If you wake up and feel like you want to drive from Nairobi to Kampala, do so. If you feel like switching off your phone, do so. If you want to go to the gym at midnight, do so." As long as you are not breaking rules, express whatever you want, she said. "Let no one tell you how to act, what to post or how to behave."
