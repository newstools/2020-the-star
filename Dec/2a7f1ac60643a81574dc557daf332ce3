What is in a name? Well, for Salome Kiende, a name is everything and no one should take advantage to ride on the popularity of a name. That is why she has asked a court to block a former partner from using ‘Chez Sonia’ in her wine business. Salome had reserved the name ‘Chez Sonia Limited’ for purposes of registering her company. The company, according to court documents, was incorporated to carry out operations as a wine club and registered, with Salome as the sole director. The popular wine club is located along Peponi Road. Salome has under Chez Sonia Limited sued Sonia Mansioui, Ernesto Gonzalez and Esther Muthoni. Mansioui was initially the consenting partner in trade of the company with the common objective to steer it up. But Mansioui and Salome fell out. Salome claims Mansioui colluded with Gonzalez and Muthoni and unlawfully caused a trademark to be registered in the name of ‘Chez Sonia’ without her company's consent. The three allegedly opened a similar business and with similar functions under the trademark Chez Sonia. “As a consequence of registering and publishing the name Chez Sonia, the three caused confusion to prospective customers of my company as to who truly runs and owns Chez Sonia Limited and Chez Sonia within the same market in Nairobi,” Salome says. Salome wants the court to restrain Mansioui, Gonzalez and Muthoni from using the name. Also sought is general damages for infringement of the company’s intellectual property rights. Salome says she has suffered loss and damage for infringement of the trade name. "Mansioui, Gonzalez, Muthoni as a consequence have collectively and unwittingly enticed customers to go to Chez Sonia thinking it belongs to Chez Sonia Limited as a result of which the latter has suffered loss and damage for infringement of the trade name,” she says.
