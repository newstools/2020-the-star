Nandi county has launched its own youth service that is very similar to the National Youth Service. The first group of 600 young people has already graduated from Nandi County Youth Service (NCYS) training at Kaimosi College. The core mandate of the NCYS is to construct and maintain roads, sewers and drains, provide cleaning and painting services, mechanical and welding works, among other tasks. Governor Stephen Sang said training of the young men and women will help solve unemployment and related problems due to the Covid-19 pandemic. NCYS equips youths with life and employment skills and will enhance their contribution to community development, he said. The programme will keep youth from being idle and engaging in  immoral and illegal activities, such as crime, substance abuse and illicit sex, the governor said. Creation of the service is line with the Nandi County Service Act passed in September 2018 by the assembly. “The youths have been given hands-on skills enabling them to be self-employed and contribute to community development," Sang said when he commissioned the graduating young people on December 4. He said youth are a major labour source and they will be able to take advantage of jobs in Nandi and elsewhere. Sang said the service will also offer young people avenues for education and places in vocational training centres. (Edited by V. Graham)
