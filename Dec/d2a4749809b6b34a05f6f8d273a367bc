HIV prevalence in Busia dropped from  7.7 per cent in 2018 to 6.7 per cent in 2020, Deputy Governor Moses Mulomi has said. In a speech read by Health chief officer Isaac Omeri at Amukura in Teso South subcounty, Mulomi said  women, however, continue to bear the brunt of the HIV epidemic. He said women constitute 9.5 per cent of cases compared to 3.8 per cent of men. “We have so far managed to identify 86 per cent of people living with HIV out of a target of 90 per cent. Eighty-five per cent of people living with HIV and are on ARVs have suppressed the virus,” the deputy governor said. Mulomi attributed this to non-disclosure of HIV status, food insecurity, illiteracy and high levels of stigma. He said mother-to-child transmission has also dropped from 13.1 per cent in 2018 to 9.7 per cent this year. The county government, he said, has laid down strategies to support couples who are HIV positive to curb mother-to-child transmission. County Aids and STI coordinator Constance Were said new infections had reduced from 1,601 in 2018 to 905 in 2020. She said failure to adhere to guidelines on taking drugs and commercial sex work at the Busia and Malaba border points were among factors that have contributed to HIV infections. Teso South deputy commissioner Willy Cheboi appealed to residents to adhere to the preventive measures for Covid-19 and HIV-Aids. Edited by A.N
