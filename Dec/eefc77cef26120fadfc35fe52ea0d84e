The national government is partnering with counties to promote domestic tourism, Tourism Chief Administrative Secretary Joseph Boinnet has said. He said since March, there has been a sharp decline in the number of tourists visiting the country. Boinnet said there were many opportunities that needed to be exploited in the counties. He urged county governments to build the capacity of their staff so they can help market their areas. Boinnet said the ministry is developing strategies and policies to enable  counties market their products in their regions as a way of encouraging inter-county travel. "We have all along depended on foreign tourists, but we want to partner with the counties so that we can market whatever resources we have in our regions," the CAS said. "We want to see residents from one region visiting another county. What we have in Mombasa cannot be found in Bomet." He spoke in Siongiroi, Chepalungu, when he launched the rehabilitation of Chepalungu forest for wildlife conservation. The CAS also toured Kipsigis Highlands Tea Factory. The county seeks to promote agritourism. Bomet Governor Hillary Barchok said they want to move away from traditional wildlife tourism where Kenyans are used to visiting parks to see animals. “We are partnering with the Tourism ministry in the production, processing and packaging of our tea as a tourist attraction,” he said.
