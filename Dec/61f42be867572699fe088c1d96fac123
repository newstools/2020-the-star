In September, residents of Alaru in Karachuonyo constituency were going about their business when four electricity poles suddenly collapsed, and the lights went out. Since then businesses that rely on electricity have been crippled as residents wait for Kenya Power to act. It's been more than two months. Kenya Power cites the ongoing rains and the area's loose soil for the delay in repairs. Meanwhile, pregnant women going for antenatal clinic at Alaru dispensary are being turned away and babies cannot be immunised as vaccines require cold storage. Resident Vivian Adhiambo said prenatal and postnatal services are no longer being offered at the dispensary. “Women are being referred to the other health facilities where there is power,” she said. The power outage has also affected government institutions. The management of Alaru Secondary School, for instance, says it is unable to print or photocopy learning materials. They have to go to cybercafes in other areas. “We are spending extra money on printing at cybercafes. The school has been forced to have a budget for the emergency,” principal Daniel Mayaka said. He appealed to Kenya power to restore electricity. In the neighbouring Alaru Primary School, Grade 4 pupils who should be using digital literacy programme gadgets are having to do without them. Head teacher Lilian Ayugi said they have no way of recharging the gadgets. “Pupils are being taught theoretically. It is hard for them to understand what they are learning without seeing the same practically,” she said. Edited by Josephine M. Mayuya
