Two minors who were abducted in Nairobi on Saturday have been rescued and a house help arrested at Busia border by DCI detectives. According to DCI on Twitter, the children aged eight and four years had been left under the custody of their house girl - 32-year-old Scovia Namataka. Coordinated efforts between Buruburu’s detectives and their counterparts at Busia border led to the interception of the suspect with the minors in a bus which was headed to Kampala. Preliminary investigations revealed that the offence was committed while the children's parents had travelled to Meru to attend a kin’s burial.
