Kenyans trust the media more than the government, a new report has shown. The ‘State of the Media 2020’ report shows that trust in the media rose from 94 per cent in 2019 to 97 per cent in 2020, with TV and radio being the most preferred sources of news. The report was released by the Media Council of Kenya at Sawela Lodge in Naivasha on Friday. In a survey carried out by Infotrak Research and Consulting, more than 3,000 people interviewed on the performance of the media. MCK chief executive David Omwoyo said when the government restricted movement into and out of some counties, the media played a crucial role in disseminating information, mainly to those who could not access the internet. “This research calls on media owners to invest more in newsrooms as Kenyans have shown where their trust and source of information is,” he said. Council chairman Maina Muiruri said the pandemic brought the media to its knees, with a drop in revenue leading to the loss of jobs and salary cuts. He was, however, optimistic that things would change in the coming months.
