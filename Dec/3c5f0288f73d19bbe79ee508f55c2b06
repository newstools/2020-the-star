Nairobians have been urged to stay away from traveling upcountry to avoid spreading coronavirus to elderly parents. Government Spokesperson Cyrus Oguna said we should approach the festive season, with the true meaning of being each other’s keeper. “Let us wear our masks, wash hands regularly, sanitize, avoid crowded areas and adhere to the public transport capacity guidelines,” said Oguna. He spoke during a media briefing on Locust Invasion and Government Response, among other issues of national importance at the Kenyatta International Convention Center. “I know we love our parents very much, and I ask our brothers and sisters that as we approach Christmas and we want to buy them gifts. Let us buy our parents the gift of not visiting them, if you truly love them,” he said. He said this may sound a bit insensitive but it the reality of the times we are in. “You can send something to them using other means, if you really love your parents, do not visit them during this situation. The situation is real out there and we know what it can do if our parents are attacked by it. Stay away until the situation normalizes. I appeal to our young people in urban centers to stay way,” Oguna concluded.
