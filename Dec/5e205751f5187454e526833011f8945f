Private hospitals in Embu county have since Monday been doing a booming business as nurses and clinical officers strike continues to hurt services in public facilities. Public hospitals have for the past three days been deserted and only a few patients who are not aware of the strike have been visiting. They are turned away by security guards. Kenya National Union of Nurses (KNUN) branch secretary Joseph Ngwasi and Kenya Union of Clinical Officers Embu branch chairman Nthiga Njoka said health workers would only resume work after their demands are met. The medics are complaining about delayed salaries, unremitted statutory deductions and lack of promotions. They also want payment of risk allowances to all nurses and clinical officers, provision of PPE, completion of their 2017 CBA and a comprehensive medical cover.
