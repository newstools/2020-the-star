Newcastle United manager Steve Bruce praised his players for stepping up to the plate after battling through a COVID-19 outbreak at the club as they beat struggling visitors West Bromwich Albion 2-1 in the Premier League on Saturday. Goals from Miguel Almiron and Dwight Gayle pushed Newcastle up to 11th in the standings after a testing two weeks in which the club’s training ground was closed after several players and staff were stricken by the novel coronavirus. Bruce said the virus had “knocked Isaac Hayden to hell” but the midfielder played the full 90 minutes in a centre back role in Newcastle’s new-look back line which had regular defenders Jamaal Lascelles and Federico Fernandez also missing. “We tried to play it down and we weren’t looking for any excuses but they’ve stuck together. I think we finished with three midfielders in the back four,” Bruce told reporters. “I couldn’t be more pleased. With the problems we’ve had, the work they’ve done at home or parks or whatever — I couldn’t speak highly enough of them. Their effort and endeavour was spot on. I can’t give enough credit to the players and staff, and certainly the medical department. The decision to shut us down was absolutely spot on.” West Brom remain second-bottom and manager Slaven Bilic said it was hard to take another league defeat — their eighth of the season — despite a stronger second half in which their attack showed some promise and Darnell Furlong equalised. “(Newcastle) were stronger, better on second balls, kept the ball better — especially up front,” Bilic admitted. “After 1-1 it was an open game... and we conceded a goal in the moment when we changed shape to stop their crosses. It was very good in the second half, very encouraging, but the result is not there.”
