Principal secretaries Nelson Marwa (Social Protection) and Francis Owino (Industrialisation) are leading the BBI signature collection drives in Migori, crisscrossing the region to market the initiative. Marwa on Wednesday said they were keen on educating residents to help them realise the propaganda being peddled by politicians opposed to the drive. Marwa hails from Kuria East constituency while Owino comes from Uriri subcounty. The two senior state officers said they intended to campaign in all the region's eight subcounties. They launched the campaign on Friday last week. On Wednesday, they were in Ntimaru town in Kuria East subcounty. They are leading the drive alongside county commissioner Boaz Cherutich. “We have actively moved across Migori to help educate the public against propaganda which is being peddled in the area especially among the Kuria community to go against the drive,” Marwa said. He said response from residents has been overwhelming and that the agenda to change the Constitution through a referendum was making good progress. Marwa took a swipe against MPs Marwa Kitayama (Kuria East) and Mathias Robi (Kuria West) who have vowed to lead the Kuria community against BBI for denying the community a county. The MPs wanted the Kuria region carved out of Migori to become an autonomous devolved unit. “We have leaders using CDF money to incite residents. We live in a democratic country, but using youths to disrupt a legitimate process will be dealt with firmly,” Marwa said. Owino said the BBI report and the handshake between President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga was meant to create peace and allow development to take root. Owino said the document has been generated by experts after looking at the trends of divisions during and after general elections that often leave Kenyans divided. “The handshake helped bring peace in Kenya especially in Migori which faced the brunt of post-election violence,” he said.
