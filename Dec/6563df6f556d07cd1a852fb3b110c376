Former Citizen TV news anchor Hussein Mohamed has refuted claims he has joined Mediamax-owned K24 TV. This is after a poster went viral suggesting Hussein was joining K24, hours after 'Punchline' show host Anne Kiguta announced her resignation. In a tweet, Hussein rubbished the poster, saying it should be treated as fake news. The poster had the image of Hussein Mohamed and was written ‘Coming Soon’ with a logo of K24 TV. "Please treat this as fake. You’ll hear it from me soon enough whether or not I’ll be coming back to TV or any other platform. Mafans ninawapenda wo…wote!" he wrote on Twitter. Hussein started offering consultancy services and is part of a project funded by the US government through the USAid since October this year.
