Four passengers have died following a road accident involving a matatu along Mombasa-Malindi Road on Monday morning. According to police, the Matatu rolled several times landing into a sisal plantation in Timboni area, Kilifi county. All four died on the spot and their bodies were taken to the Kilifi Hospital mortuary. Six more people have been admitted at the hospital with serious injuries. Kilifi South deputy sub-county police commander Paul Otieno said it's not clear what might have caused the accident since the matatu didn’t collide with another vehicle. “We are calling upon drivers to use recommended speed during this festive season. Let them be sober so that we can avoid losing passengers lives,” Otieno told the Star on phone on Monday. He called on passengers to avoid boarding overloaded vehicles. “If that Matatu had more passengers, maybe the fatalities would have been more. We are calling both drivers and passengers to follow the law,” he said. On March this year, a crash involving a lorry and a passenger Matatu killed 13 people at Shauri Moyo area along the same road. Statistics show road accidents go up during the festive seasons as vehicle operators are tempted to break the law and cash in on the season. Last week, police and NTSA launched joint impromptu road inspections to nab law breakers.
