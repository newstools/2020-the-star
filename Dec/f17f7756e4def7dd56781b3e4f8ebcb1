Interior CS Fred Matiang'i has called for use of community persuasion mechanisms in fighting radicalisation. He held a meeting on Monday with National Government Administration OfficersÂ  from Kwale county at the Kenya School of Government (KSG), Matuga. The CS told the administrators to increase the war on drugs in the area to help the youth. Matiang'i also asked the administrators to be vigilant especially as the election season approaches for groups which might be out to radicalise youths. "Besides investing in youth empowerment, GoK is tapping into new insights to complement its strategy on countering violent extremism," Matiang'i said. The CS has told the National Government Administration Officers in Kwale to push more community-level initiatives, especially persuasion, in fighting radicalisation of youth.
