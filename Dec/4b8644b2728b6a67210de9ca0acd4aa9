Students of Lugulu Girls High School in Bungoma county on Tuesday held demonstrations to protest against alleged defilement of a student. They said a student was defiled on Saturday morning in a school bathroom as she was taking a shower before morning preps. The 306 students, who carried placards, walked six kilometres from Lugulu to Webuye police station demanding the immediate arrest of the perpetrator. They said the victim woke up as usual to go take a shower when an unidentified man pounced on her, covered her mouth using his hand to stop her from calling for help and defiled her. She was rescued by a fellow student. The man fled. Addressing the press at Webuye police station, the students said they were unhappy that the school had not taken any action. Efforts to contact school principal Dinnah Cheruiyot for comment were unsuccessful as she did not pick up calls or respond to text messages. School guards barred journalists from entering the institution's compound. "We have instructions not to allow you [journalists] in. Kindly talk to our bosses," a guard said County quality education assurance Caleb Omondi pleaded with the students to return to school as the matter was being addressed. He promised that the perpetrator would soon be arrested since police have been involved. "We want you all to be calm and go back to school and continue with your studies since Lugulu is one of the schools that is highly respected by the community," he said. Bungoma East police boss Valerian Obore asked the students who witnessed the case to present evidence and witness statements to police. A parent condemned the incident and called for speedy probe into the matter.
