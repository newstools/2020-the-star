A man who has been serving a life sentence after he was convicted of defiling his daughter 10 years ago has been freed on Sh30,000 bail. Julius Wambua will be retried following a Machakos High Court ruling on Wednesday. Justice George Odunga ruled that the man be released on Sh30,000 cash bail pending trial. “The case should begin afresh and sentences by the Kithimani court and High Court be quashed,” Odunga ruled. Odunga said that Wambua was deemed an innocent person hence there were no compelling reasons to deny him bond. This reprieve comes after the man’s story was aired on Citizen TV’s segment Prison Diaries in March 2019, when his daughter Dorcas Wambua recanted her evidence alleging that she was coached by her mother to fix him for personal gain. Wambua was jailed at Kamiti Maximum Prison in 2011 and his case closed. He, however, challenged his conviction last year after the daughter revealed that he was fixed by her mother. Dorcas said her mother forced her to testify against her father. The High Court in June ordered for Wambua’s retrial leading to his release from prison on bail. There were claims that when Wambua separated with his wife in 2007, she left the home leaving the husband with both their daughters. It emerged that the two differed over a parcel of land, what is said to be the reason why the wife fixed him.
