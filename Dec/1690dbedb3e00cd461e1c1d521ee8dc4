A woman who allegedly hired hit men to murder her husband has been arrested. Isaiah Ndwiga is alive after the hired men alerted him but lied to the wife that they had eliminated him. Florence Wanja hired the men to kill her husband after promising them Sh20,000 and gave them  Sh10,000 down payment. A Runyenjes court ordered that Wanja be held at the Runyenjes police station for five days before being arraigned for plea taking pending completion of investigation. Sergeant Samuel Onyamasi sought 14 days to have Wanja be held to enable him to collect and record statements of witnesses. Runyenjes senior principal magistrate Pamela Njiru granted police five days. Onyamasi told the court that the accused who is a trader allegedly hired some men to murder her husband who is a successful dairy farmer for unknown reasons. The officer revealed that the hit men and the complainant negotiated before he faked his death by giving them his clothes on November 29. He said the hit men allegedly handed the complainant’s clothes to the woman as prove they had accomplished their mission before she paid them the balance. The detective said the complainant reported the matter to the Runyenjes police station on December 1. Edited by Kiilu Damaris
