Kenya Women Premier League defending champions Vihiga Queens will play for maximum points when they take on Wadadia at Mumias Complex on Sunday. Queens’ coach Alex Alumira, however, does not expect the girls to be totally fit owing to lack of action in the last 10 months but he believes their experience will get the job done. “It will be a tough match against a familiar opponent and I expect the girls to rise to the occasion. The girls aren’t 100 per cent fit but we still play to win. We know Wadadia inside out and they are not an easy opponent,” said Alumira. His Wadadia counterpart Rashid Sumba said the team is working to improve on their defensive record. Last season, Wadadia conceded 57 goals in 28 matches to finish eighth in the standings. “We have to play well defensively if we are to get a result. Our backline was porous last season and we are trying to fix it. I believe the girls will give a good account of themselves.” Elsewhere in Zone ‘A’, Trans Nzoia Falcons host Eldoret Falcons in Kitale, Kisumu Starlets tackle Sep Oyugis  at Moi Stadium, Kisumu while newbies Nakuru West Queens entertain Oserian Ladies.
