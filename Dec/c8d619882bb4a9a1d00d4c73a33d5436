Mwingi West MP Charles Nguna has expressed disappointment with the slow pace in attaining the 10 per cent forest cover. Nguna urged Kenyans to plant more trees and to be more vigilant to ensure the set target is met by 2022. “The forest cover is still very low and I call upon leaders to support locals to plant more trees for nature is so unforgiving once destroyed,” Nguna said. President Uhuru Kenyatta’s administration issued a ban on logging as tree planting campaigns kicked off to increase the country’s forest cover from seven to 10 per cent by 2022. While opening the third annual One Planet Summit a year ago, Uhuru said deforestation has hit Kenya hard as its effects have interfered with the country's  economy. Nguna said during this rainy season, he is distributing over 50,000 tree seedlings to his constituents. “The seedlings are in our offices and can be picked by locals from there,” he added. He also urged residents to plant trees in all government facilities including hospitals, dispensaries, schools, market places, and even at homes.
