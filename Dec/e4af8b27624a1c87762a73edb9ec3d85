The High Court has been asked to quash the appointment of Yusuf Mbuno as NG-CDF Board chief executive officer. Petitioner Sam Kinyua says the man is ineligible for the position and ought not to have been given the job. Kinyua says in suit papers that the fact that Mbuno served in that office since 2011 for eight years disqualifies him from being given the job again. He says the law allows one to serve for only three years renewable once, but this seems to have been ignored in the case of Mbuno. Kinyua claims there has been suspected haemorrhage of public funds under Mbuno’s care, a situation he adds hurts the public interest. “There are serious audit queries tied to his term of service in that, for example, in an auditor general report dated August 24, 2017, the whereabouts of a sum of Sh1.8 billion under his watch could not be traced/accounted for…,” the suit papers read. He has sued Mbuno, the National Government-Constituency Development Fund Board, the attorney-general, the Treasury CS and the National Assembly. He says the CS recommended the name despite knowing that Mbuno is ineligible. The name was taken to Parliament for vetting and was approved. Mbuno’s position gives him the power to oversee billions of shillings allocated to the 290 constituencies every year. Since 2003-04, the fund has supported projects mainly under education, health, agriculture, roads, security, sports and other national government residual functions. The board is also mandated to consider project proposals submitted by constituencies, approve funding for proposals that are consistent with the law and send funds to constituency accounts with respect to approved projects.
