A Nigerian man and a Kenyan woman sentenced to 15 years each in jail for having Sh6.3 million narcotics will continue to serve their terms. They lost their appeal. Nnamdi Egesimba and Leila Muli were convicted of narcotics trafficking. They were ordered to pay fines of Sh18 million each or serve 15 years in jail. They couldn't pay the fines. They appealed the trial court decision, which was dismissed in 2019 by the High Court. They appealed to the Appeal Court. In a judgment delivered on December 4, the judges ruled there was no evidence presented, even in defence, to show the value of the drugs was less because of its purity level. Judges Martha Koome, Daniel Musinga and Fatuma Sichale dismissed the appeal, saying it had no justification. They saw no reason to interfere with lower courts' decisions. â€œOn the severity of sentence, both courts were alive to the fact the Act provides for life sentences, but sentenced the appellants to 15 years," the court ruled. The lower courts exercised discretion, the judges said. "Accordingly, we find no merit in this appeal which we dismiss and uphold the sentences imposed by the two courts below, "the judges ruled. The two were charged in 2016 with trafficking 2,121 grams of heroin with a street value of Sh6,363,8780. (Edited by V. Graham)
