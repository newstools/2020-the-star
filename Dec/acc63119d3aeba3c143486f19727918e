Sliders treasurer Nancy Kibogong is anticipating a change of fortunes in the new Kenya Hockey Union Women’s Premier League season after receiving playing kit from Betway. The betting firm donated jerseys, hockey Sticks,  balls and goalkeeper's kit to the club. Sliders, who are largely made up of veterans,  narrowly survived relegation last year after finishing two places above the red-line but Kibogong believes the new partnership will breathe new life into plans. Hockey is among the sports disciplines which are yet to get the government's approval to resume their activities. Kibogong, who is also an active player at the club, was flanked by the club’s team manager Anne Onyango and a host of players during the ceremony held in Lavington. “We are glad to have an international brand such as Betway come to our rescue. This will help boost the morale of the team as women sports in Kenya doesn't receive as much support as our male counterparts. We are confident there is going to be positive change in the sport and for our players. The sponsorship will inspire us to fight for the trophy," she said Besides giving the trophy a shot, Kibogong revealed plans to beef up the squad with younger players. She was, however, non-committal on the number of recruits they hope to sign. “We have not been playing for almost a year and I will not be surprised if a number of our players decide to hang up their hockey sticks and carry on with life.I think with this partnership, we may attract good players,” she said The firm’s Betway public relations executive Karen Njerenga reiterated their commitment in supporting women’s activities as part of their Corporate Social Responsibility activities. The betting firm signed a deal with Tennis Kenya last month and also renewed their shirt sponsorship deal with Kariobangi Sharks for one year a week ago. Sliders were founded in February 1991 by a group of ladies with a vision to promote high level field hockey in Kenya from the grassroots.
