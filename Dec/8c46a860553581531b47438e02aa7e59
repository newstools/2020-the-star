Diamond Platnumz’s rumoured girlfriend, Kenyan-based UK model Patricia Aika, says she is not in a romantic relationship with the Bongo star. Speaking during an interview with Tanzanian blogger Millard Ayo, the model said she had never met Diamond in person. Diamond had posted a photo of Patricia on Instagram, leading to speculation she was his new catch. Patricia explained she was the one who requested him to do so as a favour. "Diamond was just giving me a shout out because I had asked him. It was more like a favour to me, nothing more. Talking, not that much, just hello, how are you? So no, I don’t have any relationship with Diamond and have never met him in person." Diamond later pulled down the photo and did not comment about it.
