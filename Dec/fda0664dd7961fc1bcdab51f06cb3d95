Music lovers will be treated to a 'Tis the Season' album with 10 carols served with a sprinkle of Kenyan flavour to usher in the Christmas season. It will be released as part of the annual Christmas concert directed by Atemi Oyungu and Eric Wainaina since 2013 to celebrate the season in an authentically Kenyan way. The album will feature Atemi, Eric Wainaina, Wyre, Kagwe Mungai, Bien of Sauti Sol, Wambura Mitaru, Mayonde and Lisa Oduor Noah. "We've taken the music we listened to growing up and given it our own flavour. It is going deeper into who we are," performing artiste Elsaphan Njora said. The first song, "Yesu amezaliwa (Do You See What I See)," is already out, featuring Atemi, Eric Wainaina, Bien-Aime Baraza, Wyre and Wambura Mitaru.
