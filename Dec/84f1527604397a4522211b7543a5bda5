Prosecution has asked a court to reject an application by an accused person to have his firearm and other seized items handed back. Hirji Ramji Patel is accused of attempting to extort Sh10 million from a businessman. He is senior operations manager of Astrol Aviation at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport. Patel says since his tools of trade were confiscated he has been unable to discharge his duty as an employee. But senior state prosecutor Kennedy Panyako on Friday told trial magistrate Kennedy Cheruiyot that all the items, including the firearm, which police confiscated will be used as exhibits. He told the court that Patel was found in possession of military jackets and other government property that the prosecution believes he obtained unlawfully. The items include walkie talkies, a Ceska pistol, two empty magazines for a Ceska pistol and one firearm certificate for Patel. But patel, through layer David Oyatta, says the items do not form part of the charges against him. His vehicle was towed to Nairobi DCIO headquarters. Panyako, however, said prosecution intends to amend the charge sheet before the hearing of the case. Patel has denied attempting to extort Sh10 million from Pareshkumar Keshhavji Dodhia in return for helping him to have an alleged assault case by Dimple Sumariya dismissed. He has also denied being in possession of bhang and government stores. He is accused of being in possession of government stores, namely one smoke military jacket, one pair of handcuffs and one bulletproof vest. The prosecution alleges Patel was found with 27 rolls of marijuana with a street value of Sh2,160 on Parklands Road, Westlands, on July 27. The magistrate will give his ruling on December 23.
