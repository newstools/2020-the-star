Deputy President William Ruto has challenged Kenyans to look forward to a year of rebuilding and restoration. In his new year message to Kenyans on Thursday, Ruto asked Kenyans to seize more chances and make up for everything lost moment. The DP said that 2020 has been a year in which the country's normalcy was shattered, hearts are broken, strength tested and our faith tried. "...but also the year we learnt the power of hope, solidarity, and the tremendous resilience inside each of us. In 2020, our vision has been trained to seek opportunity in the chaos, to see light in the dark," Ruto said. He added that "It is my hope and prayer that, with the lessons we have learnt and our now sharpened capabilities, the worst is well behind us." Ruto has also asked Kenyans to work hard and to do their best to define the new year as a moment of rebirth, and a time to shed the old ways. "...adjust our plans, align our priorities, and embrace new possibilities in making our lives, our communities, and our nation more prosperous, secure and joyful than ever before." He continued: "With courage, faith, hope, and love, let us enter the New Year, marching boldly towards a blessed destiny, in the name of Almighty God our creator and protector." Earlier on, President Uhuru Kenyatta had conveyed his New Year Message to Kenyans. Uhuru asked Kenyans to build back better. The president reminded Kenyans that the dawn of a new year is not just a calendar event that marks the passage of time. "It symbolises transition, renewed hope, new opportunities, and limitless possibilities. A New Year brings with it the chance for rebirth, renewal as well as restoration," Uhuru said.
