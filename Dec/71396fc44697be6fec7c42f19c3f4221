More than 400 teachers living with HIV in Machakos have urged the national and the county governments to supply them with septrin supplements and other anti-retroviral drugs. The teachers said there had been a shortage of septrin since the Covid-19 pandemic broke out. They spoke in Machakos a day after the World Aids Day celebrations. The chair said the teachers are at risk of getting other opportunistic infections.  They urged the government to treat their request as urgent. "Currently we are facing a challenge in our clinics because we have not been supplied with septrin. We only get the ARVs which leaves us prone to getting other infections," the chair said. "The septrins are important because they prevent opportunistic infections," the chair said. Machakos Health executive Ancient Kituku said the cutting of US PEPFAR funding was to blame for the shortage. The government of outgoing US President Donald Trump cut funds to HIV programmes in Kenya.
