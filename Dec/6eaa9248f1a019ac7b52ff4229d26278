Two pastors on Tuesday denied robbing their landlord of Sh370,000 from a fundraiser and a Sh25,000 wristwatch. The two - Benson Muiruri Mucheru of the House of Encounter Chapel and Joseph Zacharia Iyadi of African Transformers Youth Association -  were charged before Kibera senior principal magistrate Charles Mwaniki. They called the charges malicious. The charge sheet indicates they committed the offence on March 2, 2018, at the complainant's house in Karen, Nairobi. The police report said the complainant, Geoffrey Ngatia Njoroge,  had been dropped off at his house by a friend at about 11pm. It said the two pastors and their associates confronted him as he alighted at the rear door of the house. They are alleged to have taken him inside his house to discuss money and a commotion ensued. Njoroge said he was robbed of Sh370,000 he had received at a fundraiser. The two were released on bond of Sh600,000 each with surety of a similar amount. The case will be mentioned on January 11 next year. (Edited by V. Graham)
