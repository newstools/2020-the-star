Singer Akothee's first daughter Vesha Okello on Wednesday graduated from Strathmore University, and that made her a proud and fulfilled mother. To celebrate her, the single mother of five threw an invite-only party attended by her loved ones and fellow celebrities. These included Bahati, Lilian Muli, PLO Lumumba and MC Jessy. It was a white-themed affair that took place at Villa Rosa Kempinski. At some point, as the festivities were ongoing, Akothee took the mic and blasted the guests for being self-absorbed. "When I am invited to an event, I do what has taken me there. If it is taking photos, I walk in, I get invited, I sit down, I take a few photos then I put down my phone,” she said. “When you start chatting with people who are not in this event you are a disgrace to yourself. I’m sorry it would have been better for you to stay outside than bringing shame to yourself." Adding, "When you look at yourself on YouTube, you will realise the whole time your head was down, people are clapping and listening, you are doing totally nothing. If you wanted to come here and take photos with them, come by yourself." Akothee also congratulated her daughter, saying she has been a well-behaved child. She also revealed that her daughter was entitled to an upkeep of Sh150,000 per month. "School fees per year was Sh400,000 and upkeep per month totalled Sh150,000. It means if I did not have Sh2.2 million a year, Vesha would not go to school," she said. Akothee said as a proud single mother of five, the only achievement is educating her children and giving them the best. "I sold my soul to see my children grow and get the best. I did everything I could to see them succeed." Okello, who fathered the singer’s three daughters, attended the event. He was dressed in all white, as per the party’s dress code, and he looked great. He was all smiles throughout the party and at some point, took to the dance floor to dance with his daughter. Edited by T Jalio
