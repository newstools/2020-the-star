Tanzanian singer Diamond Platnumz new hit 'Waah', featuring legendary Congolese musician Koffi Olomide, has taken the Internet by a storm after garnering over 2 million views in less than 24 hours. Diamond used the song to address haters who have been trolling his 'lovers': "Wapenzi wangu, kwani yanawahusu, shape yake mbaya, hivi inawahusu? Wapenzi wangu kuparty, kwani ninawahusu?" His baby mamas Tanasha and Zari have been trolled over their bodies. In one instance, Tanasha reacted, "Oh, she is ugly, oh her boobs are sagging, she doesn't have nice legs, she doesn't have a nice waist, oh she has a small ass, but let me tell you one thing, he still loves me." Zari also hit back, "I’m the one putting on weight, you are the one who is having a headache, I don’t understand, how?" Edited by T Jalio
