A Kenyan-born man Billy Chemirmir  has been handed three new capital murder charges in the US. Chemirmir 48, was charged with killing at least 22 elderly women and stealing their jewellery and valuables in Dallas, Texas last year. According to Dallas news, Chemirmir has now been charged with 17 counts of capital murder and two counts of attempted capital murder in Dallas and Collin counties. He has also been linked in seven other deaths, bringing the total to 24 deaths in North Texas. The new charges against Chemirmir, are in the deaths of Joyce Abramowitz, Doris Wasserman and Margaret White. All three were killed at The Tradition-Prestonwood, a luxury senior living complex in Dallas, and all had been previously identified as possible victims through civil lawsuits against the complex. Abramowitz died in July 2016. In April, she reported to police that several pieces of jewelry had been stolen from her jewelry box while she was on vacation. Wasserman died in December 2017.  White died in August 2016. The executor of her estate, Paul Wright, noticed her apartment was missing her fine jewelry — including a wedding ring. Chemirmir's lawyer, Phillip Hayes, said that a lot of the evidence against Chemirmir is circumstantial, Dallas news reported. “It seems like every unexplained death they come up with, they’re pinning on him,” Hayes said.
