The Busia government has partnered with AMPATH to support Bunyala residents to enrol in the National Hospital Insurance Fund. Deputy Governor Moses Mulomi said the introduction of the health project will require cooperation of the local community. Mulomi spoke on Sunday at St Jude Sirimba Catholic Church in Bunyala North ward during a funds drive towards construction of a primary school. He assured residents that the county government will avail drugs to all health facilities in Bunyala subcounty. On Covid-19, Mulomi urged residents to strictly adhere to the Ministry of Health directives, saying the pandemic is real. Meanwhile, Busia Woman Rep Florence Mutua has expressed concerns that the county did not get an additional constituency in the BBI proposals . "Some constituencies in this county are too large and I had expected the Building Bridges Initiative to create at least one more constituency in Busia," she said. On flooding in Budalang'i, Mutua urged the national government to resettle those displaced.
