Kenyan international Michael Olunga was on Tuesday named the Most Valuable Player in the Meiji Yasuda J-League. This development comes a couple of days after the forward bagged the Golden Boot Award after netting 28 times in 34 league matches for Kashiwa Reysol, with all but one of these goals coming from open play. His last goal on the final day of the league season, didn't save Kashiwa from a 2-3 home defeat to Kawasaki Frontale. The 26-year old centre-forward had targeted 30 goals. “The expectation for 30 goals is based on hard work and as a result, goals are born. It’s only a matter of time.” Brazilians Everaldo and Leandro Perreira came  second and third on the scoring charts  with 18 and 15 goals respectively. Olunga, who was elated with his performance, took to his social media account to express gratitude to his teammates and fans. "Firstly, I want to thank God for this opportunity and blessings throughout this season. Also, the collective effort from myself , my teammates, the entire Kashiwa Reysol fraternity and fans who helped me  realise my dream. For this, I am grateful," he said. "I hope this is the beginning of more achievements in my career," added an excited Olunga.
