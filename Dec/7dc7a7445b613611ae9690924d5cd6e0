Police in Mombasa are holding two suspects in connection with the death of a man over gambling money in Kisauni. Two groups of youths clashed on Sunday night in Kadzandani area after disagreeing on how to share Sh15,000 gambling cash that one group had won. According to the police, the losing group broke into the house of the winners by cutting through the roof. This led to a fight in which one person died and three were left with deep wounds. On Tuesday, Kisauni subcounty police boss Peter Maluki said they had started investigating the case and there would be a crackdown on illegal gambling dens in the area. “This is illegal, but you know they operate in hiding. We will find out and put to an end the vice,” he told the Star. He said two people in custody are helping the police with investigations. “You know its holiday time and people want money. We have been having peace, and we won’t allow them to derail our efforts,” Maluki said. Edited by A.N
