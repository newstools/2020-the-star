Detectives have launched probe after a senior cop and his wife were found dead at their house in Lungalunga, Kwale, on Sunday. Inspector Tonik Oloo was found dead in a pool of blood together with his wife Lucy Atieno at their house at the Lungalunga Police Station police lines. Oloo served at the Critical Infrastructure Police Unit. Both bodies had gunshot wounds, according to the reports which added that a pistol and three spend cartridges were recovered from the scene. Area sub county police commander Peter Nzimbi said the officer was in jovial moods while at work yesterday. He said that the two have left one child. "He was all okay we are not sure might have happened. He didn't show any signs of stress. Sometimes it's difficult to know domestic wrangles of a couple," Nzimbi told the Star on phone on Sunday. The deceased officer's wife ran a shop at the police lines premises. Bodies were removed to Kinango sub county hospital mortuary awaiting autopsy.
