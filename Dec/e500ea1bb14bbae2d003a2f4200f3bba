High court judge Justice Agrey Muchelule and Homa Bay Town MP Peter Kaluma have urged the national government to obey court orders to avoid constitutional lawlessness in Kenya. Speaking on Tuesday during the burial of Kaluma’s grandmother Jennifer Akeyo in Ndiru village Homabay, the two said the Executive arm of the government has on visible occasions interfered with the independence of the Judiciary. Justice Muchelule said failure by the executive to implement court orders had denied many Kenyans justice. He said such trends jeopardize the independence of the Judiciary and should not be allowed to continue in Kenya. The Judge said the rule of law should be respected by everybody in Kenya. “The independence of the judiciary should not be negotiable because Kenya is governed by the rule of law. Let’s uphold the rule of law as stipulated in the constitution,” Muchelule said. The leaders said the government should be a role model in the enforcement of court orders to prevent anarchy in Kenya Homa Bay town MP, who is also the vicechair of the constitutional implementation oversight committee in the National Assembly said there are many cases where people file petitions in parliament to express their grievances after the government failed to implement court orders issued in their favour. “It should not be a tussle between the Judiciary and any other arm of the government for the orders to be enforced,” he said. He urged Attorney General Kihara Kairiuki to ensure court orders are implemented. Kaluma said the Executive should provide the Judiciary with funds as a way of exercising independence of the Judiciary. “The interference emanated from failure to remit funds to the Judiciary and failure to appoint new judges,” he said. The legislator said it is wrong for the executive to hold budgetary allocations meant for the Judiciary.  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
