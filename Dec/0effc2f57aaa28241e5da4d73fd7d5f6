ICT CS Joe Mucheru has appointed former IEBC chief executive Ezra Chiloba as a member of the Youth Enterprise Development Fund board for three years. Chiloba was in 2018 sacked as chief executive officer. IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati had twice suspended Chiloba, citing procurement malpractices ahead of the August and October 2017 elections. At the time, Chiloba said the outcome of his disciplinary process was predetermined and the process was a mere formality. Chiloba warned that the issues he faced will affect the next officer if not addressed. He said the matter of his disciplinary process revealed a major governance crisis at the electoral agency. In August, former IEBC commissioner Roselyn Akombe claimed Chiloba had threatened her to shut up over Chris Msando's murder. Akombe, had revealed that Msando, the commission's slain ICT manager, was led to “the slaughterhouse” by IEBC insiders. She said she was willing to testify at an inquest if there is one, and likened the killers to Judas Iscariot.
