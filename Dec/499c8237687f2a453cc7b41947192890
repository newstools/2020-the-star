Three people riding on a bodaboda were on Tuesday morning killed when they rammed into an oncoming bus, some two kilometres from Garissa town on the Garissa-Nairobi highway. The three, a rider and two passengers all died on the spot during the 10 am accident. The motorcycle was extensively damaged. According to an eye witness, the bodaboda rider was trying to overtake a Probox both headed to Garissa town at Corner Punda, but when he realized the bus was too close, he tried to slow down but it was too late. “The rider who was speeding had just overtaken the Probox, he then tried to turn to his side but hit the car and was thrown into the bus lane hitting it head-on,” said the witness who requested anonymity. A police officer also collaborated the eyewitness accounts accusing the bodaboda of overspending and recklessness. “Although the bus was over speeding, had the bodaboda rider slowed down and allowed the Probox to overtake the bus, this accident could not have happened,” said the officer. The Probox later sped off from the scene. By the time of going to the press, the owner of the car had not been identified. The accident that attracted hundreds of curious onlookers from Garissa and the neighbouring Mororo, led to a huge traffic snarl-up with police having a hectic time controlling the crowd. At one point angry and bodaboda riders threatened to burn down the bus christened Ambasa that was headed to Nairobi. The police together with a few elders from Madogo however managed to contain the situation. The bodies of the deceased who could not immediately be identified were taken to the Garissa Referral Hospital mortuary.
