President Uhuru Kenyatta on Friday signed into law the Sectional Properties and Statute Law (Miscellaneous Amendments) bills into law. The new Sectional Properties Act, 2019 provides for the division of buildings into units to be owned by individual proprietors among other elaborate provisions. It repeals the Sectional Properties Act of 1987. The Statute Law Act, 2020 amends 21 statutes among them the Interpretation and General Provisions Act, Records Disposal Act, Penal Code, Public Holidays Act and Firearms Act. Other laws amended by the new law are the Official Secrets Act, Kenya Roads Board Act, Statistics Act, Employment Act, Accountants Act, Judicial Service Act, Kenya National Commission on Human Rights Act, Employment and Labour Relations Court Act, Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission Act, and National Police Service Commission Act. Also amended are the Public Appointments (Parliamentary Approval) Act, Universities Act, Kenya Law Reform Commission Act, Investment and Financial Analysts Act, Witness Protection Act and Kenya Coast Guard Act. The bills were presented to the president for signature at State House, Nairobi by Solicitor General Ken Ogeto in the presence of Speaker of the National Assembly Justin Muturi, Attorney General Paul Kihara Kariuki, Head of Public Service Dr Joseph Kinyua and State House Deputy Chief of Staff Njee Muturi. In October, the High Court nullified 23 bills that were passed by the National Assembly without involving the Senate. A three-judge bench ruled that the Speaker of the National Assembly must involve his Senate counterpart. “The impugned acts are in contravention of Article 96, 109, 110, 111, 112 and 113 of the Constitution and are therefore unconstitutional, null and void,” the judges ruled. Some of the bills affected include the Computer Cyber Crime Act and Finance Act 2018.
