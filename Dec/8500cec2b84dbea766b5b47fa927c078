Taita Taveta artiste B-Classic has come from far, rising from a street child to a successful musician. Speaking to Word Is on Friday, the singer said, "I have been in the industry since 2016 but this is the year people have known me." "Last year, I had given up on music. It was because of financial problems. Before that I had been living in the streets," he said. "My mother was chased away from home so she went back to Tanzania, where she was born. My step mother also chased me. That is how I ended up in the streets." Adding, "You are told not to pay bad with bad, so right now I speak to my dad and his wife and I didn't revenge, and God has opened a way for me." He is currently making headlines with the song 'Ukinigusa' featuring Tanzanian singer Gigy Money, who is also his girlfriend. "It's a song that came to me when I was on vacation with my girlfriend. I told her about it and we got into studio and did justice to the song. I always want my video to be quality. That is why we flew to Mombasa to do the video." He also has another notable collabo, "Call me baby", featuring Nadia Mukami, and is set to do a another collabo with Tanzanian Marioo. The Champions studio-signed artiste is following in the footseps of WCB's Rayvanny. "I have been following him since his debut song. I love his scriptwriting, the melodies and flow and his work ethic," B Classic said. He promises his fans to give bigger and better songs next year. "Until people have completely known me, I will not sleep. I want to become one of the most-sought-after artistes not only in Kenya but in East Africa."
