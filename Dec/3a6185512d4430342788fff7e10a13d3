Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago says he wants to be a full-time peace worker after his term ends in 2022. He said on Saturday since he can't run again for governor - BBI didn't recommend more than two terms - he won't run for a county elective seat in 2022. Some observers speculate the two-term county boss might run for Senate or the MP seat for his Soy constituency. Speaking at a funeral in Kesses, Mandago said instead of continuing in politics, he will focus on ensuring peace and unity between communities in Uasin Gishu and elsewhere. Uasin Gishu was one of the counties worst hit by the 2007-08 post-election violence. “Since BBI didn't accept scrapping term limits for governors, after I end my term I will be free because I won't have other work," Mandago said. He said while others will vie for political positions, he will ensure those who may want to cause poll chaos are dealt with. “Those who will be vying for seats will do so but I will work on peace," Mandago said. He urged Kenyans not to have political sentiments that can cause bitterness and violence in defence of leaders they support. “The leaders we fight for many times meet and dine together," Mandago said. Kenyans have seen President Uhuru Kenyatta, Deputy President William Ruto and even ODM leader Raila Odinga together laughing, while their backers harbour bitter feelings, he said. “We learn not to take them seriously when they play politics," the governor said. Mandago has pledged to complete all the projects he started before his term ends. He is a staunch supporter of President Kenyatta. (Edited by V. Graham)
