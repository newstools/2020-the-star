The Media Council of Kenya has gone digital in accrediting its members. The move which will be effective immediately will strictly be provided through the new online self-service portal. In a statement on Wednesday, MCK CEO David Omwoyo said the the online service will ease the council’s earlier models of applications which were being received by email and hard copy formats. Omwoyo has asked the new applicants to ensure that they do upload the required copies of documents needed for the accreditation process. He said the accreditation will be offered to journalists who meet the accreditation requirements as stated in the Accreditation Guidelines. Omwoyo further said that the Special Media Passes issued by the council will be invalid from December 31, 2020. “Journalists holding the SMPs and those with the expired cards are requested to make fresh applications for the year 2021,” Omwoyo said. In July, the council extended the validation of SMs to December 31, 2020. The extension was to allow the movement of non-journalists press staff during the curfew hours. SMPs had been issued to the essential employees working in the media industry including deejays and drivers.
