Nondies have bolstered their squad by signing five players ahead of the 2020/21 Kenya Cup season. Kenya Sevens utility back Daniel Taabu have joined from Mwamba as is Impala duo of Samuel Motari and Kelvin Kanyiri. The others are Charles Omondi from Homeboyz and Brian Simiyu from Northern Suburbs. Head coach Willis Ojal expressed delight with the signings but was guarded in his expectations for the new season. "Yes, I'm delighted with the new crop who have come in but I need to see them on the pitch in competitive situations to make an assessment,” noted Ojal. Currently, Nondies are having three training sessions a week — Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday — with a group of 20 players at the new facility at the Ngong racecourse. Players are allowed to access the gym and do individual training drills like ball work but scrummage, lineouts and mauls are banned due to the Covid-19 restrictions. Nondies finished seventh last season, narrowly missing out on the playoffs. Ojal said he hopes the new signings will help them to a top-six once the government gives the go-ahead for rugby to resume activities. "I think we have a good crop of players in the squad and if all goes well, then I think we will be in the mix for the playoffs,” Ojal said. Nondies are also hopeful that previous additions on the technical bench including Kenya Under 20 assistant coach Michael Aung (consultant), former Kenyan international Kenny Andola (backs coach) and Hillary Itela (scrummaging consultant) will also have their influence felt. Nondies have bagged the most Kenya Cup (17) and Enterprise Cup (24) titles but last won the league crown in 1998. The core of the team that did duty last season including skipper Steve Odhaimbo, Ian Mabwa, Brian Sinei and Ina Njenga have remained.
