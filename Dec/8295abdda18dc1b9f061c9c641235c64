A truck driver has been arraigned before Busia senior principal magistrate Patrick Olengo after being found in possession of smuggled mahogany timber worth Sh1.4 million. The driver was arrested by Customs and Border Control officers along the Malaba-Busia highway on November 26, 2020. The accused was in the company of other individuals who did not appear in court. During the arrest, officers found 29.6 cubic meters of uncustomed mahogany timber in his possession, contrary to sections 200 (iii) (d),210 and 211 of the East African Community Customs Management Act (EACCMA) 2004. It is believed that the uncustomed goods originated from the Democratic Republic of Congo. The accused pleaded not guilty to the offense and was released on Sh50,000 cash bail or Sh100,000 bond. The case will be mentioned on Monday, December 21, 2020, and the hearing is set for April 15, 2021. Following the arraignment, the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) said that it has taken up arms in the fight against illegal trade. "In partnership with other government agencies the authority has put in place structures aimed at beefing up surveillance along border points to help curb illicit trade," KRA said.
