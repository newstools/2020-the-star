As part of their continued Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiative dubbed “Supporting Our Healthcare Facilities”, Mozzart donated medical equipment worth Ksh 3 million to the Mama Lucy Kibaki Hospital on Monday. Mozzart is targeting to support key healthcare facilities in Nairobi and around different counties in the midst of the corona virus pandemic. Previously, the company had made a donation of Ksh 10,000,000 worth of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE’s) to front line professionals. Items to Mama Lucy Kibaki Hospital include an incubator, six 15-inch patient monitors, bedside lockers, and patient beds complete with Macintosh mattresses. The event was held at the Mama Lucy Kibaki Hospital and was attended by the hospital’s Acting Medical Superintendent Dr Essam Said Ahmed among other staff from the facility and Mozzart. “We are very glad to get these equipment as they will help us get better as fully functioning 24/7 hospital. We thank Mozzart and hope more organisations and companies can do the same as most hospitals around the country are under-equiped,” Dr. Essam Ahmed, said, “Strengthening the healthcare system in Kenya is very important and I am happy that Mozzart took up this initiative. On behalf of Mama Lucy Kibaki Hospital, I want to thank them once again for this kind gesture.” He added. Mozzart intends to spread out the donations to other regions in the coming days. “We have so far donated equipment to the Pumwani Maternity Hospital, Ngara Health Centre, Chemolingot Sub County hospital in Tiaty, the Mathare North Health Centre, Kahawa West Health Centre and now Mama Lucy Kibaki Hospital. “– Mr. Frank Ochieng, Mozzart Bet Marketing Manager said, “We are also going to donate more medical equipment to the Mukuru Health Centre, Kayole 1 and Kayole 2 Health Centres this week. We will roll out to more hospitals across the country soon. We are here to support Kenyan communities in the long term,” he added.
