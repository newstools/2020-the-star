Jubilee did not field a candidate in Msambweni and Deputy President William Ruto chose to support the independent runner Feisal Abdalla Bader, who emerged victorious. Prior to the by-election, the Deputy President mobilised his entire machinery; it was a do or die situation for him. It is important to remember that the independent candidate was not his aspirant. Bader was somehow an ODM person. It is only that ODM, maybe, did not pick the right candidate for the by-election. It was the same case for the ward by-elections. The just-concluded by-elections were about the candidates and had nothing to do with the sponsors. I think political parties should read the times. These are not the days when you could impose a candidate on the people and expect to win. I would not give the Deputy President full credit for Baderâ€™s victory. I would give full credit to the candidate. He is the one who articulated the issues facing the constituents and explained to them how he planned to go about them. He was able to sell his agenda and since he resonated with the people, he won. His association with MP Suleiman Dori [who died in March and created the vacancy] also played a role in the victory. He was Dori's personal assistant and people knew him. Perhaps the people wanted him to continue with the work of his former boss. The wake-up call now is to the Building Bridges Initiative group, we need to work as a team. In Msambweni, we did not work as a team. We needed to synergise and focus. We also needed to get the right candidate, one who would be a common runner for all of us. If we had done this and still lost, then you would say the Deputy President trounced us. There are however things that we learnt. Going forward, we will have a united front in all forthcoming by-elections and everything that we will be doing. The Kieni MP spoke to the Star
