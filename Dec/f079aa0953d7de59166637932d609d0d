The Ministry of Water is undertaking 22 projects worth Sh2.5 billion in Murang’a county to encourage irrigation farming. Water and Irrigation PS Joseph Wairagu said the projects, being implemented through the National Irrigation Authority, are at various stages of completion. They are mostly targeting lower parts of the county that are dry and often face drought. He said five irrigation projects, which will cover 7,500 acres, will be undertaken at a cost of Sh1.68 billion. They are Mirichu/Murika, Nyanjigi, Mirira, Nginda and Mukurwe wa Nyangathanga. The projects are expected to be completed in a year’s time. Wairagu, who spoke on Monday while inspecting the Mirichu Miirira irrigation project in Kiharu constituency, said the projects will help make the county food secure and empower locals financially. The Mirichu/Miirira project will cover 3,000 acres and farmers are undergoing training in neighbouring Kirinyaga county on the best crops to plant. “We want farmers to invest in high-value crops that will earn them good returns. We want to see the economy of the county changing,” the PS said. The agenda of the ministry, Wairagu said, is to change the narrative that Murang’a has been left behind in water provision. Wairagu also added that the ministry will soon launch a mobile application that will monitor all water bowsers and weed out cartels in major towns.  Edited by A.N
