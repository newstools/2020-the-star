Busia has completed interviews to hire ten doctors. The County Public Service Board interviewed 55 out of the 56 shortlisted candidates, who turned up for the interview. The exercise was conducted at the Busia County Referral Hospital on Thursday and Friday. This follows a directive issued by Governor Sospeter Ojamoong inÂ  September on the need to employ more medical officers to improve service delivery. "My government through CPSB will employ ten more doctors as a stop gap measure to improve service delivery in the County's major health facilities," he said during a meeting with officials of the doctors Union. Chairperson of the CPSB, Asumpta Obore, pointed out the need to employ more health caregivers to ease the shortages being witnessed but was quick to mention that the move will depend on availability of funds. She cautioned the interviewees against canvassing or engaging in bribery to secure the job. "This is a technical area that involves life, and as a panel we have incorporated experts from the medical field to select competent persons through a competitive fair process," she said. "A total of 122 candidates applied for the vacancies, thus kickstarting the recruitment process," she added. All the candidates were required to carry their original certificates. After verification of documents, the candidates were subjected to oral interviews. The successful candidates will be responsible for disease diagnosis, surgery treatment, day to day check-up of patients, surgeries, preparing and responding to emergencies and disasters, participating in the management of medicines, medical instruments and equipments among others.
