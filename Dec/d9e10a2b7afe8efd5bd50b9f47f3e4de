 A court has allowed former Government chief pathologist Moses Njue to evict a church from a disputed land in Embu county pending the hearing and determination of a case. Siakago senior resident magistrate Edwin Wasike on Friday ordered East Africa Pentecostal Church (EAPC) to move out of the 1/8 acre land in Yonda village, Mbeere South subcounty. The court ordered the churchâ€™s general overseer Amon Mburu and preacher Reverend Michael Ngari to move out pending the hearing and determination of the case. Wasike issued the order following an application filed by the pathologist through his lawyer Kalamu Ndolo. Njue sought the eviction of the church until the case on ownership is determined. Njue said he bought the land at Sh300,000. The church and its faithful were to use the land and pay him at a later date. He told the court that the church built a church house on the land and continued using it for worship. He said lies were fabricated about the ownership of the land. The magistrate said Njue had proved that continued occupation of the land by respondents would negatively affect the property and tamper with it to his detriment. He thus directed for immediate vacation by the respondents who include Mburu, Ngari, and EAPC Church.
