A pharmacist at a university in Nakuru county surrendered to police after stabbing his 22-year-old girlfriend to death. Njoro subcounty police commandant Jonathan Kisaka said the man walked to the police station at Huruma Estate at 3am on December 31 and confessed that he had killed someone. Kisaka said police officers accompanied the suspect to the scene and found the woman’s body with multiple stab wounds to the chest and stomach. “The body was in the suspect’s house lying in a pool of blood and the murder weapon, a knife, was recovered,” he said. He said the incident must have occurred an hour earlier because the blood was still fresh. Kisaka said the suspect, who also had a stab wound to the thigh, was taken for check up at Gilgil Mental Hospital. He said the suspect must have sustained the injury during the incident because it was fresh. The names of the deceased and the suspect have been kept anonymous until the next of kin are informed.
