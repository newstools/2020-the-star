Laikipia Woman Representative Catherine Waruguru has said she will vie for the Laikipia East parliamentary seat in 2022. She accused MP Mohammed Amin of failing to initiate development projects at the grassroots, saying she is ready to defeat him at the ballot. She spoke while commissioning 22 electricity transformers for villages in Njoguini area on Tuesday. “It is time for Amin to pack his belongings and go home because there is no room for petty politics‚” she said. Waruguru said she has a right to lobby for development projects from the government for his constituents, saying he was taking credit for her development  projects. “If your MP is not working for you, let him go home. We will scout for votes as women and we will not allow some leaders to mislead the people," Waruguru said. She criticised The Service Party (TSP) leader Mwangi Kiunjuri for what she called bulldozing residents to vote for candidates of his choice. "I have always agreed with Kiunjuri on various issues concerning development. But we always differ whenever he opens a political party and dictates the persons who should be elected by Laikipia voters," she said. She said she will continue supporting President Uhuru Kenyatta’s administration after shifting from Deputy President William Ruto's camp. "I decided not to be used to support Ruto [who] is not the one who gave me the votes to become a county MP. My legacy is to work for my people and I can only do that when in government," she said. Waruguru was accompanied by officials from the Rural Electrification and Renewable Energy Commission led by CEO Paul Mbugua. Edited by Kiilu Damaris
