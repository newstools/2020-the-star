Kenyan volleyball teams will be hoping for good returns when they participate in various continental events planned for next year by the Confederation of African Volleyball. In the calendar of events released by CAVB, the first continental event will be the African Nations Championship Junior Women under-20 in Uganda followed by the junior girls under-18 category in Nigeria on January 26-February 7. The men's junior championships — under-19 and under-21 — will be staged on February 1-6 and February 18-26 respectively in Tunisia and Egypt. The Women's Volleyball African Club Championship, where Kenyan teams have posted impressive results over the years, will be held in March-April at a venue to be confirmed. It may run concurrently as the men's category whose venue is also yet to be identified. A week ago, the Kenya Volleyball Federation announced the local leagues for men and women will commence on January 23 in line with the International Volleyball Federation's format. However, due to the insufficient number of teams that have registered, the leagues will conclude in a shorter time than FIVB's format. "We have not met the format as far as the number of teams required to participate is concerned. However, whatever teams we have will participate in the league in a accordance to FIVB's format," Isaac Tirop, KVF's media liaison, said. Apart from the local and continental calendar, the national women's team, Malkia Striker, will be lining up at the rescheduled Tokyo Olympics to be held in July. After their exploits, they will be expected to congregate in time for the African Volleyball Championship and the 2022 World Volleyball Championship qualifiers in August.
