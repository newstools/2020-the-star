The Adopt-a-Boma food drive recently reached out to residents of Kibra with food rations. It also supported children with autism with epileptic suppression drugs. The event was also used to identify the construction site for a Youth Friendly Service Corner that will cater for not only the youths but also persons living with disabilities to access sexual and reproductive health Services. The event took place at the Kibra Deputy County Commissionerâ€™s Office. Among those present were I Choose Life Africa CEO Mike Mutungi and Ford Foundation special assistant regional director Hannah Ahere.
