A man drowned on Monday evening when he attempted to cross the flooded River Iraru in Gitine, South Imenti, Meru. Julius Muriuku, 60, fell off a makeshift wooden bridge while on a trip to fetch timber in Abogata. The timber trader's body was yet to be retrieved on Tuesday evening. Residents blamed police and the county government officials for slow response to distress calls made from 5pm on Monday. Area chief Purity Kainyu said they are doing everything they can to retrieve the body. The residents faulted Meru Governor Kiraitu Murungi, MCA John Kireria and Mwirigi Karinga of Abogeta East for not helping recover the body. They pleaded with the Meru government to construct a bridge at the scene, saying the nearest one is 10km away. Seven people have drowned at the same spot within the last few years and their cry to leaders has fallen on deaf ears, residents said. Muriuki's brother Joses Mugambi said they are having a sad Christmas due to the tragedy that has befallen them. He added that they were to receive in-laws on dowry payment mission for their young girl. “I ask Governor Kiraitu, MCA Kireria and Karinga to build us a bridge for easy crossing of the dangerous river as we have been trying to retrieve the body in vain,” Mugambi said.
