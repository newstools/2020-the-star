After netting the winning goal against Vihiga United in their opening match of the  Kenyan Premier League at the Mumias Complex, Kakamega Homeboyz winger David Okoth has revealed he is targeting 20 assists and 10 goals in their hunt for the title. The former Nzoia Sugar star has expressed his satisfaction with the pre-season preparations they had, which he said placed him in good shape to start the campaign on a high note. He also paid homage to coach Nicholas Muyoti. Speaking to Star Sports on the phone, Okoth reiterated his desire to see the club build on last season’s success that saw them finish second behind Gor Mahia. “As a team, we want to ensure that we achieve our objective of winning the league. I believe the club is now ripe enough and has what it takes to compete against the so-called big clubs," he said. “We are taking every match at a time. We are under no pressure. It’s high time to reciprocate the good support we are receiving from the management, the technical bench, and loyal fans." “With the Covid-19 pandemic, it has not been easy for most of us having missed group training something that will affect many teams during the initial stage of the league but we want to thank God for the unity and cohesion that is being witnessed in the club at the moment,” said Okoth. The offensive midfielder added that the key factor that holds success is teamwork, something they exhibited in their first match, a derby against Vihiga United. “It was a very tough match and I am happy that I got the opportunity to score the winning goal. This is a good start and we hope to build up on it," he added. Muyoti revealed that the speedy winger has what it takes to achieve his targets for the season and that he only needs to remain focused, continue working hard and maintain discipline. "I believe he has come of age and can fit in any team, even the national team, with the qualities he has and it’s my prayer he remains fit and maintain team spirit,” pointed out Muyoti.
