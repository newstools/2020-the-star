The ouster of Kisii county assembly speaker David Kombo failed on Tuesday after some MCAs disrupted the counting of votes. Vote counting started at 2.30pm but the process was interrupted moments later. The notice of the impeachment motion was tabled by Bogiakumu MCA Ismael Matundura last month. Kombo was accused of incompetence, ignorance or otherwise deliberately misinterpreting and flouting the standing orders. The speaker had stepped down to pave the way for MCAs to debate the motion of his removal. Addressing the press outside the assembly after the vote counting aborted, Matundura and colleague Ombuya of Sengera Bosoti ward said there was a deliberate move to have Kombo remain in office. “The counting exercise was disrupted by those opposing the motion,” Ombuya said. “The motion was clear because it was aimed at addressing members’ predicament like life insurance. I am citing a case where Kiamokama MCA Kennedy Mainya died last month but never benefited from the insurance,” Matundura said. Those who supported the motion vowed not allow the speaker conduct any house business. But leader of Minority James Ondari and deputy John Ombati said the speaker garnered the required two thirds of the total votes to retain the seat. “The speaker was the winner of the election because he garnered two thirds of the votes required to retain his seat,” Ondari said. Matundura said the speaker, as the chairman of the County Assembly Services Board, and colleagues in the same board for failing to prepare and table assembly’s reports for 2017, 2018 and 2019 contrary to section 36 and 37 County Assembly Services Act 2017. Temporary speaker Samuel Onuko, who chaired the session, said that no results were announced because the process was disrupted. Onuko said he will seek legal advice of the same before making a decision.
