Newly promoted Ulinzi Starlets are not short of ambition as they aim for the top spot in Zone ‘A’ of the Kenya Women Premier League. Despite losing their first game of the season against Thika Queens, coach Joseph Wambua reckons that his team made a statement of resilience as they picked up three points against Kayole Starlets on Sunday at Utalii Sports ground. The military side stuck to their guns after their goalkeeper was sent off in the first half and went on to win the match, scoring three goals and conceding one. This, according to coach Wambua, showed the team is on the right track. “ To play with ten players for about 75 minutes and still go on and win it shows we are headed in the right direction. It also shows our fitness levels are good,” he said. Coach Wambua believes the win sets precedent as he hitched his wagon to the star, by declaring that they are gunning for the premier league title. “I know we are a newly promoted team, but we are aiming for the top spot of the zone. Our worst finish should be the second position,” he said. When asked if that means the team is gunning for the title, he said, “Yes. It’s possible and we know what is required of us if we want to win it.” Ulinzi Starlets are pooled in Zone A against 2014/2015 premier league champions Thika Queens. Other teams in the zone are Gatundu-based Gaspo FC, Mathare United Women, Kayole Starlets, Kibera Soccer Ladies, Makolanders and Zetech Sparks.
