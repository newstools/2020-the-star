National Olympic Committee-Kenya has moved into new offices on the 6th floor of Gallant Building along Parklands Road in Nairobi. The new headquarters — which has been undergoing renovations for the past two months — was ratified by delegates during NOC-K's Ordinary Session of the General Assembly. "The new office space is designed for efficiency, functionality and cost effectiveness, according to the needs of NOC-K. The offices are optimally structured to eliminate unutilized commercial space and constrain to office functionality such as having a store in the operations office," acting secretary general Francis Mutuku said. Mutuku said that the new offices are a long-term investment that will save up more funds to help member federations. "NOC-K will have no rent costs and therefore the annual savings from rent would be used to increase the funding and support to federations. The provision of new office will facilitate easier and more effective delivery under a suitable environment," he said. NOC-K has for the last eight years been conducting its activities from 1st Floor Plaza 2000. Its new features include expanded workspace for staff, modern library, boardroom and a display room featuring a rich heritage of Team Kenya’s participation in global sports events. "The partitioning of the office is complete, the next phase is interior design and furnishing, which starts immediately. Operations are anticipated to start in the new office in January 2021," Mutuku said.
