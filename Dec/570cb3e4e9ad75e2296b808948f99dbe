King Fahad Hospital in Lamu has been closed down following a strike by medics who are demanding better working conditions. The county government has been forced to scale down services in other major health facilities to emergencies only due to the ongoing nationwide strike by nurses and clinical officers. Services in health facilities have been disrupted as patients are forced to seek medical care in the few available private hospitals and in neighbouring counties. A medic who spoke on condition of anonymity said they would not return to work until all their demands are met. “Previously, we have gone on strike and they coerced us into going back to work promising to look into our issues but nothing has been done. The conditions we are working in at the moment are putting us at daily risk of contracting Covid-19. Our colleagues have died and have been forgotten,” he said. Among their many demands, the medics want the families of their colleagues who have succumbed to the coronavirus compensated by the state. Patients were seen walking away from hospitals in the region as medics kept away from their work stations. Members of the public who had patients admitted at King Fahad took them away to private hospitals. When contacted, Lamu Health executive Anne Gathoni admitted that the strike had affected the provision of major services in facilities in the region. She, however, denied that any hospital or dispensary had been closed down due to the strike. Gathoni said services had only been scaled down to emergencies due to shortage of staff. “No hospital is closed here. The facilities are however only handling emergency cases as we see what to do,” Gathoni said.  Edited by Henry Makori
