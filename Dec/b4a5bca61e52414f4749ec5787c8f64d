The two-time Paris Marathon winner Paul Lonyangata yesterday added another feather to his rich collection after settling to the Taipei Marathon crown . Lonyangata broke away from compatriot Elisha Rotich and Ethiopia's Chele Dechasa in the 32nd kilometre to finish unchallenged in 2:09:18— his first marathon of the year. The 28-year-old also smashed the race record of 2:09:59 previously held by Sammy Kitwara. Lonyangata, who has a 2:06:10 lifetime best, was a member of the Kenyan squad that took part in  last year's World Championships in Doha but did not finish. Rotich, the runner-up at the Seoul Marathon last year in 2:06:12, slowed over the final eight kilometres but held on to finish second in 2:13:07. Further back, Tiidrek Nurme of Estonia was third in 2:16:11. However, Ethiopia's Dechasa, who has a 2:06:25 lifetime best, dropped out of the race at the 34th kilometre after suffering from ankle pain. In the women's category, Askale 'Wegi' Merachi controlled the race en-route to victory in 2:28:31. It was the second marathon victory in as many outings over the distance this year for Merachi, who won the Houston Marathon in January with a 2:23:29 life-time best. Her compatriot Asifa Kasegn was second in 2:32:00 while Zinash Mekkonen rounded off the podium sweep for Ethiopia in 2:32:24. Merachi had already dropped her challengers five kilometres into the race and forged on alone, reaching the half Mark in 1:12:47 and was on target to challenge the 2:27:36 race record. She was, however,  forced to battle some strong winds in the second half before eventually crossing the finish line.
