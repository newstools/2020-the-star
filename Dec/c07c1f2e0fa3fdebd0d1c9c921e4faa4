Ugunja MP Opiyo Wandayi has asked Parliament to reject the proposed trebling of university tuition fees. The varsities' proposal to increase annual fees fee from Sh16, 000 to Sh48,000 has been met with an outcry from parents who say it's too expensive Speaking in Bondo, he said the proposal would lock out the poor from university education. Wandayi said the government should look for alternative ways to raise funds to sustain the universities rather than increasing fees. Wandayi said the government has many avenues to raise funds for institutions of higher learning and one of them is dealing with corruption. “If the cost of higher education is raised, the gap between the rich and the poor in the country will never be bridged‚” he said. Vice chancellors and chairmen of university councils last month asked Parliament to sanction the proposed fee increment to guarantee institutions sustainability. Universities are facing a cash crunch caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and are keen on reviewing the current fee structure that has been in use since 1989. Wandayi said the government should find a mechanism to allow all students back to school in January 2021, whether or not they have fees. Most parents have been hurt financially by the pandemic, he said. Edited by Kiilu Damaris
