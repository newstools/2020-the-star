Nakuru residents will be sensitised about menstrual hygiene to beat cultural setbacks that stigmatise women and girls during their periods. County director for gender Celina Nkatha said the drive targets conservative communities that have criminalised menstruation and painted women in their periods as impure. “The campaign in Subukia, Rongai, Molo, Njoro, Kuresoi North and South targets girls and boys and their parents in addressing the misconceptions,” she said. She spoke while distributing free sanitary towels to girls in Rongai, Nakuru. Most girls rely on free sanitary pads distributed by the government at school but can’t get them now due to the Covid-19 shutdown. Studies have found that some girls use unhygienic materials during their menses while others fall into sex-for-cash arrangements to get pads. The campaign was launched at the end of 16 days of activism against gender-based violence. Nakuru county has distributed free sanitary towels to teenaged girls throughout the 55 wards in an effort to boost menstrual hygiene and control early pregnancies. “The girls are also getting guidance and counselling sessions to ensure they acquire life skills to help them deal with different challenges,” Nkatha said. She said the distribution of pads will go on until schools reopen in January next year. (edited by o. owino)
