A suspected alcohol addict collapsed in an Embu court after allegedly staying for hours without drinking. The suspect was arrested for not maintaining social distance protocols while drinking at Kamavidi Bar in Kibugu Town, Embu North Sub-county. Boniface Mwaura shocked the court when he started shivering and uttering inaudible words before falling down. But before he could hit the floor, court orderlies supported him and carried him into the adjacent cell where they laid him safely in a secure position. Senior Resident Magistrate Tony Kwambai had just finished reading a sentence in which he fined Mwaura and his two accomplices Patrick Murage and Ian Mugambi Sh500 or serve a month in jail. The three had apologised and sought forgiveness, saying that they would not repeat the same offence but the magistrate fined them the amount giving them  14 days to appeal if they were not satisfied with the sentence. The drama unfolded as the magistrate continued to issue his ruling. “Help him out, he could be suffering from long hours of withdrawal from drinking,” the magistrate said. The three were accused of endangering themselves and other people in the bar at this period of coronavirus. Prosecutor Bernard Nyagute had described them as first offenders saying he did not have records showing them to be offenders in the past.
