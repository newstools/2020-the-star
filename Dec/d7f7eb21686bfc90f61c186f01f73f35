The Kenya Dairy Board has challenged farmers to increase their milk production to meet the growing demand for cheese. KDB standards and enterprise development manager Paul Ndung’u said Kenya produces approximately 391 metric tonnes of cheese annually, which is not enough to meet local market demand. This deficiency, he said, had necessitated imports, especially of specialised cheese, which is not available locally. He said there was great potential for the country to increase production to satisfy the demand if farmers agreed to boost production, which would in turn translate to more earnings. Ndung’u said the government has created an enabling environment for dairy farmers to reach their full potential and make good returns on their investment. He said the 60 per cent custom duty and other tariffs imposed on imported cheese provided an opportunity for locally produced cheese to be competitive in the Kenyan market. Ndung'u spoke on Wednesday during a training session for cheese processors in Nyeri. The training focused on equipping processors with skills to enable them to invest in small and large scale production of cheese and other forms of value addition to boost profitability and enhance access to domestic and regional export markets. Cheese is a concentrated dairy food consisting of coagulated, compressed and usually ripened curd of milk separated from whey.  It is produced in different styles, textures and flavours to suit the taste and preference of consumers.
