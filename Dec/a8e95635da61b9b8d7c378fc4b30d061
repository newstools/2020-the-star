Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu has opened a new theatre in Tseikuru, Mwingi NorthConstituency. The Sh25 million project at the Tseikuru subcounty hospital is the first ever theatre in the area put up by a partnership of the county government and Afya Halisi through USAid funding. Ngilu said the facility will help alleviate the suffering of area residents especially pregnant women. "This project will go a long way in saving the lives of our women in this region. Quality healthcare remains very dear to me," Ngilu said. Noting the long distances residents traveled in search of theatre services, Governor Ngilu said it was an uphill task to transport critical patients in need of operations to either Mwingi Level 4 or the county referral in Kitui town. Kitui chief officer for Health Dr Muthoka confirmed that two successful caesarian surgeries had been done two hours after the opening of the theatre. Area MP Nzengu Malili praised the move to open the theatre in the area noting that residents had gone through untold suffering for years. "I commend the governor for this project that is a key milestone in the health sector in this region," Nzengu said. Joseph Bulusi, an area resident, said the theatre will save the cost of transportation of patients and give hope to residents in need of theatre services. Edited by Henry Makori
