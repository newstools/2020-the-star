Residents of Ntimaru town on Kuria East subcounty were left in shock after a 59-year-old man died in a local lodging after allegedly taking sex-enhancing drugs. The elderly man checked in at a local lodging with a young woman and after taking soda and bread he proceeded in the room. "After booking the room, the man took the drugs. But when the woman arrived later she refused to have intercourse with him," Mwita said. The woman is said to have turned down the man, her lover since 2013, on grounds that she was menstruating. Ntimaru OCPD John Losia said on Wednesday that the man started groaning and turning on the bar’s bed with foam coming from his mouth. "It was at this point that the woman rushed to the bar and lodging owner and reported the matter," Losia said. The police boss said the two called the man's son who arrived and rushed him to a local hospital. “They rushed him to a private hospital where he died on arrival,” he said. He said the woman was held at Ntimaru police station while the bar owner has recorded a statement awaiting postmortem. Edited by Henry Makori
