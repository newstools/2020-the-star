Former Kaloleni MP Gunga Mwinga is dead. Mwinga died on Sunday at the Mombasa Hospital while receiving treatment. It is not clear what he was suffering from. Kaloleni MP Paul Katana confirmed the news to the Star. "I am here at the Mombasa Hospital. Our brother has left us," Katana told the Star. Mwinga was at some point the Coast Parliamentary Group chairman. A lawyer by profession, Mwinga had retreated to the courtroom after his ouster by Katana. He had formed the Devolution Party of Kenya where he was the party leader. Mwinga was a champion of the local palm wine drink and fought for its legalization. He was also a champion for the unity of Coast leaders and tried to lure all the leaders from the region to his party.
