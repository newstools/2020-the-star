Religious leaders at the Coast want the national government to put the BBI process on hold and focus on more pressing issues such as the medics strike. Council of Imams and Preachers of Kenya national treasury Sheikh Hassan Omar said leaders in other countries are looking for ways to save their citizens from the pandemic but here, leaders have given the first priority to the BBI. “This is not the right time to handle politics, power and posts. Kenyans are suffering and there is no one to help them,” he said. Omar said in Mombasa some residents have to walk miles to get food donations because life has increasingly become tough. “Kenyans need to wake up and know that whatever is happening in our country is not right. I support the doctors' strike because our needs should be taken care of.” “We as religious leaders do not support BBI and if we get any group opposing it we will give them full support because we all need to stop it.” Supreme Council of Kenya Muslims deputy chairman Mukhtar Khitami said, “The solution for this country is not the BBI. The solution is to take care of the needs of our health workers and not to threaten them because there is no money to employ new health workers.” He urged the government to ensure doctors are paid to end the strike. “We can survive without BBI because no one will die but without doctors, people will suffer and the sick will die,” Khitami said.
