Embattled Nairobi governor Mike Sonko and MCAs have filed preliminary applications to speaker Kenneth Lusaka. The county assembly wants the senate to summon 11 witnesses including commissioner of prisons Wycliffe Ogalo, to testify against the governor. On the other hand, Sonko's application challenges the legality of the proceedings and he is arguing that county assembly did not follow the set down rules and law in impeaching him. He wants the motion sent back to the county assembly.Â  Lusaka will deliver the ruling at 2.15pm. Earlier, Sonko discredited charges levelled against him, terming them flimsy, inaccurate and witch-hunt thus dead on arrival. Through lawyer Harrison Kinyanjui, Sonko pleaded with the senators to throw away the case, adding that it does meet the threshold of removing him from office. He said the charges are allegations aimed anchored on witch-hunt and malice and should therefore be thrown out. While making opening remarks, Kinyanjui submitted that Sonko has been furnished with evidence supporting charges against him while other allegations touch on cases pending in court. He was responding to MCAs who said Sonko is rogue, extravagant and plunderer of public resources and should go home. Through their lead lawyer Ndgewa Njiru, the ward reps claimed that Sonko has failed the leadership and integrity tests and brought disrepute to the office governor.
