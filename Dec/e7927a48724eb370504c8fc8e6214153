The Assets recovery Agency (ARA) has filed a case in court seeking to freeze Sh100 million seized from a Nigerian at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport. Mauzu Bala was heading to Dubai from Nigeria when he was arrested at JKIA on Friday. The monies which ARA is seeking were in US dollars, Euros and Naira. The money was stashed in a bag. The agency says there are reasonable grounds to suspect the funds found in Balu's possession in cash may be proceeds of crime obtained from a complex money laundering scheme. "His failure to declare that he was carrying such a huge amount or documents to support the legitimacy of the cash, raises suspicion of money laundering," says ARA. The court documents indicate that the cash was for business purposes in Dubai. But Balu had no documents to support the source, purpose and movement of the cash. The money in $880,000, 63,000 Nigerian Naira and 60,000 Euros is currently being held by Kenya Airways CEO Allan Kilavuka. ARA wants the court to issue an order directing Kilavuka to hand the money to them.
