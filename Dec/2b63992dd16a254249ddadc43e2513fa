The death toll from Covid-19 hit 1,531 after five more patients died on Sunday. Health CS Mutahi Kagwe said Monday that 199 Kenyans had tested positive for the virus, raising the caseload in the country to 88,579. The new cases were from a sample size of 2,416 tested in 24 hours, representing a positivity rate of 8.2 per cent. The Health ministry said the positivity rate was on a downward trend but cautioned it might be reversed should Kenyans throw caution to the wind over Christmas. “We seem to be on a gradual decline and we hope that we will be able to maintain this. The only challenge that we may face is that we are getting into the festive season and this a time when the spread of the virus can be accelerated,” Health CAS Rashid Aman said. All the new cases were Kenyans except 22. Men were 123 and 76 were women. Patients were aged between three and 90 years. “There are 1,171 patients admitted in various health facilities countrywide with 8,127 on the home-based isolation and care. Eighty-three patients are in the intensive care unit, 40 of whom are on ventilator support and 42 on supplemental oxygen,” Kagwe said. The CS said one patient is on observation. “Another 70 patients are separately on supplemental oxygen out of whom 62 are in the general wards while eight are in the high dependency unit,” he added. Some 485 patients recovered from the disease on Monday, raising the recoveries to 69,414. From the number, 416 were from the home-based care programme while 69 were discharged from various hospitals across the country. Nairobi registered 77 more cases, followed by Mombasa with 21, Busia with 20, Uasin Gishu with 19, Meru with 11 and West Pokot and Kilifi with seven cases each. Other counties include Turakana with five cases, Laikipia, Narok and Kajiado with four cases each, Murang’a with three cases, Kakamega with two cases while Nakuru, Kisumu, Embu, Machakos, Siaya and Kwale recorded one case each.
