Police have arrested former Machakos Senator Johnston Muthama at Jomo Kenyatta primary school in Msambweni. Muthama and other leaders were monitoring the ongoing voting exercise, before attracting a crowd. The police then blocked the former legislator and detained him in one room. The reason for his arrest was not known even-though he was able to tweet about it. "I have just been arrested with no cause in Diani, Mswambeni and currently been booked at KPA police station. I have numerously been asking the officer why am being arrested, "orders from above!"," Muthama tweeted. According to one of his security guards, Muthama is now being taken to Mombasa. He said former Kakamega senator Bony Khalwale was to be arrested but he locked himself in the car and the police left him. Meanwhile, Lunga-Lunga MP Khatib Mwashetani has denied allegations that he was arrested. The incident happened immediately after he addressed the media at Gazi polling station when the Independent candidate Feisal Bader casted his vote. Bader was accompanied by Nyali MP Mohammed Ali and his Malindi counterpart Aisha Jumwa. According to Mwashetani the police wanted to escort him to the station to record a statement on an issue he raised. It is alleged that on Tuesday night there were some confrontation between ODM team and Baderâ€™s.
