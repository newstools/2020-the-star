Hundreds of commuters were stranded in Kwale for hours on Thursday during a crackdown by NTSA and the police service commission on the Mombasa-Lunga-Lunga highway. Public service and private vehicles plying the Likoni-Ukunda route were the most affected. By 10am, more than 30 vehicles had been seized for violating traffic rules. The arrested drivers and conductors were charged and released on bail of between Sh5,000 and Sh10,000. National Transport Safety Authority Coast manager Eva Nyawira said they were targeting unroadworthy and unlicensed vehicles. She said the officers were also looking for PSV stickers, Covid-19 certificates and driving licences. The exercise was meant to promote road safety for both commuters and drivers as the Christmas festivities near. "We want to ensure maximum security on our roads to prevent deaths because many drivers flout the rules," she said. The officer said the number of accidents has risen since January; most of them involving boda boda riders, their passengers and pedestrians. A total of 3,589 people have died in road accidents this year, surpassing the 3,302 deaths recorded last year, according to NTSA data. SomeÂ 1,020 motorcyclists and 88 pillion passengers died. Last year, 673 motorcyclists and 71 passengers died between January 1 and December 10. National Police Service Commission member Reuben Katithi said most causes of road accidents are speeding, reckless driving, overloading and drivers' inexperience. Katithi urged motorists to be extra careful during the holidays. He urged drivers to ensure their vehicles meet the standard traffic regulations. The crackdown is expected to end on January 16, 2021.
