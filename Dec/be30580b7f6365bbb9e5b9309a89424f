New Sofapaka head coach Kennedy Odhiambo is expected to hit the ground running on Thursday. The 2009 league champions settled on the experienced Odhiambo after parting ways with John Baraza two weeks ago after a poor start in the season. The club announced that Baraza who had more than a decade long stay as both a player and a coach would proceed for further studies either in Germany or Norway. After firing Baraza, the club elevated his assistant, Mike Mururi, to the rank of head coach albeit on acting capacity pending the arrival of Odhiambo, a Caf level A license holder from Bandari. Odhiambo who returned to the local scene in February after two years of studies in Sudan will formally take over on Thursday, with eleven-time champions Tusker being the first opponent to confront in the first week of January. Sofapaka who broke the bank to acquire signatures of highly-rated players in the league and beyond resumed training on Monday at Eastleigh Boys High School grounds. Revered players whom the club bought in the last transfer window include the Harambee Stars trio of Roy Okal, Lawrence Juma and Michael Kibwage. With Odhiambo set to leave for Sofapaka, the dockers are understood to have raided Gor Mahia for the services of assistant coach Patrick Odhiambo to fill in his shoes.
