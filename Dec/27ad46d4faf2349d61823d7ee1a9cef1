Political parties intending to sponsor candidates for the vacant Nairobi governor position will Monday submit the names of ticket contestants to the electoral commission. The poll to replace impeached Ex-governor Mike Sonko will be held on February 18, next year. Nairobi assembly speaker Benson Mutura was last Monday installed as acting governor because Sonko had no deputy at the time of his removal. Sources have told the Star there is intense haggling in the handshake team for a winning formula in the high-stakes battle. Senior Jubilee and ODM officials are to hold talks on Sunday to broker consensus on joint candidature for governor and deputy governor. “We are yet to agree on our handshake approach for this by-election but some officials are closing ranks in a common meeting to be held today (Sunday) before an announcement would be made," a senior Jubilee official said. BBI co-chair Dennis Waweru, Jesus is Alive Ministries’ Bishop Margret Wanjiru, ex-Gatanga MP Peter Kenneth are among the big names being fronted. ODM secretary-general Edwin Sifuna is being mentioned for the deputy governor post. Allies of President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga are plotting to parry away a potential challenge by Deputy President William Ruto's brigade. After today's meeting, the technical team will brief Raila and Uhuru on a possible deal for the handshake team. Sources told the Star that the Jubilee faction allied to the President will be fronting a governor candidate as ODM nominates the deputy governor. Nairobi ODM chairman George Aladwa said the handshake candidate will be the next governor for the capital. "We are working on every detail to ensure that we field joint candidates in the by-election," he told the Star.  (edited by o. owino)
