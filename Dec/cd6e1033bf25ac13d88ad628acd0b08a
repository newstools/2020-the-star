Senate Minority Leader James Orengo has dismissed Linda Katiba initiative's allegations that the ongoing constitutional amendment process is state-sponsored, urging Kenyans to ignore the propaganda. His sentiments come after a section of politicians and constitutional experts under the Linda Katiba initiative who have been calling on Kenyans to resist the BBI terming it ill-timed. The Initiative led by Narc-Kenya party leader Martha Karua, economist David Ndii and former Chief Justice Willy Mutunga has further called it a state-sponsored narrative being forced on the people. Orengo spoke at Gem Primary School grounds in Siaya where he, together with area legislator Elisha Odhiambo and Siaya county MP Christine Ombaka, presided over the distribution of cheques amounting to Sh9.2 million to various groups from the National Government Affirmative Action Fund. Orengo said the fact that the process was born out of an initiative that saw the steering committee of the Building Bridges Initiative visit various parts of the country to seek citizens’ support was enough proof that the process was popular. The Siaya Senator said that the constitutional amendment process does not have to be led by the civil society groups to be termed popular initiative, adding that the fact that it is led and enacted by the people was enough. “There is a distinction between parliamentary and popular initiatives and I can tell you that the ongoing process is popular,” he said, adding that the BBI steering committee visited every county to collect public views. He called on those opposed to the document to stop peddling rumours and misleading the public. “They should stop misleading Kenyans and direct their attention to the content of the Bill,” Orengo said. Gem MP Elisha Odhiambo and Woman Representative, Christine Ombaka called on Kenyans to append their signatures in support of the constitutional amendment, adding that the document was the best.
