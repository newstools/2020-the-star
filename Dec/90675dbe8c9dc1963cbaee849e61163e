Getting five million signatures is a demonstration of the interest the people of Kenya have in the Building Bridges Initiative, ODM leader Raila Odinga has said. Raila received 5.2 million signatures collected countrywide to endorse BBI as the process comes to an end. Speaking in Kisumu on Friday, Raila said that was the most important thing and not which region had the highest number of signature collections. He said there was no competition in the national exercise. Nyanza region led in the exercise with 893,792 signatures, followed by Eastern region with 842,000 with Rift Valley coming third with 817,000 people appending their signatures to approve the law change process. Raila however said, "Maybe Nyanza region received papers earlier than other areas. Distance was also an issue but as at now other regions were still receiving results". He added "We need to know that we only needed one million signatures but in less than one week we reached five million". The collected signatures will be given to the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission for verification.
