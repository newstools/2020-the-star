Manchester United vs Manchester City Saturday 8:30 pm Manchester United will be looking to bounce back from Tuesday’s Champions League disappointment when they continue their Premier League campaign at home to Manchester City. Neither of these sides have performed consistently so far this season, which is why they sit sixth and seventh in the Premier League table. Both teams will be desperate for a win as Ole Gunnar Solksjaer’s job remains under constant pressure and Pep Guardiola can’t afford to lose any more ground in the title race. We expect a competitive 90-minutes at Old Trafford with little separating the two clubs at the final whistle. The Red Devils were eliminated in the group stages of the Champions League courtesy of a 3-2 loss to RB Leipzig in Germany, meaning that the English giants will drop into the Europa League. Solskjaer’s side have won their last four in the league, though, and are just five points behind leaders Tottenham Hotspur with a game in hand. Man City have picked up three wins from their last six outings, against Fulham, Burnley and Olympiakos, but were held to draws by Liverpool and Porto, and lost away at Tottenham. Still, only one point separates the two clubs and each will fancy their chances of winning and moving further up the table.

They’ve scored ten out of 12 league goals this term after half time, seven of those coming after the 75th minute. The Magpies are yet to keep a Premier League clean sheet. Four of those fixtures produced over 2.5 goals and only one was goalless at half time. What’s more, they’ve conceded five out of seven second-half league goals at St James’ Park after the 80th minute. With one league win, West Bromwich Albion have struggled this season, evidenced most recently during their 5-1 hammering by Crystal Palace. That saw them concede 3+ goals for the fourth time this campaign. While they’ve kept it tight on the road  — their last four games featured under 2.5 goals each. Interestingly, none of the last eight Premier League head-to-heads here were decided by more than a one-goal margin.

They thrashed ten-man Crotone 4-0 in their last league fixture, but they could be a bit out of form following the Europa League showdown with Real Sociedad. The Genoese, on the other hand, aim to bounce back from a 2-1 loss to Milan. They have managed to find the net in each of their previous four league fixtures, and given Napoli’s tough fixture list, the visitors may extend their goal-scoring run at Stadio San Paolo. Both teams are likely to score in this match.
