The county government of Kisumu has ordered Bus companies operating stations within Kisumu Central Business District (CBD) to relocate out of town by January 1, 2021. The acting city manager Abala Wanga said the companies should move to alternative stations outside the CBD. In a notice issued by Wanga, the city has powers under the Urban and Cities Act 2011 to issue such directives as most buses are operating offices within the main bus park in town. Buses such as Easy Coach, Guardian, Periska, and Ena Coach among others have offices within Kisumu CBD and have to vacate following the directive Wanga said that action will be taken against companies that will not have complied with the notice within the given time. “The county government will tow or cause to tow all the buses or vehicles without further reference to the owners at their own risks,” Wanga said. The notice was copied to the county police commander, director of the city inspectorate, and the city engineer to implement the notice. Wanga said they are committed to making the city very clean and favourable for doing business. Kisumu city has been undergoing a transformation with traders relocated from the streets to alternative places to create space for developments. Through donor funding, the county has been implementing beautification projects. Such projects include the Sh 241 million Non-motorized transport (NMT ), which is meant to ensure pedestrians and cyclists enjoy improved convenience, comfort, and safety. Under the NMT, a Sh 37 million market dubbed Chichwa was constructed. Its stalls accommodate 518 traders and an open-air section for 240 others. The market has water reticulation, electricity, spacious stalls, security services, controlled trading areas. It also has three ultra-modern ablution blocks. It is funded by the World Bank through the State Department of Urban Development under the Kenya Urban Support Programme.  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
