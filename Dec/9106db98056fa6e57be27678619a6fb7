Ten more patients died from Covid-19 on Wednesday, raising the death toll to 1,484. Health CAS Rashid Aman said all ammunition to defend children, the elderly and other vulnerable groups must be used to beat the disease. The Health Ministry warned that six counties — Kajiado, Kisumu, Kitui, Machakos, Meru and Nyeri — have recorded a spike in cases in the past five weeks. “Our experts are attributing the rising number of cases in all these counties to the flagrant abuse and flouting of the containment measures which we have issued here at the Health ministry to combat this deadly virus,” Aman said. Nairobi still leads in infection numbers, recording 203 more new cases on Wednesday. The capital and Mombasa have had the bulk of the cases since the outbreak. Mombasa recorded 41 new cases.
