Carrefour Supermarket has expanded and opened another branch in Mombasa. The store becomes Carrefour’s ninth countrywide and officially opened its doors today to customers at the City Mall in Nyali, Mombasa. The new supermarket will be home to a variety of quality products to address the immediate shopping needs of customers who live, work and vacation within Mombasa and its surrounding areas. The Nyali store offers more than 20,000 products alongside a home-made bakery section, a fresh fishery and a butchery counter, as well as a tasty deli section plus a wide selection of non-food and electronic products. The opening of the new branch at the City Mall will create both direct and indirect job opportunities for Kenyans by employing 190 people, including a dedicated Mombasa customer service team to assist in resolving any issues. Carrefour already operates eight stores in Nairobi, with plans to open an additional two stores in the Coastal region at the Diani Centre Point Plaza and Shanzu Mall. “This is an exciting milestone for us since we ventured into Kenya in 2016, and we are looking forward to extending our quality goods and services to our customers here on the coast. Mombasa tumewasili!” Country Manager Franck Moreau said. Customers will also get loyalty points when they use the Carrefour rewards app – My Club and gift vouchers will be available for purchase. "This will give them the same great experience as our customers in Nairobi and offers us a chance to win new customers in Mombasa County,” Moreau added. Carrefour Kenya also provides on-demand delivery services from its Nyali store through its partners Jumia Food and Glovo. The service allows customers to order from the comfort of their home and enjoy Carrefour quality and low prices delivered right to their doorstep.
