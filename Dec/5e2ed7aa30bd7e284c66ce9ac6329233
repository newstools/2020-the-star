With BBI we have seen just how serious our leaders can be when they put their mind to it. It makes us question if the BBI will be of more benefit to us or to them. When Covid-19 struck, we had a great challenge in accessing masks, protective gears for healthcare workers, soap and sanitiser. To-date we have Kenyans who cannot afford to buy a mask. If it were not for donations by well-wishers, we would be lagging behind in the fight against Covid-19. In this same period we have seen teenage pregnancies and drug abuse by teens rise. However, very few leaders have come out strongly to help children. We need our leaders to be more concerned with what affects mwananchi. The government needs to come up with more projects involving teenagers and youths to keep them busy. Even before we begin the fight against teenage pregnancies, we need to know what the main problem is. Parents need to monitor the people their children hang around and what they do when hanging out.Too much freedom given to children has its consequences. We have many influencers, it is time they used their fame to benefit this generation. Most teenagers and youth admire celebrities for their lavish lifestyle and achievements. It is important for these celebrities to use their social media clout to encourage youth and develop slogans that promote morality. They need to explain to the youth that nothing comes easy and that they should be patient and work hard to succeed. Now our leaders have gone to the grassroots to get BBI signatures, which is not bad but they should show the same spirit when it comes to creating jobs and development programmes in their constituencies.
