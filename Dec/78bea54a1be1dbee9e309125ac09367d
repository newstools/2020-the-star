IPOA has summoned Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko to record a statement over his claims of police harassment. Sonko said his constitutional rights were infringed when police ambushed and teargassed his meeting with MCAs on November 30. In a statement on Wednesday, IPOA asked Sonko to appear before it on December 21 to shed light on to the incident. "Kindly treat this matter as extremely urgent," the statement read. The governor was in the meeting to stop his impeachment when police armed with tear gas canisters and guns stormed the private residence at Riverside and ordered the MCAs to leave. The police lobbed tear gas in the residence in an attempt to disperse the MCAs.  They temporarily arrested Sonko, taking him outside the compound. He was later released and escorted out by the MCAs. Sonko has discredited charges levelled against him, terming them flimsy, inaccurate and witch-hunt thus dead on arrival. Through lawyer Harrison Kinyanjui, Sonko pleaded with the senators to throw away the case, adding that it does meet the threshold of removing him from office. He said the charges are allegations aimed anchored on witch-hunt and malice and should therefore be thrown out. He was responding to MCAs who said Sonko is rogue, extravagant and plunderer of public resources and should go home. Through their lead lawyer Ndgewa Njiru, the ward reps claimed that Sonko has failed the leadership and integrity tests and brought disrepute to the office governor. “He has not only violated article 6 of the Constitution and acted in a manner that is sumptuous to the people of Kenya,” Njiru said.
