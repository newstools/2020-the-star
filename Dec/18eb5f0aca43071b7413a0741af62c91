Former Cooperatives minister Joe Nyagah forbade the public viewing of his body during his funeral, his family has said. Joe's younger brother Norman said, for this reason, the family will not allow his body to be viewed by relatives, friends and the public during his funeral at his Kamutungi farm in Mbeere South, Embu county on Saturday. Speaking to the press in Gachoka, Norman said his brother used to say that people should remember him as he was while alive and his body should not be viewed. Norman said his brother also declined to have new clothes bought for his body for burial. He willed that he should be buried next to his grandfather's grave facing the hills of Mbeere. Nairobi Anglican Bishop Joel Waweru will conduct the funeral service for Nyagah on Saturday. Norman added that Joe used to iron his own clothes while alive and his son, named after his father Jeremiah Nyagah, will do it. Norman said that Joe died of Covid-19 complications, adding that his lungs were 97.7 per cent damaged and would not have survived without a ventilator. He said his brother sought medical treatment late when Covid-19 had already damaged his lungs. Joe was admitted to Nairobi Hospital ICU on November 17 until December 11 when he died. Norman said the funeral will be held at the family's Mbeere home where they have a designated burial site. Their parents, grandfather and their late brother Zachariah are buried there. He said having lost him through Covid-19, they will be very strict during the funeral and anyone not adhering to the health protocols will be ejected from the service. Norman said Joe had many friends and although they expect many people to attend, they will limit the number to a thousand. The family has organised a link that will enable people from across the globe to follow the proceedings. A local media house will air the proceedings live. Edited by Henry Makori
