In seeking a post-Covid recovery strategy, the government has to literally look inside and outside the box. The government has to look at every single conceivable option available to jump-start the economy, which has shrunk to its lowest level ever. This means providing more incentives, making it easier to do business and to operate in this country. The government must ask itself what it can do to make it easier to operate a business, and that does not mean giving sectors money. For example, it takes one a hell of a time to do paperwork to start operating any tourism business. Across the world, the economy has shrunk. The government will have to activate all its sectors to ensure proper plans are deployed to rescue them and put them on a recovery path. The government will have to go sector by sector to see how to make it easier to operate and see how they can get back into business. The government will have to look at ways of enabling some start-up businesses to access cheaper money. For instance, we have the horticulture industry where interest rates have been the lowest but the cost of money in this country is so high compared to most countries. You will find that some countries have a system that is geared towards horticulture. This is the strategy the government should take to enable the sector have more access to cheaper loans so it can pick up. Every Cabinet minister, every principal secretary and every government official will have to go back to the drawing board and see how they can make it easier for business to recover. The government doesn't have a financial base. For the first TIME, the government has gone to the IMF for financial support because it does not have a lot of money to pay wages. The government will have to raise taxes because trying to revive activities post-Covid-19 is going to be a massive exercise. After this we may have a third wave, which will see a surge in other infectious diseases. The economist spoke to the Star
