Laikipia Governor Ndiritu Muriithi has accused some individuals of using the Judiciary to derail his efforts to introduce reforms for effective service delivery. He said on Thursday  that aggrieved members of staff have been manipulating the courts to stop these reforms. "You recently saw a senior official moving to court after being sacked whereas the action was as a result of incompetence and non-performance," Muriithi said. "In fact, people are entitled to justice as enshrined in the Constitution, but the Judiciary should dig deep into the issues presented before it." Earlier this year, Muriithi introduced mandatory performance appraisals for all employees in his administration. The governor clarified that the appraisals were meant to zero-in on lax and non-productive workers. The exercise, conducted in September this year, closed with the appraisal of the countyâ€™s executive committee members, chief officers and directors by the governor. He said the Education department was found to be the worst-performing.
