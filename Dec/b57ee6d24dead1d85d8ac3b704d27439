Jubilee Party has suspended three Nairobi Nominated MCAs - Anna Thumbi, Silvia Museiya and Millicent Jagero - for three months. They have also been suspended from all assembly committees for a period of six months. This means that the three MCAs will not earn anything outside their monthly salaries. An MCA earns a net salary of about Sh120, 000. In each committee sitting, an MCA pockets Sh3,900 while a chairperson gets Sh5,500. Jubilee has also made changes to the county assembly leadership. Dandora Three MCA Charles Thuo has replaced Hamza MCA Mark Ndung’u as the representative at the county assembly service board. Nominated MCA Juliet Ndegwa has replaced Dandora Two MCA Silas Matara from the Speaker’s panel. Ndegwa was the former Majority Whip while Thuo was the former Majority Leader. The two were kicked out of leadership in April when Jubilee Party made its changes in the house leadership. The changes were communicated by party Secretary General Raphel Tuju in a letter addressed to County Assembly Speaker Benson Mutura. The letter communicating the changes was addressed to Speaker Benson Mutura and copied to Majority Whip Paul Kados. Speaker Mutura communicated the changes in the afternoon plenary session. The changes come at a a time when the assembly has divided itself into two factions, pro-impeachment and anti- impeachment MCAs. The planned impeachment of Governor Mike Sonko was on Tuesday temporarily stopped by the Labour and Employment court. However the pro-impeachment MCAs have insisted that the impeachment will continue as planned.
