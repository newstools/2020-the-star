Angry villagers on Tuesday night torched the house of an assistant chief whom they accused of fatally attacking one of them over violation of curfew hours. The enraged villagers carried the body of the deceased on Tuesday and dumped it in the home of the administrator to protest against the chief and set his house able moments later. Daniel Namai, the Ituti assistant chief is reported to have attacked Moses Vushuru on Christmas eve when he found him outside past curfew hours and left him for the dead. â€œI was alerted by a huge fire coming on top of the administrator's house, a few meters from my home. When I reached the scene I found rowdy and angry residents baying for the blood of the who was not at home," said Abel Ambunya, a resident. The assistant chief had gone missing during the incident after getting wind of plans from the locals to punish him. The body of the deceased was removed from the assistant chief's homestead by police officer from Butere Police station who arrived at the scene before taking it to St. Mary's Mission Hospital in Mumias. Butere sub-county police Commander Alexander Makau said the chief was being held at Butere Police station as investigations into the claims by the family commenced. "We are holding the chief to try and establish whether he was involved in the death or not," the police boss said. The family of the suspected chief is taking refuge at the same police station for fear of further attacks by the villagers.
