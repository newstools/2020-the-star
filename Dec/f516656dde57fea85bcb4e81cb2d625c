More than 400 farmers in Nyalani in Kwale county will be able to irrigate over 100 acres of land daily through a Sh16 million solar project to boost crop production. Governor Salim Mvurya said the project will supplement electricity supply from Kenya Power to Nyalani Dam to provide sufficient water for irrigation. “Since power blackouts are very frequent, the solar energy will prompt continuous pumping of water from the dam to the farms,” he said. Mvurya spoke on Thursday while launching the project in Vigurungani. The governor said the residents will also get clean drinking water as the pumping machines is designed to purify it. The solar project will cut the operation cost for running diesel generators and reduce electricity bills. The 192 solar panels can produce energy equal to three-phase power units. They can last for over 20 years. The project is a continuation of the rehabilitation of the Nyalani Dam that had earlier cost Sh232 million. The Kwale administration and Safaricom's M-Pesa Foundation funded the project. Residents have for years relied on food relief because of the area’s harsh climatic condition. Mvurya said his government is making efforts to mitigate the effects of hunger and drought by setting up various dams for irrigation farming. The county boss said he wants to replicate the Nyalani Dam programme in areas experiencing similar problems. He said the county is sinking more boreholes and piping water to larger areas of Lunga Lunga, Matuga, Msambweni and Kinango subcounties. M-Pesa Foundation executive director Les Baillie told residents to take good care of the project. “We believe that we have put in place a project that is sustainable. Please don’t come again in two years saying we failed to maintain it because you won’t get a warm reception from us,” he said. Baillie said the Nyalani project creates economic empowerment that will bring about financial stability to the residents.
