The 10th edition of the annual Kalasha International Film and TV Awards went down on Saturday night at the Sarit Centre. Things were different this year as the winners accepted the awards virtually. The event was attended by Kenya Film Commission CEO Timothy Owase, ICT, Innovation and Youth Affairs Cabinet Secretary Joe Mucheru and Israeli Ambassador Obed Joseph. The best TV drama went to Citizen TV's Maria, best host in a TV show went to Nick Ndeda, lead actress in a TV drama went to Maria's Yasmeen Said while best actor in a TV drama went to Len Ongaya of Pete. Best director went to Victor Gatonye of 40 Sticks. Best TV comedy went to Varshita; the show's Mrs Wang'ombe took home the best performance in a TV comedy award. Speaking during a conference on Friday, Owase said they had introduced a new category. "From our research, there has been a growing need for content for children on our screens and as a result, the commission introduced the best children production category to acknowledge those who have developed concepts to accommodate our young ones as screen audiences." He said a film-friendly production environment will involve a shared, positive view of the industry across a range of different government departments, agencies and other entities. "The Labour Statistics for Film and Related activities data from the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics 2020 economic survey indicated that about 123,290 jobs existed directly in the film industry in 2018 with a 5.3 per cent increase recorded last year."
