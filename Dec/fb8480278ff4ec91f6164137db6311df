All livestock grazing illegally in Mukundo forest in Laikipia North must be driven out at once. That's what Environment CS Keriako Tobiko told tycoons and illegal herders on Sunday while delivering assistance to communities neighbouring the forest. He said some people have been using the indigenous forest as a hideout for stolen animals and have contributed to its destruction. “Some tycoons have been buying calves and grazing them in the 30,000-hectare (74,130-acre) forest, [along with] livestock stolen from neighbouring counties‚”  Tobiko said. He said the illegal herders have been using the forest as a commercial ranch where they fatten stolen animals for sale. He told the owners drive their animals out immediately. Tobiko said there are clear guidelines to protect the forest but illegal herders from other counties have migrated there, so there's no conservation. “The Maasai community never used to graze in the forest during the rainy season. When they did during a drought, there were guidelines on the number of livestock and where they could graze in the forest," he said. The CS said mass tree planting will take place at the start of every rainy season to restore the forest. Laikipia North MP Sarah Lekorere said residents have remained calm despite the invasion of herders, so peace has been maintained. “We urge residents to support the government to ensure the forest is protected. They should use resources wisely to make a profit as provided in the Forest Management Plan‚”  she said. She called on President Uhuru Kenyatta not to forget the region and to appoint senior officials from Laikipia North, which she said has been left behind. Edited by Kiilu Damaris
