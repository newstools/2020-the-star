The number of street families has continued to rise despite interventions being put in place by state and non-state actors. Existing interventions to rehabilitate them have largely remained inadequate due to poorly designed interventions, lack of understanding of the rehabilitation process and lack of institutionalised systems to assess and classify street families. Poor coordination between service providers and a lack of clear national policy and legislation to deal with street families have also been blamed. But now a national policy on rehabilitation of street families has been developed under the stewardship of the Street Families Rehabilitation Trust Fund Board of Trustees (SFRTF) to address these concerns. Board of Trustee member Alex Masibo said they will use an interagency approach to effectively implement the policy. He said the policy will provide a coherent and sustainable framework for the rehabilitation of street families. It will also provide a coordinated framework to support and empower vulnerable families to resilient livelihoods. Those already on the streets will be rescued and enrolled in rehabilitation programmes designed to make them self-reliant after reintegrating them into the community. The Ministry of Labour and Social Protection, State Department for Social Protection shall oversee the overall coordination and implementation of this policy through SFRTF. County governments will domesticate the policy, provide technical support and build the capacity of county staff. The National Census of Street Families conducted in 2018 revealed that the number of people living on and connected to the streets in Kenya was 46,639 with Nairobi reporting the highest concentrations of street persons with 15,337, Mombasa 7,529 and Kisumu 2,746.
