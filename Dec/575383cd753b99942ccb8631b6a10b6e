The Kisumu city manager has taken charge of the Sh37 million Chichwa market following concerns by traders of disorganisation and mismanagement. The market was opened in May to accommodate traders who were evicted from Luangni-Lakefront, Winmart, Akamba and Railways areas for the non-motorised transport project. Acting city manager Abala Wanga said his officers will tour the market on Tuesday and inform traders of the management takeover plans. Wanga said the city will manage the cleanliness, waste collection and organise traders to work in a safe environment. The city management will also take care of security and enforcement of trading and space rules in the market. Wanga said his office does not recognise any group, brokers and cartels masquerading as the owners of the market. “Such people must henceforth stop pretending to be the professionals and managers of the market,” he said. Wanga told traders to continue with their businesses but not pay anybody or association any cash until they sort any pending issues at the market. Chichwa is a component of the Sh241 million non-motorised transport project, which is meant to ensure pedestrians and cyclists enjoy improved convenience, comfort, and safety. Its stalls accommodate 518 traders and an open-air section for 240 others. The NMT corridor covers Ang’awa Street, Oginga Odinga Street, and Jomo Kenyatta Avenue. It is funded by the World Bank through the State Department of Urban Development under the Kenya Urban Support Programme. Chichwa has water reticulation, electricity, spacious stalls, security services, controlled trading areas. It also has three ultra-modern ablution blocks.
