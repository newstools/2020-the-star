Malava MP Malulu Injendi has returned to Deputy President William Ruto’s fold after a two-week dalliance with ODM leader Raila Odinga. Malulu had on December 2 declared support for the BBI process when he joined Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya at Bukhungu Stadium during the launch of BBI signature collection. He met the former Prime Minister and Oparanya in Nairobi two days later in what was seen as a major boost for the BBI grouping. “I was pleased to receive MP Injendi who informed me that he has had a change of heart and has decided to join the team promoting the BBI initiative. He was accompanied by Oparanya. Karibu sana Malulu,” Raila posted on his Twitter handle after their meeting. But speaking during a funeral service in the constituency on Friday, Malulu said Oparanya asked him to accompany him to meet someone who would assist him to ensure that Malava constituency was one of those to be split under the 70 additional elective areas proposed by the BBI. “I did not know that I was going to meet Raila, but I was following up about the constituency. If Oparanya had told me that we were going to meet Raila, I would have declined to accompany him,” he said. “I realised that what Raila was talking about was not clear when my minds were on the constituency.” Malulu said he will continue to support DP Ruto’s presidential bid in 2022. Oparanya neither picked up calls nor replied to SMSs sent to his mobile phone for comment.
