The IndependentÂ  Policing Oversight Authority has launched investigations on three police offices caught on camera assaulting a motorist. The three were captured in a video assaulting the motorist and a journalist who recorded the incident in Nakuru County. "Consequently, IPOA on its own motion has this afternoon launched investigations into the assault and injury of the two people," IPOA chairperson Anne Makori said in a statement. She added that in the course of investigations if culpability is found or further misconduct established, the Authority will make appropriate recommendations against the police officers. In the video, the motorist was seen confronting one police officer for allegedly hitting his car. The two started getting physical before two other police officers - a man and a woman- joined in and the three started beating the man. The second male officer noticed the journalist recording the incident and charged at him injuring him. But in response, the National Police Service on Saturday said that the video circulating has not shown the full incident as it occurred. "The said motorist was stopped while overlapping along the busy Nairobi Nakuru highway. Upon stopping he assaulted the police officer. Members of the public alerted the rest of the officers who were on the opposite side of the road. The officers gave a reinforcement and managed to subdue him and effected his arrest," the NPS said in a post on Twitter.
