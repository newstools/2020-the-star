Gospel singer Joyce Omondi says her husband Waihiga Mwaura has been helping in her music career. Speaking on 'Bambika show,' where she launched her new song 'Naamini,' Joyce said, "I need to give Waihiga credits for coming up with the name 'Spirit vs Soul'." Adding, "He is the one who wrote the first piece, which is like a spoken word piece." She said most of her songs draw inspiration from the scriptures. "This year I've been in a process of being honest with God in my conversations and speaking out what I feel. That's how my songs have come about," she said. "If you listen to my music, they have been consistently based on scripture. When I'm studying and doing my devotions, I get the moment where I remind myself of his word."
