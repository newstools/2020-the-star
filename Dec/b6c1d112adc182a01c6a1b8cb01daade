Wiper party leader Kalonzo Musyoka and various leaders trooped to Lee funeral home in Nairobi to pay respect to the late Machakos senator Boniface Kabaka soon after his death was confirmed. The leaders together with the family and friends started arriving at the morgue at around noon after the body had been transferred from Nairobi Hospital. Kabaka died at the Nairobi Hospital where he had been receiving treatment in the Intensive Care Unit. Addressing the press after viewing the body, Kalonzo said the death was not only a big blow to the family and the people of Machakos but to the whole country. Kalonzo urged the media to be kind with its reporting on the death of the legislator and the family during this trying moment. “Let him rest in peace. Let us not make it more difficult for the family,” he said. With him were senators Enock Wambua (Kitui), Johnson Sakaja (Nairobi), Gertrude Musuruve (Nominated), Samson Cherargei (Nandi), Fatuma Dullo (Isiolo), and legislator Kennedy Musyoka (EALA). Wambua said Senate speaker Ken Lusaka had to cut short an official function in Naivasha following the death of the legislator. “The speaker had to come back after getting the news. He is the one who will be giving updates on any arrangements going forward,” Wambua said. Kalonzo said Kabaka had undergone a procedure to remove a clot before his passing. The senator was rushed to hospital on Friday, December 4, after he collapsed while in the company of a high school teacher at 3Dee Apartments in Nairobi's Kilimani area. The woman, Esther Muli, was arrested on Monday and was released on Wednesday after police found no foul play. The first time senator was also a part-time lecturer at the Catholic University of Eastern Africa as well as a senior partner at Kabaka and Associates Advocates.  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
