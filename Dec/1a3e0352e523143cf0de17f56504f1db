Neno Evangelist founder Pastor James Ng'ang'a has called out congregants who always request for handouts from him. In a viral video that was taken from his preaching, an angry Ng'ang'a condemns the people, saying they should instead ask for the government to pay their rent and feed their children, not the pastor. "I cannot give money to them. Will I build their house or will I build the house of God?" he asked angrily, adding that he is also struggling to buy building materials. Ng'ang'a in another video lashed out at a Kenyan who sent him a text message, requesting for prayers to have his business flourish amid the coronavirus pandemic. Pastor Ng'ang'a is currently in Kajiado, where he is building a church which he calls 'Jerusalem City'. He also preaches online every day on his social media platforms and uploads his preaching on his YouTube channel. Edited by T Jalio
