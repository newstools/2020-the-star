The Kenya Revenue Authority has intensified the fight against the importation of contraband into the country through the Taveta-Holili One-Stop Border Post in Taita Taveta county. KRA Commissioner of Investigation and Enforcement Department David Yego said detectives intercepted and seized restricted goods worth more than Sh10 million at the border. The goods were seized in an operation conducted by detectives from the KRA enforcement units and the National Police Service at the border following intelligence reports. The goods worth more than Sh10 million included ethanol, assorted cosmetics, used textiles, used footwear, soap and handkerchiefs. Yego revealed that the goods were wrongly declared as sandals manufactured in Tanzania to avoid the law on the importation of contraband. Yego said the detectives arrested a suspect in connection with a part of the consignment. The suspect, Joseph Wakagwi Ndungi alias Kiganjo, is believed to be part of a syndicate involved in the importation of contraband. Ndungi was arraigned before the Taveta principal magistrate Benson Khapoya facing two counts of importing restricted goods and concealment of goods contrary to provisions of the East African Community Customs Management Act. He pleaded not guilty and was released on Sh1 million bond. The case is scheduled for mention on December 14 and hearing on December 16. “Suspects behind the scheme attempted to sneak the goods into the Kenyan market in five trucks before the interception and efforts are underway to track other suspects involved in the illegal trade”‚ he said. Yego said if those behind the racket could have succeeded in their scheme, the government would have lost more than Sh6 million in tax revenue. “KRA is determined to detect and disrupt tax evasion schemes and prosecute criminals who engage in concealment and smuggling of goods through our borders to ensure that all individuals pay their fair share of taxes,” Yego said.
