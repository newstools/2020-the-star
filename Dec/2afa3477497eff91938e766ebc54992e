Chief Inspector of Police has been arrested for sodomising four boys and two adults for an unspecified period in Chogoria, Tharaka Nithi county. "Upon expeditious interrogation of the boys, it was established that the senior officer has been sodomizing them for an unspecified period," DCI George Kinoti said. Via Twitter on Tuesday, Kinoti said in a horror-like scene the boys were found sleeping on the floor in the perpetrator’s house in within Chogoria Township. "The perpetrator is supposed to safeguard the rights of such victims as a law enforcement officer," Kinoti said. Kinoti said officers rescued the four boys aged between 14-15 years and two young adults of 18 & 19 years, from the yoke of sodomy. "The suspect has since been placed in custody pending further investigations and arraignment," he said. He thanked the member of the public who provided information leading to the perpetrator’s arrest. "Equally, we appeal to Kenyans to continue making such reports anonymously, through the DCI emergency toll free line 0800722203, for decisive action by our detectives," he added.
