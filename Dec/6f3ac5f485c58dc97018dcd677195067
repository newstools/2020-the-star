Amos of the Amos and Josh duo has partnered with the Peter Ojiambo Foundation as their brand ambassador for the disabled programme. Speaking to Word Is, Amos said the decision was a personal project for him. "I have been brought up by a disabled mother and this did not deter me from achieving my goals in life," he said. "I work with the foundation to give hope to those who are being raised by disabled parents and motivate parents who are suffering from a disability. We want these people to stop feeling inadequate and alone but let also let them know they have what it takes to lead a successful life, just like everyone else." Amos is currently working on an EP that will be coming out next year, themed on raising awareness on disability
