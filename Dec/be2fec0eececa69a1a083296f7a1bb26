A boda boda rider has committed suicide in Ndhiwa constituency after his first wife deserted him over domestic squabbles. They had separated a month ago. The 28-year-old man Jackson Abiola took away his life at Kotieno village in Central Kabuoch on Wednesday night. Abiola committed suicide in the bedroom of his first wife using pieces of cloth which he had woven into a rope. The body was found dangling from the roof on Thursday morning. Area chief Capiss Olala said Abiola got angry after his wife left him with the children. The woman reportedly did not tell him where she had gone or when she'd return. “The young man has had domestic problems with his first wife. It is suspected that he committed suicide because of the wife’s decision to walk out of the marriage,” Olala said. His second wife was still with him. “The second wife is still in the marriage and she has been rented a house in Rodi Kopany township,” the chief said. Olala said Abiola had never demonstrated any psychosocial problems prior to his death. “He was seen in the village in his normal mood but he never shared his problems with anybody,” the administrator added. The matter was reported to Ndhiwa police station for investigatios. The administrator urged residents to seek guidance and counseling services whenever they face problems in the society instead of resorting to suicide. The  body was moved to Homa Bay Referral Hospital mortuary for a postmortem.
