@robertomollo3 Two young politicians have asked Homa Bay youths to respect elected leaders and shun sponsors of violence during electioneering periods. Former Kabondo Kasipul MP Sylvance Osele and businessman Jared Otieno told the youths to give elected leaders time to deliver on their election pledges. Otieno said respecting leaders would enhance their collective push for the kind of development required in the county. “I want youths in Homa Bay to remain focused on how they can transform this county. We shouldn’t be the people used to abuse elected leaders and cause chaos,” Otieno said. The two politicians spoke during a funds drive at Ringa Catholic Church on Sunday. “You must respect yourself before expecting others to respect you. People are judged based on how they behave,” Otieno said. He said there were only a handful of youthful leaders in the National Assembly, Senate and county assemblies because youths have been unable to marshal resources and campaign for elective positions. Otieno told the youths to let their leaders work but come up and contest elective positions in the 2022 elections. “Let’s change tack and approach the 2022 polls as a united team. Youths are the majority and can easily win the political positions they want,” he added. Osele asked serving leaders to be accountable to the people. “A good leader should be a person who works for the people. One who can easily be reached in the time of need,” Osele said.
