Migori police are holding a suspect arrested on Saturday with elephant tusks worth Sh5.4million. Kenya Wildlife Service officers from Narok and Migori counties arrested the suspect after getting information from the public. Migori county police boss Manase Musyoka said the suspect had trophies weighing 54 kilograms with a street value of Sh5.4 million packed in sacks of charcoal. "He packed the ivory inside a sack of charcoals and was transporting them from Narok to Migori when he was arrested by KWS officers," Musyoka said. He congratulated members of the public for giving the information that led to the arrest of the suspect. Musyoka said several reports on illegal trafficking have been made in Migori. They hope to confiscate more illegal goods in cooperation with members of the public. The suspect, a 40year-old, will be arraigned on Monday.
