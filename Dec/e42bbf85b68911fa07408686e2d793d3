A police officer is among three arrested in the robbery incident in Businessman Manu Chandaria's home in Muthaiga. DCI George Kinoti said Police Constable Jared Makambe was arrested alongside two other private guards Judah Wafula and Stephen Omwega. Makambe is reported to have been on guard at the businessman's residence during the Sunday incident. Kinoti said two armed thugs gained entry into Chandaria's house and robbed him of an unknown amount of money and assorted jewelry at gunpoint. The thugs then escaped while firing a G3 rifle alleged to have been stolen from the AP officer on guard. "Officers responding to the scene conducted a thorough search leading to the recovery of the suspected stolen G3 rifle at a nearby bush," he said. The trio are in lawful custody as further investigations ensue. Kinoti appealed for any information that may help with the investigations. Those with information should call DCI Hotline Number - 0800 722 203.
