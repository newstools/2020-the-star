Esther Mwihaki Kamau is the new Gaturi MCA in Kiharu constituency, Murang'a county. Mwihaki was elected through the People’s Empowerment Party during Tuesday's by-election. She garnered 3,974 votes, winning against eight other contestants. Mwihaki, a former journalist, joined PEP after losing to former MCA Rosemary Wakuthii during the Jubilee party nominations in August. In Tuesday's by-election, Wakuthii came second after getting 3,433 votes. Wakuthii served as the area MCA from 2013 to 2017. She was dethroned by Kiiru Mwangi, who passed away in July this year after a long illness. While receiving her certificate at Gaturi Girls Secondary School on Tuesday, Mwihaki pledged to improve the lives of residents by helping implement development projects in the semi-arid area. Water is also one of the main challenges residents face. Mwihaki praised the government for implementing several water projects, saying she would work with the county and national governments to lay pipes. Area MP Ndindi Nyoro, who largely kept off the campaigns, said he would work with the MCA-elect to develop the area. Governor Mwangi wa Iria had openly supported Wakuthii, as did Senator Irungu Kang’ata who is also Senate Majority Chief Whip. Edited by A.N
