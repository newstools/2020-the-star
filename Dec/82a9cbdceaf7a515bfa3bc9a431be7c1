Claims of palm-greasing senators emerged as lawmakers heard Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko's (pictured) impeachment case. A mole has disclosed that a senior Jubilee politician dished out Sh300,000 to each lawmaker as inducement to save the beleaguered governor whose job and political career were on the line. The politician was said to be been holding night meetings with the senators as part of the behind-the-scene manoeuvres to save the county boss. He faces a myriad of allegations from MCAs who say he's unfit to run the capital city-county. Sonko says it's all fabrication and a witch-hunt. A lawmaker from one of the Nyanza counties has been literally forced to camp in his constituency, something that was unheard of in the past. Insiders tell Corridors of Power the arrival of a philanthropist with huge foreign networks and who has declared interest in the seat in 2022 is giving the lawmaker sleepless nights. In trying to counter the growing influence of his opponent, the MP has come up with hurriedly planned programmes in his constituency. Sometimes he even inspects finished projects he had commissioned in past years. Just days after Raila Odinga's ODM party humiliating defeat in the Msambweni parliamentary by-election, a storm has erupted in the Orange headquarters. Some insiders, including MPs, are now pointing fingers at two individuals whom they accuse of executing an elaborate scheme to run down the once-giant party. According to party stalwarts, it is time to send packing the individuals who have branded themselves partyâ€™s untouchables, yet have nothing to show for their big talk. The duo is being blamed for the continued dismal performance of the outfit, especially in by-elections.
