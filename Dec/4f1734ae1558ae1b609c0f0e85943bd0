ODM survived Deputy President William Ruto's axe in the Dabaso ward by-election after its candidate won with a thin margin of only 148 votes. ODM's Dickson Karani garnered 2,499 votes while the immediate former MCA Emmanuel Changawa of MDG supported by Ruto got 2,351 votes. A sad Changawa was present at the tallying centre with a torn shirt after he was attacked by suspected supporters of his rival. He led in the first 17 polling stations out of 22 but things changed abruptly upon announcement of the 18th polling station. Voter turnout was very low at 38.56 per cent. Out of the 12,618 registered voters only 4,866 votes were cast and the winner won with 51 per cent. The election was marred by allegations of intimidation, voter bribery and harassment believed to have contributed to low turnout. Karani in his acceptance speech said he was happy with the victory and thanked voters, IEBC, security personnel and all those who supported his campaign. "I would like to urge my opponent to join me in the development agenda and keep aside our differences for the sake of the people," he said. Karani said even with the limited time he would be in office, it will be possible to deliver his mandate of transforming the ward. He promised to complete all projects started by Changawa so that they become a success for all people. The Dabaso ward seat was declared vacant after the court nullified the election of Changawa following a successful petition by Karani. Edited by Henry Makori
