NINETEEN applications have been received for the vacant Kenya Under-20 head coach position. Kenya Rugby Union acting chief executive officer and director of rugby, Thomas Odundo, said nine locals and 10 foreign coaches had shown interest in the job following the elevation of Paul Odera to head coach position at Simbas. Sources close to KRU revealed that the union will most likely settle for a local coach due to the financial challenges they are facing with former Kenya Sevens and Under-20 coach Paul Murunga a frontrunner for the job. Odundo said the winning candidate will be appointed come the end of this month with interviews currently on going virtually. “ The interviews are on going virtually with the candidates and by the end of the end of the month we will have the coach”noted Odundo The Kenya Under-20 team, also known as Chipu, ended Namibia's dominance of Africa in the category to bag the coveted Africa Championship after beating the favourites 21-18 in the final at the KCB Sports Club in Ruaraka. Chipu thus qualified for the Junior Rugby World trophy (JWRT)  last year in Brazil after sealing the Africa ticket after beating the hosts 26-24, losing 63-11 to Uruguay and 48-34 to eventual winners Japan in the pool stages. Odundo said the target will be to qualify for the Junior Rugby World Trophy for the second successive time in the new year with Kenya staging the event again for the next three years after being accorded hosting rights by Rugby Africa. "Our goal will be to qualify for the global tournament but first we need to qualify and get the green-light in as far as the Covid-19 situation is concerned," added Odundo. He added that World Rugby will in the new year give dates to Kenya's World Cup qualifier clash against Colombia.
