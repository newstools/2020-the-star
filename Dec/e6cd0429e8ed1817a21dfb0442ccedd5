There is light at the of the tunnel for the swimming fraternity after a date for the eagerly-awaited elections was announced. Sports Disputes Tribunal chairman John Ohaga released a timetable that will see a Special General Meeting held on January 9, followed by the nominations of officials on January 15 and culminate with the elections on January 30. The elections, which have been postponed twice in the past couple of years, now look to go ahead following the release of the constitution. World governing body FINA suspended the Kenya Swimming Federation until the enactment of a new constitution and national polls. Ohaga said he is confident that the fraternity will choose strong and credible leaders."With the timeline already out, we hope that the fraternity can elect people of integrity, who will serve selflessly," he said. The Special General Meeting and the polls will likely be held virtually due to the Covid-19 pandemic, according to Ohaga. “Initially there was a lot of suspicion among stakeholders. They were asking questions why we are going virtual but they can see that it's for their own good," said Ohaga. The new constitution bars those who have had integrity issues or questionable conduct from previous administrations from presenting themselves as candidates from the forthcoming polls. Issues yet to be resolved ahead of the polls are books of accounts of the interim management committee(IMC), which handled the KSF finances in the last three years. Ohaga has termed the journey to the polls as one of the toughest he has ever faced as an administrator. "When we came on board, we thought we could be in an interim position for a couple of months. But due to entrenched interests by various parties, it has taken this long to come to an agreement," he said. Ohaga said further details on the elections process will be released in the next couple of weeks. "There is a committee fine-tuning the process and they will give us updates on the forward.”
