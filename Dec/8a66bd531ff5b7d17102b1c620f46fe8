Health authorities in Kitui county are concerned that over 5,000 children missed out on crucial immunisation doses during Covid-19 period. County's Expanded Program on Immunisation focal person Henry Muinde said on Wednesday that immunisation coverage in the county had dropped from 80 per cent  to 70 per cent. He said between January and September this year, 5,242 children from remote subcounties of Mwingi North, Kitui East and Kitui South, missed out on immunisation. This exposes them to preventable diseases. Muinde was addressing a workshop that brought together health personnel and journalists in Kitui. The meeting was meant to seek a partnership to create awareness to ensure no child was left out in immunisation. “Immunised persons are prevented from particular ailments,” he said. Muinde said Covid-19 had also led to reduced visits to health facilities.
