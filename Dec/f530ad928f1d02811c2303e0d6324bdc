Keroche heiress Anerlisa Muigai and her Tanzanian hubby Ben Pol have never publicly spoken about their private wedding, which took place early this year. The couple has kept their private life hush-hush until recently when Ben Pol had an interview with Millard Ayo. Asked if his marriage is in trouble, Ben Pol said; "To say the truth, I also would like to talk about it because we got a lot of support from people who would also like to know the status of our marriage. But at the moment, out of respect, allow me not to talk about it. I will address this at a later date." When asked to advise anyone who is planning to get into marriage, Ben said one should first ask God to give them a good person. "That is very important because if you choose looks and not consider the inner person, it will be hard," he said. "Marriage is a gamble so if you did not look at those aspects or involved God, then there are chances of losing out. If you pray to God and put Him first, you will get your soulmate. Even if they will have their shortcomings, it will be easy to cope." He also advised couples not no wait for problems before seeing a counsellor. "Don't wait to go there and work on your marriage and selves. Make it a habit to also pray together." Fellow celebrities have been DMing Anerlisa, yet they know she is married. Ben Pol explained, "I have witnessed that but it doesnâ€™t bother me because you are dealing with your wife and not with outside forces. The only problem is when they change or when you start fighting with the outside forces, which drains your energy. "You will not think about gifting your lover with flowers because your sole focus will be fighting hangers ones." Ben Pol said the seedy DMs come from entertainers, producers and even actors.
