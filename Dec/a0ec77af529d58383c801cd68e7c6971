Kenya will host the ITF World Junior Championships between January 18 and February 6, 2021, at the Nairobi Club. Speaking on Wednesday, Tennis Kenya administrator Nancy Nduku said  preparations for the event are ongoing and will be finalised by mid next week "This will be our first big tournament following the Covid-19 break and so we are making sure everything goes to plan," said Nduku. The country will be represented by some of its emerging talents including high-flying Rosehilda Asumwa, Alicia Owegi, Cynthia Cheruto and Faith Urasa in the girls' category. Zayan Varani, Brian Nyakundi, Edward Mwakio, Sayush Bhandari, Daniel Mbuvi, and Vincent Githinji set to compete in the boys' category. Tennis is one of the few sports given the Ministry of Sports' green light to resume activities under strict Covid-19 protocols. The Kenyan contingent is preparing for the event by playing at the Tennis Kenya Junior Challenge tournament, currently going on at the Nairobi club. Cheruto said next year's event will aid their push for raking points and playing at home will give them an added advantage. "Playing in junior events has really helped us. We have been away from tennis for close to nine months and it is therefore great to be back. The Challenge tournament will help in building our fitness as we prepare for the ITF event,” said Cheruto. "Our players are really working hard on their game and we hope that come the new year, we will be in good shape and dominate both the boys and girls' categories." Elsewhere, the Tennis Kenya Annual General Meeting will be held virtually on Friday. The federation is expected to receive reports from the chairman, secretary and treasurer on the state of tennis in the country and the programme for 2021.
