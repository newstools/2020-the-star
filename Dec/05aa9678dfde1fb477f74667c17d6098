A man who killed his mother in a land dispute in Kenyenya, Kisii county, has been lynched. James Arumba was beaten by a crowd at Mogonga township on Sunday and rescued by police but it was too late. He was pronounced dead on arrival at Kenyenya Subcounty Hospital. Subcounty police commander Philip Oyugi said they had begun a manhunt for him. "He has been on the run only to resurface on Sunday at Mogonga township where members of the public beat him," Oyugi said. Officers pulled him away from the crowd but failed to save his life Arumba had been pressuring his mother, Teresa Moragwa, to subdivide the family land. He wanted to hive off a piece from his share and sell it to buy a boda boda, neighbours said. The mother once had fled her home to escape her son's death threats but returned. She was found dead, strangled with a piece of cloth. Isabel Okindo, Arumba's sister, said their mother had been receiving death threats from her brother for weeks. (Edited by V. Graham)
