Kirinyaga county government has launched an accelerated Covid-19 prevention campaign programme to control the spread of the virus in the villages. The campaign is being spearheaded by the Health department. Governor Anne Waiguru said health workers and community health volunteers will go to villages, towns, markets, schools and bus parks to educate residents on the need to strictly adhere to all Covid-19 prevention measures. “It is now imperative that we observe the recommended preventive measures at all times and make it a personal responsibility to ensure that we do not contract the disease out of negligence,” she said. The governor said traders should not serve customers who do not have masks on. Consequently, customers should not allow traders without masks to serve them. Waiguru said her administration has continued to increase the capacity to manage Covid-19 in the county. The administration recently procured five ventilators and portable oxygen for use in isolation centres. She added that 300 isolation beds are ready, waiting to be placed in one wing of the upcoming medical complex at Kerugoya.
