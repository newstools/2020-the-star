 Kitui Deputy Governor Wathe Nzau did not append his signature for the BBI drive because he feels there is nothing beneficial to Kitui residents. Nzau on Wednesday said proposals by Kitui residents including the demand for Mwingi region to be made a county were left out. Kitui county also failed to get an additional constituency out of the 70 new electoral units created by the Building Bridges Initiative. "My conscience could not allow me to append or lobby people to append their signatures in support of BBI as there is nothing good for the over one million Kitui people who have been denied extra constituencies and the demand for new Mwingi county turned down," Nzau said. He was speaking in Mwingi town where he represented Governor Charity Ngilu at a forum on donkey husbandry. “As a leader, I felt it was not worthy to append our signatures and approve the BBI without the inclusion of Mwingi county in the document,” the deputy governor said. Ngilu is among regional leaders championing the BBI in Ukambani region. The collection of signatures was concluded last week. At least 100,000 Kitui county voters appended their signatures. Nzau said supporting the BBI would be like accepting a blank cheque. “That makes us become captives,” he said. “As the deputy governor, I am not supporting the BBI as it is unless there is the inclusion of Mwingi county and additional constituencies for Kitui. Funny enough, Kitui with a population of 1.12 million people really needs an extra constituency. It is unfair,” Nzau said. He said Kitui deserved at least two additional constituencies.
