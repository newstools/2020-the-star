The Lake Basin Development Authority on Friday handed over a Sh6.5 million water project to residents of Katang’a in Kasipul constituency. The Katang’a project is expected to end the perennial water shortage and benefit 17,000 people. The solar-powered water project produces at least 144,000 liters of water per day. The project was done within Katang'a Primary School in West Kasipul ward. Speaking during the handover ceremony, LBDA chairman Odoyo Owidi said the project will help residents who no longer will have to walk long distances for water. Hygiene and health will also improve. “Residents have been facing sanitation problems due to lack of water. The project is especially timely as water is important in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic,” Owidi said. The chairman was joined by Beatrice Obingo and manager of water resources development Jacob Akuno. Also present were LVSWDA director Anne Michura and Kisumu Roads executive Joyce Osogo. Owidi said LBDA will fence the project to prevent vandalism and urged security officers to safeguard the project. He urged residents to come up with a way of generating a little income to maintain the project. Akuno said installed solar panels are for pumping water in water tanks. “The water is clean and safe for human consumption since it has undergone chemical and bacterial tests in the government laboratory,” he said. Akuno said the water project can also be used for small-scale irrigation. “Residents can also use this water to grow crops. Those who take advantage of it will make milestones in economic development,” he said. Distribution of the water will be extended to Oyuma market. Residents led by Mary Auma and David Onyango said the project will transform their lives and improve their health. (Edited by V. Graham)
