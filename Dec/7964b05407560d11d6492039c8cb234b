Governor Mike Sonko is a poor listener who will do anything to demean people around him, Beatrice Elachi has said. The former Nairobi County Speaker said a time has come for the governor to face his fate. Sonko is currently facing the senate in regards his impeachment. "This is not just about the Senate, God is not happy and the governor must face that reality. All he has been doing is using intimidation and blackmail while doing things the wrong way," Elachi said. Speaking to KTN on Thursday, Elachi who is also a former Senator said Sonko has been joking with a position bestowed to him. "He must now understand that is not a court process but a political issue and as a matter of fact, you cannot appear before a court when you have not wronged," she said. Elachi said Sonko must look at the journey he has walked and reflect on what he has done wrong. "Sonko has been doing an injustice to the people of Nairobi by using tactics to survive while using money to buy everything and everyone," Elachi said. While appearing before the senate on Thursday, Sonko dismissed the allegations levelled against him by MCAs as political and ones driven by malice and character assassination. Sonko denied diverting Sh297 million meant for bursaries for needy students in the county. He tabled documents showing vouchers and bank accounts of the schools where the cash was channelled in the 2018-19 financial year. “The Sh297 million for 2018-19 was availed for payment of bursaries,” Sonko said. The MCAs accuse the county boss of diverting the money meant for payment of fees for poor students to pay lawyers. However, Sonko dismissed the claim and instead accused the sponsor of the ouster motion of engaging in character assassination.
