The Energy, Petroleum Regulatory Authority Director-General Pavel Oimeke spent the night at EACC basement cells after allegedly receiving a Sh200,000 bribe. He is said to have received the bribe to approve the opening of a fuel station in Oyugis town. Oimeke will be questioned today at the EACC offices and probably be released before a decision is made to charge him or not. He was arrested after receiving the money from an employee of the Oyugis-based fuel station. The employee had sought Oimeke's help in having the facility re-opened after it's closure. EACC said that the complainant had handed over the bribe at Oimeke’s office and was issued with the approval letter leading to his arrest by EACC detectives.
