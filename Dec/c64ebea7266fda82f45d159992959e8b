Deputy President William Ruto's motivational talk and the accompanying Sh1 million gift he handed to Harambee Stars have all attracted a Sh1.1m fine by the Confederation of African Football. CAF have penalised the Football Kenya Federation after they allowed Ruto and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga to breach the prescribed Covid-19 guidelines during Kenya's African Cup of Nations qualifier against the Comoros Islands at Kasarani Stadium on November 11. The two dignitaries barged onto the main pitch after the match and clustered around players and officials for a motivational talk before Ruto handed over the bundle of cash sealed in a brown envelope to team captain Victor Wanyama, as an incentive ahead of their return tie in Moroni. But all that effort has been flushed down the drain after CAF wrote to FKF on Tuesday communicating their decision to impose the harsh penalty. According to CAF Disciplinary Code article 8.2: "The host association or club is responsible for order and security both inside and around the stadium before, during and after the match. It is liable for incidents of any kind, and can be rendered subject to disciplinary measures." FKF have three days from Tuesday to lodge an appeal against the decision.
