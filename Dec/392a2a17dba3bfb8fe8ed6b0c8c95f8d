Political leaders from Isiolo have decried insecurity in the county and called on Interior CS Fred Matiang'i to move in and end the killings. At least 10 people have been killed in recent attacks at the county’s border with Garissa. Senator Fatuma Dullo urged the National Cohesion and Integration Commission to investigate incitement in the county during a press conference in Parliament Buildings on Thursday. “We are calling on Interior CS Fred Matiang'i to please come and help stop what is going on. Innocent people are being killed,” Dullo said. The Senate deputy majority leader demanded a reshuffling of police bosses in the county and especially at the volatile areas, alleging complacence. Dullo was with MPs Hassan Oda (Isiolo North), Abdi Tepo (Isiolo South), Rehema Jaldesa (Isiolo Woman Representative), Ali Wario (Garsen) and Rehema Hassan (Tana River Woman Representative). The leaders said eight people were killed on the evening of November 30 following attacks in Quri area. “This follows numerous other similar attacks that have remained ongoing for over 30 years, claiming thousands of lives and significantly disrupting normal life,” they said. Dullo told of how an old man was attacked and killed in his manyatta by the bandits in the wee hours of the night. “They killed somebody in his manyatta. They were only two there. He should have not died that way,” she said. The leaders claimed that the attacks were instigated by their "expansionist neighbours who intend to forcefully and violently invade the county’s territory". They want the government to arm National Police Reservists and deploy RDU to man the volatile areas. Jaldesa called for swift action by the government to address insecurity that has spread tension and fear among the residents. “Please CS Matiangi, you have powers to stop these unnecessary killings. We are not prepared for a fight as Isiolo people,” she said.
