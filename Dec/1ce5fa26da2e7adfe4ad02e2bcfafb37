Khaligraph's wife Georgina Muteti says she met the rapper at a concert. In a Q&A session with her fans, the mother of two opened up about the incident. One fan asked how they met and she said it was in November 2017 at a show. Another fan asked if she has misunderstandings with the rapper at home and she said, "Sometimes." She also said she was born and raised in Kenya, adding that she is always bothered when people and blogs refer to her as a 'mzungu'. When asked about her age, she said, "Please, I am not old. I am 25." The couple welcomed their secondborn son Lwanda in October, and their firstborn, a baby girl named Amali Jones Omollo, in June last year.
