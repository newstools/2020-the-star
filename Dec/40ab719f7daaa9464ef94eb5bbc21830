AFC Leopards are on the verge of renewing the contract of their skipper and centre half Robinson Kamura. The defender's contract with the club is set to expire on Thursday but according to a senior source at the den, the club is keen to hand Kamura a new deal before the year ends. Kamura, who has a handful of Harambee Stars caps under his belt, arrived at the club in 2017 from Mathare United where he established himself in the starting team and a leader in the dressing room. The towering defender who initially served as the assistant skipper was elevated to lead the playing unit in December 2018 after the departure of Duncan Otieno to Zambian champions Nkana FC. The club is understood to have held final talks with the Jamhuri High School alumnus yesterday with an intention of convincing him to extend hi stay at the club. Initially, Kamura, who acknowledged that the club was looking forward to retain him, was rumoured to have attracted interests from Tanzanian and Zambian clubs as well as local ones. "We have been negotiating with him for quite some time and we expect him toÂ  renew his contract before the year ends," assured an official who sought anonymity.
