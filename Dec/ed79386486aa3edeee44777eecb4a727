Interior CS Fred Matiang'i on Friday said that the government is considering extending the Kazi Mtaani Programme owing to its impact on thousands of youth across the country. He was addressing a group of beneficiaries of the Kazi Mtaani project en route to Kasarani, where he officially opened the newly-built Kasarani Sub-County offices. The new offices that will help decentralizing citizen services in the area will serve residents and businesspeople in Kasarani, Ruaraka, Githurai, and Kahawa West. The CS was accompanied by Inspector General of Police Hillary Mutyambai, Secretary National Administration Arthur Osiya, and CC Flora Mworoa and MP Kasarani Constituency Hon. Mercy Gakuya. In October, the government's Kazi Mtaani programme won acclaim from Volunteer Involving Organisations for its contribution to bettering the lives ofÂ  youths during the Covid-19 pandemic. The initiative falls under the State Department for Housing and Urban Development, which was feted by VIOS during the Covid-19 Volunteers Response Recognition Awards. The ceremony was in recognition of exemplary services to Kenyans in the coronavirus pandemic response through the implementation of the National Hygiene programme popularly known as Kazi Mtaani.
