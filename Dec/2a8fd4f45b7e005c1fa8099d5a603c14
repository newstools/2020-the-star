Garissa Governor Ali Korane has appealed to the Somalis and Boranas to end inter-community violence that has claimed the lives of nine people in the past three days. Korane was addressing a hurriedly convened security meeting at Eldere in Lagdera subcounty on Wednesday. “This is too much. We cannot be losing lives daily. While it is the responsibility of the government to protect lives and properties, residents too have a duty to peacefully co-exist. The killings must be stopped,” he said. The combatants are the Somali from Garissa and the Borana from Isiolo. The killings happened in the Quri grazing area. Korane regretted the new wave of violence and urged the two communities to give dialogue a chance. The meeting was also attended by among others leader of Majority Mohamed Gabow, MCAs and security officials led by county commissioner Meru Mwangi. Korane said there was assurance from the government of a long-term solution to the problem. Gabow accused the government of not being committed to ending the killings. “We have had many lives lost through these barbaric acts. We can longer accept it. It is time the government came out and pronounced itself on this matter. "No one is supposed to take the law in their hands. Unfortunately that is what has been happening in the last few years," he said. While some incidents are related to a boundary dispute, others have to do with pasture and water. Mid last year, a 15-elder committee was formed to reconcile the two communities. Little has been achieved. The latest clashes came a day after both Garissa and Isiolo county commissioners convened a peace meeting in the same area with local leaders. The meeting urged the two communities to live in peace and share common  resources.
