Despite being impeached by 88 MCAs, Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko might still have a fighting chance at the Senate. County Assembly Speaker Benson Mutura is expected to on Friday communicate to Speaker Kenneth Lusaka the resolution made by the assembly . However, 57 Sonko-allied MCA who have been in Kwale since Tuesday, claimed the voting system had been rigged. According to Nairobi City County Standing Order 67 (7); when the motion has been passed by two-thirds of the county assembly, the speaker shall inform the speaker of the senate of the resolution within two days. Sonko will be the sixth governor the senators will be determining the fate of following their impeachment since 2013. He has been accused of gross misconduct, violation of the constitution and abuse of office. Section 33 of the County Governments Act, which stipulates the procedure for impeachment of a governor, states that the county assembly speaker shall, within two days of the House impeaching a governor, notify the speaker of the senate, in writing. Within seven days of the receipt of notice of a resolution of the House from the speaker of the county assembly, the speaker of the Senate is required to convene a meeting of the senate to hear the charges against the governor. The Senate, by resolution, may appoint a special committee comprising 11 members to investigate the matter. At this point, the committee may invite the governor and the county assembly to argue  cases. “A special committee appointed to investigate the matter and report to the Senate within ten days on whether it finds the particulars of the allegations against the Governor to have been substantiated,” the Act states.
