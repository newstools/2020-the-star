Insecurity has greatly reduced in Kwale, according to the National Cohesion and Integration Commission. The NCIC acting CEO Millicent Okatch said the commission's monitoring report indicates that there is calmness in areas that were previously known as hot zones for insecurity. She said Matuga and Msambweni youth who used to threaten the county's security are now disciplined and busy engaging in constructive activities. "There is a huge improvement compared to the past when youths used to terrorise locals with pangas, " she said. The Ng'ombeni and Denyenye communities have always been in constant dispute with each other over boundary and revenge issues. Their differences translated to the loss of life of many innocent locals from both sides. Okatch attributed the calmness to peace campaigns initiated by various stakeholders. She said the NCIC opted to use sports as a means of unity. "We tried to look for a common element that would bring young lives together and from it we crusade for peace, " she said. Samba Sports CEO Mohammed Mwachausa said many youths have changed through sports, creating an environment for peace. He said in partnership with the NCIC, they managed to arrange forums whereby youngsters could be sensitised against drug abuse, criminal activities and teen pregnancies. "We have made it that after games we sit with our children and counsel them against violence," he said. At the same time, the NCIC warned politicians against taking advantage of youth to cause chaos ahead of the December 15 by-election in Msambweni. Commissioner Philip Okundi said the commission will take legal action against those who will incite people towards hatred and violence.
