The performance of the national teams' coaches will be reviewed after every two years, Kenya Hockey Union has revealed. While handing both the men and women’s national team tacticians with new four-year contracts, the union said the assessment help the coaches understand whether they are on track with their objectives. The union said this will also erase ambiguity, misunderstanding and provide clarity and openness in coaching affairs. Stakeholders and fans alike have cried foul for poor performances of the teams in recent times, with calls for the union to crack the whip falling on deaf ears. “The terms of the national team coaches have nothing monetary. That is a fact. It’s about growth in the world rankings. We have given them a two-year window, we will review and extend for another two years if we are satisfied with their performance,” said KHU secretary general Wycliffe Ongori. He said the terms of the agreement can only be extended if there is an improvement in the various teams in the world rankings. Ongori added that the coaches have the full backing of the union. Jacqueline Mwangi is in charge of the women’s teams (both senior and junior) while Fidelis Kimanzi handles the men’s side. The latter takes over from Meshack Senge, who spent a decade while the Mwangi was elevated after being Tom Olal’s assistant last year. “From the union, I can tell you that we are quite confident that they will meet the agreed expectations,” said Ongori. Both teams have intensified their preparations ahead of the African Cup of Nations qualifiers to be held in Nairobi next month.
