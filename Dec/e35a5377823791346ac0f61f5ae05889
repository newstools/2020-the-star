Matatu operators in Ol Kalou have complained of alleged harassment and extortion by some county enforcement officers. They have also claimed that they are being asked to pay high monthly fees despite the reduced capacity and income due to Covid-19. Michael Mwangi said enforcement officers sometimes stop a matatu at a non-designated point, so they can harass the crew. He says once the matatu stops, they send a message to their colleagues saying they have been kidnapped by matatu crew who declined to drive to enforcement offices or Ol Kalou police station after being found in the long. “Their colleagues then chase after the vehicle in question and impound it without caring to know what happened. This is open thuggery,” he said. “They do not only deny us business, but they also rob the county government.” John Gacheru recounted the day he was called to pick up two passengers who were going to Kinangop Mission Hospital, one in critical condition. The vehicle they were travelling in had broken down on the Ol Kalou-Nakuru road near the former Ol Kalou NG-CDF office. But just as he picked up the sick passenger, two enforcement officers emerged and demanded Sh200 for picking a passenger at the wrong place. “I declined to pay, and they took a photo of my vehicle saying they will forward it to their seniors for action. But to date, nothing has happened,” he said. The operators said they recently held a meeting with Nyandarua ICT and Public Administration executive Dominic Murani under whose docket enforcement falls, but the harassment and extortion have persisted. “I call on Murani to go round and see for himself what is happening,” Gacheru said. Murani could not be reached for comment. His phone went unanswered and did not respond to a text message from the Star.
