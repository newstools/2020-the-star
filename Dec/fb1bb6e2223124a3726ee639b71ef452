@robertomollo3 Homa Bay residents washing household items and cars in Lake Victoria have been given three days to stop or face arrest. The National Environment Management Authority on Wednesday said the trend is common in beaches. The agency said such activities pollute water and interfere with marine life. Homa Bay Nema director Josiah Nyandoro said many car wash sites have been created along the shores of the lake with effluent discharged into the water. “The activities have made the lake waters around many beaches dirty. Oils from cars spill into the lake and these interfere with breeding systems of aquatic life,” Nyandoro said. He was addressing journalists in his Homa Bay town office on Wednesday. He warned that further pollution of the lake will affect the economic activities of most residents who are fisherfolk. Nyandoro linked the increase of wildlife - human attacks along the beaches to the washing of utensils and other household items in the lake by residents. Nema also wants locals to avoid careless dumping of wastes in and around the lake. “Residents should fetch water and wash their clothes and utensils far away from the lake. No wonder there are many crocodile attacks around the beaches,” Nyandoro said. Residents who encroached riparian lands were told to vacate. The agency said they will write to the county department of public health to assist in assessing the situation. Nyandoro urged residents to ensure they conserve the environment for sustainable economic growth. Homa Bay has more than 56 per cent of Lake Victoria water cover in Kenya.  Edited by P.O
