No government the world over can function with two people presuming to be its head. This is not even possible in a household. Deputy President William Ruto has split Jubilee, taking some MPs elected on the party ticket with him. He is working at cross-purposes with President Uhuru Kenyatta and his actions undermine his boss. The DP has ignored his boss's appeals for politicians to stop premature 2022 politics. Ruto has demonstrated what a government should not be and has poured cold water on our system of democracy. We said (via the Constitution) that rather than have a president appoint and fire his deputy at will, we should have a running mate so they are partners in government. But Ruto has made Kenyans begin to think that the system that we had, before the new Constitution, where the President could fire his deputy at will, was much better. The Deputy President has made the government dysfunctional. He presumes to have MPs and MCAs who only listen to him or take instructions from him. A case in point is the Building Bridges Initiative campaign where President Kenyatta has, in no uncertain terms, given his support, unequivocally, to the initiative. Ruto continues to pretend to support Uhuru yet he openly defies the Head of State. The kind of government Ruto has created is untenable, and would not have survived without Uhuru and my party leader Raila Odinga's handshake in March 2018. Thanks to the handshake, Uhuru now has support within Parliament to enable him to implement his agenda for Kenyans. If it was not for the handshake, the Jubilee government would have ground to a halt. Uhuru's supporters should be wary of the Deputy President's motives. He should no longer be allowed to pretend that he has any ounce of respect for his boss. In these circumstances, Uhuru should reengineer an overhaul of government and Ruto should have the decency to resign.
