Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya has accused the ODM party of planning to rig votes in the Msambweni by-election. This follows utterances of the OD M candidate Omar Boga, who publicly announced himself as the winner even before the poll. Mvurya expressed fears that the campaigns lead by ODM party and Boga’s words threaten a free and fair by-election on December 15. He questioned why the party was saying they must win the by-election. “It seems ODM is preparing to cheat. That is why they are sure of their victory‚” he said. The county chief spoke in Ukunda during a vote-hunting mission for the independent candidate Feisal Bader He called upon the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission to be alert and make sure the exercise is not jeopardised. Mvurya said he won’t allow injustices to be done to Msambweni residents and vowed to protect Bader’s votes. He also asked law enforcement officers to take action against inciters and arrest those who will interfere with the exercise. He told ODM to shun the politics of insults and chaos. The governor said he wants a peaceful by-election and asked police to do their part in beefing up security. In October, former Mombasa senator Hassan Omar also accused ODM of plotting to disrupt peace if defeated in the poll. The ODM party, however, denied the allegations saying their opponents had sensed defeat. They said the party was a peaceful organisation and had no intention to disrupt the by-election. Boga said the accusations were mere propaganda spread by people with no agendas. Deputy Governor Fatuma Achani cautioned politicians against disrespecting Kwale leaders while campaigning. The Msambweni seat fell vacant after the demise of MP Suleiman Dori. Eight candidates will battle it out for the position. Edited by Kiilu Damaris
