The Kirinyaga county assembly will next week vet Governor Anne Waiguru's nominees to the county public service board. Those proposed to fill the posts are Raymond Karinga Thomas, Catherine Karimi Mwangi, Patrick Tarzan Matu, Esther Wanjiru Muchiri and Leah Margaret Wanjeri Kabui. Newton Njagi has been nominated to fill the board’s secretary’s position. The nominees’ names were tabled Monday during a special sitting at the county assembly. County leaders, led by majority leader Kamau Murango, have promised to ensure a smooth process. “We have had a problem in the county for a long time due to lack of this important organ. We promise to exercise our function as per the law as we hope that the nominees presented are competent enough to handle the task before them,” he said Public Service and Administration Committee chair Harrison Ngiria said they are committed to ensuring that the assembly approves the nominees. “We will ensure that the slots are evenly distributed and that the board contains representatives from different wards within the county. Gone are the days when such opportunities were allocated through discriminatory methods,” he said. Nominated MCA Caroline Muriithi said the lack of a public service board has resulted in untold suffering for some county employees, among them a group of health workers who were reinstated but could not receive payment as their pay details had to be processed by the board. “We also have ECD teachers whose contracts expired but cannot resume services without the authorisation of the board.” “So we expect the assembly will fast-track the process to ensure we get a board in place in the soonest.”
