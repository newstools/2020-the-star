American writer John Steinbeck once said war is a symptom of man's failure as a thinking animal. These words aptly capture what is ailing Northern Kenya where neighbours kill each other as if it is the fashionable thing to do. Only last week more than 10 people were killed following skirmishes between people from Garissa and Isiolo counties. These are human lives lost. Being a country governed by the rule of law, it is prudent that even those behind the heinous crime be subjected to the criminal justice system. The situation is untenable, but it is made worse by reckless statements from politicians, from both sides, who seem hellbent on seeing innocent blood shed instead of finding ways of brokering peace. The government needs to take serious action against such politicians and drive the message home—that recklessness will not be tolerated, especially with slightly over a year to the 2022 general election. The residents being encouraged to wage war on each other need to learn than when fighting breaks out, the politicians' children will be safe in their parents' mansions in Nairobi or abroad, studying in ivy league colleges. It is the common man who will suffer. So before you blindly follow failed politicians keen to pass off as genuine leaders think twice.
