The third leg of Athletics Kenya Cross Country Series will be held on January 2 in Ol Kalou, Nyandarua County and not January 9 as had been earlier scheduled. AK's vice-president in charge of competitions, Paul Mutwii, said this change will allow athletes to rest and prepare well for the county cross country championships that will be held on January 13. "Athletes, who participate in cross country, usually require at least two weeks to recover before they can compete again. It would be impossible for them to run on 9th and then expect them to compete again less than a week later. That is why we decided to bring the cross country series forward toÂ  January 2,"Mutwii said. Instead, the opening leg of the AK relay series will now be held on January 9 at Nyayo Stadium. Mutwii said the county cross country championships will provide counties with the chance to pick the best of their talented athletes who will represent them at the regional championships to be held on February 5. "The county cross country championships will be a competition among individual athletes. At the regional level, however, it will be counties competing against one another for top honours," he said. The change in activities was communicated to athletes at the 2nd AK Cross Country Championship in Nandi County on December 19. Mutwii encouraged all athletes to intensify their training in readiness for AK's packed calendar of activities next year.
