Tanzanian beauty queen Wema Sepetu and singer Hamisa Mobetto have not been in good terms for a while. However, during Hamisa's birthday Wema showered her with love and praises, just months after she shaded her at an interview. She wrote: "Happy Birthday to you sweetness…Deep down in my heart kuna mapenzi mengi sana kwako (& u know it)…Enjoy ur Big Day Fabulously kama ulivyo wewe…" To which Hamisa responded: "Always ❤️" Fans wondered at Wema's post and so she shared another one promoting Hamisa's new song just to confirm that she and Hamisa are okay now. "Kama Bado hujaona Ngoma Kali ya Kamdogo mdogo ka mimi ya Ginger Me... Bado Link ipo kwa Bio yake inapumua... Go Check it Out Now...‼️‼️‼️" Hamisa then responded; "You've woken up with alot of love today." In the past, Hamisa revealed that Wema was her idol but the two fell out over their ex-boyfriend Diamond Platnumz.
