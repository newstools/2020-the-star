Keroche Breweries heiress Anerlisa Muigai is mourning the death of her only sister Tecra Muigai Karanja in an accident on Saturday. Anerlisa shared photos she took with her late sister accompanied by rose flowers and a heart. In another post, she shared a family statement accompanied by a broken heart. Until her death, Tecra worked as the strategy and information director at Keroche Breweries. "While we mourn the loss of a remarkable young lady, we also celebrate her life and hope it serves as an example to young people around the world to work hard to make their dreams come true and to be willing to explore and push their limits,” read the statement. Anerlisa introduced her late sister to the limelight early this year. "She just hates the spotlight and that is why I don’t post her on my page even if it’s a family photo,” she wrote.
