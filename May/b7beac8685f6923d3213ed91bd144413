ODM party has dismissed claims of possible changes in the party leadership positions in Homa Bay County. In a statement on Tuesday, party Secretary-General Edwin Sifuna said the County Secretary position has not been altered as purported in social media. This is after a statement allegedly authored by a member of parliament in the county made rounds on social media directing certain changes in the position of County Secretary. Sifuna advised all party members in the county to ignore the said message as the purported changes have not been sanctioned by the member or any other organ of the party. "We wish to remind everyone that positions in the party at both National and grassroots level are not a personal entitlement that can be bartered at one's whim," he said. "If indeed any serving official wishes to relinquish their position, they can do so by addressing their resignation letters to their relevant branch or county office without usurping the power of the membership to fill the resultant vacancy". He noted that grassroots elections for all positions in the party are scheduled later in the year and the membership is advised to wait the said elections in order to fill any existing vacancies
