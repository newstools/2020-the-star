Detectives are investigating 56 Bungoma MCAs for allegedly pocketing Sh40,000 each in irregular Covid-19 allowances. The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission has summoned the 56 MCAs out of 62. In a letter seen by the Star, the first batch of 12 MCAs will face anti-graft sleuths on Tuesday. Ndivisi MCA Martin Wanyonyi confirmed they had been summoned. He said the payment schedule indicated the allowances came from the World Health Organisation. "When we signed for the money we were told it was from WHO and meant for training and sensitisation,” Wanyonyi said. A number of MCAs said they were ready to refund the money. The MCAs are now planning to remove Majority leader Florence Fulano and speaker Emmanuel Situma over the allocation. A list seen by the Star showed that 39 MCAs had signed to impeach the speaker.  The threshold for removal of a speaker requires 41 signatures. Situma defended himself and questioned why the MCAs were dragging him into politics. “I was not there when they were signing the money. It is wrong for them to [ruin] my name to achieve what they want,” he said. Fulano said she was also convinced the money was from WHO. The MCA said she is ready to face the EACC.
