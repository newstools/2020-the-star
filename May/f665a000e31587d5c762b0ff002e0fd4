Motorists should not display the "wide load" signage if their vehicles do not fall within the category specified by law, Transport authorities have said. The National Transport and Safety Authority and the Kenya National Highways Authority said Wednesday that some pickups were displaying the signage when their load does not exceed the overall allowed width. “Our attention has been drawn to the widespread display of wide load signage on the front and rears of pickups either when load carried does not exceed the overall allowed width or when not carrying any load, contrary to the provisions of the law. “Section 3 (a) of the Traffic Act Cap 403, states that the required maximum overall width of a motor vehicle together with any load projecting beyond the overall width of the vehicle shall not exceed 2.65 metres,” they said in a joint statement. The statement was signed by NTSA Director-General George Njao and KeNHA Director-General Peter Mundinia. The two said most pickups have a width of 1.8 metres and therefore do not require the wide load sign. Owners of pickups whose dimensions do not fall within the category specified by law have been asked not to display the "wide load" signage. For trucks, KeNHA has nine installed weighbridges on the national road network to check for axle load. The axle load limits for the various axle-wheel configurations, maximum gross vehicle weight, maximum vehicle dimensions and the minimum fines for excess axle load or gross vehicle weight are set in the Traffic Act (Cap. 403). For single Steering Axle (2 wheels fitted with single tyres), a maximum axle load is 8,000 kg while single Axle (4 wheels fitted with dual tyres) has a maximum axle load limit of 10,000 kg. The tandem axle group (8 wheels- dual tyres) has a maximum axle load of 18,000 kg while a triple axle group (12 wheels-dual tyres) has a maximum axle load of 24,000 kg.
