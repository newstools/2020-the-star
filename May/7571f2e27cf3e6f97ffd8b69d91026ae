About 8,000 residents of Kariobangi North left homeless following forceful eviction by the government now want the ongoing construction in the disputed land stopped. Through Lawyer John Khaminwa, the residents claim that some of them were unable to get alternative shelter after eviction. They are pleading with the court to intervene and issue an order stopping the state from further displacing them. The government disobeyed a court order issued on May 3. Justice Samson Okong’o restrained CS Land Farida Karoney, CS Interior Fred Matiang’i, deputy  commissioner Kasarani, Nairobi county,  Registrar of Titles, Chief Land Registrar and the Attorney General from evicting them until their application is determined The state, they say, is in contempt of those orders. “Their actions were unconstitutional, illegal and malicious as we have been rendered homeless,” the residents say. They are also seeking an order compelling the OCS Kariobangi police station to provide them with security on the suit property until the matter is determined. “It's imperative the court issues the orders so that our rights can be protected especially during this crucial period of Covid-19 pandemic as we have no alternative place to settle currently,” read the court documents. The residents have occupied the land since 1996. They argue the CSs have no right to claim their land since government ownership had lapsed after it was transferred to them. According to the court documents, the County of Nairobi recognised their occupation of the land as lawful after acquiring it two decades ago. They say their legitimate expectation was that once the property had been allocated to them they would exclusively occupy the land without any interruption from anybody whatsoever including the government.
