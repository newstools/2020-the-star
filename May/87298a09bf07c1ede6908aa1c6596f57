A Nyeri man has attracted global attention and dominated social media for two days after he called for the burning down of the White House. Alex Nderitu was commenting on sustained protests in the US following the murder of a black man by a white police officer. The officer pressed his knee on the neck of George Floyd, 46, killing him, despite the unarmed man pleading for his life. The video of the killing went viral, sparking global outrage against deep racism in the US. Floyd's death last Monday triggered violent street protests in Illinois, California, Memphis, Tennessee, Chicago and Los Angeles. Nderitu asked the residents in the above states to attack the White House. “Burn White House now….we are not turning back,” he posted. US comedian and actor Terrence Williams asked the FBI, CIA and other security organs in the US to intervene. “They are threatening to burn down the White House. We must protect President Trump and his administration. All threats must be taken seriously,” the comedian wrote. In an interview with a local station, Nderitu said he was a Pan Africanist and that he condemned the killing of the black people. He said black people should be treated equally as white people without any discrimination. The AU condemned the killing of Floyd and asked US authorities to action against the police officers who were involved in his death. Edited by Henry Makori
