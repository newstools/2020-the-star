The government has been urged to consider all people living with disability when distributing funds meant to cushion the vulnerable against the effects of Covid-19. Addressing journalists in Bombolulu, Mombasa, on Monday, Tunaweza Women with Disabilities executive director Charity Chahasi said public participation should be conducted before the decision on who should benefit from the funds is made. She said it is important to ensure that people living with disabilities are well-educated on preventive measures because they are more vulnerable. "PLWD are at a higher risk of contracting the virus because they need assistance, which puts them at a higher risk," Chahasi said. She spoke when the group distributed face masks to PLWDs in Mombasa county. The lobby targets to distribute 2,500 masks in the whole county. Chahasi also urged the county government to engage the public in dialogue before mass testing.  Edited by A.N
