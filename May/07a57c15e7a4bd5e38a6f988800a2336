Over 5,000 families have received relief food from Murang’a Woman Rep Sabina Chege. Chege said many people were unable to feed themselves due to the closure of businesses occasioned by the coronavirus pandemic. She cited thousands of people who worked in hotels, bars and restaurants, most of whom were sent on unpaid leave. She said in Kenol town on Friday that her National Government Affirmative Action Fund emergency kitty had about Sh500,000 which could only support 1,000 families. But Chege said she was able to ask for help from well wishers who made it possible to increase the number of beneficiaries to about 20,000 people. The beneficiaries received face masks, 5kg of maize flour, 2kg of beans and a bar soap to help them main hygiene while having a balanced diet. The MP said the number of people who require assistance in Murang’a county was huge and appealed to businessmen and professionals to contribute. Chege said she had only invited representatives from each subcounty to avoid crowding but a huge crowd ended up gathering at the venue. “I am working with chiefs and volunteers and have identified so many vulnerable people. People are hungry,” she said. Area MP Mary Waithera lauded Chege’s efforts and announced that she would also launch a relief food programme this week. She noted that her constituency is largely semi-arid and residents suffer immensely during droughts. With coronavirus the situation is worse as even those who are employed are not able to support themselves, she added. “Those who worked in bars and hotels or travelled to neighbouring counties to work in coffee estates are all at home now,” Waithera said.
