A landslide in the Aberdare Forest has disrupted the water supply in Nyeri town and its environs. A statement released by Nyeri Water and Sanitation Company (NYEWASCO) on Tuesday said the landslide was as a result of the ongoing heavy downpour. “This has caused flooding and clogging at Ihwa Intake in River Chania, which supplies water to Kamakwa treatment plant,” Nyewasco managing director Peter Gichaaga said. Aberdare Forest, which is one of the five major water towers in the country, is the source of River Chania. The clogging led to a temporary shutdown of treatment works at Kamakwa plant on the outskirts of Nyeri town. “Due to the high turbidity which has exceeded the acceptable levels and the disruptive flooding at the intake, Nyeri Water and Sanitation Company hereby informs our esteemed customers that treatment works at Kamakwa plant have been temporarily shut down,” Gichaaga said. The company said it was supplying water from the clear water tank whose levels had plummeted and could only last a few hours. The company further advised residents to use water sparingly, especially during this period of Covid-19. Nyewasco also appealed to residents to harvest rainwater to supplement the supply. “Our technical team is working round the clock to normalise the situation. We seek your indulgence as we endeavour to restore normal operations,” the statement said.  Edited by A.N
