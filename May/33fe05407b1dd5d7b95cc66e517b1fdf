Former Mwamba and Strathmore Leos coach John Mbai has been appointed Kenya Rugby League Federation technical director. The former international, who also had a coaching stint at Mean Machine, will work with coaches at the grassroots to come up with structures and as well develop and nurture talent. Chairman Richard Nyakwaka termed the appointment as step in the right direction. “He brings a wealth of experience and tactical acumen which is needed to grow the game. He is one of the bright young coaches we have in the country,” noted Nyakwaka. Nyakwaka observed that the potential of the game in the country is vast. “A good number of our players don’t make the grade in the Kenya Rugby Union pyramid and those are the individuals we are looking at to grow our player base and ensure that the popularity of the sport grows,” added Nyakwaka. Elsewhere, Kenya Harlequins have launched a fund-raiser with the contributions set to be channeled towards Allan Makaka Educational Fund for his two children. The former Kenya sevens international died in a road accident on Saturday morning after he rammed into a stationary lorry on Mombasa Road. The statement from Quins read: “To contribute please use playbill 858844, Account Name Makaka Children Fund and thank you for your contribution towards this noble cause.” Makaka played for Quins from 2004-2008 and where he won two national sevens circuit titles and a Kenya Cup crown in 2008. He made 57 appearances for Shujaa in the World Sevens Series scoring 28 tries and is ranked 21 among Kenya’s all-time sevens scorers.
