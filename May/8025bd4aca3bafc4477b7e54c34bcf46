Health officials are looking for people who may have come into contact with two women who tested positive for Covid-19 in Nyeri. The two have provided names of their contacts including close family members and friends, an estimated 50 contacts. They reported no history of travel outside Nyeri county, meaning they might be secondary contacts. The county is now looking for the primary contacts who would help in opening up the network. Three of their children have been admitted to Wambugu Agricultural Training Centre quarantine facility. Nyeri Governor Mutahi Kahiga said officials were tracing people who might have come into contact with a truck driver who was delivering road construction materials to Hiriga in Mathira constituency who tested positive for Covid-19. He had interacted with workers at the construction site, creating a contact network of at least 123 people. The health department has so far managed to identify and quarantine 55 persons at Nyeri Kenya Medical Training College. Nyeri on Thursday confirmed two Covid-19 cases. The two  women aged 42 and 44 are residents of Majengo slums in Nyeri town. They worked as bartenders in a bar and restaurant located near the lower bus stage in Nyeri town. Kahiga said the two were asymptomatic and had gone for testing voluntarily as a requirement for reopening of bars and restaurants when they turned positive. Nyeri county director of medical services Nelson Muriu said they were tested with four others who worked in the same restaurant but their results were negative for Covid-19. “The two patients are still asymptomatic and have been admitted to Mt Kenya isolation hospital,” Muriu said. He said the county was contemplating mass testing in Majengo slums, lower bus stage and markets. Edited by Henry Makori
