Rapper Khaligraph has called out Diamond Platnumz's official photographer Lukamba for refusing to send him photos he took with Diamond during the gala of Sound City MVP Awards in Nigeria. He wrote, “So I see Diamond backstage. He congratulated me and said congratulations my brother this is so big win for East Africa and he is like, can we take a picture. "So we take a picture while holding the award, and his photographer is the guy who took the pictures. "I asked him to send me the picture and he never wanted to send the pictures. I don’t know why, probably Diamond didn’t win anything or what?" Lukamba explained that his card got corrupted and lost all the data, hence his failure to send the photos to Papa Jones. WCB’s signee Lava Lava defended Lukamba, saying, “@khaligraph_jones We respect You Og Kijana Alipata Matatizo kidogo Yakikazi Tuko Pamoja."
