 Former Kakamega Senator Boni Khalwale has said the state has no plans to cushion Kenyans affected by the Covid-19 pandemic and ravaging floods. He faulted President Uhuru Kenyatta for extending the nationwide dusk-to-dawn curfew saying it was unnecessary without government interventions to help those affected. Uhuru on Saturday extended the 7pm to 5am curfew until June 6. He also extended the cessation of movement in and out of Nairobi, Mombasa, Kwale, Kilifi and Mandera by another three weeks. The measures are aimed at containing the spread of coronavirus which had infected 887 Kenyans by Sunday. But Khalwale said Uhuru ought to have come up with measures to cushion wananchi against the effects of such restrictions amid the pandemic. He spoke in Mumias West on Sunday when he distributed mattresses, blankets and foodstuff to the victims of River Nzoia floods. Khalwale said the President was instead engaged in succession politics without caring about Kenyans who were economically suffering in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic and the floods. Floods have killed more than 237 people according to Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa. More than 33 counties are affected. Kisumu, Garissa, Busia, Tana River and Homa Bay are among the worst affected counties. Khalwale also queried how the government was spending funds received from the international community and well-wishers to help in the fight against coronavirus. “This money we just hear it being mentioned in Nairobi. Even the other day, we saw on TV the East Africa Breweries having donated Sh100 million. Where does this money go to? "We want to see this money being used in the villages to help curb the spread of Covid-19 and even some of it to be channelled towards helping victims of floods across the country so we can know that Uhuru’s government is working," Khalwale said.
