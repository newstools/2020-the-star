Kapaseret MP Oscar Sudi has revealed that he met with the ODM party leader Raila Odinga coincidentally in one of the popular restaurants in Nairobi. The MP is among the outspoken allies to Deputy President William Ruto from the Rift Valley region. Sudi and other allies to Ruto opposed the Building Bridges Initiative rally which was to be held in Uasin Gishu. In February, Sudi and the team said that holding BBI rally in Uasin Gishu would contribute to hate and listing some communities instead of uniting Kenyans. Sudi and his Soy counterpart Caleb Kositany said they will not allow the BBI forums under the leadership of ODM leader Raila Odinga in any part of the county. “We will not remain silent and allow hate-mongering that has been witnessed in Kitui, Kisii and Mombasa to be transferred to Eldoret. Any meeting must be organised by the leadership of the area, not outsiders,” Sudi said. His meeting with Raila on Wednesday was a surprise to many Kenyans but the MP said it was a coincident meeting during lunch hour and had nothing to do with politics. The MP added that Raila is like a father figure to him and he was a close friend to his late son late Fidel Odinga. “We had lunch together and thereafter chit chats. Raila is like a father to me. We were close buddies with his son the late Fidel Odinga,” Sudi said. He added that “When I meet him it doesn't necessarily mean we discuss politics." On Tuesday, the MP ruled out speculations on the looming reshuffle to the cabinet. “Let people stop threatening us with reshuffle nonsense we can provide the President with the full list of professionals from R.Valley serving in his government to facilitate their sacking,” Sudi said.
