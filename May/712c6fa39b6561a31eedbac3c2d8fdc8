Betty Kyallo has announced the relocation of her beauty parlour 'Flair by Betty' to a "bigger and better place". Flair was initially located in Kilimani. Betty will give details of the new location later. She said she had stalled on making the move after corona was reported in Kenya, but she has decided to carry on with the project and take precautions. “I was scared because our services are very personal and so I took precautions. But looking back, I shouldn’t have closed it, we should have just taken the necessary precautions," she said on a live YouTube session, adding that she was forced to pay her staff off her pocket and it was so tough. "Just strategise. Get with it, do not stop things, especially business, because corona is here with us, just take caution,” Betty said. She had a fallout with her former business partner Susan Kaitany of Posh Palace before she left.
