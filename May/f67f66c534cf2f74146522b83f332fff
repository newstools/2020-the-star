A total of 182 foreigners were returned to Tanzania after testing positive for Covid-19. This is out of 214 positive cases which were recorded at the Kenya-Tanzania border. During his briefing on Tuesday, Health CS Mutahi Kagwe said the foreigners are distributed in different borders. They are distributed as follows; four people came in through Isebania, 24 through Lunga lunga, 126 from Namanga, 23 from Taveta and five from Loitoktok. All of these people were returned to Tanzania, Kagwe said. "People are being asked to watch and see.. report anybody coming through the border," he said. Kagwe said they have taken PPEs to the area to ensure Kenyans are safe when testing is taking place. He further said that Kenya has set up two mobile laboratories and another lab in Namanga for testing. Another lab will be in Naivasha in the event that any person was not tested at the border. Kagwe said that they we have to test the drivers because they are "our brothers and sisters". "...but we cannot allow people to come in without Covid-19 free certificate," he said. "...there is no country that is going round the streets to test,everybody goes for targeted testing. We are focusing on areas that we have reason to test."
