An OCS in Meru county, Ayub Makapila, is on the run while his junior officer has been arrested  after complaints of bribery and corruption. The EACC detectives received a tip off that officers from Mulika area in Meru have been receiving bribes in the pretext that they are enforcing government directives on curfew. The dusk to dawn curfew has seen many people being arrested with bribery cases on the rise. The detectives said the OCS alongside his junior officer, Kirugi Kiarie, were demanding for  Sh5, 000 from two suspects that had been arrested. The two; Joseph Matangi and David Kinyua were arrested at their homes at around 20:15 hours on allegations of being outside after curfew hours. Curfew hours are from 7pm to 5am. Head of the EACC in the region George Ojowi said they have the audio and video recording of how the OCS demanded for the bribe. This was after they decided to go undercover to arrest the police boss. “When the bribe was delivered, the OCS instructed Kiarie to receive the money from the suspects," Ojowi said. "Our officers then managed to arrest Kiarie and recovered the money that we put as bait." Ojowi said they had received several allegations on how police are using curfew to extort money from Mwananchi. "We call upon public to come forward and report any police extortion of mistreatment. You arrest somebody in their house and demand bribe?" he posed. Ojowi said the police officer has been moved to Meru Police station as investigations commence.
