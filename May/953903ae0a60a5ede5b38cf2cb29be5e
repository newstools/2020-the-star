A police officer who is alleged to have received a Sh160,000 bribe at a police station two years ago has been charged. Gladys Cherono was arraigned before Anti-Corruption chief magistrate Douglas Ogoti, where she denied three counts of receiving a bribe. It is alleged that on October 5, 2018 at Industrial Area police station in Nairobi, she asked for a Sh 100,000 bribe from Martin  Mburu to facilitate the release of Robert Njuki and Gibson Ngige. The two had been arrested on suspicion of stealing a car. On the same day, she allegedly further demanded  Sh30,000 from Mburu to secure their release. She also faces a third count in which she asked for another Sh30,000. The officer pleaded with the court through her lawyer, George Kithi, to release her on reasonable bail terms since she is a young mother and has served in the police service for 10 years. Ogoti released her on a Sh150,000 bash bail. Edited by EKibii
