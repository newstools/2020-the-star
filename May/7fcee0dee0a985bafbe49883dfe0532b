Ten cases of drowning have been reported in Bomet as heavy rains continue to pound the country. The county disaster management team on Tuesday disclosed it had recovered eight bodies from rivers and dams across the region. County director in charge of disaster Stanley Mutai said two of the reported cases are still missing and the search is ongoing. Kipsonoi, Amalo and Sisei rivers account for most of the drowning cases. Mutai said three bodies were recovered from Kipsonoi, while two were retrieved from Amalo. The other two cases are of individuals who accidentally fell into a dam and a stream in Chepalungu subcounty. The most affected areas in the county are Sotik and Chepalungu where the heavy rains have destroyed crops and houses. Residents have been warned not to cross swollen rivers. “If people avoid crossing rivers during this rainy season while drunk, we are going to avoid such drowning cases which have continued to rise in our region,” Mutai said.
