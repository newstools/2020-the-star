High forward-looking loan provision in the wake of Coronavirus has continued to dent banks’ profits in the first three months of the year. Kenya adopted the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS19) accounting standard that requires financial institutions to provide for unforeseen defaults beforehand. KCB Group for instance posted a higher provision expense to cover for downgraded facilities, with expected growth in defaults across key sectors of the economy attributable to the pandemic. NCBA Bank however reported the highest growth in net profits of 20 per cent but it’s operating expense surged to Sh3.7 billion from Sh3.3 billion on an account of high loan loss provision.
