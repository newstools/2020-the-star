@githinjireuben Police are hunting for a 17-year-old youth suspected to have Clovid-19 who escaped from quarantine at the Embu Level 5 Teaching and Referral Hospital. Embu county’s Public Health director Rosalyn Kaugi said the youth had arrived from Nairobi, which has been sealed off due the prevalence of Covid-19. He was taken to the hospital's isolation unit but he escaped two days ago before he was tested, she said. She said the youth had been living in Karurina Village, Embu West subcounty, prompting concerned residents to report him to authorities. The county's Covid-19 response team visited the house and took the youth to the hospital's isolation unit where he was quarantined, but escaped. Kaugi said the disappearance was reported to the Embu police station and officers are looking for him. She expressed fear the youth, if infected, could spread the virus to many people since he had not been tested before he fled. “Once he is traced and tested, we will take the next measures depending on the test results," Kaugi said. She spoke during a training of priests on combating Covid-19 at St Peter and Paul Primary School in Karurina. Kaugi said the county remained watchful and swiftly responded to alerts from the public about suspected cases. She urged residents to inform authorities about newcomers. The county has not recorded any Covid-19 case. (Edited by V. Graham)
