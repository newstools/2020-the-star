Residents of Mbeere South in Embu county have complained that incidents of defilement and incest have increased after schools were closed due to coronavirus. Mwangaza Women Rights Organization chairperson Mary Makau said three cases of incest and five of defilement had been reported within a month. Makau said offenders were exploiting the restrictions placed by the national government to stop the spread of Covid-19. She said some suspects were arrested but were later released on bond. She appealed to the courts to mete out harsh punishments against sex abuse convicts so that they can serve as a lesson to others planning to commit such crimes. Makau spoke during a ceremony in which Action Aid International Kenya issued free hand washing containers, soap and trucks full of water worth Sh242,640 to Makima ward residents to prevent the spread Covid-19. Davis and Shirtliff company repaired free of charge a pump that had broken down and restored water supply to the semi-arid area. Action Aid Makima team leader Mwachidudu Chimera handed over the equipment during a brief ceremony at Makima assistant county commissioner’s office. Chimera explained that they work with government administrators to identify places where the public visit in large numbers to station the hand washing facilities. “We will transport 50,000 litres of water to various parts of Makima to facilitate hand washing. We want to avoid a situation where people have containers and soap but lack water,” he said. He appealed to residents to observe hand washing and social distancing to prevent the spread of the pandemic. Chimera said they had ensured Makange water project has continuous supply. “Our associate Davis and Shirtliff repaired a pump that supplies water from River Thiba, but which had broken down after heavy rains, at a cost of Sh220,000. Water flow has been restored to the places served by the pump,” he said.  Edited by Henry Makori
