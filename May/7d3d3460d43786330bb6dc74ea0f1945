 The Baringo county assembly has approved nominees to the County Public Service Board despite petitions by some members of the public. The assembly approved Joseph Korir as chairman to replace Mark Suge. “Korir is listed among the wanted persons in the Ndung'u Report,” Kabarnet town-based petitioner Isaiah Biwott claimed. Biwott also faulted the conduct of Musa Ewoi Lochom, a board member, claiming he is being investigated in connection with the loss of billions for the stalled construction of Itare Dam in Nakuru. Other nominees include Samson Kigen Kibii, Stella Jerop Chebii, Samuel Lentete, Christine Ronoh and Julius Munge. However, assembly majority leader Lawi Kipchumba dismissed Biwott's allegations, terming them baseless. “The Ndung'u Report is just a political gimmick, if it was anything serious, then all the listed names including Korir’s should have had their title deeds revoked or their names forwarded to court, prosecuted, convicted and jailed,” Kipchumba said. He said the allegations brought to the assembly's appointments committee, chaired by speaker David Kiplagat, were simply malicious. Kipchumba was backed by among others, Bartabwa MCA Reuben Chepsongol, Jeniffer Kabon (Kapropita), Silas Tochim (Tenges), John Tarus (Sacho), Richard Cheserem (Saimo-Soi), John Aengwo (Saimo-Kipsaraman), Julius Ngotie (Eldama-Ravine) and Jacob Cheboiwo (Kisanana). Kabarnet MCA Earnest Kibet was the only one who opposed the list, saying it was unfair not to listen to members of the public. The list was forwarded last month to the assembly by Governor Stanley Kiptis. “We saw it good to pass the names urgently, so we can have an active hiring board to oversee employment of more nurses to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic,” Kipchumba said.
