Interior CS Fred Matiangi has sent his condolences to the family of seven officers who died in Baringo floods. The seven were part of 12 officers who were swept away by floods in Baringo on Friday. "Saddened to learn of the demise of seven of our galant police officers who were part of a group whose vehicle was swept away by flash floods at Chemoe, Baringo County in the course of their service," he said. "My condolences and prayers to their families and colleagues." On Friday, bodies of five of the seven police officers attached to the Anti-Stock Theft Unit were recovered. The search for the remaining two stopped after they were found along River Kagir in Saimo/Soi ward, Baringo North. Five policemen survived the ordeal and were taken to Kabarnet hospital for treatment. On Wednesday, Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa said Kenya lost 116 lives to the ongoing floods. Wamalwa said 29 counties have been affected and 100,000 households displaced. He said they have dispatched 40,000 bags of rice to over 24 counties affected by floods. According to the weather forecast, rainfall is expected to continue over most parts of the country until June.
