Lokomotiv Moscow’s Jefferson Farfan has tested positive for the coronavirus, the Russian Premier League club said on Saturday. Farfan, 35, is yet to play a game in this campaign, which has eight more rounds remaining, after sustaining a knee injury last year. “Jefferson Farfan has tested positive for coronavirus,” the club said in on Twitter. “We wish Jeff a speedy recovery! Get better soon!” Lokomotiv are second in Russia’s top flight, which will resume on June 21 after it was suspended in mid-March because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
