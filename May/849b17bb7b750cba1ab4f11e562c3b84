Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong and eight others will on May 29 know whether they have a case to answer in a Sh8 million graft case. The state closed its case after calling 20 witnesses and producing 50 documents in a case in which the governor is accused of awarding a tender to a ghost company. The prosecution has asked the court to find the accused persons have a case to answer based on the evidence adduced in court. Ojaamong, Bernard Aite, Leonard Wanda, Allan Omachari, Samwel Oseko, Edan Odoo, Renish Omullo, Sebastian Hallensben and Madam R Enterprises (MRE) were charged in 2018 with conspiracy to commit an economic crime. Ojaamong is separately charged with engaging in a project without prior planning and abuse of office. Others are accused of fraudulent acquisition of property, failure to pay taxes amongst others. The prosecution says Ojaamong travelled to Germany on April 1, 2014, with the officials to study new technologies on solid waste management. The trip was fully funded by MRE Limited. Seven days after, Ojaamong signed an MoU with MRE Ltd, the prosecution says. The county was to pay Sh8 million to MRE for a feasibility study on solid waste management for the Busia government. But at the time of signing the MoU, MRE was not registered.Â  The company came into existence on July 8, 2014. A witness who testified against the governor said he signed an MoU with a non-existent company. The prosecution said the process used to procure the feasibility study on solid waste management was flawed. Another witness said the county chief engaged MRE through the MoU knowing that there was no procurement process for a feasibility study. The court also heard that Aite, Wanda, Omachari and Oseko facilitated the payments for a project that had not been planned, budgeted or procured. (edited by o. owino)
