Nahashon Muguna, former acting MD, on Wednesday was confirmed as NCWSC boss and promised restoration of water supply by Saturday. Muguna, a mechanical engineer, had been serving as MD in an acting capacity for almost two years at the Nairobi City Water and Sewerage Company. He scored the highest among three finalists. “There are a lot of water challenges in Nairobi and for us to handle that we need effective leadership," Timothy Muriuki, the deputy board vice chair, told reporters after the announcement at NCWSC headquarters. Responding to the acute water shortage, Muguna said, "The work for temporary reinstatement is around 50 per cent and we expect by Saturday morning to start delivering water to the city." Muguna said the shortage had been caused on May 8 by a massive landslide in the Aberdares Forest following heavy rains. It damaged the main pipeline that supplies water from Sasumua Dam to Nairobi. The damage cut off 11.6 or cent of Nairobi's water requirement. The current requirement is 810,000 cubic metres per day. Tanker trucks have been delivering water to many areas, including informal settlements, but it's still not enough. Affected areas include Waiyaki Way, Kangemi, Lavington, Westlands, Parklands, MP Shah Hospital, Aga Khan Hospital, Nairobi Hospital, Kenyatta Hospital, Upper Hill and Kilimani. The University of Nairobi main campus and the Upper and Lower Kabete campuses, Kenyatta University Parklands campus also were cut off. “We are waiting for the government to finish construction of the Northern Collector Tunnel (NCT), which will add more water,” Muguna said. It is expected to be completed in June 2021 and pump an additional 140,000 cubic metres per day. Since its inception, the water body has had only two other substantive MDs - Francis Mugo and Philip Gichuki Muguna was appointed acting MD in August 2017; he had previously been director of technology.
