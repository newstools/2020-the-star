The world celebrated International Donkey day on Sunday, with the animal’s defenders calling for protection of the beast of burden. The defenders expressed concern that the population of donkeys had continued to reduce due to human behaviour. An organisation dealing with the welfare of donkeys in Western Kenya said illegal slaughter and theft of donkeys for export was reducing the population of donkeys. This year’s celebrations were marked under the theme "Donkeys power for Resilience". The donkeys welfare organisation Send Cow urged residents to support government efforts to protect donkeys. Nyanza and Western Send Cow coordinator Peter Ng’ielo said the high demand for donkey skins and meat in foreign countries had threatened the population of the animals. Ng’ielo told donkey farmers not to engage in activities that may affect the animal's growth. “Donkeys play pivotal roles in the society. It’s important we protect their lives to enable us continue undertaking the transportation services using them,” Ng’ielo said. Speaking to journalists in Homa Bay town on Sunday, the official asked farmers to report to the government any threat they face against donkeys. He said donkeys had supported the livelihoods of many families, noting that any harm to the animal would contribute to increased poverty. “The population of donkeys has reduced to about 18,000 in Homa Bay because of theft and illegal slaughter. This has impoverished families which depend on donkeys for livelihood,” he said. In February, the Ministry of Agriculture closed four donkey slaughterhouses to protect the animals. Ng’ielo said they welcomed the move because it promoted the growth of donkey population in Kenya. Homa Bay Send Cow project coordinator George Okoko said the government plans to regularly spray tsetse flies that cause diseases in donkeys. Edited by Henry Makori
