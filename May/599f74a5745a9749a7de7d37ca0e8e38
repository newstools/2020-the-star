Senators allied to President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga are said to be fronting Nominated Senator Judy Pareno as the next Senate Deputy Speaker. The Star has established that behind-the-scenes negotiation would see Pareno removed on Friday afternoon. The decision was arrived at during a Jubilee-Nasa meeting with President Kenyatta at State House on Friday morning. If elected by 45 senators, Pareno who is a member of the Speaker's Panel, will be the first woman Deputy Speaker in the House. It is understood that Pareno was suggested as a compromise candidate by Jubilee and Nasa senators to strengthen cooperation between Uhuru and Raila. Pareno is the chairperson of ODM's National Elections Board, a close confidant and trusted ally of the ODM chief. Uasin Gishu Senator Margaret Kamar and Nairobi's Johnson Sakaja are said to have declined offers to succeed Kindiki after days of negotiating. Election of the new Deputy Speaker will be held next week after the date is gazetted. (Edited by V. Graham)
