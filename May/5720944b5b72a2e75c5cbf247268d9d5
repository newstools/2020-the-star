Even though it is clear the pro-Ruto MPs have genuine concerns to raise with Jubilee boss Uhuru Kenyatta about how they have been handled, I don't think a confrontation with their party leader would help their case. From the look of things, Kenyatta as the Jubilee Party leader has made up his mind about the rebels. I strongly believe that to President Kenyatta and his inner team, there's a strong conviction that Deputy President William Ruto's camp wants to weaken his leadership by setting the public against him. Uhuru does not want to be a lame-duck President and he will fight tooth and nail to protect his legacy. The best option for Ruto's wing should be for the DP to humble himself, reach out to Kenyatta in person, apologise for his indiscretions that have undermined Kenyatta by his ambitions for 2022. He should plead with Kenyatta to pardon him. The DP should publicly reprimand his troops who will be attending the PG at State House to tread with caution for whatever negative actions they will exhibit or utter will naturally be blamed on him. Kenyatta is determined to sanitise Jubilee and nothing will stop him from executing a ruthless purge. Those who feel offended should seek a truce and avoid any utterances that might harden Kenyatta's heart. The DP must now wake up and accept he's fighting from a point of weakness. He should ask for forgiveness and lie low as he prepares to fight another day. The DP's troops in government stand to be hunted down even more if they try to stop Kenyatta's fumigation plans. We are seeing a new Kenyatta because he is reacting to the conduct and lack of respect directed at him by the pro-Ruto MPs. Those who will attend the PG should be calm. The DP, as the deputy party leader, should be in attendance, as well, but pick his words carefully and use the opportunity to make peace. Two years is a long time for anybody to take on a sitting President. The writer is a former Journalist and Political analyst.
