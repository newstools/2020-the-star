A Nairobi court has summoned the OCS Kamukunji police station to appear in court on Tuesday over the disappearance of a Ugandan national charged with kidnapping a police officer. The OCS is expected to shed light on the alleged circumstances that led to Martin Wasike’s disappearance from lawful custody at the police station. Wasike was detained at the police station alongside Shariff Wanabwa and Phoebe Andayi for the alleged disappearance of police officer Abel Misati. They were charged last week with the offence of kidnapping the police officer with the intent to murder. It was alleged that on January 19 this year at an undisclosed place they jointly kidnapped Constable Misati with the aim to murder him. They denied the charge and were remanded at the Kamukunji police station where Wasike is alleged to have escaped from a day after they were charged. Senior Principal Magistrate Kennedy Cheruiyot issued the summons after Misati’s family asked the court to issue the summons to the OCS. Through their lawyer Alfred Nyandieka, the family said they were concerned over the disappearance of the accused persons noting that he was not Kenyan and they need answers.
