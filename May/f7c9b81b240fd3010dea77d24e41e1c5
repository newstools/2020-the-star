Kenya Bureau of Standards has withdrawn eight hand sanitiser brands from the market after they failed quality checks. The move comes just a month after the bureau uncovered 28 fake brands in the market from manufacturers out to cash in on the demand. In a statement, Kebs said it has noted that several brands being manufactured offered for sale do not meet its requirements. ''Following market surveillance activities, KEBS wishes to inform the public that the following eight brands of hand sanitiser have been ascertained as not meeting the requirements of KS EAS 789; Kenya Standard specification for Instant Hand Sanitizers,’’ Kebs said. They include Alphax, Clean Essentials, G&L, Gentle Care, Lili, Msiri, Shi shi Natural, and Spotless Advance. Consequently, the manufacturers of the said products have been instructed to discontinue manufacturing or offering for sale the affected sanitizers. They are also required to recall all the substandard sanitizers from the market and institute corrective actions whose effectiveness shall be confirmed by KEBS before the suspension of permits is lifted. In March, Kebs published quality specifications for hand sanitisers after the product’s demand spiked. It recommended a concentration of 60 to 95 per cent alcohol in hand sanitising products. Kebs has also expressed concern over the continued use of thermometer guns that have not been calibrated saying hey give wrong correct readings.
