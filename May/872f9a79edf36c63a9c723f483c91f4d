Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya has rejected a supplementary budget passed by the county assembly on Tuesday over variation of Sh145 million and returned it for review. Oparanya in his memorandum to the assembly said the reallocation of Sh90 million from the agriculture docket's Sh638 million meant for farm subsidies would leave a pending bill since fertiliser and maize seeds had already been delivered under a binding agreement. Oparanya is also opposed to the assembly's decision to reallocate Sh35 million meant for sports support programme to the shelter improvement programme. "This money has already been spent and therefore not available for reallocation," the memorandum dated May 14 reads. This is the first time Oparanya has returned the budget to the assembly in the seven years he has served as governor. The governor also asked the assembly to remove Sh20 million that was allocated for purchase of Hansard equipment for the county assembly. He termed the proposed purchase a substantive budgetary item that had not been factored in the current financial year's budget. "Due to time and resource constraints the county government will reserve Sh50 million for development programmes for the county assembly in the financial year 2020-2021 which the assembly may use for their various development programmes," he said. Assembly budget and appropriation committee met on Friday at Friends hotel in Kakamega town to review the governor's memorandum. The supplementary budget reduced the development budget by Sh272 million and raised the recurrent budget by Sh69 million. The assembly is likely to sit on Tuesday to debate and pass the revised supplementary burget. Edited by Henry Makori
