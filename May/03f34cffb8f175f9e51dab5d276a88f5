Sixteen people have drowned and over 1,500 families displaced by floods in Central region, Red Cross regional manager Gitonga Mugambi said. Gitonga said on Tuesday at Kariti ward in Ndia constituency, Kirinyaga, that out of the 16 people who have drowned, they have retrieved the bodies of only seven. The affected regions include Kirinyaga county (400 families), Laikipia (500), Murang'a (700), Kiambu (400) and Nyeri (120). Gitonga spoke after distributing tents, mosquito nets, soaps and blankets to over  40 families displaced by floods after Sagana River burst its banks. Ngando and Sagana residents abandoned their houses worth millions of shillings to move to safer grounds. Thigirici assistant chief Mercy Wanjiku praised Red Cross for its assistance and urged residents to help one another. A family in Nguguini village in Ndia escaped death after a massive landslide hit their farm with over 100 coffee bushes. The landslide took place as the family slept. Jane Muthoni Muriithi and her family escaped death during the incident at 2am on Saturday. “I am totally confused as I don’t know what to do after this misfortune. I don’t know how to survive and feed my family as most of my coffee bushes have been washed away. I call on the government to help me,” Muthoni said. Edited by Henry Makori
