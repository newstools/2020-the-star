Health CS Mutahi Kagwe has urged all health workers to protect themselves before protecting others as the country fights Covid-19. Speaking during a press briefing in Kiambu on Thursday, Kagwe reminded the public that health workers are important during this time because they are dealing with people who are both negative and positive. "Our health workers are the single most important factor in combating this disease. We cannot afford to have our health workers infected by the virus and we are happy that so far so good. Protect yourself then protect others," Kagwe said. He also congratulated Kiambu Governor James Nyoro for recruiting health workers. "An additional 100 workers from different cadres are expected to be hired in Kiambu. 1171 healthcare workers have been sensitized on UHC at the counties," he said. He added that the ministry will be building on its UHC capacity and capacity for organizations critical for UHC such as NHIF and Kemsa.
