Fishers in Lamu, Tana River, Kilifi, Mombasa and Kwale counties will get grants to improve their income through a Sh10 billion World Bank loan to Kenya. Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Peter Munya said the concessional loan will target poor families that depend on fisheries. Munya spoke on Thursday while signing the agreements with the five coastal counties who will benefit from the funds. The CS said Kenya has 13,000 small scale fishers who operate near the shore where stocks have declined. “The ministry targets to build their capacity to venture deeper into Kenya’s territorial water and exclusive zones to increase their yields. Already, 186 fishers have been trained in Kilifi and Lamu with plans to train more after the Covid-19 restrictions have been lifted,” he said. He said fish provide high and easily absorbed protein, minerals and oils which can reduce malnutrition among the population. “We expect that the fishers will form stronger associations that will enable them to own semi-industrial and industrial fishing vessels to participate in the tuna and tuna-like fishery currently dominated by the foreign fishing companies,” he said. The grant will be implemented under the Kenya Marine Fisheries and Social Economic Project which seeks to improve governance and management of the marine fisheries and mariculture and strengthen coastal regions. Fisheries PS Micheni Ntiba said marine fisheries has a potential of 300,000 metric tonnes that has not been exploited. The support from the World Bank and the government will be able to transform the marine fisheries, he said. “The government is also setting aside a 30 per cent marine protected area for restocking and conservation of fish.  Currently, we have 17 deep sea fishing machinery that will also assist the youth when fishing,” Ntiba said.
