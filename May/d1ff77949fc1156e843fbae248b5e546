BBC presenter Ciru Muriuki is set to undergo a third endometriosis surgery. She posted a photo in a hospital bed and captioned it, "So Iâ€™m back in the hospital for my third surgery. This journey with endometriosis has not been easy. On the bright side, my skin is popping. We thank God," she wrote. Her last surgery was some days before Christmas in 2017. She shared a photo of herself in the hospital on Instagram and captioned it, "This was me after my first laparoscopic surgery for endometriosis cysts. "I was bleeding into my ovaries every time I had my period. Words cannot describe the pain." Endometriosis is the abnormal growth of cells (endometrial cells) similar to those that form the inside of the uterus but in a location outside of the uterus. Others who have been suffering from this condition include media personalities Njambi Koikai and Janet Mbugua.
