Bungoma Senator Moses Wetangula and Westlands MP Timothy Wanyonyi have lost their brother. Tony Waswa Wetang’ula who also doubled up as Wanyonyi’s aide passed on while undergoing treatment the Agha Khan Hospital, Nairobi. “He is one of my younger brothers and he has been working with my brother Tim, helping him. Tim is working with disability and you need somebody close to you to help you navigate through life so Tony has been working with Tim all these years and he has been part of his life," Wetangula said. The Senator said Waswa was a young man who had enjoyed good health throughout his life. "I don’t remember any single day he has been in hospital. I was called this morning by Tim. I had gone home to see our parents yesterday," he said. "Tim told me Tony had been admitted at Agha Khan a day or so ago with some fevers and after twelve hours, he was moved to ICU and this morning he passed on." Wetangula said the passing was a terrible tragedy to his family but they accept the gift of life that God gave him and the many years and the good time they had with him. "We have lost but that is the will of God," Wetangula said. Ford Kenya party director of communications John Mondo told the Star that Waswa had been admitted to the hospital where he succumbed to his illness.
