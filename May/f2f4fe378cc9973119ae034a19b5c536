More than 100 people living with disabilities in Nyalenda slums, Kisumu county on Monday benefited from food donations. Nyalenda B ward representative Joseph Olale distributed maize flour, cooking oil, salt, and bar soaps to the disabled persons. He said the food packages are aimed at cushioning those living with disability from the effects of coronavirus pandemic. Olale, while giving out the items at Jacaranda Academy in Nyalenda, said those disabled people had been hit hard by Covid-19 and floods. “With deteriorating economic activities they are facing many challenges which require a collective effort to support them,” he said. The donations program, Olale said, targets 2,500 families in Nyalenda B ward with 1,500 people so far benefited. He announced that they will continue with distribution to the less fortunate persons in his ward. Olale on Tuesday distributes food items to women in business. The traders, he said, are seriously affected in business with the drastic measures to prevent the spread of the virus. The MCA commended the national government for the measures put in place to help cushion residents. He named programs such as Kazi Mtaani which has seen 2,300 youths enrolled earning Sh653 per day. Others are M-Pesa transfer and disability fund programs.
