A woman is fighting for her life after her car was sprayed with bullets on defying police orders to stop on Emali/Loitokitok road on Sunday. The woman, who according to the police, was driving towards Loitokitok on the Kenya/Tanzania when she defied police orders to stop. Kajiado County Police Commander, Beatrice Gachago told the Star that her officers had received a prior report of a stolen car that bore similar registration numbers and colour. “The officers stopped the woman as she approached a police roadblock in the Mashuuru Sub-County jurisdiction but refused,” said Gachago. She said her action prompted the police to open fire on the car in a bid to demobilise it. The county police boss said the woman received several gunshots, and that her officers were yet to provide full information by Sunday night. An eye witness earlier told the Star that the woman was driving towards the roadblock when she was flagged down but refused to stop. The woman was shot five times with one bullet still logged in her stomach, according to medics at Makindu sub-county hospital. She had been rushed to the hospital where she is nursing serious gunshot wounds. Makindu hospital medical superintendent, Dr David Kasanga, confirmed the receipt of the patient. Kasanga said the woman was shot several times; on the left thigh, hands, and another gunshot on the stomach. "There is a consultant surgeon who is trying to save her life since she has lost a lot of blood following these injuries. He is currently assessing the damage on the stomach, to repair that first to stop more loss of blood,” said Kasanga.
