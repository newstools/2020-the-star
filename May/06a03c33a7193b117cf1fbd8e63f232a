Gospel singer Laura Karwira says she was reached out to by the Permanent Presidential Music Commission to work on 'Pambazuka'. The song carries the message of hope to Kenyans at this time of the coronavirus pandemic. Speaking to Word Is, Laura said she had an amazing time working on the song. "It's a song of hope that unites Kenyans to recognise and face in unity their present enemies, one major one being the corona pandemic at the moment," she said. "The song reminds us of our fierce Kenyan spirit and encourages us even in the dark times, that eventually, through God, everything is going to get better." The song features Bire, Chuchu, Isaac Mugunda and Ray Gee, the former street child who went viral online a few weeks ago, singing Justin Bieber's song. Karwira is famed for her song 'Ujulikane' featuring Alice Kimanzi, which was nominated as the Praise and Worship Song of the Year in 2018's Groove awards.
