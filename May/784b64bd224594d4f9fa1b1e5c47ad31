Health CS Mutahi Kagwe on Thursday said the ministry had a meeting with spiritual leaders to address emerging issues from the Covid-19 pandemic that cannot be addressed by law. He said some challenges, including domestic violence and financial distress which have since increased due to the virus, cannot fully be solved through the law. Kagwe said the government plans to work with the religious community -Christians, Muslims, and other religions -   to help reduce the impact caused by the pandemic. "At a time when we feel that the cases that we are getting are discouraging, allow us to change the protocols that we have developed. It doesn't matter what it is, as long as you are intending to bring people together at this point in time," he said. Kagwe noted that religious leaders have acknowledged the limitation of what the government is able to do during these hard times and some have plans to continue with virtual services after resumption of the normal schedule (post-coronavirus). Kagwe was speaking during the daily Covid -19 presser where he announced 80 more virus cases bringing the number to 1,102, the total cases in the country.
