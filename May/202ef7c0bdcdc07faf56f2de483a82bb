Twelve health workers who came into contact with a Bomet man who died from coronavirus have tested negative for the disease. Bomet Governor Hillary Barchok said on Thursday samples from the health workers, including nurses, clinical officers and a medical officer, were sent to the Kenya Medical Research Institute (Kemri) laboratory in Kisumu on Wednesday. The first test was conducted after they spent four days in quarantine. The second test is set to be conducted on Sunday. They will, however, have to remain in seclusion until the end of the mandatory 14 days. The Covid-19 patient is said to have sneaked into the county from Nairobi. He was admitted to Longisa Referral Hospital on Monday last week. He died the following day. The burial took place on Wednesday night in Kagawet. Only two members of the family attended the ceremony which was conducted by health workers from the county. Sixteen other family members have been quarantined at Kaplong School in Sotik. Barchok urged residents to be vigilant and observe government guidelines to prevent further spread of the disease. “We now hope our people will start taking the precautions seriously. When we say this virus is dangerous, people think it is a joke,” he said. Edited by A.N
