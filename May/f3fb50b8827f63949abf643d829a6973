The virtual Madaraka day celebrations will be hosted in two venues in Nairobi due to coronavirus pandemic. The unique June 1 celebrations will start at 8am where the Kenya Defence Forces stage a show at the Nyayo stadium and culminate in the live address by President Uhuru Kenyatta from State House, Nairobi. All the events are synchronised into one event and will be aired live on media platforms with no crowd allowed at the venues. “You can see fighter jets are running and KDF is also training. Just expect a good production,” the state official said. Very few people will attend the State House celebrations according to the details obtained by the Star. Among those who will attend includes Deputy President William Ruto, Cabinet Secretaries and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga. The jets will also fly above Nyayo Stadium and State House to commemorate the day when Kenya attained its full independence. The event will be supported with the recorded entertainment programs and documentaries that highlights Kenya’s culture as well as development milestones since 1963. Interior PS Karanja Kibicho said on Tuesday that the government had put in place mechanisms for virtual celebrations. “This is therefore to ask you to advice the public to remain at home and follow the celebrations on radio and television,” Kibicho directed county commissioners. Traditionally, Madaraka Day has been celebrated  in an event where the foreign and Kenyan dignitaries attends with Kenyans being invited to also participate.
