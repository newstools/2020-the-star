A journalist is nursing serious injuries at the Homa Bay County Referral Hospital after he was attacked by three gangsters. Linus Ombima of Rameny FM in Rongo town, Migori, was attacked on his way to work at 8.15pm on Thursday. He had barely gone 20 metres away from his house in Rongo town when the assailants pounced on him. "The three men confronted me after they emerged from the opposite direction. One of them pounced on my head with an axe as two others blocked me from running away,” Ombima said from his hospital bed. He suffered deep-cut injuries to his head. His right cheek was stabbed with a knife that pierced through the other and one of his right fingers was also chopped off. Investigations are underway. The assailants dumped him at the roadside thinking he was already dead. He was later rescued by neighbours. Ombima is a news anchor at the radio station. His attack, therefore, disrupted programme that night and the following day. Rameny FM manager Paul Odhiambo said they learnt of Ombima's misery after he failed to return, as was expected, to read the 9pm news. "He read the news at 7pm and went back to his house so he could return for the 9pm bulletin. His wife informed us he had been attacked after he failed to read the 9pm news,” he said. Odhiambo said the attack must have been planned. “It seems the attackers are people who know Ombima very well and they planned to attack him,” he said. Rongo subcounty police commander Peter Okiring’ said they were already investigating. “We have the information and are already doing investigations to ensure the suspects are arrested, ” he said.
