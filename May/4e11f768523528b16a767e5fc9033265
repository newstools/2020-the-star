The Ministry of Education has said it is working on a system to involve parents in the learning of their children. The ministry says it has received reports of parents struggling to ensure their children follow the out-of-class learning adopted after schools were closed on March 15 following the Covid-19 outbreak. Because of the coronavirus fallout, the government adopted digital and broadcast platforms such as TV and radio to facilitate learning. This has drawn criticism from some stakeholders, who say many learners, especially those from poor families, are left out. But Education Chief Administrative Secretary Mumina Bonaya said parents have a shared responsibility with schools to ensure meaningful teaching and learning takes place. "Parents are the first and continuing educators of their children. They are not expected to teach but to motivate their children to achieve their full potential,” she said during a meeting at the Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development, Nairobi. The team is expected to come up with strategies that will enable parents and guardians to create an environment that is conducive not only to learning at home but also to the overall wellbeing of the learners. The CAS noted that informed parents have a positive impact on the overall development of their children in the acquisition of the right morals and religious values, among other beneficent attributes. The out-of-class lessons give learners an opportunity to interact with their immediate environment and practise the values instilled in them at school. “As learning continues to take place at home, we need to not only focus on the academic dimension but also the physical, moral, social and psychological wellbeing of the child,” Bonaya said. KICD council chairperson Sara Ruto underscored the invaluable role that parents play in the education of their children. She said they cannot be left behind in their children's academic journey.
