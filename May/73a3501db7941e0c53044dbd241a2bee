Nominated Senator Naomi Waqo has pledged her loyalty to President Uhuru Kenyatta. In a statement on Friday, Waqo said she was loyal to the Head of State and Jubilee Party leader. "I stand by and I am guided by his decisions in all matters affecting our party and our great nation," she said. Waqo said she was unable to travel to Nairobi to attend the party parliamentary group meeting on Monday because of unavoidable circumstances Jubilee was aware of. Waqo said she communicated her apology and it was duly registered during the meeting. "I stand by the resolutions adopted during the meeting. I congratulate and support our new leaders in Senate, Sen Samuel Pogishio, Sen Fatuma Dullo, Sen Irungu Kangata and Sen Farhiya Haji," she said. She went on to tell her political detractors that it was impossible to drive a wedge between the President and herself. "I am aware that meetings have been going on to try and discredit me due to the grassroots support that I enjoy. I will always serve my people and God to the best of my ability," Waqo said. On Wednesday, nominated Senator Christine Zawadi pledged her allegiance to the party hours after her name was included in a disciplinary list. In the list, Chief Whip Irungu Kang'ata listed Zawadi, Falhada Dekow Iman, Naomi Jillo Waqo, Victor Prengei, Mary Seneta Yiane and Millicent Omanga. They are facing disciplinary action for snubbing the parliamentary group meeting on Monday. Jubilee has threatened to expel the five nominated senators for snubbing the Presidentâ€™s meeting. Secretary general Raphael Tuju said the party would take action against rebels in Parliament, including a recall. Edited by Henry Makori
