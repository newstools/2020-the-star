Fifty-three out of 183 Kenyans who had registered to travel back home from China will not make it, a senior source at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Wednesday. The source who is not permitted to speak to the media said some of the 53 did not meet travel requirements while others could not afford an air ticket. Those who were willing to come were being evacuated at their own cost. Last Friday, Kenyaâ€™s ambassador to China Sarah Serem said 183 Kenyans have been working and residing in the country or were businessmen affected by the closure of the airspace in bid to curb the spread of Covid-19. To facilitate their travel, Serem had asked those who had an expired or lost passport to submit their documents to the embassy for processing. The Kenyans were also required to obtain a Covid-19 certificate prior to being cleared to board. Foreign Affairs confirmed that 130 Kenyans will be on a Kenya Airways flight that that is expected to depart on Thursday and arrive in the country on May 9 from Guangzhou. Health CS Mutahi Kagwe clarified on Wednesday that upon arrival, the Kenyans will not be placed in government quarantine but in appropriate facilities decided by their doctors who will monitor them. At the same time, Kenyans in India willing to return home overbooked by 80 people. On Monday, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed an arrangement to fly 223 Kenyans who are expected in the country on Thursday evening.  Edited by Henry Makori
