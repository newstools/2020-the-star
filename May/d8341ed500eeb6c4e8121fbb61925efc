Fewer people are staying at home and going to their places of work this week compared to last week, Google’s latest Covid-19 Community Mobility Report reveals. According to the report released on May 11, more people are visiting recreation centres, groceries, pharmacies, parks, bus stops, and train stations. The report reveals that eight per cent more Kenyans have visited retail and recreation spaces in the last one week. These spaces include restaurants, cafes, shopping centres, museums, libraries, and movie theatres. This could be a result of the government’s recent directive on the reopening of restaurants. Additionally, there is a 10 per cent increase in the number of people who visited grocery markets, farmers' markets, speciality food shops, drug stores, and pharmacies in the last week. This is after a seven per cent reduction in movement in these areas last week. According to the report, increased visits to drug stores and pharmacies could be an indication of Kenyans trying to find self-medication solutions against Covid-19. Six per cent more Kenyans visited national parks, public beaches, marinas, dog parks, plazas, and public gardens. The report further reveals that more people used public transport like buses and trains - a nine per cent increase in movement in bus and train stations, up from a previous three per cent reduction. There was a one per cent drop in movement in both residential areas and places of work in the last week, compared to the previous week’s five per cent drop and 16 per cent increase respectively.
