Nurses in health centres were on Monday treated to flowers to mark 'Nurses' Week' and '2020 Year of the Nurse and Midwife' as declared by the World Health Organisation. The treat was organised by the Kenya Healthcare Federation through Kepsa in partnership with Elgon Kenya and the Kenya Flower Council. KHF board director Faith Muigai and SafeCare regional director carried the programme and also read out a message encrypted on the flower bouquet from President Uhuru Kenyatta to the nurses. It said, "There have been few moments in history when the world has faced a crisis as far-reaching and consequential as this. It is exactly in moments such as this that we display our humanity, perseverance and hope. Whatever the adversity, no matter the foe, we shall triumph together. We stand united. Tuko pamoja."
