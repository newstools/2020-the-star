A chief in Isiolo county has been arrested in connection with a recent cattle rustling incident in the area. County commissioner Herman Shambi said they will not allow government officials or residents to aid cattle rustlers. Shambi did not name the chief to avoid possible interference with investigations. The suspect is awaiting arraignment. He said the chief covered for the cattle rustlers when he had information about them and where they hid the stolen animals. He said another highly-connected individual is in police custody. “We will not be intimidated by who the rustler is related to. No one will be spared in the fight on cattle rustling menace in Isiolo,” he said. Shambi said they have made significant progress in their efforts to recover stolen animals. Eighteen out of 23 cows stolen from Igembe, Meru county have also been recovered. “A dairy cow and five goats recently stolen from a farmer in Kambi ya Juu area have also been recovered,” he said. The administrator told journalists on Thursday that an entire community will not be punished because of a few criminals. He urged the public to volunteer crucial information to security agents to enable them to arrest all those involved in rustling. The police post at Kambi ya Juu, that had been closed for some months, will also be opened Friday to boost security in the area, he said. (edited by o. owino)
