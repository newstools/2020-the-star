A woman who insulted her neighbour that she uses boosters to enlarge her hips pleaded guilty on Thursday. Monica Njeri was arraigned before Kibera senior principal magistrate Derrick Kuto. Njeri committed the offence at Mutuini in Riruta, Nairobi. She was charged with using offensive words with the intention to provoke Mary Wambui, the complainant. “She brushed her off and started insulting the complainant. She called her a prostitute and threatened to burn his house,” the charge sheet read. Njeri expressed remorse and asked for forgiveness. Kuto directed the matter be mentioned on Friday for sentencing.
