Kenya has recorded 25 more people who have tested positive for coronavirus disease, bringing the total to 607. CAS Rashid Aman on Thursday said they tested 1,075 samples in 24 hours. From this, 22 are Kenyans, one Ugandan, one Tanzanian and one Chinese. A total of 21 are male and four are female. He said that 17 are from Nairobi, two Wajir, two Kajiado and one each from Migori, Mombasa and Isiolo counties. This marks the first case in Isiolo. Aman said Eastleigh is leading with nine cases. Kenya has recorded seven new discharges, bringing the total to 197. Three more patients have died, bringing the total to 29. The government has warned Kenyans who fled from Eastleigh and Old Town, after a lockdown was announced. "We are appealing to these families. For those welcoming those members, you are placing yourself in danger. Those within these areas, please remain in there,"  Aman said. "If you are infected unknowingly, then you have spread he disease. By moving out there is a chance that you are a carrier. You must assume that you are a carrier." Aman said this should remain in the conscience of people sneaking out. On Wednesday, the government  locked down Eastleigh and Old Town as coronavirus cases surge. More to follow...
