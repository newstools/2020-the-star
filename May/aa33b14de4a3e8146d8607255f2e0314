New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has rung in the start of the trading day at the New York Stock Exchange, marking its return after a two-month closure. “In the two months the floor was dark, NYers bent the curve and slowed the spread of this virus,” the governor tweeted. Under new measures at the NYSE, only a quarter of the normal number of traders will be allowed to return to work. Traders must also avoid public transport, wear masks and follow strict social distancing rules, with newly fitted transparent barriers to keep people apart. New York City has been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, with some 200,000 cases and more than 20,000 deaths.
