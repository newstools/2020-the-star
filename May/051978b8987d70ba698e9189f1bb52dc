Gatundu North residents are disregarding government directives on the Covid-19 pandemic. A spot check by the Star in Kanyoni, Kamwangi, Karure, Gatukuyu and Kang’oo in the subcounty revealed residents carrying out their daily duties without observing the guidelines.  In towns and market places, locals disregard social distancing and very few have face masks. Boda boda operators carry more than one passenger while eateries have no hand washing equipment. Operators who spoke to the Star said customers insisted on carrying more passengers to save cost. They said they were aware of the risks but blamed the shortage of face masks. “We understand the risks but we are ensuring that they wash their hands first. The problem we have is shortage of face masks. It’s a headache,” said Joel Waithaka, a boda boda rider. Other residents said protective gear such as face masks and sanitiser were scarce in the area. “We are doing our best to protect ourselves even though the face masks and hand sanitiser are scarce here. Again, most locals live from hand to mouth and cannot afford the face masks. But God will protect us,” resident Nelly Wairimu said. Gatundu North legislator Ann Kibe warned that the pandemic had reached Kiambu county. “It’s worrying to see that people are carrying out their businesses as usual as if nothing serious is happening. The virus is not only in the urban areas but has reached the rural areas. We must adhere to the guidelines by the government so that we can protect ourselves and our loved ones from suffering from the pandemic,” Kibe said at Karure town. The MP said she was in talks with the government to have local tailors produce face masks. Edited by Henry Makori
