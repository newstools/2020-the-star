A Bungoma MCAs has asked Governor Wycliffe Wangamati to sack any corrupt officials in his government. Ford Kenya nominated MCA Luke Opwora said that county lawmakers were irked by cases of alleged loss and misuse of funds meant to fight Covid-19. Opwora told journalists at the county assembly precincts that allegations that the county had inflated the cost of handwashing jerricans was tainting the party's image. On April 16, the ethics agency began investigating the controversy surrounding the purchase of 600 20-litre jerricans at Sh10,000 each by the county government. “Our governor who was elected on a Ford Kenya party ticket promised to live up to electorates' expectations and we believe he is on the right track,” he said. He said the assembly has supported Wangamati's agenda by ensuring whatever the executive brings on the floor is approved. “We believe in you and will continue doing so as long as you don't allow some corrupt officials in your government to ridicule you, ridicule our county and ridicule our Ford Kenya party,” he told the governor. The MCA asked Wangamati to let dishonest employees who want to sabotage his regime carry their crosses. “If you are a county employee and you have been implicated in any corrupt deal, please step aside for probe to be conducted by relevant agencies,” he said. The MCA said that officers cleared of wrongdoing will be allowed back to their offices. He said if any officer will be found to have defrauded taxpayers, they will be put behind bars and surcharged. Opwora said that the party has the mandate to fulfil promises they gave to wananchi. “We, as a party, are not happy with whatever is going on in our county with people bringing division among our leaders regardless of their affiliation,” he said.
