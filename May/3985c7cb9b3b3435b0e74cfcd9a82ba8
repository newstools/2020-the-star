President Uhuru Kenyatta has sent a message of comfort to the family of former Makueni MP Peter Kiilu who passed away at a Nairobi hospital. The President eulogised the former MP as a friendly and seasoned public administrator who served the nation with distinction. Kiilu died on Tuesday. It is not clear what killed him. In the 2007 Kenyan parliamentary election, Kiilu was elected to the National Assembly of Kenya as a member of the Orange Democratic Movement-Kenya (later the Wiper Democratic Movement) representing Makueni constituency. In the 2013 Kenyan general election, he ran on the National Rainbow Coalition (NARC) ticket, but Dan Maanzo defeated him. During his tenure as a lawmaker, Kiilu served as a member of the Joint Committee on Parliamentary Broadcasting and Library (2008 - 2012) and as the vice-chair of the Administration and National Security Committee. Prior to that,  Kiilu worked as a Provincial Commissioner from 1991 to 2003 and a  District Commissioner from 1984 to 1991 . Kiilu attended Maseno High School before joining the University of Nairobi.
