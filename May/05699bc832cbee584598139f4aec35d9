More than 300 Muslims in Tana River county have received food from the Arid Lands Development Focus. The NGO distributed rice, beans, wheat flour, cooking fat, cooking oil, sugar and milk valued at Sh9 million. The items were donated by Secours Islamique France, a French Islamic humanitarian organisation based in Nairobi. ALDEF programme manager Mohamed Ali said the victims lived in Dairy village before floods ravaged the area. He said beneficiaries include orphans, people with disability, the elderly, those with chronic diseases, homes headed by women, breastfeeding mothers and malnourished children. Mohamed said the programme is supporting 168 households from Garissa and Tana River counties. He said stringent measures are in place to protect flood victims from contracting Covid-19. “The camps have enough handwashing facilities and residents observe social distancing,” Mohamed said. Mohamed Dabaso, a youth leader from Madogo, said majority of Tana River residents are starving and need urgent help. He said they are daily income earners but they cannot work because of the curfew and restrictions put in place. Dabaso asked the national government and development partners to come to their rescue. ALDEF also takes care of 850 households in Wajir county. Edited by Frank Obonyo
