After good rains, new life often emerges in many ways. Forests are major carbon sinks and are actually a sort of "green lung" because they clean the air, remove dust particles and produce oxygen. Carbon sinks in forested areas are dynamic; their capacity can grow or shrink regionally. The Nairobi National Park is a very important carbon sink for the city of Nairobi and is essentially the “lungs of Nairobi”. It is therefore critically important that the natural habitat within the park is not destroyed. It was the late Anoop Shah who had a vision and encouraged others to start the Nairobi Greenline Project to ensure the boundaries of the Nairobi Park are protected with 250,000 trees from Nairobi to Athi River. However, it is also the sad current reality that large sections of the Greenline belt have already been destroyed by infrastructure developments. Trees still hold many secret treasures, and it is believed the cures for many diseases will be found in the leaves of trees in future. How beautiful the forest is just after the rains, with the flowers and many birds. In some places, if you just sit quietly, you will hopefully become aware of the beautiful fragrances, while at the same time listening to our feathered friends as the birds sing a wonderful orchestra of melodies. This simple activity can be very therapeutic for those who practise it. It always allows us the opportunity to draw near to God as we find rest and peace. Our lives are like flowers in a forest. We bud, we blossom and we fade. Let us live to the fullest while we can. Next time you visit the Nairobi National Park, also remember the park is a major part of the “green lung" for the greater Nairobi district. So let us all “Go Green” wherever and whenever we can!
