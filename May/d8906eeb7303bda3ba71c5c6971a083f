Rift Valley clerics want the government to classify churches as essential services providers and allow them to resume operations with stringent conditions. Bishop Peter Simwa, chairman of the Eldoret Gospel Ministers Association said Kenyans needed to continue worshipping despite the Covid-19 outbreak. Eldoret Catholic Bishop Dominic Kimengich made a similar call but said Kenyans should continue to fully adhere to control measures outlined by the government. “Many of the religious leaders are saying now that the government has eased restriction on some sectors like restaurants, it is time the government looked into ways of helping churches to continue with their operations,” Kimengich said at a press briefing in Eldoret. He said the closure of the churches was affecting many Christians. For instance, he said, Catholic faithful had gone for weeks without taking the Eucharist. “We are all praying to God to intervene in this situation and would like to go back to normalcy,” Kimengich said. He said the church had also suffered losses of its key members in other parts of the world. “If they allow restaurants to open and matatus to continue carrying passengers then there is no problem if we are allowed to operate with all measures in place,”  Simwa said. He said they were happy with the way President Uhuru Kenyatta was leading the fight against Covid-19. Churches have raised resources that will be used to assist the needy and very vulnerable in society, he said. “We are grateful that the President has always called church leaders to pray for the country, but we are now saying that Kenyans need to be allowed to go to churches and pray to God,” Simwa said.
