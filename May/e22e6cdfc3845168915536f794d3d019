Former Sports CS Rashid Echesa has sought the release of his firearms and vehicle which were confiscated by detectives. In an urgent application filed in Milimani court, Echesa said has been forced to sometimes to use public transport which has subjected him to embarrassment. “By continuing to illegally detain applicant’s only motor vehicle, the respondents have rendered him immobile, subjected him to embarrassment and loss of human dignity in that he is now forced to use public transport and sometimes walk...” The confiscation of his firearm too, he said, has exposed him to security risk. Echesa argues that his rights to personal security as guaranteed by the Constitution have been contravened as a result. In his view, the confiscation of his firearm was done contrary to a court order from Kakamega. “Confiscating the applicant’s firearms has greatly subjected him to serious security risks and challenges given that he is the immediate former Youth and Sports Cabinet Secretary,” the suit papers read. Echesa said he fears the car, which was impounded and is held at the DCI will be vandalised and waste away to his detriment. When he was arrested and vehicles confiscated, the detectives had said they wanted to question him in relation to the ownership of the cars. Echesa termed his re-arrest and the entire operation a political witch hunt. But according to police sources, the arrest was effected following a revived 2016 case in which the former CS had been accused of fraudulently obtaining and transferring ownership of the vehicles, which allegedly belonged to one of his dead friends. The friend’s widow had filed the case at the Kiambu magistrate’s court. On February 26, the detectives obtained a search warrant from the Kiambu chief magistrate’s court under a miscellaneous criminal application. The state has been given two days to respond to his application which will be heard on May 23. Edited by R.Wamochie
