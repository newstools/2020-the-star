We are facing a  monumental health crisis in the fight against coronavirus. The pandemic threatens the livelihoods of millions through job losses and the decimation of segments of the economy. The national government has appealed for contributions in cash and in kind. The response has been heart-warming. By last week, about Sh2 billion had been donated. But even as we battle Covid-19, the ongoing heavy rains have created yet another national disaster that requires a speedy and urgent response. The landslides and flash floods have already killed almost 120 people and destroyed crops and other property. The National Disaster Preparedness Authority seems to be in total slumber. The vulnerable families have been left to the mercy of NGOs and ill-prepared county governments.  It is a natural disaster like the floods that the authority was meant to deal with but their indifference only inspires despair and hopelessness. The disaster team must lead from the front and inspire confidence and demonstrate they are up to the task. The government should create a fund that can deal with flooding and other emergencies instead of appealing for help long after the disaster has struck.
