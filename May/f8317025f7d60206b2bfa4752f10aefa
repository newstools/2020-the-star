Hippos from Masinga Dam have killed a boy and mauled another after moving to the banks following extreme flooding. One of the boys, 17, was mauled to death by a hippopotamus in Murangâ€™a Ndogo village when he went to fetch water for the family at around 3pm on Sunday. Riakanau senior chief Kimeu Musyimi, under whose area the two attacks took place, said hippos in the hydroelectric dam have moved to the banks and are causing terror. The boy's body was recovered and taken to Embu Level 5 Teaching and Referral Hospital mortuary. Musyimi said in the first incident, which took place about a week ago, a hippo attacked a 16-year-old boy fetching water in Thingini village at around 1pm and critically injured his back. It also broke his hand. He is admitted at Embu Level 5 Hospital. Musyimi asked residents to stop sending children to fetch water from the dam and instead encourage them to study. Edited by R.Wamochie
