Lecturers will be moving to Parliament seeking job protection and funding for research to provide solutions to coronavirus challenges. Universities Academic Staff Union secretary general Constantine Wasonga, in a statement on Friday, said the union's top organ had also resolved to contribute to the coronavirus kitty. However, contributions by individual academic staff to the fund is voluntary. The union wants academic staff who provide frontline healthcare services to be given PPEs and emergency allowances. All academic staff should be accorded adequate health insurance, the union says. The union highlighted unresolved issues with e-learning, including access, equity, examination procedure, policy, and social injustice. It wants public universities to provide access to the internet and data bundles to all staff working from home. The union wants the Education ministry and Treasury to release funds to public universities to implement the payment of staff in accordance with the CBA reached in December 2019. In the CBA, academic staff will get a 5.8 per cent pay rise progressively over five years. It was to cover the 2017-21 period and the overdue period is to be backdated. Edited by Josephine M. Mayuya
