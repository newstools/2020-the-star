A man died after a landslide buried his house at Chania in Nyeri town on Friday. Neighbours said the landslide occurred at night following heavy rain on Thursday. “This landslide occurred at night when one of the houses was buried with one person trapped inside,” Jackson Maina said. Nyeri county commissioner Loyford Kibaara who visited the scene said the rain will continue and urged people to move to safer grounds. He said some areas in the county experienced landslides and flooding. Tetu, Mukurwe-ini , Othaya and Nyeri Central subcounties were most at risk, he said. “Even in Kieni West subcounty we had areas which were flooded and about 40 people were affected,” he said. Kibaara blamed residents for settling on riparian land. The area in Nyeri town where the landslide occurred is on the banks of River Chania. The body of the man was removed by members of the public as no machinery would access the area. The county commissioner appealed to all people living in riparian areas and other sections prone to flooding or landslides to relocate to safer grounds. He said on Friday morning there was a landslide in Tetu but there were no casualties. Edited by Henry Makori
