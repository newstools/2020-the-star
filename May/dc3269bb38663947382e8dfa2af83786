In 2017, five candidates joined forces to beat then Kiambu Governor William Kabogo and propel their aspirant, Ferdinand Waititu, to office. The five were called United for Kiambu. Their man Waititu, however, left them out in the cold when he took office. But Governor James Nyoro has accommodated his teammates in the government within 100 days in office. The team comprised Waititu, Nyoro as his running mate, engineer John Mugwe, businessman and preacher Kariuki Ngare, and Aquiline Njoki. Waititu was impeached by MCAs last year and the move upheld by the Senate on January 29. Nyoro succeeded him. “It is always good to recognise something good someone did for you. We have Mugwe and Ngare as my advisers. Njoki is a member of our board. This team will always advise us and I'm sure we have a strong team,” he said. During Waititu's time, Ngare was left without an office while the government was being formed while Mugwe was sacked and Nyoro, though in government, complained of being sidelined. Nyoro on Tuesday said his administration has accommodated all the UFK members. He spoke at Kamirithu polytechnic in Limuru subcounty where he launched the production of face masks. The institution will make 50,000 face masks per week. The governor said five other polytechnics will also produce face masks, which will be distributed by MCAs in all the 60 wards for free. “The MCAs will be collecting them from our headquarters and distribute them to our people in all wards,” Nyoro said. He was accompanied by MCAs Jacque Nungari (Bibirioni), Ngigi Karuga (Limuru East), Joseph Kahenya (Limuru Central) and majority leader Gideon Gachara, who is also Ndeiya MCA. Others were Deputy Governor Joyce Ngugi and Education executive Mary Kamau. Edited by Josephine M. Mayuya
