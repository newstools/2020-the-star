A woman and her daughter were arraigned on Tuesday for allegedly possessing a tortoise without a permit. Rosemary Ogode and Sara Tamala appeared before Kibera chief magistrate Mwaniki but were not charged after the prosecution sought an adjournment to Wednesday to pave the way for an amendment to the charge sheet. Prosecutor Charles Mwangi had told the court that the charge sheet needed some few corrections before the two are released on bond. The charge sheet present in court says the two were found in possession of a Sh100,000 male leopard tortoise on Ziwani Estate, Starehe constituency, Nairobi, this month. They did not have a permit. The magistrate directed the matter adjourned to Wednesday.
