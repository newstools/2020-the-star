 A security guard has been arrested in Kabondo Kasipul constituency for allegedly stealing medical equipment The guard who works at Kabondo Level 4 hospital in the constituency was arrested on Saturday for stealing the equipment from the health facility. The guard’s arrest came following a tip off from locals who had seen some of the items hidden in his maize farm. Others were hidden in a thicket near his home at Kotuoya village, in the same constituency. The stolen items included a theatre machine, lamps, bed sheets, electric cables, two tents, water tanks, blankets and 13 plastic chairs were later recovered. Rachuonyo East Deputy County Commissioner Jack Obuo said the guard had developed a habit of stealing equipment from the hospital and selling them elsewhere. “It seems the guard had a market somewhere else to which he has been transporting the items. He has been committing the crime for while before our officers investigated and recovered the lost items,” Obuo said. Obuo told security guards in the area to uphold integrity in discharging their duties. “It is wrong for a security guard who is entrusted with public property to steal the same property he is employed to guard,” the administrator added. The suspect was detained at Othoro police station where he would be charged after investigations are complete.
