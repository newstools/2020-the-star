Political leaders in Kilifi on Saturday called for unity to better fight for their people’s rights and solve perennial problems in the Coast region. Speaking at the burial of Mama Esther Ngala, the widow of former Coast political kingpin Ronald Gideon Ngala, the leaders promised to work together for Coast unity. The leaders said they had to put their political differences aside to fight for what the late Ngala wanted for his people, namely, land. They said they would use their positions to help the people of Kilifi and the Coast region secure their land. National Land Commission member Kazungu Kambi said the challenge ahead was hard but not impossible. “This problem of land, which our father had dreams of solving, should be solved by us working together,” the former Kaloleni MP said. He told area MP Paul Katana to emulate the late Ngala and ensure the land rights he a fought for were enjoyed by Kaloleni residents. “We support the work you have done in Kaloleni so far. It is the same way that RG Ngala did by the time he died aged 49. You have to do more because you have potential,” Kambi said. He asked Kilifi North MP Own Baya to rise to the challenge and ensure Coast leaders are united. “No one can solve Coast problems if we Coast people do not come together to solve them,” said Kambi. “We have been given positions and when we fail, let us not blame President Uhuru Kenyatta.” Katana he will join hands with Kambi and Baya in ensuring that the sacrifice that RG Ngala made was not in vain. “Let us not complain about the government anymore. We are in government. We must continue the work that RG Ngala started,” said Katana. Baya said RG Ngala represented the Coast region and the Mijikenda people and that he has been following on his words and speeches. Edited by Henry Makori
