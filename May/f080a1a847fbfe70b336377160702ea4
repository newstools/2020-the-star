Three officers nearly clashed at Ugunja after they were posted to head the same police station at the same time. The transfer of OCS Marwa Chacha was cancelled one month after he handed over to his colleague from Kisumu, Micheal Mwatete. Mwatete had already reported to Ugunja police station when the cancellation was made. Marwa, who was in Ugunja, learned of the cancelled transfer and wanted to go back to his previous station but another officer, Patrick Bett, was already in the office. Ugunja OCPD Ibrahim Muchuma said Bett, who was a deputy OCS in Ukwala, will serve as OCS subject to confirmation. On Monday, Ugunja residents protested against the return of Marwa, whom they accused of harassment. Business and transport along Kisumu-Busia highway were paralysed as residents marched and warned that Marwa should never set foot in Ugunja police station again. The residents said Marwa had turned the station into a den of thieves. They accused him of demanding bribes, even from people accused of capital offences such as murder and defilement. “Early this year, a four-year-old girl was defiled and Marwa was bribed with Sh20,000. When we inquired, he kicked us out of his office," resident Anthony Ochieng said. Muchuma said he cannot confirm the allegations against Marwa. He urged residents to forward their complaints to the authorities instead of protesting. “I am hearing the complaint about the officer for the first time. None of the residents has come to my office to report the matter,” Muchuma said. Ochieng said Marwa fined residents caught contravening the curfew. “Those on foot were charged Sh5,000, the ones on motorbikes were charged Sh10,000, while those in vehicles paid Sh20,000,” he said. Ugunja MP Opiyo Wandayi asked Inspector General of Police Hillary Mutyambai to quickly resolve the confusion. He said the botched transfer was causing unnecessary tension and disrupting business.
