Vihiga is unable to conduct mass testing for Covid-19 for lack of funds, Health executive Amos Kutwa has said. “We cannot hire testing kits and the national government is focusing on the worst-hit counties," he said. Vihiga county has not registered any coronavirus case. Kutwa said a report by the Institute of Economic Affairs Kenya is an indicator that Vihiga needs to invest more in the health sector. The county is among devolved units that were listed as having inadequate capacity to deal with the coronavirus pandemic. "We should not expect miracles from Heaven. We need to invest heavily in the health sector despite limited funds," he said. Kutwa said it is unfair to compare Vihiga with counties such as Kakamega, Bungoma and Mandera, which have Sh3 billion each for health. “We allocate to the health sector Sh1.4 billion, which is spread as follows; Sh1 billion caters for salary, Sh100 million is for drugs, Sh200 million goes to development and Sh100 million is for daily office activities and emergencies," he said. The CEC said Vihiga needs about Sh800 million to buy drugs for the county's 700,000 residents. “Kakamega General Hospital and Russia hospital (Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital) in Kisumu are entitled to receive government grants and the two cannot be at the same level with Mbale Referral Hospital,” Kutwa said. He said they have earmarked the blood bank to serve as an isolation centre.  Edited by Frank Obonyo
