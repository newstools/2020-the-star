Cotu Secretary General Francis Atwoli on Friday urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to continue in his efforts to repossess grabbed public land. Speaking during Labour Day celebrations in State House, Nairobi, Atwoli thanked the President for taking over the grabbed Ruai sewage land. "Your Excellency, don't get tired. All our research stations land has been grabbed. All public facilities in Nairobi and outside Nairobi have been grabbed. All those government houses, we want you to go ahead and reclaim. Even those plots that were initially owned by the government," he said. Atwoli said the Ruai land repossession sent a strong message to all land grabbers that it is just a matter of time before their ill-gotten parcels revert to the rightful owners. "We urge your government not to relent on these efforts. The entire Kenyan citizens are behind you," he said. On Covid-19, Atwoli said there is no doubt that the country, like the rest of the world, should expect economic meltdown that will see a slow performance in the world economy. "Kenyan workers are hardworking people and are prepared to rebuild the economy after this pandemic," he said. Further, Atwoli urged employers to engage labour unions before effecting pay cuts in the wake of disruptions triggered by COVID-19. He rebuked merciless and arbitrary cuts and job losses which have has caused distress to many. I am a champion of social justice and would be the last person to see workers' rights being abused blatantly without my intervention," he said.
