Prolonged closure of schools may cause mental health problems in children and adolescents, a clinical psychologist has warned. Rose Otieno, a lecturer at Kisii University, said some children and adolescents are already experiencing behavioural and emotional disorder, and are abusing drugs. She said these may at a later stage contribute to low self-esteem, troubled relationships and difficulty in school. Otieno said the psychological impact of Covid-19 and home confinement cannot be underestimated. “When faced with an epidemic or a traumatising situation, children and adolescents may have excessive irritation, bed wetting, thumb sucking, excessive worry, sadness and poor eating or sleeping patterns,” she said. Otieno advised the government to consider the psychological impact of home confinement and reevaluate its approach to handling the pandemic. She added, however, that the measures to control Covid-19 such as closing down learning institutions are appropriate. Despite the measures, the psychologist said, the government has not fully implemented online learning for all 13 million school-going children. She said children in public schools and those from nomadic communities cannot access digital learning because internet is mostly available in towns and e-learning is a new concept in Kenya.
