Lamu residents have been warned against presenting fake permits to travel to locked counties. Lamu county commissioner Irungu Macharia said on Wednesday anyone seeking travel clearance must submit an application to his office three days prior. This follows the government’s cessation of movement into and out of Mombasa, Kwale and Kilifi in the fight against the coronavirus. The cessation of movement has led to the grounding of public transport vehicles in Lamu and Tana River counties. However, some sly Lamu residents have been faking travel permits to enable them to travel to Kilifi and Mombasa. Police manning the various roadblocks on the Lamu-Mombasa highway have also been accused of demanding bribes between Sh200 to Sh1,000 to allow people travelling in and out of Covid-19 hit areas as they wish. Lamu is yet to record a single case of the coronavirus and there are concerns that the loophole could lead to cases in the county. Macharia said all those found breaching Covid-19 guidelines shall be quarantined at their own expense. He said travel permits can only be obtained from his office and nowhere else. “Let it be understood that only the office of the county commissioner can issue travel permits. The application is to be made three days earlier and must indicate the mode of transport to be used. If you don’t follow the law we will have you quarantined by force. You can't put other people at risk by using shortcuts,” Macharia said. Edited by A.N
