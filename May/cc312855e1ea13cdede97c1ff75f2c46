A day after Football Kenya Federation controversially concluded the 2019/20 season, the Kenyan Premier League is now accusing the national governing body of malice. FKF announced on Thursday that the remaining matches of the season would not be played and consequently used the first leg standings to determine the champions and relegated team. This attracted the attention of KPL who are now pointing fingers to Kandanda House for undermining their role. KPL are mandated by law to run the top flight league. "FKF’s decision to end the league on the plain pretext that CAF asked for information regarding strategies put in place to ensure the conclusion of the KPL 2019-20 season reeks of malice. Would FKF have made that decision if CAF had not sought clarity? read a letter from KPL. KPL now say that six weeks is all they will require to run the remaining fixtures once the government relaxes its directives on public gatherings and sporting activities. "It remains the insistence of KPL that it is still possible to finish the league by the end of July 2020. The Government’s decision to extend countrywide curfew and isolation of the Nairobi Metropolitan Region and Mombasa County by 21 days, which expires on May 17, does not provide adequate reason to trigger kneejerk reactions like ending the league without first exploring other avenues which would give teams a sporting chance," added the letter addressed to FKF secretary general Barry Otieno.
