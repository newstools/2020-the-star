Beach operators and hotel workers laid off due to tourism disruptions will be included in the food relief programme in Kwale county. The Covid-19 outbreak has massively affected the tourism sector as hotels closed and small businesses along the coastal beaches suffered. Msambweni deputy county commissioner Erick Wamlevu said mass job losses have prompted the need for intervention. Wamlevu said processes are ongoing to see the affected people get immediate assistance. “Both governments, with the help of Red Cross, have decided to include these persons in the food relief programme because they are also affected,” he said. He spoke on Thursday while distributing food to needy families in Msambweni. Wamlevu said they have partnered the Australian mining firm Base Titanium and are looking for more sponsors to get enough food for the citizens. The administrator said tour operators are mostly hit by the coronavirus outbreak due to travel restrictions and the dwindling number of tourists. Wamlevu has also urged fishermen to protect the coastline and report any case of intruders who might take advantage of the vulnerability of the sea to get to Kenya. The DCC said help would be extended to victims of floods in various parts of the county. More than 500 people have been displaced by floods in Kwale, according to Red Cross regional chairman Ramadhan Bungale. The majority come from Kingwede in Msambweni and Shirazi, Vanga, Tsuini, Jengo in Lunga-Lunga subcounties. Interior CAS Hussein Dado also said the heavy rains have caused havoc in most of the country and asked Kwale residents to remain calm. Dado said the government is assessing the situation to ensure all affected families are assisted. (edited by o. owino)
