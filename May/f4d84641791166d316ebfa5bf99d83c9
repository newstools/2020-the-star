Interior CS Fred Matiang'i and Kisii Woman Representative Janet Ong'era on Thursday made separate reach outs to vulnerable groups with donations in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. Matiang'i donated more than 2,000 face masks and sanitiser to the Kisii Catholic Church while the MP dished out foodstuff worth thousands of shillings to the disabled and traders outside her office. The lawmaker said registration of people with disabilities was ongoing. She said the process has been slow due to a lack of awareness. "Against the projected 8,000 of those having various disabilities, we currently have only 2,000. Going forward, we want to reach out to all of them so that they can also receive help from the government," Ong'era said. She said the disabled people have immense opportunities to leverage their income by starting income-generating activities with funding from the state. Parts of the donations were given out by Matiang'i. More than 400 people benefited from the donations which consisted of flour and sugar. Matiang'i's face mask donations were delivered through businessman Steve Arika and will be dispersed to church members. He praised the church for obeying the government’s directive to close in the bid to curb the spread of coronavirus. As of Thursday morning, Covid-19 had killed 298,401 people across the world out of 4.44 million who have tested positive for the virus. Another 1.66 million patients have recovered. In Kenya, 737 people have tested positive with 40 fatalities and 281 recoveries. Speaking in Kisii as they received the donations, Fr Joseph Otomu urged investors and organisations to support the fight against the pandemic. “Covid-19 is real. That is why we have to heed the government’s directive to prevent it to avoid facing dire consequences,” Otomu said.  Edited by P.O
