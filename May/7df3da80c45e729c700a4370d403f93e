Kenya is experiencing a national power outage following a system disturbance. In a statement on Saturday, Kenya Power said, “We have lost power supply in the national grid due to a system disturbance which occurred on our transmission network at 5.49am.” The company said its engineers are working to identify and address the problem. Kenya Power said it will issue an update on the situation. There are reports an insulator at Sasini Tea Farm, Kiambu, snapped after Kenya tried to feed power to back up Uganda. Power has been restored in some areas. Uganda is also experiencing a countrywide blackout. The country's main power distribution company - Umeme - in a statement said there was emergency load shedding from Saturday to Monday, 9am-5pm in Nalubale, Kiira, Bujagali and Isimba. The shedding is to allow water release tests.
