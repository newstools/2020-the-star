The High Court has extended orders barring the execution of arrest warrant against Kitui Health chief officer for contempt of court. Justice Byram Ongaya of the Employment and Labour Relations Court in Nairobi directed the application by chief officer Richard Muthoka to be heard in a month. In March, the judge issued an order suspending the execution of the warrant, pending the hearing of Muthoka's application challenging the warrant. On November 1, 2019, Dr Kennedy Mulwa obtained orders of warrant of arrest against the chief officer. Muthoka was accused of defying court orders to respond to Mulwa's application in which he was accused of illegally transferring the medic from Kitui Referral Hospital to Zombe Subcounty Hospital. But Muthoka, through lawyer Leonard Mbuvi, filed an application under a certificate of urgency claiming the warrant was issued without him being given the opportunity to be heard. Lawyer Mbuvi told the court that his client was not aware of the case filed by Dr Mulwa challenging his transfer. While seeking the lifting of the arrest order, Muthoka said it was hard for him to work with the warrant hanging over him. He said Mulwa never served him with court papers to warrant his response. He asked the court to suspend its execution. Muthoka said there was nothing sinister in transferring Mulwa. He said that the petitioner, like any other county or national civil servant, is bound to obey normal transfers within the county as directed by his employer. "He is still receiving his full salary, despite the fact that he never reported to his new work station," Muthoka said. "We never sacked the petitioner and since the date of his transfer, he has not worked or reported to work despite the fact that he is earning his full salary to date."  (Edited by F'Orieny)
