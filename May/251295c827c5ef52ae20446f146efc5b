The Foundation for Dialogue Kenya has donated thermal guns to Nyeri government to bolster the war on Covid-19. Governor Mutahi Kahiga on Wednesday said the thermal guns presented to him by the organisation's representative Michael Mugo will be used to screen people entering the county at each of its five entry points. The entry points are in Karatina town, Naromoru, Nairutia, Mukurwe-ini and Kiaguthu, where the county government has been stationing officials to conduct screening. "The organisation has since the onset of the pandemic modified its counter violent extremism programme to counter the pandemic. Apart from the thermal guns, they are supporting community health volunteers with sanitiser, personal protective equipment and training — all in an effort against Covid-19. We appreciate this kind gesture,” Kahiga said. Foundation for Dialogue is a Kenyan non-governmental organisation engaged in the prevention and countering of violent extremism. It has been carrying out its activities in Nyeri county. Nyeri town is a transit town connecting parts of Eastern and Northeastern regions through the Isiolo-Nanyuki–Nyeri–Nairobi route, which can easily be used by terrorists to transport their equipment or promote radicalisation. “I would like to raise my concern over the human traffic entering Nyeri and urge security officers at the entry points to be more vigilant. As of last week, we had recorded a whopping 200,000 people entering Nyeri who had been screened for Covid-19.” Kahiga said the Karatina checkpoint has been recording the largest number of people entering the county registering more than 36,000 every week. He wondered where the people were coming from as Nairobi has been on partial lockdown. The county chief urged residents to be vigilant. He said the rise in Covid-19 positive cases in the country is a wake-up call, hence efforts must be made to contain the virus.
