Football stakeholders in Kakamega County have lauded government's move, through Sports Fund, to avail a Sh20m Covid-19 stimulus package for Kenyan Premier League teams, saying it will go a long way in cushioning players during these tough times. However, the stakeholders, led by businessman Fred Ikana observed that this should be extended to other sporting disciplines for the sake of improving sports across the country. The sporting industry has been hard hit by the pandemic break, leaving several players to go without paycheques while others are being subjected to huge pay cuts. While distributing foodstuffs to needy families in Shinyalu through Ikana Maendeleo Initiative, Ikana said: “I am touched with the sorry state of some of our sports heroes and heroines who have been subjected to abject poverty. Let the government and other well-wishers come out and support them." Former football administrator Moses Akali lauded Sports Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohamed for the initiative. “This is a good idea. Players earn a living out of playing and with clubs unable to attract any revenues the footballers are going without pay despite the responsibilities that await them,” Akali said. Former international Nick Yakhama said: “We want to see the government pushing the program to the lowest levels in the grassroots. We are also appealing to the various County governments to come up with similar programs to salvage the industry."
