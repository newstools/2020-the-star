Catholic Bishop of Eldoret Dominic Kimengich has cautioned leaders against divisive politics and urged them to focus on Covid-19 and humanitarian needs. Rift Valley is considered a bastion of Deputy President William Ruto and a purge of his allies is underway, causing anxiety in the region. The bishop was not specific but he appeared to be referring to the anti-Ruto campaign. The bishop's sentiments were echoed by evangelical bishops and pastors led by Bishop Sybery Nyabero and chairman of the Muslim Preachers and Imams Abubakar Bini. Kimengich said it was immoral for leaders to expend so much energy on politics at a time when Kenyans are suffering life-threatening challenges. Thousands of people are struggling with the effects of the coronavirus, cholera, floods, landslides and general poverty. Speaking at his office in Eldoret, he denounced political scheming and factionalism. “Surely this is not the time for negative politics but for leaders to come together and focus on the many challenges we face," the bishop said, adding there might be no country to govern in the future. “It’s immoral that many people are dying and leaders are focusing on politics," he said, adding that the wounds of the 2008 post-election violence were yet to heal. Nyabero and Bini also urged leaders to help President Uhuru Kenyatta unite the country. Kimengich called for an end to stigmatising recovered Covid-19 patients, saying they should be allowed home to return in peace. Their rejection by their own community is disheartening, he said. All families affected by the virus should be embraced and not mistreated, the clerics said. Red Cross manager for North Rift Nicholas Kemboi separately said many Kenyans had stopped going to hospitals for treatment of other ailments partly because of the stigma associated with Covid-19. Kemboi said Covid-19 is a disease like others and families should not run from patients but take care of them. (Edited by V. Graham)
