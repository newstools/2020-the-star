Comedian Dr Ofweneke, aka Sande Bush, has opened up about how his biological mother abandoned him a week after he was born. Ofweneke is an award-winning MC and one of the most talented comedians in Kenya. Speaking on Churchill Show during Mother's Day edition, Ofweneke recounted his emotional journey. His father was an alcoholic and that angered his mother. Ofweneke was born at Pumwani Hospital. "I was detained in hospital for few days after my mom broke a hospital thermos,” he said. He says when he was taken home, his father was too high to remember that a baby was born. "That is the day my dad quit alcohol and decided to be a better man, but he was not in good terms with my mum," he said. A week after his birth, his father bought a beer at one of his favourite joints in Mathare and before he could drink it, the house girl came. "She told him, ‘Aunty amecome na amewacha mtoi kwa stairs’. He came back and found neighbours picking me up," the comedian said. Ofweneke was left with his dad. "I respect him because he carried two burdens. It has never been easy for him. He has fought a lot of battles. I admire my dad so much," he said. He emotionally added that God gave his dad patience and resilience. "I’ve seen him raise my uncles, aunties and I. Dad, wherever you are, I celebrate you and proud to say that you’re an amazing gentleman," he said. He also thanked his stepmother for taking care of him. The comedian met his mother after form three and she died three years later.
