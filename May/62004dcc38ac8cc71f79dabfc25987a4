Kenya Under-20 assistant coach Michael Aung has joined the Nondies technical bench. Aung, a former player with the side and former international in his hey day, will be in charge of the forwards in a raft of changes announced by head coach Willis Ojal. Former Kenyan international Kenny Andola will take charge of the backs while Hillary Itela will be the scrummaging coach for the 2020-2021 season. Ojal termed the new additions as vital in their quest to contend for the title and is optimistic they will add value to the team. “All the three have had distinguished careers on the pitch and held management roles very recently. I know they will add value to the club as we seek to restore the club’s lost glory,” added Ojal. He said Nondies have a three-year strategic plan and were hopeful of making it to the playoffs after finishing seventh and eighth in the past two seasons hence missing out on the playoffs by a whisker. “We have improved in the past two seasons but we need to make the next step in our journey and qualify for the playoffs. We want to be among the top six teams in the league,” added Ojal He was, however, non-committal on transfer targets as of now. “It’s too early to talk about transfers but with time we will look around and see who can add value to the team,” added Ojal. Elsewhere, Stormers skills’ coach Levy Labeeb has urged Kenyan clubs to refine their skills. The tactician noted that skills are a continuous process which needs to be refined. “The country has very talented players and good coaches but we need to go deeper in terms of skills training,” he added. Labeeb has worked with various Kenyan teams including Simbas and Lionesses between 2012-2017.
