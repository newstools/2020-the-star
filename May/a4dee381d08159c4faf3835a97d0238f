Thirty-two people suspected to have coronavirus in Kisii are under quarantine at the Kenya Medical Training College. Health executive Sarah Omache said they will take samples for testing but the 32 will remain in quarantine for the mandatory 14 days. She thanked residents for informing the authorities about some people who had travelled from Nairobi. Omache urged residents to strictly observe government guidelines because they are for the good of the community. She said action will be taken against people who do not wear masks and refuse to keep social distance. Omache said some residents, especially the elderly, are unable to receive information about the virus so the county will ensure that everybody is taught about the dangers and prevention of Covid-19. She said people in the villages are not observing social distancing and that is why the Kenya Medical Training College has offered to teach them about the disease. “The multi-agency emergency response committee is keeping a close watch in case of an outbreak,” Omache said.
