The Labour court in Kisumu has put on hold the planned massive sacking of lower cadre staff at Kisii University. The injunction was issued late Thursday by Justice Mathias Nduma who certified the matter as urgent. The application, said the judge, shall be served and be responded to within 14 days. He also ordered the applicant to file supplementary affidavit and submissions within 14 days. He warned of a possible jail term for vice chancellor Prof John Akama if he failed to abide by the ruling. “Should you disobey the same you shall be in contempt of court and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months," Justice Nduma said. The university staff union officials said by Wednesday the university had sent home more than 80 staff. Union boss Joshua Momanyi termed the sackings arbitrary and illegal. Many of the affected staff had not been given termination notices, Nduma said. Momanyi accused the university of taking advantage of the prevailing situation to sack workers and demanded that due process be followed when laying off staff. “The university administration is not sincere. There had been no deliberations and staff were just being called to pick letters. We believe this is immoral . We believe the administration is hiding under the cover of this national crisis to commit a felony,” Momanyi said. He said already many of those affected were servicing loans and sacking would subject them to misery. Edited by Henry Makori
