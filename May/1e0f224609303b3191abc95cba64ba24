Juliana Kanyomozi recently welcomed a baby boy, Baby Taj. Many Ugandans have been speculating the baby is fathered by Ugandaâ€™s first son, Gen Muhoozi. Muhoozi is a Ugandan military officer and the son of President Yoweri Museveni. He has served as senior presidential adviser for Special Operations since 2017. But singer Juliana Kanyomozi through her social media asked fans to treat every rumour as a lie. She took a screenshot of a blog and wrote, "This is a hoax! Treat it with the contempt it deserves. Thank you." After welcoming the baby, Kanyomozi wrote, "It's a boy! Say hello to Taj 12-05-2020. We are thrilled! To God be the glory." Juliana successfully kept her pregnancy on the down-low. This is her second baby as she lost her firstborn in 2014
