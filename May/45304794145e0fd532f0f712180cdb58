Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden on Saturday voiced his support for the U.S. women’s soccer team, a day after it suffered a setback in its gender discrimination lawsuit against the United States Soccer Federation. The team’s claims for equal pay were dismissed by a court on Friday, handing a victory to U.S. Soccer. “Don’t give up this fight. This is not over yet,” Biden wrote in a tweet to the team. “Equal pay, now. Or else when I’m president, you can go elsewhere for World Cup funding,” Biden said to the federation. The former vice president is looking to unseat incumbent Republican Donald Trump in November’s U.S. presidential election. The World Cup-winning team’s long-running feud with U.S. Soccer has been a very public and bitter battle and the players had been seeking $66 million in damages under the Equal Pay Act. On Friday, Judge R. Gary Klausner of the United States District Court for the Central District of California threw out the players’ claims that they were underpaid in comparison with the men’s national team. The court allowed complaints of unfair medical, travel and training to proceed to trial, which is set for June 16.
