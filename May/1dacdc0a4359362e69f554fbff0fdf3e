Bomet residents will now be required to give their travel details to help in contact tracing in case of Covid-19 infection. The county government has unveiled special booklets in which they will record registration numbers of vehicles used, destinations, stopovers and departure points, as well as the time of departure and arrival, whether inside or outside the county. Launching the initiative at his office, Governor Hillary Barchok said his administration is committed to keeping the contagion at bay and urged residents to be on the lookout for suspected cases to avoid contracting the virus. “As a county, we are happy we are Covid-19-free but that does not mean we should rest. Let's be alert and adhere to guidelines in place,” he said. Some 450, 000 booklets will be distributed, especially to commuters. They also contain critical information such as preventative measures to enhance awareness. “As we continue fighting the pandemic, we've made another progress by unveiling these pocket booklets which make it easier for us in data analysis, and in a situation where we want to trace contacts of patients during this period,” Barchok said. The booklets will be distributed by subcounty health management teams and community health volunteers. Analysis of the data will help in providing key information that will inform more effective response measures. Meanwhile, 26 people who sneaked into the county from different regions, including Nairobi, are still in quarantine at Tenwek Hospital. (Edited by F'Orieny)
