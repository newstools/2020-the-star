The measures include social distancing, sanitising or washing hands with soap and running water, working from home and wearing masks. Kahiga urged residents to continue observing all the guidelines to ensure the county remains Covid-19 free. The governor spoke outside his offices in Nyeri town on Wednesday when he received medical supplies from the Ministry of Health to bolster the war on the coronavirus. “As a county, the donation will ensure medical practitioners who are frontline soldiers in the fight against Covid-19 are well protected,” he said. The supplies included 36 boxes of full PPE kits, 20 boxes of antiseptic soap, blankets and bedsheets to be used in hospitals. The items will be supplied to all the level IV and V hospitals in the county which are likely to deal with Covid-19 cases. “We want to appreciate the Ministry of Health through CS Mutahi Kagwe for this timely contribution towards the fight against Covid-19,” Kahiga said. He said the county will in the next two weeks roll out a feeding programme for the vulnerable. The governor estimated that about 200,000 people in the county could be facing starvation.  Edited by A.N
