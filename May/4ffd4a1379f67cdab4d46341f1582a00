Former Starehe MP Bishop Margaret Wanjiru is recovering well after being admitted for testing positive for Covid-19. Sources have told the Star that doctors say she is responding well to treatment and she may be discharged in the coming days. Last week, Wanjiru was admitted after being diagnosed with Covid-19. The former MP and founder of the Jesus Is Alive Ministries had reportedly hosted 18 people at her house before she fell ill. The government, in its directives, has forbidden the gathering of more than 15 people in a bid to contain the spread of the coronavirus. It is not clear why the gathering happened but the Star confirmed that eight of those 18 people also tested positive. The first case of the coronavirus that has infected over five million globally was confirmed on March 13 in Kenya. Kenya on Wednesday recorded 123 new cases of Covid-19, raising the country's total number to 1,471. This is the largest number recorded since the first case on March 13. The new cases were out of the 3,077 samples that were tested in the last 24 hours. This is also the largest number of tests that have been done so far.
