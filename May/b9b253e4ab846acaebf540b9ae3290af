More than 20 families in Limuru were on Monday forced to move out of their rented houses after water from Manguo Swamp flooded the area. The Kiambu government was on Monday forced to open one end of the swamp to prevent water from flooding the Nakuru-Nairobi highway. The swamp's exit was closed 30 years ago and people bought land in the area. When the swamp was unblocked, water from the 20-acre area started flowing towards Limuru town, destroying houses built along its path. Most of those affected were tenants of building owner Peter Mulemwa. Mulemwa said he bought the land in 2000 and the former Limuru Municipal Council approved his two-storey building in 2001. “I built in 2002 and started getting tenants. I spent more than Sh7 million to build it and now its value is about Sh15 million,” he said. Mulemwa said the government did not give tenants enough time to vacate. He said firefighters asked them to vacate last Friday. “They came again on Monday morning to remind us. Later in the afternoon, we saw a tractor at the swamp unblocking the water which flooded our place,” he said. Limuru Central MCA Joseph Kahenya said the county has been talking about the flooded swamp for a long time and decided to reclaim riparian areas. He said the area where the water is flowing used to be a water path many years before it was blocked. Kahenya said heavy rain has forced the government to open all riparian areas and waterways to drain off excess water wreaking havoc across the country. “This means if someone knows they bought land, build a house or have been occupying a water path, just know the government is coming to reclaim the land,” the MCA said.
