A total of 237 people have been killed by floods, Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa said in Naivasha on Wednesday. The death toll stood at 194 last week. Some 33 counties have been affected by the floods even as authorities say the ongoing heavy rains will continue into next month. Those living near water bodies and in lowland areas have been urged to move to higher grounds. Eugene said the rains will continue int June and said there was an urgent need to avert further loss of lives and property. He was speaking at Kihoto estate in Naivasha. More than 2,000 people have been displaced by floods in the area. Eugene was with his environment counterpart Keriako Tobiko. He said all water bodies including lakes and rivers had risen to their highest levels leading to the current flooding crisis. “As of today, 33 counties have been affected by the rains while a total of 237 people have died,” Eugene said. He identified lakes Victoria and Naivasha as some which had risen to the highest levels, flooding homes of thousands of families. “We have issued a warning to all people living on the banks of any river or shores of lakes to move to higher grounds with immediate effect,” Eugene said. Wamalwa said the national government was working closely with county governments to assist those affected by the floods across the 33 counties. “The country is already suffering from Covid-19 pandemic, locust invasion and now floods and we are asking donors to come to the rescue of the affected families,” he said. Most of those displaced in Kihoto estate in Naivasha are workers of flower farm who had been laid off due to Covid-19. Tobiko attributed some of the current challenges to the destruction of the environment by "people keen to grab forests and riparian land." He said tens of structures on riparian land had been submerged. “Nature is unforgiving and the current flooding around the lake is due to the encroachment of riparian land by some individuals and farmers,” Tobiko said.
