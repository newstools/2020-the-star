The government has announced measures it will undertake to compensate for the number of school learning days lost to the Covid-19 outbreak. Second term half term will be shortened by four days while the August holiday will be shortened by two weeks to enable learners to capture what they missed. The normal school day will also have longer hours. These are some of the measures the government plans to introduce when schools open next month. The measures are contained in CS George Magoha's response to the National Assembly's Education Committee chaired by Julius Melly. The committee had invited Magoha to explain among others measures put in place to ensure completion of school syllabus within the scheduled time. Magoha has in recent weeks urged parents to keep calm and avoid listening to fearmongers spreading rumours that the national exams will be postponed. President Uhuru Kenyatta ordered learning suspended progressively from March 15 to stem the spread of the coronavirus in learning institutions, from primary schools through universities. There has been uncertainty surrounding the reopening of learning institutions. Magoha on April 26 said the earliest schools can reopen is in June. The CS said there will be many interventions depending on how Kenya will be able to control the disease. He said every child will be given time to cover the lost time before an exam is administered.
