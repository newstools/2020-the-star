Health CS Mutahi Kagwe has expressed disappointment at Kenyans who take to Twitter to make fun of the Covid-19 figures read out during daily briefings. "When we read these figures, some people on Twitter make a lot funny jokes," he said. Speaking during his daily brief on Thursday, Kagwe said the coronavirus is not something to be taken lightly. "The reason we do this is to let the people in the mentioned areas know that there are infections/ cases around them so that they can guard themselves," he said. "...This is so that they are aware..when you are told that there are 13 cases in Kibera, you cannot behave the same as other counties that have no infections." Kagwe said the government is reviewing the situation to see how it can ease restrictions. " ...and at a time when we feel that the cases we are getting will allow us to change the protocol ...then it will be as such…” Kagwe said. He said that the pandemic war cannot be fought by the government alone. "This war can only be won by individuals in their offices, homes, market places who take measures to protect themselves," he said. Kenya's Covid-19 cases have risen to 1,109, with 80 new cases recorded. This is from a sample size of 3,102 tested in the last 24 hours. This is the largest sample size. Kenya has increased its testing capacity by 40 per cent in the last two weeks. Of the new cases, 41 are from Nairobi, while 20 are from Mombasa. A total of 13 new cases are from Kibera. A six-month-old baby is among those infected. Kagwe said mothers must take extra precaution. "Parents should not encourage visitors. Let them visit when the baby is grown," he said.
