The government has started mass testing of long-distance truck drivers at the Taveta-Holili One-Stop Border Post to combat the spread of the coronavirus. Taita Taveta Health executive John Mwakima said the testing is crucial to protecting residents on the border town of Taveta. Hundreds of trucks stop in the town in transit to Tanzania. Many truck drivers were using the entry point to avoid a long wait for testing at the Namanga border point. The drivers are regarded as a high-risk group for Covid-19. “In order to protect our citizens, truck drivers will not be allowed into the country until their coronavirus results are known,” Mwakima said. He said 21 samples of truck drivers at the border were collected on Tuesday and taken for testing at the Kenya Medical Research Institute lab in Kilifi county. Mwakima discouraged hawking and carwash business along the highway due to the high risks involved. As of Tuesday, the health department had taken 101 samples to the national Covid-19 testing laboratories. Of these, 71 have turned negative. The other results were expected Thursday. “The county disease surveillance team has so far respondent to a total of 347 cases, out of which 298 have been put into quarantine, while 49 have been managed for other conditions,” Mwakima said. Another 204 cases have been released from quarantine after completing the 14-day quarantine period. Meanwhile, a 55-year old truck driver who was on Sunday isolated at Moi County Referral Hospital in Voi has tested negative. The driver had tested positive in Uganda and was picked up in Maungu, en route to Mombasa. Mwakima said further confirmation tests will be undertaken before the truck driver is released.
