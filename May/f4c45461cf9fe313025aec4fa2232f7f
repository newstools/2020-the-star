The body was a middle-aged man was found mauled beyond recognition by stray dogs at Action estate along the Iten-Eldoret highway on Wednesday morning. The deceased, only identified as Sila, a shoe shiner in the town, was discovered by residents of the estate who were heading to town for work. There was traffic snarl-up in the morning along Eldoret-Iten road for two hours as members of the public and boda boda riders milled around the scene of the incident to have a glimpse of the badly mutilated body. Police who arrived at the scene an hour later ruled out claims that the deceased might have been killed by a criminal gang while heading to his house before being mauled by stray dogs on Tuesday night. Residents of  Action estate barricaded the road in protest, saying several people had lost their lives to stray dogs. Area Police chief Lucy Kananu said they had launched investigations into the matter and asked members of the public to stop speculation over the circumstances under which the deceased met his death. “The body of the deceased was discovered mauled by stray dogs beyond recognition and we have launched investigations into the incident,” Kananu said. The incident came only three days after residents Action and Block 10 estates near Eldoret Airport protested against increased numbers of stray dogs roaming in the area. They accused the department of veterinary in Uasin Gishu County of failing to heed to their calls to kill all the stray dogs. Edited by Henry Makori
