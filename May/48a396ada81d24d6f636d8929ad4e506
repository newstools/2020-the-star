Interior CS Fred Matiang’i has urged police officers to remain firm in enforcing the dusk to dawn curfew. Matiang’i told multiagency officers manning roadblocks erected in Machakos and Nairobi counties not to allow unauthorised movement in and out of Nairobi Metropolitan. The CS spoke on Friday when he inspected the roadblocks erected in Machakos and Kajiado counties to enforce the cessation of movement into and out of Nairobi Metropolitan Area. He was accompanied by the Inspector General of Police Hillary Mutyambai. The road blocks visited by the duo included Koma and Athi River along Kangundo and Mombasa roads in Machakos County and those in Isinya, Kiserian and Kibiko in Kajiado County. The two were welcomed into the counties by the respective county security teams. At all the road blocks visited by the duo, the CS thanked government agencies deployed to control movement as an effort to help in the fight against the spread of Covid-19.
