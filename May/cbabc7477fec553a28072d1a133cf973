There have been three cases of pregnant women who tested positive for coronavirus in the country, Public Health acting Director-General Patrick Amoth has said. In his Q and A sessions on Wednesday, Amoth said Kenya has not lost any. But he noted that no one is immune to the virus, regardless of age and status. "We urge everyone to continue with our laid down measures: wash hands, wear a mask, sanitise, keep social and physical distance and stay at home as much as possible," he said. Research is underway to understand the impacts of Covid-19 infection on pregnant women. Data is limited but at present, there is no evidence that they are at higher risk of severe illness than the general population. According to the World Health Organisation, because of the changes in their bodies and immune systems, pregnant women can be badly affected by some respiratory infections. "It is, therefore, important that they take precautions to protect themselves against Covid-19 and report possible symptoms (including fever, cough or difficulty breathing) to their healthcare provider," WHO said. The organisation adds there is no conclusive data or evidence to show pregnant women can pass the infection to their foetus or baby during pregnancy or delivery. "To date, the virus has not been found in samples of amniotic fluid or breastmilk," wrote the health organisation. According to WHO guidelines, a safe and positive childbirth experience includes being treated with respect and dignity, having a companion of choice present during delivery and clear communication by maternity staff. There is currently no evidence of pregnant women transmitting Covid-19 to their babies while in the womb or after delivery during breastfeeding. Dr Mukaindo Mwaniki, Consultant Obstetrician and Gynecologist, Aga Khan University Hospital Nairobi, said further testing has not shown the presence of the virus in amniotic fluid or the placenta.
