A woman accused of stabbing her boyfriend to death has been remanded for 21 days. Vigilance Shighi, 29, is suspected of stabbing Edward Okello, 33, in the lower abdomen on May 9 in Nairobi. Reports indicate that Okello, an aeronautical engineer at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, was stabbed with a kitchen knife in the house he shared with the suspect. He went out of the house and called for help from neighbours, who rushed him to Mama Lucy Hospital. Okello died while undergoing treatment. The matter was reported to Buruburu police station. Police officers recovered a blood-stained knife at the scene. The two are said to have lived together for six months. In an affidavit before Makadara senior resident magistrate Lewis Gatheru, detective Veronicah Waithera said she is yet to complete investigations and needed to detain the suspect for more time. “I am yet to forward the suspect and the deceased's phones for forensic analysis. I also need more time to record statements from all possible witnesses,” she said. Waithera said a postmortem is yet to be conducted and the respondent taken for a psychiatric test. She said if the suspect is freed she might flee. When asked whether she had any objection, Shighi said she did not kill Okello. “Your honour, we had a quarrel and I only threw a cup at him. I did not stab him. I am not a murderer,” she said. Gatheru told her that she’s only being investigated and no one is accusing her of murder. “But due to the severity of the offence, I will allow the application. You will be detained at the police station for 21 days as investigations continue,” Gatheru said. The matter will be mentioned on June 2. Edited by Josephine M. Mayuya
