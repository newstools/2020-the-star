Motorists can now breath a sigh of relief after the prices of Super Petrol and Diesel decreased by Sh9.54 per litre and Sh19.19 per litre respectively in the latest review by the Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority. Kerosene has increased by Sh2.49 per litre to retail at Sh79.77 up from Sh77.28 . Motorists will now pay Sh83.33 per litre for Super Petrol down from Sh92.87. Diesel now goes for Sh78.37 down from Sh97.56. All these prices will be effected from midnight. The daily dusk to dawn curfew and barred movement into and out of four counties has lowered the demand for fuel. Motorists in Nairobi have since April 15 been paying Sh92.87 per litre of super petrol from Sh110.87 in March. Last month, the Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority (EPRA) announced significant cuts in fuel prices, attributing the drop to decreased prices of the weighted average cost of imported refined petroleum products. The price of Brent crude fell nearly 2.5 per cent to $31.82 per barrel despite news that the oil cartel and allies –under the banner Opec+ – had reached a deal that would end a price war between the two countries.
