Health CAS Rashid Aman has asked politicians to be at the forefront in fighting the coronavirus pandemic in the country. Speaking on Saturday during the updates of the virus situation, the CAS said that all Kenyans should observe the measures given if the country is to reduce spread of the virus. He said the fight needs solidarity and steadfastness in keeping the cause if the country is to win the fight against it. "It is disturbing and dishearteningÂ  to observe from time to time the casual manner in which some of us in leadership positions practice the containment measure," He said. Aman added that "As leaders, it is of crucial importance that we walk the talk. We must lead by example." The CAS further said that it will be difficult to appeal to the citizens to wear masks and observe other measures when the leaders are not doing the same. His plea comes a day after Kenyans on the social media continue to criticise some of the politicians drawn from the western region for violating the measures given to contain the virus. On Friday, Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli hosted about 40 politicians at his home in Kajiado. The public expressed their discomfort over the gradual violation of Covid-19 containment protocols by politicians and elites whereas members of the public alleged to have violated the same rules are brutalised by the police. Pictures circulating online showed the politicians who included Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa, Senate Speaker Ken Lusaka, governors and lawmakers from the region standing close together addressing the press without observing the mandatory social distance imposed by the Ministry of Health.
