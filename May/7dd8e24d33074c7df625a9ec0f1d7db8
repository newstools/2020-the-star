Meru Deputy Governor Titus Ntuchiu has announced an extension of businesses permit payments. Ntuchiu, who is also the Finance executive, said owing to the ongoing Covid-19 situation and to cushion the residents from the adverse economic effects associated with the pandemic, the county has extended the deadline with 30 days effective April 30. Throughout the extended period, the business owners will not be charged any penalties or interest. “I wish to inform our business community in the County to note that this is not a waiver for the fees since the county government does not have the legal mandate to wave fees,” Ntuchiu said. He said that in making the decision, the county notes that most businesses are still operational, such as petrol stations, garages, boutiques, supermarkets and retail traders, among others. He encouraged the business owners, especially those who are still open, to continue paying the fees albeit in installments. No coronavirus case has been reported in Meru. Edited by E.Kibii
