Beseiged Ford Kenya party leader Moses Wetang'ula has fought back against his ouster and gone on to susped Simiyu Eseli as secretary general. "Regrettably, my close friend and the person I grew up with, is suspended and will be replaced by Kiminini MP Chris Wamalwa," he said on Sunday during a press briefing, minutes after a section of the NEC met and resolved to remove him. "Wafula Wamunyinyi , a man who has walked in my shadow, has also been suspended and we have appointed Vincent Kemosi as the new secretary for Livestock." Wamunyinyi had been appointed the new party leader on an interim basis. Wetang'ula described the alleged coup in his party as unlawful and archaic. Speaking at the Ford Kenya's headquarters, off Ngong Road, the Bungoma senator announced those who participated in the alleged illegal takeover have been suspended. He said the party is intact and called on members not to panic. Wetang'ula warned Eseli, Wamunyinyi and Bungoma Governor Wycliffe Wangamati, who was also at the meeting which resolved to kick out the party leader,Â  that Ford Kenya is not a 'Bungoma affair'. "Ford Kenya is a national party," he said. Wamalwa, who accompanied Wetang'ula, said, "We have been having an SG who is moribund. We want to regain the lost glory in the roaring lion." Earlier, Wangamati said, "Ford Kenya has a very low history. As we speak, Ford Kenya has two governors and they are both in support of the changes." "There is a lot of realignment happening at the national level and as a party we want to be part of those realignments and also be in government in 2022."
