Lamu town butcheries are making huge profits than ever before following a surge in demand for meat since Ramadhan began a week ago. Many traders in Langoni, Mkomani, Gadeni, Bajuri, Wiyoni, Kashmir, Shella and other areas within the Lamu Archipelago have reported running out of meat as early as midday. The Muslim faithful buy in bulk so they can break their fast in the evenings. The long queues in front of butcheries are good news to those in the business. This is unusual. Previously, many butchers have admitted having to store up and resell their meat after several days for lack of customers. The situation has ultimately seen the price of meat skyrocket, with a kilo now going for as high as Sh600. In the evenings, many residents are still turned away as they seek more after a day’s fast. By 12pm on Friday, Hassan Barissa had already run out of his day’s stock. He said he would have to start making double or triple orders to meet the demand. "I'm already out of my supply, yet it's Friday and this is when the sales are higher. I will triple my order from Saturday. Business is good since Ramadhan started. It has never been this way,” Barissa said. Alwy Mohamed said, "Normally, one would have several kilos left by the end of the day but ever since Ramadhan started, we are running out of meat and are having to turn tens of customers away. It's really profitable right now."
