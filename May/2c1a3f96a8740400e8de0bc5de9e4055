All livestock markets along Kajiado's border with Tanzania will be closed from next week. They include the county’s largest livestock market in Bissil town, along the Kajiado-Namanga highway. Governor Joseph ole Lenku said the order will be in force for at least 15 days before a review is made. “I am under great pressure to close down those markets, but again the lives of our people are more important than having a thriving business,” Lenku said in Kitengela on Friday. The governor said his decision is informed by the situation in Tanzania, where few measures have been taken to slow the spread of Covid-19. “It is only yesterday that we received new cases of Covid-19, one of them Kenyan, who had travelled from Tanzania. We are taking this precaution to save lives,” Lenku said . One man crossed into Kenya from Loitokitok through a panya route, while another sneaked in on May 5 through Namanga. Both have tested positive for coronavirus. Lenku launched three motorised sanitisation booths in Kitengela town on Friday and distributed free face masks produced by Isinya Polytechnics. He said the county’s polytechnics will be producing 40,000 masks every week. Lenku was accompanied by Deputy Governor Martin Moshisho and other county leaders. They also toured Isinya town.
