Senate Minority Whip Mutula Kilonzo has told besieged Deputy Speaker Kithure Kindiki that his woes are political in nature and must be pursued politically. “Once trust has been lost there is nothing we can do to save the person who has lost the trust of a party. The positions we occupy require utmost loyalty. There is no middle ground,” Kilonzo said. Kilonzo spoke on Friday when he seconded the special motion for the removal of the Tharaka Nithi senator from the office of the deputy speaker. “We did not recruit you. You were elected politically. You were recruited politically and you would have pursued it politically,” Kilonzo said. The Makueni senator reminded Kindiki that he would have accepted the overtures extended to him by President Uhuru Kenyatta's allies to avert his ouster. “ The overtures extended to you should have informed your decision. Since you did not take them, the vote of confidence will be taken here and you will see for youself,” Kilonzo said. The senator told Kindiki that the position he held required a high threshold of confidence from the party in him. “Professor Kindiki and any person occupying that position must be able to show that he has the confidence of the House from both the majority and minority,” Kilonzo added.
