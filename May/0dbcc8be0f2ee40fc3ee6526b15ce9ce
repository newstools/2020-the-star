 KCB lock Oliver Mangeni has recovered from a hand injury and will be fit for the remainder of the season once the coronavirus pandemic is contained. The towering second-row forward suffered an index finger metacarpal injury during the bankers' hard-fought 22-22 Kenya cup draw against Homeboyz on February 29. It was estimated that Mangeni would miss the title run-in due to injury but with the season suspended due to the virus, it will be a big boost for the bankers — who are chasing a fourth Kenya Cup crown and Enterprise Cup title. Mangeni has played an integral in the bankers' success over the year, winning the Kenya Cup crown in 2015, 2017, 2018 and 2019. The bankers have sent individual programs to all their players to keep themselves fit in case the season resumes any time. Elsewhere, representatives of Championship and Nationwide clubs will be included in the six-man committee to look at ways of restarting the season. Director of Rugby Thomas Odundo said they wanted to make the panel all-inclusive. “We want to include all clubs. Presently, the panel consists of Kenya Cup representatives Xavier Makuba of KCB, George Mbaye of Mwamba and Kabras’ Phillip Jalango. The union is represented by directors Hillary Itela, Moses Ndale and Peris Mukoko.
