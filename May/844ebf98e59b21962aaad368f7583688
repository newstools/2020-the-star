The government plans to employ 16,000 teachers to bridge the shortage gap. Of the 16,000, 11,000 will be employed under the proposed stimulus package announced by President Uhuru Kenyatta on Saturday, while 5,000 will be employed by the Teachers Service Commission (TSC). Out of the Sh53.7 billion stimulus package, Sh6.5 billion will go to the Education Ministry. Some of the funds will be used to hire teachers and some will be used to employ ICT specialised interns to support digital learning and acquisition of 250,000 locally fabricated desks. The President further addressed parents’ concerns about the future of their children’s education, saying "the education future will be communicated later". “We know that parents and children are concerned about what the future holds, we shall communicate after extensive discussions that are ongoing with the relevant stakeholders,” he noted. “In the near future we will come up with plans to ensure children can carry on with their education." The new plan will make it the biggest number of teachers absorbed to schools in one year and will play an integral part in shrinking the teacher shortage that stands at 48,173. It will be a big win for the TSC that last week decried approval of Sh2 billion to the hire 5,000 teachers as inadequate in ending teacher shortage.
