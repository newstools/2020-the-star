A Kangundo landlady has removed doors and windows of her rental houses and evicted 10 families. The families spent the night in the cold with their children as they had nowhere to go. The landlady had issued them a 12-day notice to relocate for renovations but the tenants said they were unable to get alternative accommodation. Thomas Kikwau, a tenant, said the landlady had forcibly evicted them. “I went out and locked my house in the morning just like other days but when I came back I found the windows and doors removed,” he said. Patricia Mbatha said the landlady told them that she had sold the property and a new landlord would soon take over. They said the notice to vacate was not enough for them to find new houses. Mbatha said house hunting is difficult at the moment because of the coronavirus outbreak. “If you look for a house to rent people say you want to bring coronavirus to them,” another tenant said. Alphonce Munyao said he was shocked to find his house doorless and windowless upon arriving from work. “I'm worried about what we will do and whether we will sleep in houses like this,” he said. Kangundo subcounty police commander Benjamin Ongo'mbe said they cannot do anything since none of the tenants had reported the case. (edited by o. owino)
