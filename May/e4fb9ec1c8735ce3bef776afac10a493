Police at Industrial Area are investigating two suspects accused of defrauding a woman of Sh3.5 million. Mwangangi Mengi and Angela Mutheu Mweu will be detained at the police station for 10 days pending investigations. In an affidavit before Makadara resident magistrate Mercy Malingu, corporal Daniel Wambua said the suspects were arrested on May 7. They are accused of obtaining Sh3.5 million from Ann Mutio Mwanzia by pretending to be in a position to supply her with cereals. Wambua said he is investigating the two for conspiracy to defraud, obtaining money by false pretence, impersonation and stealing. He requested to hold the two for 10 days as he was yet to record statements from some witnesses who had travelled out of the county. “Your honour, I need time to get M-Pesa statements from Safaricom of the mobile numbers that were used to defraud members of the public and we also need to conduct an identification parade,” Wambua said. The officer said he needs to establish the owners of the identification cards found in possession of the suspects and that were used to register mobile phone numbers. He also opposed bond application by the suspects, saying they are a flight risk and might interfere with investigations. “Your honour, we also have intelligence that the suspects have been running a syndicate that defrauds innocent members of the public of their cash,” Wambua said. Malingu granted the orders and directed the matter be mentioned on May 27. Edited by Josephine M. Mayuya
