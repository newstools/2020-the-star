Bungoma deputy speaker Womusai Simiyu has been forced to withdraw his support for Governor Wycliffe Wangamati to save his job. A motion to remove Womusai was sponsored by deputy chief whip Joseph Maguda of Township ward. Forty out of the 60 MCAs had supported the impeachment motion. The move came barely two days after the MCAs replaced the majority leader, his deputy and whips, accusing them of subservience to the executive. Womusai, who has been a supporter and defender of Wangamati, on Wednesday called a Kamukunji with the MCAs and pleaded for leniency. He promised to change. Addressing a presser outside the assembly buildings after the meeting, Womusai said he had apologised to his colleagues and joined the team that intends to carry out proper oversight of the executive. “From today I want to declare that I recognise the new leadership and vow to work with his team which I have previously worked with,” Womusai said. He had initially opposed the new assembly leadership. Womusai said he had changed and will ensure that corruption in the county government is eliminated. Majority leader Joseph Nyongesa said they had decided to put the motion against Womusai aside. “The deputy speaker has apologised and vowed that he will work with the rest of the members to ensure that the governor is put in check," he said. Governor Wangamati is facing rebellion from members of the county assembly and Senator Moses Wetang'ula, who have accused his administration of corruption. Wangamati has denied the allegations, saying it is a witch-hunt. The EACC and the assembly are investigating the alleged misuse of Covid-19 funds. Wetang'ula raised an issue in the Senate concerning the purchase of 20-litre jerrycans by the county government at Sh10,000 each to fight the Covid-19 pandemic. Edited by A.N
