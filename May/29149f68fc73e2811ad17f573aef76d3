The alarming flooding and displacement of people in Nakuru county are due to rising levels of underground water, a disaster management official has said. With the high water levels in Lakes Naivasha and Nakuru, the county government is seeking expert advice on the underground water. Over 5,000 families have been displaced with fears that the number could rise in the coming weeks. County chief officer in charge of disaster management Ann Njenga said there is a lot of underground water in the county. Njenga said the water had caused a lot of damage. “We want identify the sources and routes of the underground water so that we can advise the public for their safety,” she said at Ndabibi in Naivasha where over 400 families have been displaced after Marumanet dam in Eburru forest burst its banks. “The experts are also investigating the safety of other dams in the county so that we can move people to safer grounds,” she said. Njenga identified the affected areas as Gilgil, Naivasha, Mbarut, Molo, Salgaa, Kiptagich and Elburgon. “We have issued a warning to families living around Lakes Naivasha and Nakuru to move to safer grounds due to the current flooding crisis,” she said. Farmer Ann Wanjiku said they did not salvage anything during the midnight flooding. The mother of three said all their personal effects and crops were swept away. “There was a loud bang followed by the water which was sweeping everything on its way and we thank God that no life was lost,” she said. Stephen Mungai said they had never recorded such incident in the area 60kms from Naivasha town. “The floods swept away logs from the forest which in turn destroyed houses and crops in the field, forcing tens of families to relocate,” he said. - mwaniki fm
