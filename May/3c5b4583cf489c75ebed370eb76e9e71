Posta Rangers head coach Sammy 'Pamzo' Omolo is calling on the Ministry of Sports to extend their helping hand to the club after going for three months without pay. Rangers are among the six clubs which the ministry overlooked while disbursing funds meant to cushion players and members of the technical bench as the country grapples with coronavirus pandemic. Players from 12 clubs received Sh 10,000 each much to the dismay of Pamzo, who revealed that the parastatal had not paid them since February. The league-winning tactician with Tusker in 2011 said that his players were suffering and would have been the immediate targets for the aid. "Honestly we are doing badly as a club and the government is aware that the Postal Corporation is struggling. We haven't been paid for the last three months and the Ministry should move with speed and bail our players out. The technical bench and other staff have also gone for months without pay, " he said. Apart from Rangers other clubs who did not benefit from the financial boost thanks to their financial muscle are Tusker, Wazito, Ulinzi Stars, Bandari and KCB.
