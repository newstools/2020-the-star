Residents in Milimani area in Ngong are in shock after collecting over 1,000 used condoms left over by merry-makers from Nairobi. Other left overs included empty facial masks, whiskey, and wine bottles, which the residents said polluted the environment. After the discoveries, the area residents reported the matter to the nearest police station. This led to a meeting between the area police chief Rashid Abdalla, Kenya Forest Department and Kenya Wildlife Service officers. Representatives of the residents Henry Kinuthia, told the police boss that more than 200 cars drove into the area over the weekend. He said this happens every Friday, Saturday, and Sunday in which the conveners go for picnics. “They also complained that youth from the villages around who sell sodas and sweets may be exposed to those unwanted activities,” Kinuthia said. The residents also complained of loud music played out in the middle of the night under powerful flashlights which are causing them sleepless nights. Abdalla ordered police officers, game rangers and forest guards to be deployed to ensure that merry-makers are adhering to government guidelines on the fight against COVID-19. The area police boss further ordered his officers to arrest anyone found flouting government guidelines and place them in forced quarantine.
