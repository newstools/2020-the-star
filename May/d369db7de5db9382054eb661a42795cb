Enterprise Cup champions Kabras will look to promote talent from the rugby-rich schools in Western Kenya region. Assistant coach Edwin Achayo said the move is a radical departure from their tradition of signing players from established clubs. “We have learnt our lessons and we know we have a large base of players from within this region who have just finished high school. We want to tap the talent and enable them to learn the culture of the club,” added Achayo. Among the players who have made a mark so far are Bryceson Agesa from Vihiga High,  Felix Makokha (Chavakali High School) and  Kevin Wekesa (Bungoma High). The trio completed school in 2019 and have made a mark with the sugar millers as they chase a Kenya and Enterprise Cup double for the 2019-2020 season. “Agesa, Makokha and Wekesa have had a taste of Kenya Cup action this year and have been exceptional. They are young and hungry for success,” noted Achayo. He noted that the second-tier team, which plays in the Eric Shirley Shield competition, is also full of players who have just completed their secondary education and so far, the results are impressive. “Our team is second on the log with just one defeat and judging from their performance, we have a  competitive team for the future,” observed Achayo. He said a good number of their players including Dan Angwech, Barry Robinson and Kevin Wekesa have been capped by the Kenya Under-20 team and that bodes well for the future of their careers.
