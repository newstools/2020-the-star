The courts in Embu have agreed to hear children cases daily after defilement and incest incidents increased during schools’ closure to fight the coronavirus. County director of Children’s Services Davelyne Mundi said on Wednesday defilement and incest cases have become rampant, especially in Mbeere region. He said in one month, three incest and six defilement cases have been reported. Mundi said eight of the cases were reported in Makima ward, Mbeere South subcounty. The most recent took place in Ishiara on Wednesday in Mbeere North subcounty He said owing to the apparent impunity with which offenders are committing crimes against children, his office had a meeting with judicial officers, and they agreed that all cases related to children will be heard every day to dispense with them quickly. He spoke when he joined Embu West deputy county commissioner Caroline Imaya in receiving foodstuffs and hand-washing units worth Sh600,000 donated by Home of Smiles Foundation to children's homes in Embu. The donation was led by the organisation's chairman Ireri Waithavu. Edited by A.N
