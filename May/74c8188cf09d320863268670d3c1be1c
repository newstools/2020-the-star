Six people among them two teenagers were charged in a Meru court with the murder of a man in Isiolo, three months ago. Mohadha Adu, 20, Ahmed Guhat, 27, Ibrahim Guhat, 20, and Mohammed Guhat, 22 and two 17-year olds denied the charges before Judge Alfred Mabeya. Court documents say they stabbed Adan Ismail to death on February 2 at Bisan Edade area of Garbattula at around 11.30pm. A mental assessment report by Dr Gordon Ambayo of Meru Level 5 Hospital declared the suspects fit to stand trial. State prosecutor Patrick Namiti told the court Danyere MCA Daud Adan informed the police of the matter a day after it occurred. Detectives led by Garbattula DCI boss Justus Nzelu proceeded to the scene of the crime and found the mutilated body had been moved from the original murder scene and placed near the road. The man had cuts on the back of the head, left arm and several stab wounds on the back which resulted in heavy bleeding. The detectives recovered clothes soaked in blood, a belt and a pair of open shoes believed to belong to Ismail. They did not recover the murder weapon. An autopsy conducted at Garissa Referral Hospital by Dr Julius Rogena showed the death was due to excessive bleeding from stab wounds. The suspects sought to be given copies of statements and reasonable bonds terms through their lawyer Karuti. Namiti asked the court to issue strict bond terms to the first and sixth suspects because they were a flight risk. The defence opposed the application, protesting that the DPP had not served them with the affidavit. Justice Mabeya directed Namiti to file an affidavit within seven days and give reasons for denying the suspects bond. The suspects will be detained until June 16, when a probation report will be presented in court to determine bail or bond terms. (edited by o. owino)
