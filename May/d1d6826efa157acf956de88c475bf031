Despite his team failing to win a Kenyan Premier League match for a third successive outing, Sofapaka coach John Baraza remains unperturbed. Batoto Ba Mungu were held to a 1-1 draw by  Mathare United on the back of a defeat to Gor Mahia and another stalemate against Chemelil . Baraza, however, lauded his players' fighting spirit whilst welcoming the one point Sofapaka got out of their duel with the Slum Boys. “I was expecting a total difficult match against Mathare United. They are a good side with some good players and on a good day, they can punish you if you don’t plan well,” said Baraza. He added:  “I’m glad we picked a point from the match and I can only congratulate the players because they did give their best. They pushed themselves even harder especially when we had gone down in the early opening minutes of the second half.” Baraza was impressed by the performance of some of his January signings not least Sebastine Sunday.  “I’m totally impressed with the new signings in Promise Chinonso, Sebastine Sunday and Brian Kayanja. "They showed they are in for business despite having just had one training session on the eve of the game. "They gave their best and that shows we have the right players to help us compete.  I’m happy with how they played today. They totally performed beyond our expectations being that they are new in the league. I look forward to more from them,” he said Sofapaka will host Gor again this weekend just ten days after they met in Kisumu,  where K'Ogalo emerged 2-1 victors. Baraza pointed out that the results they have obtained so far  leaves them still very much with chance of contesting for the league title. “We have so far played 19 games and we have 13 more to go. I believe if we plan well then we will collect maximum points to help us fight for league title,” Baraza concluded. Sofapaka have 27 points from 19 matches—a massive 17 points adrift of league leaders Gor
