A Budalang’i man driven out of his home by floods is living in an abandoned mortuary with his family. Paul Oduor is worried his five children might fall sick because of living in unsanitary conditions. The youngest is almost three years old. The children are scared of falling asleep at night for fear of ghosts, which neighbours say haunt the deserted building. “I had a rough time trying to convince my family members to agree to sleep inside the mortuary since they know that the mortuary is only for the dead, but they eventually agreed,” he said on Tuesday. Oduor, a resident of Mukhobola village in Bunyala Central, told the Star that his home was flooded on April 1. The family fled leaving their property behind. Oduor said he decided to shelter inside the mortuary at Mukhobola Health Centre, as it is close to his home and because he had nowhere else to go. Oduor said he had a hard time convincing his family to shelter in the morgue but they agreed when the weather grew too cold. The father of five said although he knows that it is unconventional to live in a mortuary, he has no option since humanitarian organisations are yet to reach him. Oduor said he informed area MP Raphael Wanjala who advised him to seek refuge elsewhere, but he stayed put since he has nowhere to go. Edited by Josephine M. Mayuya
