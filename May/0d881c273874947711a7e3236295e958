Brand Kenya manager Samwel Rutto is among tens of people who  have died in West Pokot flash floods. Rutto died on April 28 when the floods swept Chesogon along the West Pokot-Elgeyo Marakwet border. An unknown number of people also went missing, while hundreds were rendered homeless. A relative told the Star Rutto had taken leave from work and travelled to his upcountry home in Kamatira location, West Pokot county, before the Covid-19 partial lockdown. He was accompanied by his family on the trip back to the village before the tragedy. “The incident happened on Tuesday evening as he home. His vehicle plunged into River Kotoruk along the Makutano-Kapkoris Road. The River had swollen and weakened the bridge that gave way,” a close family member said. Rutto leaves behind his wife, Patricia Tulel-Ruto, and his three children. “It is with great sadness that we announce [to] the Board of Directors, Brand Ke fraternity and family of Mr and Mrs Wilson Ptios Kamarkor Akuto the sudden death of Samwel Rutto that occurred on 28 April 2020,” Brand Kenya said in an obituary on Saturday in a local newspaper. “Until his demise, Ptiosas was at Brand Ke, a merger of former Export Promotion Council (EPC) and former Brand Kenya Board.” Rutto was the seventh son of Akuto and Miriam Chepochepawan. He was a brother to Simon Akuto, Peninao, Samson Akuto, John Akuto, Trizao, and Zehra Akuto. He will be buried today, saturday, at his home in Kamatira. On April 18, seven people were reported missing and feared dead while another 25 were injured after floods and mudslides hit Chesogon along the West Pokot and Elgeyo Marakwet border. Robert Katina from the Red Cross said more people might have died because many were still missing in affected villages. Chesogon police post was among installations swept away by the floods.
