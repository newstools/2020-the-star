Orange Democratic Movement party has banished the allegations that it was behind the removal of Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang'ula from Ford Kenya leadership position. ODM Secretary General Edwin Sifuna said through a statement on Sunday that it is not aware of the squabbles that have been witnessed within Ford Kenya. His remarks come after ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi blamed Raila Odinga and Cotu Secretary General Francis Atwoli for being behind the changes that were witnessed on Sunday. "Mudavadi should desist from seeing the ghost of ODM everywhere. It is ODMs stated policy not to interfere in the internal workings of other political parties," Sifuna said. He added that "We do not pretend to know the issues within Ford Kenya that have occasioned the changes, but unlike Mudavadi, we will let Ford Kenya members exercise their right to choose their leadership, without us pretending to know why they did it and what informed these." Sifuna said Mudavadi should not lecture anyone on political choices. He said that Mudavadi has recently been holding meetings with politicians of different shades in the past few weeks yet no one has raised any issue regarding the same. "We have neither raised any issue about it, nor begrudged him the right to chart his political future, when not crossing the land trying to be a fence-sitting compromise candidate." The secretary general has asked Mudavadi to let Ford Kenya members and officials decide their future. Mudavadi had said that some of the key leaders in Nasa are on the move to dominate everyone politically. Ford Kenya held a special NEC meeting which Kanduyi MP Wafula Wamunyinyi being picked as party Leader on an interim basis. "Party leader Moses Wetang'ula is hereby dismissed on account of gross misconduct," the NEC resolved.
