Vihiga Governor Wilber Ottichillo has signed two health laws to improve services and boost the fight against Covid-19. The Health Improvement Facility Fund Act and Vihiga County Health Services Act will spur improvement of health facilities. Ottichillo said they will create the spirit of competition among health facilities on the quality of services offered. “The two laws will also help the county government to manage health services delivery through a legal framework making their activities to roll-out comfortably,” Ottichillo said. The governor said the laws will attract donor funding. The county boss urged MCAs to pass the Disaster Management Bill to support the Covid-19 fight. Speaker Hasna Mudeizi and Health committee members assured the governor of their support in the execution of services to the residents. “We are compelled to make sure the people of this county receive quality health services. Article 10 of the Constitution focuses on decentralisation of services to the mwananchi being a fundamental component of devolution,” the speaker said. Deputy Governor Patrick Saisi said the laws will improve service delivery.
