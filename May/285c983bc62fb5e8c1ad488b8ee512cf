Authorities in Nyamira have denied they are distributing condoms in quarantine facilities. County commissioner Amos Mariba said police will investigate reports that some of the centres have been turned into brothels. He ordered the arrest and isolation of anyone found distributing condoms in the facilities. Nyamira has 165 people in quarantine centres. "The government takes with great concern the rumours that some quarantined people are engaged in sexual affairs, as if the facilities are brothels. If it is true, we may be forced to extend their stay for more days or make it indefinite," Mariba said. Health executive Douglas Bosire said he had not received such information but his department will carry out an independent investigation. "It would be strange if we discover that some people are enjoying illegal companions at the centres. These are not brothels, they are designated health facilities," he said. The two leaders spoke after receiving protective gear from Kisii University, World Vision and Catholic Medical Mission to help in the Covid-19 fight. Mariba told civil servants who are not on duty to stay at home and stop idling in offices. He ordered security personnel to arrest idling officers and lock them up in quarantine centres. "There is no reason why you should keep going to the office yet you were asked to stay at home," Mariba said. Kisii University lecturer Jackline Nyaanga said persons with disability have been forgotten in the distribution of masks and sanitiser. The university donated more than 1,000 masks to boda boda operators and people living with disability.Â Catholic Medical Mission donated more than 45 protective gear to medics. Edited by Frank Obonyo
