Silvia Romano, the 24-year-old Italian aid worker who worked as a volunteer at Milele Africa before she was kidnapped by al Shabaab associates at Chakama area of Malindi in 2018 is a clear victim of the duplicity and injustice of the Somalia-based terror organisation. , and lately freed from the terror group in Somalia. She was freed from the terror group in Somalia and arrived home on May 10. “The exchange finally took place on May 8 in an area 30 kilometres from Mogadishu. The young woman arrived in the traditional clothes of Somali women and appeared to be in good health,” News 1 reported. If anger over foreign interventions in Somalia is supposedly what drives the existence and operations of al Shabaab militants, the abduction of Silvia was an antidote to that propaganda since neither herself nor her country, Italy, have been involved in any way to the security or political matters of Somalia. In fact, Italy's government involvement in Somalia had effectively ended in the colonial times, when there was a geopolitical entity called the 'Italian Somaliland' that later formed part of the modern-day State of Somalia. While Silvia has delightfully returned home safely, however, more needs to be done to fight al Shabaab terrorists and secure the release of others who they also undeservedly kidnapped such as the case of the two Mandera-based Cuban doctors who were abducted in April 2019.
