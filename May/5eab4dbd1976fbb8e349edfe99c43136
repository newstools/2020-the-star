Garissa Governor Ali Korane has warned residents against disregarding social distancing and wearing of face masks, the health measures meant to curb the spread of the coronavirus. The governor on Thursday said he was concerned that residents were ignoring the measures. He warned that the fact that the county had not recorded any confirmed case of Covid-19 did not mean it was safe. He said the virus is real and is already ravaging other regions, including neighbouring Wajir county. “The fact that were are yet to report a single case should not be misconstrued to mean that the disease is not within us. Until we test and confirm the same, we must adhere to the guidelines issued by the Health ministry to limit infections and the spread of the virus,” Korane said. He spoke when he unveiled new vehicles to be used by the Garissa Water and Sewerage Company. “I have personally witnessed residents in Garissa town interacting freely without face masks and ignoring social distancing. Some are still even shaking hands and hugging in public,” Korane said. The vehicles include three utility pickups, a tractor-trailer, a tipper and 30 motorcycles.  They are part of investments in the water and sanitation sector supported by the World Bank under the Water and Sanitation Development Program (WSDP) Korane said the vehicles will be used in line patrolling to fix pipes and leakages, enforcement, revenue collection and attending to water consumer complaints.
