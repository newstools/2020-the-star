Gospel singer Size 8 is celebrating seven years in salvation. The mother of two rose to fame as a secular musician, releasing hits that established her as one of the top-tier female artistes. She rebranded to Size 8 Reborn after getting saved. Speaking to Word Is, she says when she quit secular music, no one thought she could last a day in salvation. "The kind of music I was doing and the life I was living was a clear indication I could backslide in a day, but here I am, seven years strong in Christ," she said. She says the only time her faith has been deeply tested was when she had a miscarriage in 2018. Although she had been born again for quite some time, her songs conflicted with her faith. Size 8 will be discussing her salvation journey in an upcoming documentary. "Most people to date do not know the exact reason why I got saved, but I will explain that in the documentary. With it, people will be in a position to understand who Size 8 is in deep," she said. 'Mateke' was her first gospel song that attested to her agony in the secular world.
