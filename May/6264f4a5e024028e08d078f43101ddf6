Sexual and gender-based violence have increased in Isiolo county during the Covid-19 period. The increase in domestic violence has been attributed to the fact that couples are spending more time with each other at home owing to the dusk-to-dawn curfew and working from home. ActionAid Isiolo manager Teresia Anderson said because of the pandemic, several people have lost their jobs, leading to frustrations. “The government directives to curb the spread of the virus have also made people spend more time together, a fact that has contributed to a sharp increase in cases of domestic violence,” she said. Anderson was speaking at their offices in Isiolo when she handed over water storage tanks and hand-washing units to the County Covid-19 Emergency Response Committee. The items will be distributed to areas considered vulnerable due to abject poverty and scarcity of water. She said that apart from physical battering, rape and female genital mutilation are also on the rise. “I urge members of public to be on the lookout for people who perpetrate sexual and gender-based violence and report such cases to the police or send the word ‘SMS HELP’ to 21094 for action to be taken,” Anderson said. County Maendeleo ya Wanawake chairperson Asli Fayo said some women were happy to have their men back home early while others were suffering as the people who are supposed to protect them have turned into their tormentors. “I urge husbands not to misuse the opportunity accorded to them to spend more time with their spouses. They should show love to their spouses and children,” she said. Isiolo Governor Mohamed Kuti, who chairs the County Emergency Response Committee, said the team had been notified of an increase in the number of domestic violence cases.  Edited by A.N
