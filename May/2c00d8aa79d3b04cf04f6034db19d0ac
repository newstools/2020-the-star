The Turkana administration has screened more than 296,000 people for high temperatures that meet the coronavirus symptom definition. Jane Ajele, the Turkana county executive for Health said the government has set up screening and isolation centres, quarantines sites and is sensitising residents on the virus. “Truck drivers plying the Mombasa-Nairobi-Kitale to Lodwar route will not be allowed to pass at Kainuk screening centre without a Covid-19 free certificate,” she said. Ajele advised restaurant owners to ensure all of their staff have Covid-19 free certificates before resuming services. The staff are required to pay Sh1,000 for the Covid-19 test that will be conducted monthly. “We have placed screening centres along the border of Turkana and Uganda, that’s Lowa and Lokiriama in Loima subcounty. “In Turkana West, we have Nadapal that borders South Sudan and in Turkana North subcounty we will set up in Todonyang that borders Ethiopia,” she said. The county executive said an isolation centre has been set up at Kanamkemer Subcounty Hospital with 26 beds. In Turkana West where 196,000 refugees are being hosted, there exist three isolation centres: one in Kalobeyei and two in Kakuma. Ajele said the department of health has also identified the Lodwar Medical Training College and 54 secondary schools to serve as quarantine centres. “We have also equipped the ICU at Lodwar County Referral Hospital which has a bed capacity of three and its ready to be used,” she said. She urged other partners such as the UNHCR for additional three beds at the Lodwar hospital. Ajele said the Ministry of Health has trained 476 healthcare workers out 1,200. Turkana-based journalists who are also in the frontline sourcing information will also be trained in the prevention of Covid-19, she said. The county executive urged members of the public to wash their hands regularly with soap and water and maintain one-metre social distancing. (edited by o. owino)
