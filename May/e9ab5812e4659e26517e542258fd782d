Safaricom will give front line health workers a monthly bundle of 12GB data, 600 voice call minutes and 2,000 SMSs as they grapple with fighting the pandemic. The package will be given each month for three months. Safaricom said it will offer 195 terabytes of data, 10 million voice call minutes and 33 million SMSs to critical government healthcare workers for the next three months. In a statement on Monday, Safaricom said the initiative is part of their commitment to keep the country connected during this period. The giant telco said it will avail connectivity resources and airtime to the Ministry of Health, the Covid-19 Emergency Response Fund and frontline healthcare workers both at national and county levels. The package will be topped up to the individual lines of the Covid-19 frontline workers as identified by the Ministry of Health. Meanwhile, there will be 100 Mbps Internet Connectivity at Afya House for the National Command and Control Centre in the fight to safeguard health. The Covid-19 Emergency Response Fund Airtime Support will include a one-off bundle consisting of 50GB data + 3,500 voice call minutes + 10,000 SMSs to 15 members to assist in the smooth running of the fund activities. “The gallant front line healthcare workers are our first line of defence against the pandemic and their dedication to serving the country has helped slow down infections within our communities," Safaricom CEO Peter Ndegwa said. "We not only want to appreciate the great work they are doing, but also facilitate their communication as they continue discharging their duties.” Ndegwa said this commitment adds to their ongoing initiatives, currently valued at Sh6.5 billion, to support Safaricom customers. “We are cognizant of the challenge ahead of us and our purpose as an organisation is clear, to keep our customers connected and support Kenyans in whatever way we can,” Ndegwa said.
