All African Games 400m hurdles champion Vanice Nyagisera says her one-month training stint in South Africa under hurdles guru Hennie Kotze has helped her improve. “I was in South Africa for 35 days for extensive training and this was the best training stint I have had since I started running,” said the 19-year-old former student of Mogonga PAG High School in Kisii County. She added: “One of the skills a learnt is attacking hurdles which, initially was my biggest weakness. I’m now excellent in that area and I’m looking forward to returning to the track once coronavirus is contained.” Speaking from her General Service Unit (GSU) headquarters training camp in Nairobi, she hailed coach Kotze who also handled the 2015 world champion, the late Nicholas Bett. “Hurdles is a very technical race and coach Kotze really helped me improve and correct my mistakes during my training stint in South Africa. Even my speed has improved tremendously and I can’t wait to compete again,” she said. Nyagisera pulled an upset during the All African Games in Rabat, Morocco when she clinched a rare gold in her speciality in August last year. She beat favourite Lamia Lhabz of Morocco to clinch gold at Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium. She, however, admitted that COVID_19 has drastically affected her plans and training. “I was at my peak because I had raced in Europe and South Africa before coronavirus. I was also ready for the World Under 20 championships in July. However, this has not made me lose focus and will continue training,” she asserted. Shew said she is still keen on the World Under-20 Championship that was postponed indefinitely by World Athletics and Kenya government. She trains daily at Ruaraka where she focuses on long runs, lifting weights and hill work. “Since we don’t have facilities here, I’m just keeping fit as we monitor the situation,” added Nyagisera who hails from Nyagisai in Kisii County.
