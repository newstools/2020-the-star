It took the health surveillance team three days to track a Busia truck driver who tested positive for the coronavirus. The truck driver’s samples were taken for testing in Uganda on April 21 but he was allowed to continue with the journey into Uganda as his samples were still under examination. By April 23, when the results turned positive, the 52-year-old man had already crossed the border into Kenya where he travelled to Mombasa. A statement issued by Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong on Thursday indicated that the man travelled again from Mombasa to Busia before the Covid-19 surveillance team traced him to his home in Mundika, Matayos, on April 25. The cargo transporter was picked together with his wife and their four-month-old baby for further testing. Ojaamong said the wife and the baby tested negative for the coronavirus. There was another case in Busia of a truck driver who comes from Mwingi in Kitui county. “The other victim from Mwingi was tested in Uganda on April 30, 2020, and traced to the Malaba border post where he turned positive on May 4, 2020,” he said. Both cases were asymptomatic. Ojaamong also urged medical practitioners to embrace dialogue in addressing pertinent issues. “This is an emergency and we should be able to engage in constructive dialogue,” he said. “Confirmation of two cases is a wake-up call to residents to observe guidelines issued by the Ministry of Health to prevent the spread of the disease.” Edited by A.N
