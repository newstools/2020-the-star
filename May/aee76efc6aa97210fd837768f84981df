Harmonize has been commended by his fans for putting aside his beef with Diamond Platnumz on social media over the weekend. The singer went live on Instagram in what he called ‘Konde Gang Live Club.’ He acted like a DJ and asked fans to send in their song requests. Well, it seems many wanted to challenge him as they asked him to play Diamond Platnumz’s song, which he did. Harmonize was seen dancing to the popular ‘Jeje’ hit by his mentor and ex-boss. Konde Boy has always made it clear he and Diamond are not friends. Their beef started when he exited Diamond’s WCB record label. He was asked to pay millions of shillings to exit per the contract he signed back in 2015. Harmonize has since gone solo and has started his label ‘Konde Gang’, and signed one artiste.
