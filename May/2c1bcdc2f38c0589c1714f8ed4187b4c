Two former EACC employees have been charged with receiving bribes from a traffic police officer who was under investigation for alleged bribery. Richard Topila and Kipyegon Kosgei are accused of requesting and receiving Sh110,120 from the officer. In the first count, Topila, a former EACC driver, allegedly requested Sh110,000 from George Manyala. Manyala is a traffic police officer. Topila said he would assist in the termination of bribery investigations that were being undertaken by the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission against Manyala. He also allegedly intended to assist in terminating investigations against other traffic officers attached to Kingâ€™eero police station. The offence occurred between April 12 and 17, 2018. In a second count, Topila and Kipyegon Kosgei, a former EACC investigation, have been charged with receiving Sh60,000 in a bribe from Manyala. The duo allegedly received the bribe on April 17, 2018, to assist in quashing the investigations. In another count, Topila and Kosgei are accused of receiving another Sh50,120 from Manyala on April 20, 2018. The two appeared before Milimani chief magistrate Douglas Ogoti on Thursday and denied all the charges. They were granted Sh150,000 bail each with an alternative bond of Sh300,000 each. The EACC said Topila and Kosgei were released from the commission in June 2019 after investigations established they engaged in financial irregularities. The case will be mentioned on June 4.
