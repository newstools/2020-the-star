Defilement and other forms of child abuse are on the rise in Kwale county with at least four cases reported in the last two months. Plan International said the victims are children aged two to 14 years. Programme manager Harriet Osimbo said Covid-19 has social effects that have predisposed minors to abuse and gender-based violence. She spoke on Thursday evening at Kwale hospital while donating assorted medical supplies to the county government in Matuga subcounty. Osimbo asked the national government and the community to develop strategies to protect girls during the coronavirus pandemic. “This is serious. It is a wakeup call on families and authorities to be vigilant in preventing children from sexual abuse,” Osimbo said. She said many other incidents have gone unreported while some were solved informally since they involved relatives. Osimbo said families should understand that protecting rapists and defilers was wrong and an injustice. “Regardless of who are the culprits, hiding them is against the law and those issues must be dealt in courts for justice to prevail,” she said. County nursing officer Edward Mumbo said last year over 5,000 cases of teen pregnancies were recorded in Kwale. Osimbo said by the end of the coronavirus pandemic many children would have fallen victim to sexual abuse if appropriate measures won’t be taken. Edited by Henry Makori
