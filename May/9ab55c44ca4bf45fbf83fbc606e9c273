China Road and Bridge Corporation will construct the Likoni floating bridge in Mombasa at Sh1.5 billion. A contract has been signed between CRBC and Kenya National Highways Authority according to a May 5 statement on the Chinese firm’s website. The bridge will reduce congestion at the crossing channel, allowing Likoni residents to access the Mombasa Island and vice versa. Construction has been earmarked for completion within the next six months. The project will include the construction of a 660-metre pedestrian bridge stretching from north to south of Likoni. It is funded by the government. The Likoni channel ferries an estimated 300,000 passengers and over 6,000 cars daily. However, it is always not smooth with the Kenya Ferry Services vessels which break down frequently. "This plan has taken into account such aspects as timeliness, economy, reliability and practicality.” The bridge will complement the existing ferry services to streamline passage and reduce overcrowding and long queues of up to one kilometre. A CRBC official told the Star that the bridge involves the construction of the pile foundations and a Bailey-type approach bridge with movable main steel bridge at the middle of the channel that allows ship movements. The approaches on either side of the channel are fixed steel structures anchored on pile foundations. “The Kenyan government has recently promulgated a series of pandemic prevention and control measures, such as restrictions on transport capacity and curfews resulting in surging pressure on ferry traffic,” the statement said.  A technical committee with representatives from key stakeholders has been formed for effective coordination of the project at all stages which include, design, construction and operations. "Evidence from National Surveillance Systems indicate concerns on compliance with public health guidelines at Likoni Ferry," a top ministry official said. Edited by R.Wamochie
