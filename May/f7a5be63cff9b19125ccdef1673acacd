Burundi’s First Lady Denise Nkurunziza has been admitted at the Aga Khan University Hospital, Nairobi, after she reportedly contracted the novel coronavirus. She was airlifted to Kenya’s Capital from Bujumbura on Thursday morning, flying  on an Amref plane. It remains unclear how the First Lady was flown to the country since there are strict conditions only allowing those who test negative entry. Health CAS Dr Mercy Mwangangi during the Friday Covid-19 status briefing said since the matter concerns the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a comprehensive statement will be issued from the docket.“I can confirm that Kenya has one of the best health care systems but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will issue a statement on her status and whether such privileges will be extended to other Kenyans,” she said. Kenya has so far reported 1,745 Covid-19 cases after 127 more people tested positive in the last 24 hours. Some 438 people have been discharged while four others succumbed to the disease. Some 671 cases are positive across various hospitals, while 130 are on self-isolation at home. Earlier this month, Burundi President Pierre Nkurunzinz ordered the country’s top World Health Organization (WHO) representative and three other experts coordinating the novel coronavirus response to leave the country. Through the Foreign ministry in a letter dated May 12, the President said the four officials “are declared persona non grata and as such, must leave the territory of Burundi”. Burundi is the only African country which has not suspended playing of football during the coronavirus pandemic. The country also recently held their presidential elections which saw the governing party candidate, retired General Evariste Ndayishimiye, win with 69 percent of the vote.
