More than 300 people from Ruambwa sublocation in Budalang'i constituency have received relief food from an NGO. The residents were displaced by floods last week. Speaking at St Kizito Sirimba Primary School after handing over the food on Saturday, Lucas Meso Foundation team leader Jacquelyn Amadi said they were deeply touched by the victims' agony. She encouraged those whose houses had been damaged by the raging floodwaters not to lose hope. The foundation donated maize, beans and sugar. “The foundation is aware of the challenges you have faced as a result of the floods, but I would wish to assure you that at the end of the day a solution would definitely be found,” Amadi said. She said the foundation will do everything at its disposal to provide further assistance. Bunyala North MCA Fred Musirimba thanked the foundation for the donation and urged other well-wishers to emulate it. He said the flood victims had incurred huge losses and needed support. "The flood victims camping in various camps across Budalang'i constituency have faced a lot of challenges. Their houses and farms have been completely damaged by floods, so they are in dire need of help," the MCA said. Musirimba thanked Sirimba Catholic priest Fr Chris Barasa for volunteering to host the victims at the school. Edited by Henry Makori
