Senate Majority Whip Irungu Kang'ata has moved the much-awaited motion for the removal Senate Deputy Speaker Kithure Kindiki. In moving his motion on Friday, the Murang'a senator outlined the Jubilee party's case against the Tharaka Nithi senator. According to Kang'ata, Kindiki failed to attend a Jubilee party Parliamentary group meeting and made a controversial ruling that was counterproductive to President Uhuru Kenyatta's agenda. “By not attending the State House meeting that was a Parliamentary Group meeting, the party lost confidence in the deputy speaker,” Kang'ata said while moving the motion. Kanga'ta said he has no personal issue against Kindiki, saying the Tharaka Nithi senator was his university law lecturer. “When I was asked by the party leader to withdraw confidence in Kindik, I called him and sent emissaries to him and we had an hour-long engagement with him and I told him I had nothing personal against him,” he said. Kang'ata claimed Kindiki asked him for a written document from the party. Kanga'ta said the party had no confidence in his leadership because he failed to attend the State House Parliamentary Group meeting on May 11. He also said the deputy speaker erred when he ordered that a Senate committee investigate the transfer of functions from Nairobi county to the National government. “The deputy speaker was forced to rescind his decision when the Minority Leader raised a point of order the following day. He did that knowing well that the President and the party leader is passionate about transferring functions to the national government,” Kang'ata said. The motion on which Kindiki based his ruling then was moved by former majority leader Kipchumba Murkomen (Elgeyo Marakwet).
