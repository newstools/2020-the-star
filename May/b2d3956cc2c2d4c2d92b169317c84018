Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka has said his party is ready to work with President Uhuru Kenyatta, barely a day after a Jubilee and Kanu coalition. The former Vice President said consultations are ongoing within Nasa and between Wiper and Jubilee for a pact to unite the country. Speculation a government of national unity would be formed has been rife, with observers suggesting a Cabinet reshuffle would be in the offing. On Monday, Kalonzo told Citizen TV that Wiper, ODM, ANC and Ford Kenya are considering how to approach a deal without offending the 2017 coalition agreement deposited with the Registrar of Political Parties. “As Wiper, we are also consulting with our coalition partners to see what we can do. At this time the country needs to come together regardless of political persuasion in order to jumpstart the economy,” Kalonzo said. The former VP cited the Nasa coalition agreement – which ties the opposition parties - as the only stumbling block to the crafting of the new alliance. He said that the parties are deliberating how to navigate the legal technicality before making the next step. “Wiper will be ready to enter into a cooperation agreement with both Kanu and Jubilee when the right time comes,” he said. Kalonzo said Wiper top organ held a virtual meeting where he was given the green light to enter into cooperation with any other like-minded parties to unite the country. (edited by o. owino)
