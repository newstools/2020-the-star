A church-run school in Majaoni, Kisauni constituency, has devised a new method of keeping over 400 pupils learning while at home. Good News Academy develops content that is sent home to the pupils together with food to last at least two weeks. “We do this to keep our students busy so they can stay at home and have something for their families to eat in the process,” Pastor Allan Owano said. He is the Hope Foundation of Kenya vice president, which sponsors the school. After two weeks, which the teachers deem are enough for pupils to complete a topic, a test is set and sent to them via WhatsApp. The WhatsApp numbers are of either their parents, guardians or neighbours, provided by the pupils. The pupils are given a period to send back the answers to their teachers via WhatsApp. “We ask parents to help maintain honesty because this is their child’s life. After they do the test and have written their answers on a piece of paper, they take photos of the answer sheets and send them to the teachers through WhatsApp for marking,” Owano said. Once the teachers are satisfied the topic has been understood, they work on the next topic. The food package each pupil's family is given 8kg of maize flour, 8kg of beans, 4kg of sugar, 8kg of rice, three litres of cooking oil and soap. “We estimate that the food can last a family of five at least two weeks, after which we provide another package of the same,” Owano said. He said this was in efforts to help the government fight the coronavirus pandemic. “We will be doing this until the pandemic is declared over,” said Owano. The foundation does the same for a sister school in Bomani, Kilifi county. There are about 400 students at the New Life Academy who also benefit from the programme. “Next week, we will be doing that to our students who learn at Vallery Macmilllan High School. There are about 200 of them we sponsor,” Owano said. Edited by Henry Makori
