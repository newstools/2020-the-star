Insurers have been urged to speed-up digitisation to cope with the new realities occasioned by the Coronavirus outbreak. “The pandemic has ushered in a new way of working that now requires greater use of technology in daily operations by organizations,” said ZEP-RE Chief Information Officer Alexio Manyonde. He said that in the era of working from home and social distancing, the expectations from clients has not changed, but the ability of the insurance industry to deliver on the expectations faces a challenge. Claims processing time, for instance, has been greatly affected by claims department staff being unable to share physical documents from one desk to the next as they would normally do in office operations. “Clients seek three things from their insurers – speedy settlement of claims, timely updates, and a choice on how to engage, therefore industry players need to review their work processes and adopt new technologies to be able to keep up with the fast-changing business environment,” he said. ZEP-RE has used its workflow system to automate notification as claims progress through the payment process. The technology allows the firm to give clients the confirmation they need to assure them that their claims are being handled despite being out of office. Manyonde said ZEP-RE would soon launch a claims portal that will offer alternative interaction channels within the claims process. “The portal will be integrated with our workflow systems to be able to satisfy the need for engagement as well as timely updates to our clients,” he concluded.
