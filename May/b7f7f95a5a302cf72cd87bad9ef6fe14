Paras Shah’s 1937 MG TA two-seater sports car will contest the Golden Jubilee Africa Concours d’Elegance which will be held by the Alfa Romeo Owners Club at the Nairobi Racecourse on September 27. Paras made his debut in the classiest event on the Kenya motorsport calendar last year after receiving the iconic British sports car only two days before the Concours. Despite this limitation, he finished 19th overall and fourth in the class for Pre 1940 cars which was won by the 1934 Rolls Royce of Veronica Wroe. Commenting on his prospects for this year’s Concours Paras said, “For me, last year was a frantic rush to get my classic MG to the judging line. I took note of the Judge’s score sheet and I am taking a lot of trouble to have a competitive entry by September 27th.  The car has been totally dismantled and is being painstakingly rebuilt.” The forthcoming Concours will be the 50th in the annual series organised by the Alfa Romeo Owners Club.
