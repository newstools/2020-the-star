Police sleuths have arrested a prime suspect linked with two gruesome murder at Oljororok, Nyandarua County. Dishon Muturi Nderi has been hiding from police who have been investigating the death of a mother and her child which occurred on April 22, 2020. Nderi is said to have murdered Margaret Wairimu, 30, at night by breaking into her house before hitting them repeatedly with a blunt object to their death. Initially, the police thought their death was caused by fire only to realise that it was arson when they found the door to the woman's bedroom locked. Wairimu was found the following day on the bed, with only her underpants on. She had multiple stab wounds in the head. The body of her seven-year-old son, Jeremiah Maina, was burnt beyond recognition. He was a Grade 2 pupil at Michinda Primary School, Ndaragwa. The same suspect is also linked to the death of a woman who was similarly killed in her house. He is suspected to be the man behind numerous reported cases of murder at Oljororok. The suspect has been placed in custody as pursuit of possible accomplices continues.
