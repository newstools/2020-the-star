DCI detectives have arrested a 30-year-old man who had put pepper, salt and superglue in his wife's private parts. James Kifo Muriuki is alleged to have dehumanised his wife Charity Wairimu on May 16, 2020, moments after he arrived at his home after sneaking back from Nairobi. Detectives from Special Crime Unit, DCI Tseikuru and DCI Tharaka South apprehended him on Thursday morning. The man is said to have committed the offence after luring his wife in the dead of the night to River Kathita, whereby he ordered her to strip naked before asking her to reveal all the men she had slept with while he was away. Muriuki is said to have beaten his wife for hesitating to reveal the names of the men she had slept with. He then sprayed pepper, salt and super glue on her genitalia and later used a knife to push the said contents to her lady parts. It was reported that he sealed her mouth and ears and left her for dead. The suspect is in police custody and will be arraigned once necessary police procedure is complete. It is unclear how the man was able to avoid roadblocks put in place following the cessation of movement into and out of Nairobi Metropolitan Area and get to Tharaka Nithi county.
