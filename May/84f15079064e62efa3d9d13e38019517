The shadow foreign secretary has sharply criticised the government's advice for those returning to the UK. Talking about the 14-day quarantine for people flying into the UK, Lisa Nandy called for clarity. "The big problem is actually getting that advice to people in the first place and it's been far too slow and far too confusing for most people," she said. "For weeks we've had mixed messages being briefed out of government." She said her office was in touch with about 3,000 British nationals who are still stranded abroad. And those who have returned to the UK have not been given guidance on what they should be doing when they get home, she said.
