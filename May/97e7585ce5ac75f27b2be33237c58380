The hospitality sector in the country continues to suffer from the coronavirus effects as the country continues to record more cases. The latest restaurant to bow to Covid-19 pressure is Serena Hotels.The management informed its staff that the restaurant will not reopen in June as it had said earlier. Therefore, the management said that all the staff will take unpaid leave from June 1, 2020 until further notice as they continue to monitor the situation. At the same time, the staff has been informed that they will receive an allowance of Sh10,000 for the month of June. The essential staff members of the hotel who are required to be on duty on a regular basis will be paid 30 per cent of their salary for the month of June. The staff who will be needed on a rotational basis to keep the property serviced will be paid according to the number of days that they will have worked. Also, the management said that the company will continue to provide for medical services to its staff within the existing providers. The statement comes after the Fairmont Norfolk closed its operations for the same reason. The Fairmont Norfolk management said on Thursday that it could no longer operate as normal following the virus which struck the nation on March 13, 2020. Mehdi Morad, the country general manager, announced that the company cannot sustain its business and it will terminate its employeeâ€™s contract.
