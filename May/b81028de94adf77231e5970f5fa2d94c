Gospel singer Mr Seed has released an EP titled, ‘The Sound.’ Seed, who has been consistent in releasing hits, unveiled this major project despite the Covid-19 pandemic. The project has five songs. The first single, ‘Ogopa Mungu’, is already out. “It’s been a journey into making this amazing piece for you my fans and most importantly to God. It’s a composition of all the new sound and I believe it will bless you,” he said. “To the whole team behind the success of The Sound EP, 'God Bless You'. Truly, 2020 Is the Year. Our Year.” Mr Seed has been doing music as a solo artiste for two years after he exited Bahati's EMB Records.
