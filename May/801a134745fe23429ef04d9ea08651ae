 Residents of Malaba and other satellite towns in Teso North subcounty have been urged not to discriminate against long-distance truck drivers. Teso North MP Oku Kaunya said on Tuesday the spread of Covid-19 can be controlled if residents observe safety guidelines issued by the Health ministry. “Make sure you stay away from them by keeping your distance but don’t discriminate against anyone,” he said while giving out face masks to kiosk owners and boda boda operators. Six drivers have tested positive for Covid-19 in Uganda this week, heightening concern for the safety of border residents. The six entered Uganda from Kenya through the Malaba border point. About 78 per cent of cargo destined for Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, DR Congo and South Sudan passes through Malaba. On Tuesday, Uganda reported that its Covid-19 cases had risen to 98, with the latest being a 27-year-old Kenyan truck driver who crossed the border through Busia. On Monday the landlocked country reported cases had risen to 97, five of them being Kenyan cargo transporters who crossed into Uganda through Malaba.  Malaba border residents have raised concerns over their safety. Some drivers who are unable to cross into Uganda for various reasons sleep in guesthouses at the border town. Last week, some residents said they now go daily to the Malaba Port Health Department for temperature screening.  Edited by Josephine M. Mayuya
