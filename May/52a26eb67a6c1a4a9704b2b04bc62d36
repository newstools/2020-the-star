The High Court has set free a tout convicted of violent robbery and sentenced to 30 years imprisonment. Joshua Ndung'u was acquitted for lack of evidence identifying him as the offender. Court documents say Ndung'u and accomplices violently robbed Josphat Kiara of Sh200 and a cell phone on July 28, 2010, at Kariobangi North estate in Nairobi. He denied the charges and proceeded to full trial. Kiara, a taxi driver, told the court that he was on his way to pick the vehicle he used. It was raining. At 5.50am he met three men on his way to the bus stop who attacked him. One of them stabbed him in the eye, took his phone and Sh200. Well-wishers rushed him to the hospital and later reported the robbery to the police. Kiara told the court that the man who stabbed him in the eye was Ndung'u. He said he could identify him as he was well known to him prior to the robbery. When he reported the incident to the police, Ndung'u could not be traced. Five years later, Kiara saw the accused and informed the police. Ndung'u testified that he had been a resident of Huruma since 2000 working as a tout and that he was arrested in 2015. He denied attacking and robbing the complainant. The tout said he was framed by Kiara who took over his job after his arrest but was convicted and sentenced. In his appeal to the High Court, Ndung'u faulted the trial court for improperly shifting the burden of proof to the defence. “The sentence meted by the trial court is set aside. He is acquitted of the charge. The appellant is ordered set at liberty forthwith and released from prison unless otherwise lawfully held,” Justice Luka Kimaru ruled. (edited by o. owino)
