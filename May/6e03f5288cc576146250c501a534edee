However, the number of fatalities in the country has risen to 36 after three more fatalities were recorded in Mombasa. "We will donate this to front-line workers and those who do contact tracing to appreciate them," Macharia said. He noted that they have received 6,095 respirators,500 isolation gowns, 3,000 of surgical masks, 40 thermometers and 85000 normal faces masks. Macharia said this on the occasion of the International Day of Nurses. The theme of this year is” Nursing the World to Health”. Historically, as well as today, nurses are at the forefront of fighting epidemics and pandemics - providing high quality and respectful treatment and care. They are often the first and sometimes the only health professional that people see and the quality of their initial assessment, care and treatment are vital. According to the WHO, Nurses account for more than half of all the world’s health workers, yet there is an urgent shortage of nurses worldwide with 5.9 million more nurses still needed, especially in low- and middle-income countries.
