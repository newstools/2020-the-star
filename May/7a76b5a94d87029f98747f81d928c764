Kenya has received two mobile laboratories from the German government. "Our ability to succeed in dealing with this pandemic is in us working together," EAC CS Adan Mohammed said. Speaking during a Covid-19 briefing on Wednesday, Mohammed thanked the German Embassy for their efforts. "We shall use these at our borders in Namanga, Isibania among others. This will go along way," he said. "Whether it will be drivers who will be benefiting from this or our health workers, we thank them for this." German ambassador Annett Günther said that the labs will help increase Kenya's testing capacity. "Covid-19 is a crisis that tests us on how we treat ourselves. We can only beat the pandemic when we work together," she said. "Two of these labs they will enable Kenya to detect communicable diseases." Günther said Germany supports the training of health workers which will start next week. She sad that the new corporation of ILRI will now offer 800 tests per day. "I hope that Kenya will overcome this crisis with little lives lost," she added.
