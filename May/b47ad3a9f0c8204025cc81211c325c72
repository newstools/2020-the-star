The Meru government has acquired an oxygen generator to help the fight against Covid-19. The generator yields 480 litres of oxygen in a minute, which is six times better than a 10-year-old plant at the hospital that yielded only 90 litres in a minute. It will be installed at Meru Level 5 Hospital but will also supply the gas to all level 4 hospitals across the county. Meru Governor Kiraitu Murungi and his deputy Titus Ntuchiu said the plant will support the care of critically ill patients, especially coronavirus cases that require oxygen supplementation. “It has arrived at the right time as we fight Covid-19. I thank public health officers who contribute immensely to the fight,” Kiraitu said. No Covid-19 cases have been reported so far but it doesn’t mean Meru is immune.  We must be alert tomorrow and in the days after, he said. Kiraitu said the neighbouring Isiolo county had confirmed a patient and Meru is at risk because the man had a business in the county. It is essential that people take precautionary measures and strictly follow the Ministry of Health directives, he said. “People are in shock and fear because the first reported case in Isiolo is a trader who had businesses in Meru. We must prepare to contain and curb the disease,” Kiraitu said. The governor said construction of a new ICU block is ongoing at Meru Level 5 Hospital. “We anticipate the ICU will be finalised in two weeks. I plead with Meru people to stay at home, wash hands and follow the Ministry of Health directives,” he said. The governor said the pandemic needs everyone’s efforts and adherence to guidelines.
