The Murang’a government has received donations worth Sh500,000 from the local Rotary Club to help in the fight against Covid-19. The donations included 20 handwashing units, an oximeter and a CPAP machine. Health executive Joseph Mbai said on Friday the two machines are used to support children who have respiratory problems. The machines will be installed at Murang’a Level 5 hospital. The handwashing units, Mbai said, will be distributed to areas that are yet to be covered. More than 1,000 units have already been distributed. “We have established a structure that enables us to know the areas that we are yet to cover,” Mbai said. The county last month issued about 450 units to members of the county assembly for distribution. The county government has also been fumigating markets and major shopping centres. Murang’a Rotary club president Beatrice Wanjohi said the organisation will continue to offer support including giving food to families worst-hit by the floods. Tens of families have been displaced by landslides and floods. They have been integrated with other families. Edited by A.N
