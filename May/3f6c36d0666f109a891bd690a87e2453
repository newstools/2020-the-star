Seven more Kenyans have tested positive for Covid-19 in Uganda. This is from the 3,161 samples tested on Friday. A total of 13 new positive cases were recorded. Of the 13 new cases, four are Ugandans, while two are Tanzanians. Uganda now at 114 Covid 19 cases. A trade disruption has been looming between Kenya and Uganda as Kenyan truck drivers contemplate boycotting cargo destined for the neighbouring country. This is to protest against what they term as "harassment and discrimination” by Ugandan authorities at the Malaba and Busia border points, which have been affected by massive delays in the past one month over coronavirus checks. On Tuesday, Kenya Long Distance Truck Drivers Association, Secretary-General Nicholas Mbugua called on Kenyan drivers to stop going into Uganda. According to Mbugua, Kenyans are denied access to basic needs such as food, water, and accommodation once they are in Uganda, making it difficult to smoothly transit and deliver cargo. He said Kenyan drivers are perceived to be having coronavirus even after testing negative and allowed to move. “Our drivers are being harassed so what I am saying is, stop going into Uganda. Let them come for their own cargo,” Mbugua said yesterday. “Who said Ugandans cannot have the virus? We are going to stop going into Uganda until the two governments agree on how to address these issues,” he added. There are at least 600-1000 heavy commercial trucks along the Northern Corridor which links Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, South Sudan and DR Congo to the Port of Mombasa. Logistics firm-Kobo360 yesterday confirmed clearance for its clients' consignments has dropped. “The mandatory coronavirus testing at the Kenya-Uganda border has reduced clearance for Kobo360 truck drivers of essential goods to less than 50 per cent,” Country Manager(Kenya), Dennis Koome told the Star. The Malaba border has in the past two weeks witness a stretch of 30-40 kilometers into Kenya as drivers await clearance into Uganda.
