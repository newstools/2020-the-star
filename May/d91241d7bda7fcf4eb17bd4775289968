Health CS Mutahi Kagwe has told Kenyans that life is far from getting back to normal following the high positive cases recorded in the last 24 hours. In his daily briefing on Covid-19 updates in the country on Tuesday, Kagwe said the 45 cases recorded was the highest in the country since the first case in March 11. The CS said that some people have opted to ignore the government measures set to mitigate further spread. Some Kenyans have been put on the spot for not observing social distancing while at eateries. The CS said that some people are abusing restaurants and the government will not hesitate to escalate measures in accordance with the behaviours observed. “The figures recorded demonstrate things are not getting any better, people are abusing social distancing in eateries,” Kagwe said. “Today's figures show that things are far from normal. Clearly, we are not following protocols as set out by the Health Ministry.” Eateries which will not observe the set guidelines risk being closed for good. “We will close hotels and eateries breaking rules,” Kagwe said. Kagwe has also sent a warning to people who have been frustrating government's effort to flatten the curve. He said more cases will be reported if Kenyans don't change and follow the directives given. “I want to tell those disregarding preventive measures that they are to blame for the upward numbers. Our destiny as a people is bound to the collective and individual response to the virus,” Kagwe said. Out of 45 new cases, 29 are from Nairobi, 11 from Mombasa, from from Wajir and one foreign national from Somalia. The figures from Nairobi are all from Eastleigh.
