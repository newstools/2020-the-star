Hospital administrators have challenged a decision by the SRC to omit them from the list of health workers who will benefit from the Covid-19 Emergency Fund. Last month, the President announced the Covid-19 medical emergency allowance and benefits for all frontline health workers but SRC has allegedly not included health administrators. The Kenya Association of Health Administrators has moved to court seeking to stop Treasury CS Ukur Yatani from implementing SRC’s directive until their case is heard and determined. The case has been certified as urgent by the Labour Court and the administrators have been directed to serve the petition to the respondents by May 22. Through Lawyer Danstan Omari, the administrators argue that they are a registered society under the 17 members of the Kenya Health Professional Society and they should be included in the list of health workers. They have sued the Salaries and Remuneration Commission, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Finance and Attorney General. The Kenya Health Professionals Society and Council of Governors have been listed as interested parties. “KAHA being an association of health administrators who are spread out in all hospitals under the national and county governments have been at the forefront in the fight against Covid-19, consequently necessitating the recall of their members that were on leave,” they argued. Omari says among the 17 cadres forming KHPS, SRC only considered 16 for the allowances and deliberately omitted the health administrators without offering any explanation. In an affidavit, secretary general Emily Orina says they are central to the smooth running of any hospital in Kenya as they are responsible for all support services. Edited by Henry Makori
