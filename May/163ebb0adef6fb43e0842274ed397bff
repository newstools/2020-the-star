The Nyeri administration will allow hawkers to resume trading by setting up stalls at the Dedan Kimathi Kamukunji Stadium in Nyeri town. Governor Mutahi Kahiga said the allocation of stalls for the hawkers on the playing field will start soon. Most of the hawkers previously operated in Nyeri town along the Gakere and Kamukunji roads but their businesses were stopped when Covid-19 broke out. “They were starting operations on the town’s streets from 5pm to 6pm but now they will be selling at Kamukunji from 3pm to 5pm,” Kahiga said. He said the hawkers need to go back to work and earn a living while observing social distancing. The governor said over two months have passed since the small traders were stopped from trading on the streets.  They have depleted what they had saved and most of them could be starving, he said. He said the county had raised over Sh10 million to support the vulnerable. “The Nyeri Covid-19 Fund is meant to raise funds to feed the needy families and individuals in the county and cushion them from the pandemic’s effects,” he said. He called on well-wishers to give their contributions to the fund. Kahiga urged the traders to ensure they observe the Covid-19 guidelines including wearing face masks and washing or sanitising their hands regularly. (edited by o. owino)
