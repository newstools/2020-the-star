Rumours that Khaligraph Jones had something to do with rapper Chris Kantai's death led to the mother barring him from the funeral in Ngong. In a recent interview, Khaligraph said the mother blamed him for Kantai's depression. “Even after his death, a lot of things were said, that ooh, Khaligraph you went and worked with him and when he was suffering, I just left him to suffer. They are always looking for someone to blame when there is a crisis,” he said. “Kantai’s mum was made to believe I’m the one who made Kantai go through depression and eventually passing away.” Khaligraph was accused of running away with Kantai’s style of music. “It is said I owed him money from the song we did together,” he said. Kantai collaborated with Khaligraph in ‘Ting Badi Malo’ and died in February 2019. Before his death, Kantai was battling alcoholism.
