Machakos rapper Katungwa, alias Bupe, has joined forces with Namibian singer Taz Goemi on a new hit single titled ‘Holy Ghost’. The duo comes together to celebrate and acknowledge the presence of the Holy Ghost in a believer's life that enables them to make decisions, communicate with God and simply get through the day. Bupe says Holy Ghost is centred around the empowering of the Holy Spirit. "Taz and I go way back," he said. "Working on this project with him was a seamless and very engaging experience. His ability to create music both as a producer and an artiste always fascinates me." Understanding the times we are in, Bupe curated a simple video, which is a compilation of friends, family and fans from different countries, jamming to this banger. Bupe’s other top tunes include: 'Love me like that', 'Woow' and 'No brainer'.
