Researchers at the University of Eldoret are working with herbalists to find a medicine that can treat Covid-19 and its related complications. Vice Chancellor Professor Teresia Akenga said a team of researchers is already testing herbs that could cure the virus. Akenga spoke when she donated masks and other supplies to the community around the university to support the Covid-19 fight. She was accompanied by Uasin Gishu county commissioner Abdirisack Jaldesa and several MCAs. “As a university, we are also working with the local leadership and community to also ensure we adhere to guidelines issued by the Ministry of Health,” she said. Akenga said it was the university's mandate to carry out community outreach and help vulnerable groups affected by the Covid-19 situation. “We are working on hygiene issues by supporting groups of Kenyans who have to go out to earn a living despite current restrictions,” Akenga said. The vice chancellor said they were also increasing production of soap manufactured by the university. “Our staff have also come together to contribute part of their earnings in order to support the fight against the coronavirus,” Akenga said. At the same time, the University of Eldoret is developing infrastructure to start online learning following disruption of programmes. Akenga said it had not been possible to roll out online learning because the closures of learning institutions fond them unawares. The government indefinitely shut down all learning institutions on March 15, days after the first Covid-19 patient was confirmed. The VC said if the universities are allowed to re-open in the next few months, then they will adopt a crash programme to cover for lost time. (edited by o. owino)
