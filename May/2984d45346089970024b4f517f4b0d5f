 A court has reduced from 30 to 10 years the sentence of a man convicted of assaulting his in-law with a jembe and breaking his limbs for refusing to buy him alcohol. This was after Jonnes Mlughu Mwapungu filed a successful appeal against the 30-year sentence that was imposed by a lower court in Voi. He wanted it reduced, saying it was harsh. Mwapungu was charged with causing grievous harm to Elijah Daniel Rongoma in Mwambota village, Ronge location in Taita Taveta county on March 31, 2018. He denied the charges. Rongoma testified that he had left for his neighbour’s home to get a chicken when he found people drinking bangara, a local home-made brew. He said he refused to buy the brew and was assaulted by one of the people drinking whom he identified as his in-law. He said Mwapungu attacked him with a jembe handle, inflicting serious injuries. “I had no dispute with the appellant (Mwapungu) and I do not know why I was beaten,” he said. Two other witnesses confirmed that the assault was completely unprovoked. “He was grabbed by the neck and kicked from all sides by all those present. One of them took a jembe stick and hit him and while he was shielding his head, both of his arms got fractured,” a neighbour said. The investigating officer said the assault happened at a time when there were investigations relating to the sale of illicit brew. In the process of consuming and possibly selling illicit brew, the attacker had accused Rongoma of being a police informer. After the trial court sentenced him to 30 years behind bars, Mwapungu moved to the High Court in Voi arguing that the verdict was too harsh and an excessive punishment. The judge reevaluated the case and reduced the sentence to 10 years. “In the circumstances, the sentence of 30 years is reduced to a term of 10 years,” Justice Farah Amin ruled. Edited by A.N
