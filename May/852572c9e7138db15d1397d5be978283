The ongoing rain in many parts of the country is expected to continue. The Meteorological Department has cautioned people in lowlands and mining sites that they are at risk. Kwale county meteorological director Dominic Mbindyo asked residents to be on the lookout for mudslides and overflowing rivers. He said miners should be careful since the sand is too wet and might cave in. Mbindyo spoke to the Star in a phone interview. He said the intensity of rain in Kwale might increase any time soon and quarries pose a great risk to human life. "Most stones and sand mining sites collapse during rain causing great disasters," Mbindyo said. The official said miners should avoid excavation during the rainy season. The weather expert added that the quarries should be filled up once the activities are done. "I strongly recommend that abandoned areas be reclaimed and trees planted," Mbindyo said. He said floods might hit some parts of Vanga if it rains heavily in Tanzania. Mbindyo advised residents mostly living in Matuga and Lunga Lunga to evacuate to higher land. His advice came after River Umba in Vanga burst its banks, flooding more than 350 acres. Transport was disrupted after Miembeni bridge in Shimba Hills was swept away by floods. In Diani, some houses were left submerged in the water after sewerage lines were blocked. Mbindyo urged residents to clear the drainage system to avoid further problems. County police commander Joseph Nthenge warned miners against hiring children, saying stern action will be taken against them. He said children below the age of 18 are usually employed to assemble stones and sand in mining sites. Edited by Henry Makori
