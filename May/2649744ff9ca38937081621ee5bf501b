Carrefour has launched a month-long campaign with Kenya Red Cross to assist communities in need during the coronavirus crisis. Customers are encouraged to join the cause by dropping food hampers in donation boxes located in Carrefour's seven stores. The supermarket will contribute a food hamper for every 10 donated by its customers, it said in a statement on Monday. “During this time of Covid-19, it is important to give back to those in need. Being there for the community by assisting in curbing the effects of this pandemic is an integral part of our business,” country manager Franck Moreau said. The supermarket will donate maize flour, rice, sugar, cooking oil and other food items to needy families neighbouring its stores. Distribution will be done through the Kenya Covid-19 Emergency Response Fund. "The measures instituted as part of the Covid-19 response has put a lot of households in direct strain economically, and unless the most vulnerable families are supported, we cannot defeat this pandemic," said Asha Mohammed, secretary general, Kenya Red Cross Society. Kenya Red Cross has been at the forefront in collecting and distributing food during this crisis. Carrefour is operated by Majid Al Futtaim in Kenya. Edited by Josephine M. Mayuya
