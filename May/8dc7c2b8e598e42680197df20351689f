The high court has temporarily barred the Speaker of the Senate from removing Senator Ledama Olekina from the position of Chairperson County Public Accounts and Investments Committee. Justice Weldon Korir has further certified as urgent the case filed by the senator challenging the decision to remove him from the position. Judge Korir on Monday ruled that unless he issues the orders, then the petition may be overtaken by events. The matter will be mentioned on May 14 for further direction on hearing of the application. The judge also directed Olekina's lawyers to serve the petition to the respondents.

Speaker Ken Lusaka and Minority Leader James Orengo have threatened to remove him from the position. More to follow...
