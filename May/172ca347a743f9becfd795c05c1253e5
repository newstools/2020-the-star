The Kenyan Premier League has rescheduled its governing council's meeting which was lined up for this week. The virtual meeting is set to deliberate on the next course of action following the extension of government restrictions meant to fight the spread of coronavirus. The meeting will now be held next month according to the body's Chief Executive Officer Jack Oguda. KPL's chances of fully reversing FKF's decision of terminating the competition without their consent suffered another blow after President Uhuru Kenyatta extended the restrictions which include cessation of movement in and out of Nairobi, night-time curfew and ban on public and sporting gatherings for three weeks. "The governing council was supposed to sit this week to discuss the way forward in the wake of the extension of the restrictions. They will now convene a virtual meeting next month," said Oguda The Sports Disputes Tribunal temporarily suspended FKF's verdict pending mention on Tuesday.
