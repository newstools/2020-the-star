 Multinational Procter & Gamble has donated hygiene products and personal protective equipment worth Sh6 million to the government and relief agencies in the war against the spread of the Covid-19. The items will be used by frontline healthcare workers in 42 counties. P&G’s financial manager Simon Mwangi said they are committed to touching and improving the lives of communities. "We want, through our Protect Our Heroes Mission, to help impact the quality of life of everyday heroes, especially during a global pandemic of this unprecedented nature,” Mwangi said. P&G is one of the world’s leading consumer goods companies. Globally, it supports more than 200 relief organisations financially and in kind in 30 countries. The donations were received on Friday by Health Chief Administrative Secretary Rashid Aman. “In times of crisis, we are grateful for the support from companies like P&G who bolster our efforts to keep helping the most vulnerable in our society,” Aman said. Mwangi said the company appreciated the government’s efforts and would partner with the Ministry of Health to promote hygiene among the public. "We will ensure that frontline health workers are protected, and ultimately curb the spread of Covid-19.” The PPEs were valued at Sh3 million.  - mwaniki fm
