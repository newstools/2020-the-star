Three Nairobi MCAs accused of conspiring to obtain Sh1 million bribe from a school owner have a case to answer, a court has ruled. Anti-Corruption Court senior principal magistrate Thomas Nziki ruled that the prosecution had proved a prima facie case against MCAs David Mberia (Langata), Jared Okode (Mathare) and Abraham Mwangi (Woodley). The MCAs were acquitted of six other counts of abuse of office for lack of evidence. They are represented by a team of lawyers led by Robert Asembo. The trio allegedly sought the bribe from Samuel Kiragu to rescind their report to the assembly that the private school in Eastleigh was illegal. Court documents say the offence was committed between April 8 andÂ  25, within Nairobi county. The MCAs were to allegedly influence the outcome of an inquiry carried out by the Culture and Social Services Committee. The committee had probed the ownership of the land in which Kiragu Waichahi School is constructed on. During a previous hearing of the case, the court heard from EACC investigator Martin Ongara that the MCAs were arrested after pocketing a Sh200,000 treated bribe from the school's proprietor All the accused persons are each out on cash bail of Sh500,000. The case will be mentioned on May 12 to fix the defence hearing date. (edited by o. owino)
