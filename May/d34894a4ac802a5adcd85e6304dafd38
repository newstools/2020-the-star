Kenya's Covid-19 cases are expected to peak between August and September, with about 200 cases a day, Ministry of Health DG Dr Patrick Amoth has said. Speaking during the daily virus briefing in Nairobi on Thursday, Amoth said the modeling used keeps on changing based on different variables in place. "Our health system has not been overrun and we shall continue to implement these measures, especially avoiding of gathering and keeping distance," he said. "The numbers that we have been reporting keep on increasing because we have ramped up our testing capacity… the more we test, the more we are likely to peak…" Amoth said Kenyans should not be surprised by rising numbers. '... We could be reporting between 200 and 300 cases per day in the months of August and September that are our peak...if we test 4,000 samples and get 100 positive cases, it should not surprise us...we must observe guidelines and other measures..." he said. Eighty more Kenyans have tested positive for coronavirus, bringing the total to 1,109. Health CS Mutahi Kagwe said the youngest case is a six-month-old baby. Kagwe said Nairobi and Mombasa are still leading with 41 cases and 20 cases respectively. Seven other cases are from Siaya county and the contacts were traced back to a mourner who travelled from Kibera in Nairobi. Kagwe said a Kenyan from Kibera left for a burial without the authority to travel. "There are seven new cases in Siaya and the story is a sad one because the departure point of that case is Kibera," Kagwe said on Thursday. Kagwe said the police officers thought the forged documents were genuine and gave way to the mourners to travel through roadblocks. ".. the seven mourners are all positive and were identified by contact teams in Siaya. There is a reason why we lock down places..." he said.
