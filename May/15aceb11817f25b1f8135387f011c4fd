An Embu MCA has recorded a statement with police over claims of inciting locals to demonstrate and uproot beacons on disputed land. Makima ward representative Phillip Nzangi was questioned by DCI officers for close to four hours at the detectives' Kiritiri office in Mbeere South subcounty. The MCA arrived at the offices at about 10am on Monday. He was with nominated colleague Edna Muisyo and an elder from his ward Sila Mwaniki. He was taken in for interrogation. Nzangi is accused of inciting locals on May 13 to demonstrate and uproot beacons erected by Tana and Athi Development Authority (Tarda) on land that is also claimed by residents. The Seven Folks Dam in Embu is on the land. Residents say the agency plans to evict them from the area. Nzangi denied the accusations, saying he was being falsely accused for political reasons. He said a senior politician was behind the accusations. The two MCAs said Tarda ought to have informed residents about the decision to erect beacons "because public participation is mandatory." They said the agency was hiding something and that he was being used as a sacrificial lamb. He said police even journalists who were caught up in the chaos because they did not want the pressmen to expose the truth.  Edited by P.O
