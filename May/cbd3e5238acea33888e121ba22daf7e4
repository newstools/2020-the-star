 Vihiga county officials involved in the theft of drugs from public hospitals will be dismissed, arrested and prosecuted, medical services acting chief officer Richard Voyoo has said. Voyoo on Thursday told the Star the county was losing millions of shillings in drug theft. He said there was a cartel, including security officers, that was involved in stealing drug supplies to various hospitals. â€œFor those who we shall found, we will suspend them from the service first, and then we will audit the drugs lost in that particular facility for them to pay," Voyoo said. Voyoo is the county's chief officer for Environment. He was appointed to hold the medical services post in acting capacity following the suspension of Arnold Mamadi. Mamadi was suspended over irregular appointments of health workers. Voyoo said he was ready to fight the drug cartels and promised to crush them. He said it was unfortunate that the county buys drugs to help the sick yet individuals were stealing the supplies for selfish benefits. He said brutal punishments will be meted out on the culprits. Some of the security officers are cooperating with suspects, giving us a hard time to eliminate the culprits from the system," he said. He said the pharmacies in charge of the hospitals where drugs are stolen will also be punished. "Drugs cannot just disappear in a facility without an internal helper and that is why pharmacists in those facilities will have to face the same penalty as the suspect." Governor Wilber Ottichilo previously warned that those involved in the theft of drugs will be immediately sacked. Voyoo said they have developed a digital system that is helping to monitor drugs and how they are used. "We are also auditing all our 65 health facilities and we allowed Kemsa to deliver drugs in our hospitals with invoices as evidence."  Edited by P.O
