Ugandan-born entrepreneur Zari the Boss Lady has paid tribute to her ex-husband Ivan Semwanga, who died three years ago. Ivan reportedly suffered a heart attack. He was in critical condition at Steve Biko Hospital, Pretoria, South Africa, where Zari took care of him. Zari has described Ivan as a giver. "You still the GOAT even after three years of your passing," she wrote. "The game has never been the same since you left. Decembers are no longer the same, obubalaza here in SA ain't the same, pop bottle games not the same, your giving heart was never matched. "You were the 'UN office for all'. Everyone else is just clowning or chasing clout. Your shoes are too big to fit/fill. Continue resting in peace, champ, three years already but it seems like yesterday. We love you and miss you always #TheDon." The ex-married couple had three boys together and divorced after Zari accused Ivan of domestic violence. She went on to marry Diamond Platnumz but also divorced him over cheating.
