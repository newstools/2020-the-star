Marketing firm QNET has partnered with Red Cross to donate foodstuffs to families left vulnerable by the Covid-19 crisis. The partnership is part of the company’s annual global Ramadhan charity to improve the lives of poor families. The Red Cross will distribute the food packages through QNET's independent representatives (IRs). “Through our independent representatives in Kenya, it was a humbling experience to become the bastion of hope and bring smiles to many families, especially during these difficult times when many people’s livelihoods have been affected by the Covid-19 pandemic,” QNET's sub-Saharan Africa manager Biram Fall said. Last year, the company donated foodstuffs to the Tree House Children’s Home in Nairobi’s Ruaraka area. This year, QNET made similar donations in Ghana, Ivory Coast, Mali, Cameroon, Senegal and Tanzania. QNET has been operating for over 20 years, offering products in health, wellness, lifestyle and education through an e-commerce platform. The direct selling company products are designed to help people live healthier lifestyles while improving livelihoods. “We are committed to the professional standards of the direct selling industry and are compliant with local laws and regulations in every country we operate in across the world,”  Fall said. The company supports entrepreneurship in communities it operates in by selling its products through independent representatives. It started operations in Africa in 2007 and is affiliated to the World Federation of Direct Selling Associations.
