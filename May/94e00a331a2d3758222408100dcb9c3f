Kenya Basketball Federation (KBF) assistant secretary Ambrose Kisoi has praised the move by Fiba Africa to organise online courses for coaches and referees starting today. A total of 50 names were submitted to Fiba Africa last week for the courses. The Level 1 coaching course starts today with the referees’ set for next week. The courses will be conducted by Fiba experts and will be conducted through video conference on the Zoom platform.  It will bring together participants from at least four Francophone and Anglophone federations. Kisoi said that Fiba Africa will then organise the practical part of the training in Kenya as soon as activities resume following the coronavirus break. “This new development by Fiba will help to grow the game in the country because we will now have a bigger pool of referees and coaches to handle our activities and teams in the future,” said Kisoi. He said it has been difficult for referees and coaches to travel outside the country to attend these courses due to the costs involved but now many will have a chance to be trained and certified at home. “This will help us develop our referees to international standards. The fact that they will be training at home is an added advantage since there are no costs involved,” noted Kisoi. The coaches' training will have four modules of one hour and will last one week. The referees must be between 21 and 31 years old with more than two years of activity at the national level. Fiba Africa directed that all learners be available and must have stable internet connectivity.
