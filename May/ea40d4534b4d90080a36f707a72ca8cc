From time immemorial, humans have had the need to adorn themselves. There is also the wish to personalise that adornment to give relevance to their culture, their preference and their desire to be unique. But we never would have expected that every being on this planet, countless billions, would have to give up the real estate on their face that corona took from us. Here are some snaps of how people around the world have dealt with face covers, from supermodel Iman to those making do with cabbage leaves, intricate hand-embroidered masks or others matching textiles, to those bedecked or bejewelled. These photos show we are all in this together for as long as it takes. Iman’s mask was superimposed on a recent Vogue cover, still, at 64,  the perfect image of Africa’s most famous  supermodel. She approved this image and she says, “I’ve joined @ Vogue Arabia in the fight against Covid-19 to support their #stayathome campaign, and emphasise the importance of safe habits during the pandemic #stay stronger together!”
