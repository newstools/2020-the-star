This move comes in a bid to combat Coronavirus which has brought several businesses and sectors on its knees and as part of the firm’s global survive-and-serve strategy. It aims to significantly reduce barriers to entry for SMEs who are considering multiple solutions from different global vendors. “Serving our local communities and businesses is a key focus for Zoho, and we recognize that the impact of the global Covid-19 pandemic is forcing businesses to adopt digitization much faster than they might otherwise have.” Bourne added. Zoho, through the small business emergency subscription assistance program, is also offering its existing, qualifying small business customers a three-month waiver on their subscription fees. A number of additional initiatives and resources have been launched for businesses to help them weather the Covid-19 crisis including a remote working toolkit, which is freely available to all businesses until July 1, 2020. Zoho has plans for long-term growth and expansion in Africa, having seen 35 per cent growth in the region in 2019-2020.
