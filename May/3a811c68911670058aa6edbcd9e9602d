Ghanaian star Stonebwoy has dropped his fourth studio album, 'Anloga Junction', which coincides with the official video release of lead single “Nominate”, featuring Grammy-winning icon Keri Hilson. Speaking on the collaboration, Keri said, “I love the song we’ve done. I’ve always wanted to feel like this! Working with Stone was also a nice surprise. It was random how we met. I think the best music is made like this.” Stonebwoy is the first Ghanaian artiste to have his album on the Billboard World Chart. His album, “Epistles of Mama”, debuted at #13 on the chart. He was also named the ‘Most Streamed Artiste’ in Ghana, according to the Boomplay 2019 music facts sheet for the second year in a row.
