Singer Vivian has opened up about her relationship with her baby daddy. Speaking on Adelle Onyango's podcast Legally Clueless, Vivian says she was married for two years after she got her firstborn child with a DJ. "I was in my early 20s and optimistic about life. I got a baby and lived with the guy for two years then we broke up," she said. At the same time, she was struggling to kickstart her music career. "Picking up the role of a wife and having a relationship that was immature and not knowing how to handle issues was so hard," she said. "He was a good and supportive man but because we did not have a good foundation, we ended up breaking up." The 'Chumchum' hitmaker says she had to do extra jobs to raise her daughter. "I have raised my daughter alone and I have never taker her to anyone to raise her, I have always been with her. I said no to some events just because I did not have anyone to leave her with," she said. Her first song was a hustle and it took six months to come out. "I ended up getting an opportunity to host karaoke to get extra money," she said. "When you release a song and expect money to flow, then you will fail. Making music is one part and making money from it is another thing. I had to learn to survive in this industry." Vivian is married to comedian Sam West, and together they are raising a blended family, as she came into the union with a daughter from a previous relationship, and Sam West also started the family with a son from a former relationship. Sam West is currently her manager.
