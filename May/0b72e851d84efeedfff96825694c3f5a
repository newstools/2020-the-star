Diana Marua has refuted claims she was married and had other children before she met Bahati. This after Kenyans on Twitter unleashed pictures of her, a man and children, claiming this was her family before Bahati. In her YouTube channel, she addressed this to Bahati, saying it's not the first time she has seen it for the last three years since she came to the limelight. She said before meeting Bahati, she was a model doing advertisements here and there. "So once, I did a family advertisement for Nivea and I was the mummy figure," she said. "There's a guy who was my husband and two children. That was in 2014. "It was a whole year’s project. So on Mother’s Day, it was me and the kids, and on Father’s Day, it was him and the kids."
