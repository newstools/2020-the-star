Two clinicians turned positive in Mombasa on Tuesday, Governor Hassan Joho has said. Speaking to BBC on Wednesday, Joho said this was occasioned by lack of enough PPEs. "...we have seen cases where two clinicians turned positive but now we have enough PPEs that will last us for the next 15 days..," he said. But Joho noted that the county government is organising itself to get more Personal Protective Equipment for the health workers. "... this is a lesson that we should not put all our eggs in one basket," he said. Two weeks ago, Joho said a doctor, nurses and clinicians were among those who tested positive for the coronavirus. The health workers are drawn from different health facilities within Mombasa county. Joho further noted that the county is targeting a lock down in villages that are mostly affected to contain the spread of the virus. "We don't mind redirecting county projects to assist such areas. We have enough resources to ensure our people are taken care of," he said. Joho said the county has already fed 20,000 families adding that they are ready to feed over  100,000 families. "... we have a plan to support families in case there is a lockdown. When we get to that point, we shall cross the bridge," he said. The governor noted that changing the mindset and culture of Mombasa people is the biggest issue. "They believe they cannot get coronavirus, others believe it doesn't exist. It is real," he said. "There are people who think that they cannot get this disease. This disease can reach you, they are on our doorstep." Joho called on Muslims to follow regulations during the holy month of Ramadhan. “I have no problem praying from home. We can all pray from home. Ramadhan doesn’t mean we must go to the mosques,” he said.
