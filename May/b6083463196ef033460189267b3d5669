Works on the Sh520 million Lake Naivasha waterfront project will begin in June after the ministries of Tourism and Transport agreed on the designs. The project will have a campsite, dancing fountains and an aquarium among other amenities. Transport and Infrastructure CAS Wavinya Ndeti said the project would take six months to complete. Ndeti said that the Public Works department was working with their counterparts in Tourism to implement the waterfront. “The design for the project is complete and we are working with the Ministry of Tourism in constructing the waterfront which will bring in job opportunities and visitors,” she said. Wavinya spoke to journalists in Naivasha after visiting the site of the waterfront and the Special Economic Zone in Mai Mahiu. She said that customs offices around the dry port would also be constructed starting next month. “The President is keen that the Special Economic Zone is fully operational in the coming months and works on the administrative offices have started,” she said. The CAS noted that the Covid-19 pandemic had delayed works on the two capital projects but she was confident that they would be completed on schdule. Oliver Chapa from KWS said that the waterfront would be unique and would have various features meant to attract tourists. Chapa said plans were underway to hold a public participation meeting with stakeholders so that the project could have their blessings. “These grounds have for years been used by students from KWS and their classes will have to be transferred to the main institute near Naivasha town,” he said. Antony Kimondo, a designer,  admitted that the pandemic had affected the works but was optimistic that they would recover the time lost. “We have engaged all the stakeholders involved in this project and works will begin next month and based on our projections we expect the waterfront to be ready within six months,” he said.
