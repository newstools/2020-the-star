Deputy President William Ruto has called for Kenyans to support those affected by floods and the coronavirus pandemic. Ruto said the country is facing a lot of challenges that have ravaged the lives of many Kenyans. The DP, through a post on his Twitter page, said that the affected people are in need of help of any kind from both citizens and the government. Ruto said that many people have lost their jobs, which has affected their income used to support their families. “Many who have lost work, income and livelihood are desperate and hungry. Let's us reach out with food and all kind of support individually where we are able and collectively as the government of Kenya,” Ruto said. Ruto’s call comes as floods in many parts of the country continue to cause destruction. Over 190 lives have been lost through floods and thousands of families have been displaced from their homes. Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa toured the Western region which has been greatly affected by the floods over the weekend. The CS said more than 11,000 people in Bungoma County need support after their homes and property were destroyed by floods. He said the majority of those affected have been left homeless, and their crops swept away by floods. “The government is well aware of the number of people affected by these floods and we are doing everything within our reach to help the affected families," The CS said.
