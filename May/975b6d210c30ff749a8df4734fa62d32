Algeria will extend measures aimed at restricting movement by 15 days until May 29 to cope with rising cases of infections with the novel coronavirus, Prime Minister Abdelaziz Djerrad said on Tuesday. The government last month decided to extend until May 14 restrictions on movement including a nationwide night curfew and closures of universities, schools and mosques. Public transport and air travel are still suspended. The authorities this month ordered the closure of businesses including shops for clothing, shoes and pastry just days after being reopened for not observing social distancing. “Some behaviour that may take us back are to be avoided,” Djerrad said. The North African country has reported 5,891 confirmed infections, with 507 deaths and 2,841 recoveries.
