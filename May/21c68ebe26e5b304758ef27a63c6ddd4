Kenya on Monday recorded 28 new cases of Covid-19, raising the number to 700 cases, Health CAS Rashid Aman has said. Of the new cases, 10 are from Mombasa, nine from Kajiado, seven from Nairobi and two from Wajir. The nine cases from Kajiado are all Kenyan truck drivers who were returning from Tanzania and tested at the Namanga border. A total of 841 samples were tested in the last 24 hours. The CAS announced 12 new recoveries bringing the total number of those who have recovered in the country to 251. However, Aman announced one more death in Nairobi, raising Kenya's total fatalities from the virus to 33. Aman warned the number of counties affected has kept increasing. "It is inevitable that this virus will spread across the entire country. As we move into the third month, let's be each other brother's keeper," he said. Speaking during the Covid-19 briefing on Monday, the CAS said the government's priority is to limit community spread. Aman urged Kenyans to report to nearby hospitals to make sure they are assisted before the symptoms worsen. "We want to encourage Kenyans not to fear health facilities, they are safe. Seek the care you need," he said. Tourism CS Najib Balala said the Covid-19 test of businesses will be Sh1,000. "It will be subsidised to support the economy. No charges for inspection as well as compliance permit. The charges are waived," he said.
