Over 2,000 police bosses have been trained on Covid-19 spread prevention by the National Gun Owner’s Association. NGAO's Covid-19 prevention team secretary Julius Mumo said 14 counties have been covered so far. Speaking in Mwingi Town on Saturday where over 200 police heads were trained, Mumo said 150 members were trained and deployed across the counties to carry out the exercise. The exercise is by the Ministry of Health in conjunction with NGAO. "In the full realisation that our officers are front liners, we saw it necessary to educate them on different protection measures, which include proper sanitisation and handwashing, how to wear face masks and gloves, how to decontaminate handcuffs and armoury equipment, including unit automobiles, " Mumo said. Mumo added that officers were also being trained on how to arrest lawbreakers as well as the coronavirus signs and symptoms for them to easily identify symptomatic Covid-19 persons. The ongoing exercise is structured in a way that the police bosses are supposed to then train their juniors. Mumo said they aim to cover all the 47 counties. The police were also supplied with personal protective equipment (PPE's), face mask, gloves and sanitisers. “We are also getting support from the Inspector General's office and the exercise is helpful to the officers,” Mumo said. He noted that among the challenges they are facing is lack of PPEs in the police stations. “We are reaching out to different people to donate towards supporting police officers who are in the front line, ensuring the set measures to combat spread of the virus are met," he said.
