After rejection, anxiety and disappointments, the three ousted Jubilee senators were spotted taking a rest in one of their homes. In a picture seen by the Star on Sunday, Elgeyo Marakwet senator Kipchumba Murkomen, Susan Kihika(Nakuru) and former deputy speaker Kithure Kindiki sat down in white plastic chairs with their white teeth all out. It is not clear what they were smiling about or even the agenda of the meeting but they were spotted taking tea in mugs. Murkomen and Kihika were sacked as Majority leader and Whip respectively. The changes were instigated by a Uhuru-leaning team of Senators who handed the Majority leader post to West Pokot lawmaker Samuel Poghisio. Kindiki who is an international law professor was unceremoniously removed from the senate seat after 54 out of the 67 senators voted in favour of the ouster motion. Majority Chief Whip Irungu Kang’ata, who moved the motion, cited Kindiki’s failure to attend a meeting called by the President at State House – an act he said amounted to disloyalty. In a post via Twitter, Murkomen wrote "What a week". His tweet that saw mixed reactions from Kenyans online attracted more than 700 retweets and 6.7k likes. @MrHarryG1 said "Prof. Kindiki came to the house knowing he would loose, infact I am sure they advised the nominated senators to toe the party line and save their jobs. He could have resigned but chose a public trial for the whole nation to watch idiocy." "Murkomen, nobody has fought a serving government and won before. Zoea opposition mapema Face with tears of joy," @seanclinton5 said. Others are;
