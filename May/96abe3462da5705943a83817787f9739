ODM party leader Raila Odinga has dedicated this labour day to health workers across the country as they grapple with treating patients with coronavirus. "..we celebrate you, our health workers for risking your lives to save us from COVID-19. We are alive because you are fighting for us. You have been equal to the task, proving the world wrong," he said. Via Twitter on Friday, Raila also commended everyone’s Labour including farmers, delivery guys, garbage collectors,among others. "We have reason to agree all labourers are essential and deserve dignity and respect. Happy Labour Day Kenya and Africa," he said. Nairobi governor Mike Sonko also dedicated this day to health workers. "As we mark this year's Labour Day, let's use this day to recognize our health workers and all others who are offering essential services as we continue with efforts to combat the coronavirus," he said. Today, workers would ordinarily throng Uhuru Park not only to celebrate their input into the economy but also listen to an announcement from the government with hope of an increase in minimum wages. However, this year’s celebration will be far different, there will be no gathering, no song and dance and for some workers, they are staring at job losses or salary cuts as the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic are felt. While the government has eased taxation that could have burdened the thousands of workers as a way of mitigating the effects of coronavirus which has hit the economy, it will be remembered that last year, the workers went home empty handed. Labour Cabinet Secretary Simon Chelugui early this week told the Star that his Ministry is “doing all it can to find solutions to prevent far-reaching actions being taken by employers.
