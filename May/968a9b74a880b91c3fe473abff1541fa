Youths in Mathare Life for Life foundation have partnered with Enkare Oltau volunteers to bring joy to vulnerable families in the slum. They did door-to-door food distribution last Thursday to 50 families. They also used the opportunity to educate residents on the benefits of following government directives to help control coronavirus. Speaking during the donation Life for Life foundation assistant chairperson John Okwako said, "Most residents here depend on daily wages, especially from Eastleigh, which is under lockdown. "During these tough times, we opted to feed as many families as we can from our own pockets and other well-wishers as a way of giving back to the society."
