SWVL Kenya has announced an initiative they have undertaken with  an accelerator for entrepreneurs, to provide care packs to their captains to help sustain them and their families during the COVID-19 period. Due to SWVL currently operating only on essential routes, and using their vehicles to transport doctors and hygiene products, the company saw it fit to cushion the losses that captains may make during the pandemic. About 400 captains have so far been able to collect their care packs from SOMO. “We know that during these tough times, many captains may be unable to make as much money as they normally do thus we are easing the burden,” said SWVL Kenya General Manager, Dip Patel. SWVL has also undertaken two more community initiatives, one with the National Business Compact on Coronavirus (NBCC) and the other with Safe Hands Kenya. The ride-hailing firm has provided vehicles to transport the doctors working on the Ministry of Health initiative from their homes to the call centre and back in the safest manner possible. “We decided to help transport doctors to the call centre, to ensure that they have safe means of transport, as they go about their duties,” said Patel. In a similar manner, SWVL has provided vehicles to “Safe Hands Kenya”, who are distributing hygiene and sanitary products to underprivileged communities. The vehicles will transport the staff of Safe Hands across Nairobi, where they will be distributing soaps, sanitizers and cleaning agents. Safe Hands has so far raised $1 million(Sh100million) through the international donor community and their partnership with SWVL will extend to crowdfunding to help sustain those at risk during the pandemic. SWVL continues to operate at this time but only on essential routes.
