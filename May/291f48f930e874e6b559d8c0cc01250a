Naivasha residents fear an outbreak of cholera after the flooding of latrines and boreholes in Kihoto and Manera estates. The estates border Lake Naivasha whose water level has risen sharply in the past month, flooding tens of nearby houses. The rise in the lake level has been attributed to high volumes of water from rivers draining into the water body and flash floods from Naivasha town. The rivers also carry a lot of silt which is deposited in the lake bed, raising its level. A local leader, Simon Wanyoike Wanango, said the health crisis needed to be addressed urgently. “Human waste from the latrines is flowing into the shallow wells and boreholes, leaving residents exposed to water-borne diseases,” Wanyoike said. He said there have been cholera cases in the past when it rains and called on the county government to move with haste and address the problem. “We are currently coping with Covid-19 and we fear a cholera outbreak in the coming weeks if the situation is not addressed,” he said. Chief Public Health officer Samuel King’ori said by phone that borehole water will be treated. His officers had been to the affected estates and a lasting solution will be found, he said. “We are working with our colleagues from the departments of Water and Disaster Management to assist the affected families and making sure that there is no disease outbreak,” King'ori said. Disaster Management chief officer Ann Njenga said they at the weekend ordered families living near Lakes Naivasha and Lake Nakuru to relocate to higher grounds. Njenga said experts had indicated the presence of a lot of underground water which was responsible for the damages. She identified Kihoto estate in Naivasha, Mbaruk in Gilgil and Ndabibi and Kiptagich in Kuresoi as the most affected areas. “In Kihoto and Mbaruk we have residents who border lakes Naivasha and Nakuru respectively. We have advised them to move to higher grounds,” she said. - mwaniki fm
