 The International Organization for Migration in Kenya will provide 8,000 kits for mass testing of truck drivers and frontline health workers at different border points. It is part of a consignment of 31,000 testings that has been procured by the organization for coronavirus testing in Eastern Africa. Those targeted are migrants, refugees, humanitarian and frontline health workers. “IOM Kenya is expecting 8,000 GeneXpert Covid-19 testing kits which will be used to test frontline health workers and truck drivers at points of entry,' the organisation said. Laboratory testing is being conducted in IOM and partner laboratories in the sub-Saharan region in partnership with UNICEF’s regional office in Nairobi. The GeneXpert testing kit is used to test for SARS-Cov-2, the coronavirus which causes Covid-19. Test results are expected within 30 minutes. In Kenya, it has been commonly used for testing of tuberculosis although the Ministry of Health announced that it would use it to test for Covid-19.  Edited by P.O
