Bungoma Governor Wycliffe Wangamati has warned residents against interacting with long-distance truck drivers to avoid getting infected with Covid-19. “We call upon people to avoid truck drivers like the plague because they come from Kenya Ports Authority (KPA), which is the epicentre of the pandemic in Mombasa,” he said. Bungoma has recorded its first two Covid-19 cases, both truck drivers. There has been an increase in the number of truckers testing positive for the disease. Wangamati said the build-up of trucks along the highway poses a threat to residents, especially those who run restaurants and car wash, sex workers and boda boda operators. He urged Health CS Mutahi Kagwe to categorise Bungoma as a high-risk county and warned residents against being reckless. "Out of the 112 samples taken, two returned positive and we are following up more than 10 people who were in contact with them," the governor said. Wangamati urged the national government to set up a testing centre in the county. He said the county should be classified as a hotspot because of Bukembe, Kanduyi and Kimaeti towns, where truck drivers park while on transit to Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, South Sudan and DR Congo. Wangamati said all sex workers who will be found interacting with truck drivers will be arrested. "I travelled by taxi and noticed that people are reckless and not adhering to coronavirus control measures," he said. Wangamati said the two drivers, who are at Webuye Hospital amid tight security, include a 49-year-old man who was quarantined at Webuye Kenya Medical Training Centre. The other was intercepted at Bitobo roadblock, at the border of  Bungoma and Busia counties. Wangamati said the two had interacted with more than 10 people at Webuye the KMTC.  Edited by Frank Obonyo
