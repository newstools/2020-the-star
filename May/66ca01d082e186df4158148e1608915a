Keroche heiress Tecra Muigai would have turned 30 years old yesterday. Tecra died on May 2 and was buried in a private funeral ceremony last Friday in Naivasha. Celebrating her younger sister’s birthday, Anerlisa shared photos of Tecra, reminiscing her happy moments. "Happy 30th Birthday Angel Tecra. God Must Be Happy To Have You In Heaven. We Miss You So Much," she wrote. In another post, she described her as a 'powerhouse'. "This was so Tecra, she would enter a room and everyone would be quiet to listen to her. #PowerHouse #Genius. Happy Birthday," she wrote. Omar Lali, the 54-year-old boyfriend of the late Tecra  was on on May 5 presented at the Lamu law courts facing suspected murder charges. Tecra, the daughter of  Keroche Breweries CEO Tabitha Karanja, died in an accident. The court session took place via video link and was presided over by Lamu principal magistrate Allan Temba. Tecra suffered cerebral-oedema resulting from a fall from a staircase at a house she shared with Omar in Lamu on April 27. Omar was arrested by homicide detectives over suspicions that he could have been involved in her death. He is also said to have given differing accounts of Tecra’s death leading police to believe he was hiding something. When appearing on the live court session on Monday, Temba granted the police request to detain Omar for 21 days at the Lamu police station to enable them to conduct comprehensive investigations into the suspected murder of Tecra. “They are allowed to detain the suspect as long as they allow him access to legal advice from his advocates,” he said. The application to detain the suspect was made by the office of the DPP and the Investigating Officer. During the 21-day period, the DCI will record witness statements, analyse the crime scene, conduct post-mortem examination and analysis of the phones, CCTV and/or computers if any, of the deceased and the suspect.
