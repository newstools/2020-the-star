The Garissa government has started distributing food to over 6,000 vulnerable families. The food will be distributed in Garissa, Fafi, Balambala, Ijara, Hulugho, Dadaab and Lagdera subcounties. The food items include rice, corn flour, wheat flour, cooking oil, porridge flour and sugar. The first batch was distributed to over 200 households in Mzuri, Bashaal and Tawakal. The initiative is part of concerted efforts by the county government to support needy families during the holy month of Ramadhan. The county administration, through its Department of Religious Affairs, was helped by clerics to identify the neediest households in the targeted areas. Deputy Governor Abdi Dagane, while launching the Governor's Iftar initiative on Saturday in Bulla Mzuri, Garissa town, said the county was honouring a pledge made by Governor Ali Korane. "We have started with 200 families today and in the coming days, we intend to scale-up this distribution to families in Bulla Tawakal, Bulla Masalani and Bulla Bashal within Garissa Township. The same exercise will be rolled out soon in the other six subcounties,” he said. “We shall not only scale-up the exercise but may revise the figures upwards to accommodate the families whose sources of livelihoods have been affected by the Covid-19 and floods.” Dagane urged residents to embrace the spirit of sharing during Ramadhan and adhere to guidelines issued by the Ministry of Health to curb the spread of Covid-19. Garissa subcounty deputy county commissioner Samuel Njuguna said the national government has availed 4,000 bags of rice, masks and sanitiser to support the governor's Iftar initiative and those affected by the floods. He cautioned beneficiaries against gathering in their homes, especially after evening prayers. Njuguna said the national and the county government will continue collaborating to ensure residents affected by the floods and the coronavirus get the necessary assistance. Edited by A.N
