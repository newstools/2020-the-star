National Olympic Committee of Kenya (NOC-K ) will meet its affiliates in an online consultative meeting which will among other things discuss the impact of COVID-19 on sports in Kenya. The forum will also look at mitigation measures and come up with a collective guiding document for a safe return to sports, which will later be handed to the government through the Ministry of Sports. The meeting which will take place via Zoom will see all 26 Olympic federations converge with the same objective. “The objective of the meeting will be understanding of the impact of COVID-19 on sports in Kenya and consult on the approach to take on mitigation measures which will include new protocols for sports following government guidelines,” explained NOC-K Acting secretary-general, Francis Mutuku. NOCK revealed they will also consider the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and International Federations (IFs) guidelines given so far. “Cognisant that there have been efforts to mitigate the effects of coronavirus on sportspeople from different fronts, this will be a good opportunity to evaluate the actions taken so far, the challenges and way forward,” noted Mutuku. NOC-K launched an athletes’ survey in early May and has been collecting responses through national federations. The survey seeks to collect data and firsthand information from athletes on their current situation and challenges. The proposals identified from the information collected will be discussed in order to assist the national federations in developing programs that meet the specific needs of the athletes. Mutuku said the NOC-K Medical Commission will also sit in advance and guide the federations in developing the new protocols. “The medical team is critical since they understand sports as well as the health situation. They will be present in the meeting to guide the federations,” he added.
