Amani National Congress party leader Musalia Mudavadi has criticised the removal of Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang'ula as Ford Kenya leader. Through a statement hours after his removal, Mudavadi said the move is meant to invade and destabilise all the independent-minded political parties. Ford Kenya's NEC resolved to dismiss Wetang'ula as party leader on Sunday citing gross misconduct. A special NEC meeting was convened where Kanduyi MP Wafula Wamunyinyi was picked to take over as party leader on an interim basis. Mudavadi blamed Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli for being behind the changes in Ford Kenya. "The mischief has been escalated at a number of meetings led by a leader of NASA member party, whose objective is to destroy and dominate everyone politically," Mudavadi said. He added that " In this, they are headed by the Secretary General of Central Organization of Trade Unions (COTU)." He said that ANC is solidly behind him and urged Ford Kenya to diffuse the confusion by the externally sponsored mischief. "We urge Ford Kenya to be firm and quislings and in its resolve to stand with the people of Kenya." ANC leader has also asked Kenyans to refuse to succumb to political intimidation and bribery. He has added that the changes in some of the political parties in the country have managed to capture the Parliament. "The axis of evil in the country has captured Parliament and now hosts it hostage." Mudavadi further said that "They are now invading political parties. They want to kill all platforms of democracy and good governance in the country." During the Ford Kenya NEC meet, Bungoma Governor Wycliffe Wangamati said, "Ford Kenya has a very low history. As we speak, Ford Kenya has two governors and they are both in support of the changes."
