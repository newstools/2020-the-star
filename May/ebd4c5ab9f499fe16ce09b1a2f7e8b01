Residents of Kikuyu town in Kiambu county woke up to a rude shock on Sunday when they found three 14-seater matatus burnt to shells. Two of the vehicles belonged to 2NK Sacco and one to Kazana Sacco which ply the Nairobi-Kikuyu route. TheyÂ  are usually parked at Kikuyu bus park at night. 2NK matatu operator Boniface Mwai asked police to investigate the incident and establish what really happened. "We want thorough investigations to know what happened. We fear whoever did this could burn the rest of the matatus which are normally parked here," Mwai said. Local trader Bedan Kinyanjui urged police to intensity night patrols so as to prevent such incidents. Police who were at the scene said investigations had been launched and asked anyone with information to report to them. Edited by Henry Makori
