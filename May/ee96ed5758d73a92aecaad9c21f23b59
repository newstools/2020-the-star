Former American comedian and actress Gilda Radner once said, “Motherhood is the biggest gamble in the world. It is the glorious life force. It’s huge and scary—it’s an act of infinite optimism.” For 25-year-old Winfred Kilonzo, a divorcee, motherhood was different and so she gruesomely murdered her two children, infront of her own mother. The incident took place at Kayole 1, Eastlands Nairobi,  just 200 meters from Kayole police station on Saturday at 7.10pm. The two children, a girl, 7, and boy, 2, died from stab wounds on arrival at Mama Lucy Hospital. After committing the filicide, Kilonzo is now admitted at Mama Lucy Hospital in critical condition after a botched suicide mission. Police say the boy was stabbed seven times, hinting the mother might have been under intense depression and anger. Kayole subcounty police commander Wilson Kosgey told the Star that Kilonzo had just come from the market where she sold second-hand clothes and shoes, a business she started late last year. “The reports we have is that the woman looked distressed but more details will come out after investigations,” Kosgey said on Sunday. Other reports indicate the woman had picked a quarrel with her mother before the killing. When the Star visited the scene on Sunday, bloodstains could be seen at the door of their house located in a one-floor flat. Police recovered the knife used to stab the children A woman who spoke on anonymity said the suspect divorced with his husband two years ago. "As an eyewitness, her mother is being treated as a suspect as she might have ‘collaborated’ into the killings," the police boss said. Police said the suspect will be arrested and charged, if she survives. The two kids suffered stomach and spinal cord stab injuries. “She just targeted the critical areas to make sure the kids didn’t survive the onslaught,” Kosgei added.  Edited by E.Kibii
