Bars and eatery owners operating illegally in Murang’a have been put on notice by the county government. Health CEC Joseph Mbai on Friday said some bars have been operating secretly, locking customers inside to avoid being caught by authorities. Mbai said last week, 30 eatery operators approached the county government seeking letters from the Ministry of Health on the requirements for reopening. “But when we gave them the letters, most have been using them as licences to reopen their premises,” Mbai said, reiterating that the letters were only outlining the government’s guidelines including sitting arrangements and hygiene measures required. The letters clearly state that eateries should not open before all the requirements are fulfilled, he said. He noted that the county government had asked the operators to forward a list of their workers to enable it procure sufficient testing kits from the Kenya Medical Supplies Authority (Kemsa). Mbai warned that operators found contravening the government’s directives will be prosecuted and their licences will not be renewed. “We have a list of the premises and they will suffer the consequences,” he said. “We know the business community is suffering but we are asking them to be a little bit patient and follow the right process,” he said, adding that the county government is also in the process of establishing who will foot the costs of the tests. The county government revoked bars' licences in March to deter owners from operating. Governor Mwangi wa Iria has said that the owners of the bars that flout the rules will be quarantined together with  their customers at their own cost. He also sounded a warning to motorists who park their vehicles outside bars and order drinks.
