A lawmaker wants more funds allocated to support the less-fortunate families during this Covid-19 crisis. Baringo Central MP Joshua Kandie said despite people being told to stay at home to avoid contracting the virus, most of them live hand-to-mouth, hence must be supported to weather the crisis. "Most of the people in Kenya are now jobless and having nothing to do. They are staying idle in their homes, so there is a need for a constant provision of food and non-food items to them," Kandie said. He spoke on Friday after donating Rice, cooking oil, bar soap, maize and wheat flour to 50 Muslim families in Kabarnet town. "This is just but a small gesture as I stand with you this Ramadan season," the MP said. Kandie praised the efforts against the virus but added that more is needed to support vulnerable citizens.Â He appealed to the national and county governments to allocate more funds to purchase and distribute food, soap and masks to poor families across the country. He said despite numerous donations received so far, more humanitarian aid is needed to cater for the hungry, the physically challenged and insecurity and flood victims. Last month, the Baringo county assembly passed a budget of Sh200,000 towards supporting the same cause.  (Edited by F'Orieny)
