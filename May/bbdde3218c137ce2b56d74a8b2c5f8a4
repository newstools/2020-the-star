Small business will have Sh200 billion to dip into for their revival post-Covid-19 through a deal between Equity Bank and the chamber of commerce. Equity CEO James Mwangi and Richard Ngatia, President of Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry signed the deal after online deliberations by their top organs. The kitty will provide a lifeline to macro, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) on their path to recovery. However, membership to the chamber's chapters across the 47 counties is mandatory for the traders to benefit from the kitty. “The bank committed 200 billion to support chamber finance business activities, train and build the capacity of 3 million members across the country, work county chapter leadership to enable credit facilities, appraisals, support regional businesses, promote and protect jobs and enterprises,” Ngatia said. The deal will enhance continuity amid mass closures of business due to the aftershocks of the pandemic. Ngatia said that the pact will promote the national economy and transform value chains for small businesses. Last month, President Uhuru Kenyatta reduced the turnover tax rate from three per cent to one per cent for all micro, small and medium enterprises. The move was an incentive to stimulate businesses and also cushion vulnerable Kenyans from the ongoing economic downturn. (edited by o. owino)
