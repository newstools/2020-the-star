 Even after the Ministry of Health allowed hotels to resume operations under strict Covid-19 rules, none has reopened in Kwale. Tourism CEC Nasib Nyahi said some of the rules outlined by the ministry to curb the spread of the disease are very costly. “There are so many processes the restaurants must undertake before being allowed to operate, whose expenses are very high and so I think some hotels have opted to wait until normalcy resumes,” he said. Hotel owners must test their employees for the virus, apply for a health approval licence, work within set hours and serve a controlled number of customers at a time while observing the social distancing. Nyahi said in a phone interview on Sunday that the majority of the hotels and restaurants in Kwale depend on the tourism industry which has been overwhelmed by the virus. The communities living around suffer from high poverty levels and cannot support local tourism following the partial lockdown, curfew and stringent public health measures, he said. The CEC said, there are electricity and water bills the hotels must pay, the cost of testing each worker which ranges between Sh2,000 and Sh4,000, buying supplies and sanitiser. He said many hotels had closed after failing to pay their workers and owners can’t risk accumulating more debts. Edited by Henry Makori
