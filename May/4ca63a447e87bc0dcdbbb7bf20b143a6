Politician Martha Karua says she enjoyed watching the banned lesbian love film 'Rafiki'. This is after a link was shared on Twitter by US-based lawyer Prof Makau Mutua, who was against the ban. In what that was deemed as promoting lesbianism, Makau asked his followers to watch the film, even providing a link where one can watch it for free. Karua got the opportunity to watch it, and she gave it a rave review. "Thanks for sharing, Prof. Enjoyed watching this well-acted production by Wanuri," she wrote on Twitter. Last week, the High Court upheld the ban on the movie, saying it does not in any way violate artistic freedom of expression but instead protects the society from moral decay. Martha Karua says the double standards on what is appropriate or acceptable for viewing is our undoing. A section of followers disagreed with Karua. One follower said, "On this Mama, let us agree to disagree. Let male human beings remain male as female ones remain female. Some behaviours have been assigned to males; others to female. Let it remain so." Kerr Owino said the movie was made with wazungu money for wazungu audience. "Let's refrain from aping the west as though it's a sign of sophistication and intelligence. This is what plebeians, not patricians, glorify in the West. There are many Kenyan filmmakers making movies relevant to us." Martha Karua hit back, saying the movie does not in any way ask anyone to behave in a particular way."Just like when you watch the violent movies on our screens daily, there is no requirement that you become a batterer or murderer," she said. After the High Court upheld the ban of the film, Wanuri, the writer/director and co-producer of 'Rafiki' said she will continue to fight against laws that have no place in our democratic Kenyan society.
