Tanzanian prolific music duo Navy Kenzo is gearing up to for a new LP project, their second studio album in three years. Speaking about the release, Navy Kenzo said they have been working a lot lately, spending a lot of countless hours in the studio. "The songs we had done were initially intended for an EP project but there is just so much good music, it became hard to finalise the EP and we decided to just roll out the content with a full album,‚Äù they said. It is uncertain yet how many songs this new album contains or what it will be named, but sources say the content is "fresh and amazing". "They are constantly raising the bar and redefining the standard of good music," a source said. "This new project is on a different element. The sound, production, the vibe. They have outdone themselves."
