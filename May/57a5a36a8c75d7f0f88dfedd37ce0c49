Politicians in Vihiga have taken advantage of the Covid-19 pandemic to rally support for 2022 elections, a Jubilee official has said. Organising secretary Eegan Otiato accused Luanda MCA Tom Atingo of inciting traders to ignore Covid-19 health measures. Efforts by the Star to reach Atingo for a comment failed as he did not take phone calls or respond to text messages sent to him. “We should not focus on the 2022 General Election when we can't sustain the lives of these voters who are to vote when that time comes,” Otiato said. He said most people were struggling with life following the Covid-19 pandemic and urged Vihiga professionals to help the poor. The Jubilee politician said it was difficult for people to stay at home as directed by the government when their needs were not met. "We can't keep our people at home without proper plans on how they will get basic needs. We need to get them food, if not then hunger will kill these people before the disease does," Otiato said. Otiato said leaders who branding Covid-19 donations with their names for political gain should be rejected by voters come 2022. “Voters are not fools; they are watching what you politicians are doing at the moment," he said. Former Air Force officer Gaulkey Kweya who is currently head of operations in a Luanda security firm said the county had handled the Covid-19 pandemic poorly. He said politicians were engaged in premature politics that will cost them heavily come 2022. Edited by Henry Makori
