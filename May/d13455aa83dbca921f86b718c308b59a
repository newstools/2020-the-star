 More than 300 Diani beach operators have turned to farming and fishing as tourism earnings take a hit from the Covid-19 crisis. Beach operators' chairman Ali Nyoka said their problems began with the cancellation of international flights. “Our work started to deteriorate because the number of local and foreign guests declined,” he told the Star on the phone. Nyoka said the closure of hotels and the banning of public gatherings in the coastlines worsened the situation.  Beaches have been deserted since then. “We have families to take care of and we don’t know how long the disease will stay, so to be safe looking for alternatives was inevitable,” he said. The chairman said that fishing and farming were not any good because there are no markets for their produce. He said the absence of active tourism is what makes the fishing industry perform poorly. Nyoka said most people are at home and have no savings with which to buy fish or any farm produce at the regular prices. Members have to sell the commodities at lower prices for fear of making losses. “If you have caught dozens of fish and there is no one to buy, what do you do other than sell at a cheaper price?” Nyoka said. The beach operators have appealed to the national government to consider giving them food rations. (edited by o. owino)
