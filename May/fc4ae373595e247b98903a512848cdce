Narok Senator Ledama ole Kina has settled the matter that almost brought chaos to the ODM party. The argument between Ledama and ODM Minority Leader in the Senate James Orengo started on Tuesday following the new members to the County Public and Accounts Investment Committee being announced. Ole Kina emerged the winner from the votes cast defeating his Kisii counterpart Sam Ongeri. Following his win, Orengo disputed the outcome, saying the names of the new members were published in a rush when other issues were not resolved. Ole Kina said that the move by Orengo was not in good faith yet he is a member of the ODM party. But on Wednesday, Ole Kina said through a post on Twitter that the matter had been resolved. He said that he held wide consultations regarding his election as the Senate CPAIC chairperson with Orengo and the ODM party leadership. "I have had wide consultations on the issue of my election as chair of the Senate CPAIC with James Orengo and the ODM party," Ole Kina said. Ole Kina has also stated that his support for ODM leader Raila Odinga and President Uhuru Kenyatta is solid and unshaken. Meanwhile, Murang’a Senator Irungu Kangata has denied reports he voted for ODM candidate Sam Ongeri in the polls. The Senate Deputy Majority Chief Whip said he voted according to the directions given by Majority leader Kipchumba Murkomen. “I have to follow the dictates of the party. I am in that committee as its nominee. I voted as per Jubilee party position. I am loyal to the party. The position was we should support Ole Kina,” he told the Star on Wednesday. On Tuesday, sources in the committee has intimated to the Star that Kangata voted for Ongeri alongside three ODM members. The deal, according, was that Kangata would be elected as vice chair of the powerful oversight committee. But the Murang’a legislator said he was never in the race for the vice chair position as his current seat of Deputy Majority Chief Whip does not allow him to hold another position.
