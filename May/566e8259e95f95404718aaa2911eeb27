@alalmaurice Cane growers have asked the new head of the sugar directorate Rosemary Owino to deal firmly with illegal importers. Kenya Sugarcane Growers Association secretary general Richard Ogendo on Monday said the influx of illegal sugar imports has massively affected local industries. “We congratulate the new head of the directorate and promise to work with her,” Ogendo said. Before her appointment, Owino was head of marketing at the tea directorate. She replaced Solomon Odera who was moved to head the fibre crops directorate. Ogendo cautioned that dealing with sugar barons will not be easy as they always fight back. The directorate issues import permits to traders to allow them to ship in duty-free sugar from regional countries. The Kesga boss asked Owino to only allow imports that are commensurate with a deficit in the country at any given time. This, Ogendo said, will ensure fair pricing and competition in the local market. He noted that cartels always take advantage of sugar deficit in the country leading to cheap importation. The lobby secretary also called on the new directorate head to tackle late payment of farmers and workers. State-owned sugar factories owe farmers more than Sh2 billion. Ogendo said Owino should ensure those who looted farmers’ out-growers institutions are prosecuted and jailed. “We hope she will also initiate a process of cane development to provide the industry with adequate raw material,” Ogendo said. Ogendo said the barons are fond of creating an ‘artificial shortage’ of the sweetener for their selfish benefits. “These crooks will do anything to propagate a shortage of the commodity to force imports,” he said. The sugar influx in local markets, he said, has caused a dwindle in local production.  (edited by o. owino)
