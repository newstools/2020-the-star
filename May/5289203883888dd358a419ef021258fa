A Magistrate's court has found that Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong and eight others have a case to answer in a Sh8 million graft case. Anti-corruption court magistrate Douglas Ogoti ruled that with the evidence on record, the prosecution has established there is a case against the nine. The county chief and his co-accused persons will now be required to defend themselves before the trial court determines the case. Ojaamong said he will be calling witnesses to defend himself. He did not mention how many. The governor, Bernard Aite, Leonard Wanda, Allan Omachari, Samwel Oseko, Edan Odoo, Renish Omullo, Sebasian Hallensben and Madam R Enterprises (MRE) were in 2018 charged with conspiracy to commit an economic crime. Ojaamong is separately charged with engaging in a project without prior planning and abuse of office. Others are accused of fraudulent acquisition to property, failure to pay taxes amongst others. According to the prosecution's case,  Ojaamong on April 1, 2014 travelled to Germany in the company of officials from the county on a fact-finding mission to study new technologies on solid waste management. The trip was fully funded by MRE Limited but the various plans on waste management were not by MRE and its directors Renish and Sebasian. The prosecution in its written submissions indicated that seven days after, Ojaamong executed an MoU between MRE Ltd and the county government of Busia, whereby the county was to pay Sh8 million to MRE for a feasibility study on solid waste management for the county government of Busia. However, at the time of signing the MoU, MRE was not in existence as the same had not been incorporated. The company came into existence on July 8, 2014. A witness who testified against the governor said he signed an MoU  with a non existent company.
