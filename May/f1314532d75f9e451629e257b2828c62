Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission sleuths have arrested senior Kilifi county officials over an ambiguous tender deal worth millions used to curb the spread of Covid-19 in the county. At least four officers, including the Finance Chief Officer,  County Secretary and two officials from the health department were arrested over the irregular procurement of the tender for the construction of Kilifi Covid-19 Complex centre. The Kilifi County Secretary Arnold Mkare, Finance Chief Officer Benjamin Kai, Chief Officer Health Services Bilali Mazoya and Chief Officer for Medical Alio Ibrahim, were arrested for failing to give information on the Complex. This follows weeks of investigations by the anti-graft watchdog over the alleged irregular contract and tender awarded to a company, Pharmaken Limited, which was reported by the Star. The first phase of the complex is worth Sh493 million, while the second phase was estimated at Sh398 million. EACC regional boss, Mutembei Nyaga confirmed the arrest of the officials, saying they had widened their net to ensure all suspects were in custody. “We are processing details and all those implicated in the deal will have charges pressed against them, depending on how investigations commence,” said Nyaga. The tender is for the repair and maintenance of equipment in county hospitals as part of measures to address the Covid-19 pandemic. The letter dated April 14 and signed by the Coast Upper North EACC regional boss Ignatius Wekesa is addressed to county secretary Arnold Jefwa. The county is supposed to submit the procurement plan, requisition and approval of the procurement. It should also provide the budgetary allocation, prequalified list of medical suppliers, a detailed scope of work and the tender advertisement. Nyaga said the county attorney, Michele Bibi Fondo, head of supply chain management Matano Riziki Chota and the chief officer executive Amina Nassor, were still being sought over the matter.
