The Communications Authority of Kenya has intensified search for a new director-general, almost a year after Francis Wangusi's term expired in August last year. In an advertisement on Friday, the communications agency invited candidates to send their applications before June 9. The replacement of Wangusi will end months of the dramatic change of guard at CA. At one time, Wangusi was bundled out of office before the court reinstated him, saying the board was not well constituted to effect his exit. The board hurriedly appointed the current director of legal services, Mercy Wanjau, in an acting capacity. “This advertisement supersedes all previous advertisements relating to the vacancy, applicants who had applied for the position previously and are still interested should reapply,” the CA said.
