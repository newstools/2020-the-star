At least eight relatives of a 45-year-old woman who tested positive for Covid-19 in Homa Bay have been quarantined. They were seized by county health and security officers from MuKuyu village in Suba South on suspicion that they had been in contact with the woman. They include the woman's eight-year-old niece, five-month-old granddaughter and three adult sons. The woman is suspected to have contracted the virus at a funeral in Shirati, Tanzania. It is reported that she crossed into Tanzania to attend her uncle's funeral and sneaked back after staying there for two weeks. Homa Bay Health executive Richard Muga said the woman returned from Tanzania on Tuesday, May 5 on a boda boda. “Concerned residents reported the matter to local authorities who in turn took her to Homa Bay KMTC for quarantine,” Muga said. Muga said they were tracing all the people she might have interacted with. Health surveillance officers are already on the ground in Suba South. “We have nabbed eight close family members of the woman. Their samples are being taken for tests at Kemri in Kisumu,” Muga said. The woman has been taken to Malela isolation centre in Ndhiwa constituency. Muga said she is undergoing treatment among other medical tests. “The woman becomes the second person who was taken to the isolation unit after testing positive,” he added. Muga urged residents to cooperate with officers to help get people who came into contact with the woman for quarantine. “Residents should not fear coming out when they suspect they have the virus. Covid-19 is not a death sentence,” he said. On Saturday, Suba South deputy county commissioner Kamau Maina said they had intensified surveillance at the entry points. “We’re working closely with residents to ensure we adhere to the Nyumba Kumi initiative. It helps us comb out strangers,” he said.
