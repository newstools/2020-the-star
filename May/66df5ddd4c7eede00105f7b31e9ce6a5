Police have arrested three men suspected of being behind the stoning and chasing away of chiefs in Lari, Kiambu county on Sunday. The three were arrested on Tuesday. Lari deputy county commissioner Aaron Koros said Kamae chief Isaac Gichuhi and his assistants Grace Nyaguthie and Samuel Muhuthia were on official duty at 7pm on Sunday at Kirasha junction trading centre when they were attacked by five men. Trouble started after the administrators tried to access a bar where the operator had locked customers inside. The five men, who were outside the bar, started hurling insults at the chiefs, telling them that they (the chiefs) can also contract the coronavirus, and they also needed to go home. When the door to the bar was opened, revellers started running away. In the process, the five men who were outside the bar started hurling stones at the chiefs. The chiefs scampered to safety and reported the incident to police who responded immediately. When the police arrived, all the suspects had fled. Speaking to the Star, the deputy county commissioner said police on Tuesday raided Kamae village and arrested the three suspects. "We will not allow any government officer who is implementing government directives to be intimidated," Koros said. Koros said they have increased patrols in the area to ensure people get home before 7pm. Resident Joseph Mureithi condemned the incident, saying people should obey the law at all times. Voice of Men and Children organisation chairman James Njenga said some Kenyans have been violating guidelines put in place to reduce the spread of the disease, without knowing that they were putting their lives at risk. "The ignorance of our people is the reason I was advocating for a lockdown," he said.  Edited by A.N
