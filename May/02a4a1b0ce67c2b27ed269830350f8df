Guardian Angel is set to release a full worship album, alongside fellow Kenyan artistes such as Eunice Njeri. Speaking to Word Is, he said when he first sang a worship song, ‘Nakuhitaji’, people received it very well. "Some people have even gotten saved by listening to some of my worship songs. I spoke to other worship artistes and we agreed to do only worship songs because there is a niche for such songs," he said. Guardian added that he wants to teach young people they can make an impact even without doing crazy stunts to get attention. He reminisced a day when a woman called him from Aga Khan Hospital with a little boy who was so sick, he couldn’t even get up from his bed. "I prayed for him through the phone and five minutes later, the mother sent me photos of herself breastfeeding the baby. I saw the photos and cried,” he said.
