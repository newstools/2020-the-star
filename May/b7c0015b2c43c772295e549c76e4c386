Safaricom announced on Sunday that one of its employees at Thika Road Mall had contracted Covid-19. A statement by the company’s CEO Peter Ndegwa said the affected employee had been swiftly put in isolation and was receiving appropriate medical attention. The Safaricom shop at the mall was temporarily closed as a result for cleaning and sanitisation. Colleagues of the affected staffer “have been informed and are currently undergoing counseling and screening to ensure their safety and wellbeing,” Ndegwa said. He said wellbeing and safety of the company’s employees was his priority, adding that the company would provide all the necessary medical care to the staffer to ensure proper physical and psychological stability. “The health, safety and wellbeing of our staff and customers is our top most priority. We are fully supporting our affected colleagues and their families, through the recovery period by providing all necessary medical care and psychosocial support required, ensuring their wellbeing,” Ndegwa said. With the TRM shop closed, the CEO said the inconvenienced customers should seek services from the nearest outlets and through self-service platforms including Zuri Chatbot, MySafaricom App and the Interactive Voice Biometric System. The customer care lines 100 and 200 are also available to all customers, he said. “Even as we take these actions, we reiterate our commitment to continue working with all stakeholders to help our nation through this crisis,” Ndegwa said.
