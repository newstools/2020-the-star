Three women and a child have been put under quarantine in Transmara West, Narok County after they arrived from Tanzania. Area sub county Deputy County Commissioner Mohammed Hassan Noor said the response team had to trace the three after residents raised an alarm. Addressing the press in his office, Noor said that two of the women had visited Mwanza while the other toured Mangucha before returning. They have been isolated at Transmara West sub county hospital. He added that they used unmanned entry points to gain access to the neighbouring country. “We have told the people in the border points to stop human movements to Tanzania in a bid to fight corona virus,” said Noor. He revealed that some of the confirmed Covid-19 cases in Tanzania is about 10km from the Kenya-Tanzania border at Angata Barikoi. The commissioner said that they have erected road block in Angata Barikoi to ensure that no Tanzanian gains entry to our country until virus reduced. “We will rely on information from chiefs, their assistants, and Nyumba Kumi initiative on any foreigner who might sneak to country due their high corona cases in their country of origin,” said Noor. Noor warned some of the Kenyans who have been visiting Tanzania secretly, operating bars and night clubs that they will be arrested and put under force quarantine for defying government directive in combating the deadly virus. Narok county has three unmanned entry points from Tanzania and are Angata Barikoi, Loita and Olpusimoru. The official entry points are Namanga and Isebania. Narok county government is now under high alert after Tanzania recorded new COVID-19 cases. Governor Samuel Tunai said that his administration in collaboration with national government will work closely to ensure that no Tanzanian comes to Kenya through their entry points. “So far no reported confirmed cases on corona in Narok but now our great threat is Tanzania because their numbers have doubled,” Tunai said.
