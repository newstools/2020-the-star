Turkana county on Wednesday received Sh2.5 million anti-coronavirus supplies and personal protective equipment from World Vision. World Vision collaborated with the county to strengthen preparedness against Covid-19. The organisation focuses on children's welfare by providing education, food, hygiene supplies, water and health services. Joseph Adome, World Vision's county manager, said the donation includes 20 jerrycans of liquid soap (20 litres), 20 jerrycans of sanitiser, 3,700 face masks, 2,000 gloves, 10 hand sprayers, gumboots, 24 goggles and 2,400 jerrycans of water. â€œThe donation will protect frontline healthcare workers responding to emergency cases," Adome said. The jerrycans of water will help pastoralists so they can store water and wash their hands to prevent them from contracting the coronavirus. Adome turned the donations over to representatives of the Ministry of Health. World Vision is also helping Turkana handle flooding and the locust infestation that has ravaged the county. Charles Ekai, Turkana's head of resource mobilisation, said that last week they received an ambulance, hand sanitiser and surgical face masks from UNHCR in Kakuma. Roberts Abok, county chief Health officer, said World Vision will work with the Health ministry to monitor truck drivers entering from Mombasa and Nairobi to Kainuk. He said they will screen truck drivers at Kainuk and ensure those who enter have been tested over 48 hours, receiving Covid-19-free certificates. Jane Ajele, the Turkana Health executive, said the county has set up screening and isolation centres and quarantine sites. It is also educating residents about the virus. She said truck drivers plying the Mombasa-Nairobi-Kitale to Lodwar route will not be allowed to pass at Kainuk screening centre without a Covid-19-free certificate. Ajele advised restaurant owners to ensure all staff receive Covid-19-free certificates before they reopen. (Edited by V. Graham)
