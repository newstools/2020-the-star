President Uhuru Kenyatta has announced the extension the nationwide 7 pm to 5 am curfew by another 21 days. The curfew will now stay in place until June 6, 2020. The President also extended the cessation of movement into and out of the Nairobi Metropolitan Area, Mombasa, Kilifi, Kwale and Mandera counties for three more weeks. Speaking at State House, Nairobi on Saturday, the President also announced a cessation of movement of persons and passengers ferrying automobiles, except cargo vehicles between the Kenya-Tanzania border effective midnight tonight. The President also announced the same measures between the Kenya-Somalia border. All cargo truck drivers are to be tested for Covid-19 and will only be allowed entry into Kenya if they test negative. The measures come after a total of 43 cases crossed into Kenya from Somalia and Tanzania. Out of these, 14 crossed the border at Wajir, Namanga (16), Isebania (10), Lunga Lunga (2) and one from the Loitoktok border point. The President said 78 truck drivers who are foreign nationals tested positive for the disease. Uhuru said these truckers were denied entry into Kenya's territory at different border crossings. The President warned Kenyans to heed the government directives in order to avoid further stringent measures. "Do your part in curbing the spread of this virus, we do not want to lock down the country," he said. Uhuru said his government will continue to take every measure to protect the lives of Kenyans from the pandemic and to plan for the recovery of our economy. "The whole world is walking through the valley of the shadow of death. However, I know that the firmness of our resolve as a nation, the fidelity of each and everyone in keeping the enemy at bay, and God’s enduring Grace, will see us into the light," he added.
