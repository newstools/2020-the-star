Uganda President Yoweri Museveni on Monday demonstrated how to 'optimally' consume food rations donated by his government during the Covid-19 period. Holding a knife and a plate of 1kg cooked Ugali also known as Posho in Uganda, Museveni demonstrated to his kitchen staff how one kilogram of maize flour was enough to last a household for several days. "I asked the kitchen staff to prepare 1kg of the maize flour from the food being distributed by the COVID-19 relief team," he said. "My intention was to understand how an individual can consume this food optimally during this period." Museveni said the scientific conclusion is that 250gs of Posho is optimal for consumption in this situation "This means that for 2.6kgs of posho, about 10 days are possible," he said. He said if each individual can consume about 250kgs of the relief Posho per meal, one can obtain enough calories to enable you to considerably survive for quite some time. "The food should not be consumed wastefully," he said.
