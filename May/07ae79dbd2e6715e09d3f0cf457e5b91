Citizen TV presenter Willis Raburu did not post anything to celebrate his third marriage anniversary with wife Marya Prude on social media like the last two years. Raburu's marriage is allegedly broken and according to sources, the two are living separately. Raburu and Marya had their wedding on May 5, 2017. The wedding was exclusive, with close friends and family attending. A day after the wedding, Raburu shared a photo from their wedding and introduced Marya to the world as his wife. Massive congratulatory messages from fans followed, and since then, their marriage blossomed, with the couple sharing bright moments of it. A year later, in 2018, during the same day, Raburu showered his wife with a love message on their anniversary. He wrote, "I am normally very good with words, but it’s only your beauty that renders me speechless. "You got me and you are even sexier when you pray. Like I said I get speechless but the words that I am forever grateful I spoke are: 'I DO'.” While Prude thanked him for loving her."I used to wonder what they meant by saying marriage is a lot of work and it is meant for grownups. Believe me, now I know.” Last year, they celebrated the anniversary at Villa Rosa Kempinski. To mark their big day, Willis Raburu jotted a sweet message to his wife as part of the celebrations. Raburu referred to May 5 as the most precious day in his life, and to the wife as his 'Bonga points'. “This day you said you do, to a crazy man with a dream, who did not have his life totally figured out and all he had was a word and a belief," he wrote. "You see deeper and have taught me to as well. You love me with all my flaws, my faults and my good. Thank God I found you (you know the rest).” The two are alleged to have split in March. Neither Raburu nor the wife has commented on the issue yet. Edited by T Jalio
