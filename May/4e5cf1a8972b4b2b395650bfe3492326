At least 1,000 people have been displaced and property destroyed by floods in Kakamega county. The floods from rivers Nzoia, Yala and Kipkaren have hit Mumias West, Matungu and Khwisero subcounties in the past week. About 100 families were displaced in Mautuma, Chekalini, Lugari Lwandeti and Chevaywa wards of Lugari constituency. They flood victims are camping at Chepsai and Shibale primary schools while others are living with relatives. The victims are appealing for assistance from the government and well-wishers. The floods have also damaged sections of the Kakamega-Bungoma road, cutting off transport between the two counties. Lugari MP Ayub Savula visited the families and donated cash and food. He urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to declare floods a national disaster because many Kenyans have been displaced, lost lives and property. "I will discuss with the county and national governments to provide emergency support to those affected," Savula said.  Kakamega county commissioner Pauline Dola said her office had already submitted to the national government a list of the affected people. "We hope to get a quick positive response from the government but we are asking residents along river banks to move to safer places," she said. Resident Violet Toili said River Kipkaren's water levels rose last week and flooded their homes on Friday night while they were asleep. "We spent the night in the cold before moving to Chepsai Primary School. I lost cows and chicken because I focused on my childrenâ€™s safety," she said. Another resident, David Chagusia, lost his house, while his 10-acre farm in Mavaka village was submerged. Governor Wycliffe Oparanya visited the families in Mumias West on Sunday and donated mattresses and blankets. "We want you to give us your mobile phone numbers so we send you money to buy food of your choice," Oparanya said.  Edited by Frank Obonyo
