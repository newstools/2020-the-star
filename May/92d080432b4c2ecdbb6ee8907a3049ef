Kenya is unable to conduct tests for Covid-19 using technology applied for tuberculosis diagnosis for lack of cartridges used in the process. Health PS Susan Mochache told MPs that the GeneXpert machines in 189 facilities have not been put to use. This is despite a committee of laboratory experts approving its use in all counties except Samburu, Tana River and Elgeyo Marakwet. Mochache said facilities in the said counties lack basic safety equipment required for testing the virus. She assured Kenyans that the national government will procure testing kits, train officers and coordinate quality assurance. The PS revealed that 10 counties - Nairobi, Kisumu, Uasin Gishu, Mombasa, Kilifi, Wajir, Busia, Machakos, Trans Nzoia and Kericho have started testing for Covid-19. MPs at the Health committee chaired by Murang’a Woman Representative Sabina Chege, however, questioned whether counties have actually started the tests. Funyula’s Wilberforce Oundo said there was no testing going on in Busia county as purported by the ministry. Lawmakers further raised concerns that there is no budgetary allocation for quarantine and isolation of persons who test positive for the virus. This was even as it emerged that the 14-high risk counties have received equipment worth Sh107 million from the national government to bolster their response to Covid-19. They are Kisumu, Kiambu, Busia, Migori, Uasin Gishu, Mombasa, Kilifi, Garissa, Mandera, Wajir, Machakos, Kajiado, Kakamega, and Nakuru. Health ministry data shows that the counties have received – through Kemsa – 90,100 3-ply face masks valued at Sh100 each. Counties have also been given 1,294 3-ply surgical masks at Sh3 million as well as 350 disposable medical protective clothing at Sh2.6 million. The data Health PS Susan Mochache shared with MPs shows that counties have received 610 goggles at Sh352,580 and 729 pieces of examination gloves. The ministry has also distributed 10,771 sterile surgical gloves - 50-pack; valued at Sh22.6 million and 400 pieces of alcohol-based hand rub at Sh160,000. MoH has said that at least 7,980 N95 respiratory masks valued at Sh5.9 million have also been shared out. Counties have also received PPEs worth Sh49 million and theatre boots of varied sizes valued at Sh10.8 million. Governors have also been sent 50 pack nitrile gloves valued at Sh42,000 and 10 infrared thermometers valued at Sh147,000. A ventilator valued at Sh3 million and suction machines have also been distributed to counties as of April 30. Mochache said that no money has been disbursed to counties so far in response to the pandemic, adding that any that comes by shall be channelled directly to them. The PS said the ministry intends to facilitate recruitment of 1,059 specialised staff for Intensive Care Units and High Dependency Units at identified Covid-19 treatment centres. Also to be hired from the Sh1 billion appropriated in the recent estimates are 568 staff for Kenyatta University Hospital; 288  for Mbagathi; and 94 staff for Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital in Eldoret.
