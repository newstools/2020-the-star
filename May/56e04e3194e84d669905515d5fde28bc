US-based Kenyan artiste King Kanja has released his debut album, 'Vibe Lord', under his imprint label, King Kanja Empire. The 10-track album features a cross-section of artistes. He is celebrated for his unique style that blends hip-hop, R&B, reggae and African polyrhythmic music, while infusing Kikuyu and Kiswahili into his lyrics. Kanja said 'Vibe Lord' represents the energy he brings when he walks into a room or onto the stage, his growth as a man and as a musician. "The different people, views and culture I have experienced from my tour last year influenced this album," he said. "A lot of these songs were recorded during the tour because I wanted to captivate the energy of the place and the audience from the concert,” he said. During this Covid-19 period, he found himself transitioning into a different mindset and energy. "It made me dig deeper inside me to pull out the biggest vibes I had to compete for this album, reflecting on the vibes I collected from each city during my US tour,” he said.
