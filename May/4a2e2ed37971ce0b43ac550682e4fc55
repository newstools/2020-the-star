Kenya Airports Authority is making arrangements to take back the passengers plane to the sky after being grounded following the coronavirus pandemic. A statement from Airport manager Abel Gogo to all the government agencies, all concessionaires, contractors, suppliers and service providers reads. He has invited all the stakeholders for a virtual meeting which will be held on May 13, 2010. The meeting will address public precautionary health measures for civil aviation that will be adhered to once the operation resumes. They will also discuss the operational readiness and resumption activities. Since the pandemic started, passenger flights were grounded across the world, with evacuation planes allowed to fly. Both the international and local flights were suspended in order to protect the workers and the passengers from the virus. In April, Kenya Airways exported 40 tons of fresh produce to London amid efforts to keep the economy alive. The 40 tons of fresh fruit and vegetables, were imported as cargo in one of its passenger Dreamliners converted to a cargo plane. The national carrier said that this is key in keeping the shelves of British supermarkets stocked and Kenyan jobs protected during the current Covid-19 pandemic that has crippled the economy. The increase in cargo flights saw flower farms in Naivasha resuming to production after a month of losses and job cuts.
