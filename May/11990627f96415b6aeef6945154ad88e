Three guards were murdered by suspected gangsters in the wee hours of Wednesday at Ikanga market in Kitui South subcounty. The murders were confirmed by Ikanga location senior chief Onesmus Musauli. He said the thugs who were armed with crude weapons like pangas and axes took advantage of the Covid-19 dusk-to-dawn curfew to commit the crime. Speaking on the phone, the chief said the motive of the murders was not immediately known because the criminals did not appear to be on a robbery mission. “It is not clear why the thugs hacked the watchmen to death as they watched over shops in Ikanga market. They did not appear keen on stealing from the shops. They only broke into one of the shops and made away with airtime cards and other minor items,” the chief said. He said investigations have been launched. The chief added that the bodies of the slain watchmen were taken to the Mutomo Hospital mortuary. The Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry chairman Paul Mwangi condemned the killings. He called on the authorities to increase security surveillance and patrols by police during curfew hours as instances of thuggery and shop breaking had escalated. “Criminals appear to have a field day once people retire to the safety of their homes as the curfew time kicks in. There has been a sharp increase in burglary and mugging during curfew,” chief Musauli said. Edited by Henry Makori
