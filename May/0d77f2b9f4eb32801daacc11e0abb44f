Malaba residents have asked authorities to tighten security in the border town following the killing of a clearing agent. Paul Etori was killed on Friday night and his body dumped in a sewer system. He was found on Saturday morning. Clearing agents are essential service providers, thus allowed to work at night during curfew hours to clear cargo trucks crossing the border to Uganda. Etori’s body, according to Akadetewai chief Celine Okwara, had knife wounds in the neck, arms and back. Okwara said Etori’s personal belongings were found intact. "His wallet, two mobile phones and a bag he was carrying were all recovered untampered," she said. The two mobile phones were still on. Okwara said Etori was the chairman of Malaba clearing agents. “Even his motorbike was at the spot the killing took place,” the administrator said. “They were just after his life.” She said there was evidence of struggle at the scene,  implying Etori may have engaged his killers before he was overpowered. Teso North police boss Wilson Muraya said they have started investigations into the incident and cautioned Malaba town residents against speculating on the motive of the killers and those who may have been involved. “No one has been arrested but I want people to stop the speculation,” he told the Star. “We are following up the matter and I will brief you later.” Etori’s body was taken to Frapa Funeral Home in Teso North. The murder took place approximately 100 metres from the scene where 10 bullets were dropped by unknown people last week. Peter Mathews, a Malaba resident,  said police should enhance security in the border town to prevent the return of insecurity witnessed in 2014 and 2015. Edited by E.Kibii
