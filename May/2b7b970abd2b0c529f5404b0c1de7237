Eight people have been quarantined at the Kenya Medical Training College in Homa Bay after they travelled to Tanzania and back. Six are members of one family in Pudo village, Suba South constituency. They are said to have crossed into Tanzania to attend a relative's funeral. The seventh person, who is from Nyandiwa beach, went to Tanzania for personal business and returned on a boda boda. The boda boda operator is the eighth person. The eight were rounded up by health and security officers on Sunday. Deputy county commissioner Kamau Maina said they failed to report their travel history to their local chiefs. He said the family returned to the country on Saturday. “We got a tip-off from some residents that the family members had travelled to Tanzania and back,” Maina said. “Their samples will be collected at Homa Bay KMTC where they are quarantined for tests at Kemri in Kisumu.” The administrator said they are still looking for another person who sneaked into the area from Tanzania. National and county officials have increased vigilance in Suba South constituency after a 45-year-old woman tested positive for Covid-19 on Saturday. The woman attended a funeral in Tanzania and returned after a two-week stay. Suba South MP John Mbadi urged residents to obey government’s directives to slow down the spread of the coronavirus. He urged residents to suspend unnecessary travel to Tanzania. “I appeal to residents to stop travelling to Tanzania to attend funerals. Let’s be responsible to avoid contracting the virus,” Mbadi said. Edited by Josephine M. Mayuya
