A manhunt has been launched for a Ugandan kidnapping suspect who disappeared from Kamukunji Police Station on Thursday morning in unclear circumstances. Martin Wasike, 27, was in custody for allegedly kidnapping police constable Abel Misati on January 19. The officer is yet to be found. The Ugandan and countryman Shariff Wanabwa and Phoebe Anido had the previous day appeared in a Milimani court to answer charges of collaborating in the kidnapping of the police officer. They were to reappear in court on June 2. The prosecution told the court that Misati, whose phone was found in Eastleigh on April 17, might have been killed. Detectives intend to extend the investigation to Uganda. - mwaniki fm
