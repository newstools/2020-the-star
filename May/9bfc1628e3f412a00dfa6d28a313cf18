An elderly Bomet woman and her son have been arrested for attempting to exhume the body her husband 10 years after his death. Nancy Chepkorir Mitei from Kipkebe village and her 26-year-old son were arrested after the public complained of a bizarre incident in the homestead. Area chief Ruben Ngetich said the two were arrested as they   exhumed the casket. They argued that, as a married man, the deceased should have been buried on his land. Mitei accused some family members of refusing her to till her husband's land, alleging that they were not duly married. She wondered why she was being kicked out yet she had a son with the man she had all along known to be her husband. She wanted a share of the family property. The woman said their culture demanded that her husband should have been buried on his land as he had a wife and children. “We have not been living in peace for all these years. The only way we can avoid being haunted by bad spirits is to have the body buried on his share of land,” she said. But elders argued that there will be more deaths if the grave was left open. Bomet sub-county police commander Musa Omari said the mother and son might arraigned depending on the outcome of police investigations. - mwaniki fm
