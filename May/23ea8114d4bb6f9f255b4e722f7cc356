Police in Nyamira have arrested a woman suspected of stealing a two-year-old child at the Kisii bus park last Thursday. The child's mother, Sheila Nyaboke, said the woman befriended her at the washrooms before making off with the child. Nyaboke was travelling from Nakuru to her home in Kisii and arrived at the stage in the evening. She was about to board a matatu to Nyamarambe in South Mugirango when the incident occurred. "This woman appeared so friendly that I entrusted her with my child, we even answered the call of nature together as she held on to my child. But when I went to buy juice for him, the woman disappeared," Nyaboke said. On Sunday, villagers at Nyaigesa in Nyamira South subcounty alerted the police about the suspect after a CCTV footage of the two going to the washrooms was aired. The area chief said the child was found with the woman when officers raided her home the same day. Kisii county police commander Jebel Munene told the Star the suspect was taken in police custody in Nyamira. She will be taken to Kisii for trial. "We thank the villagers for the alert that led to her arrest. We are dispatching some officers today to pick and bring her here so we can open a case against her," he said. Kisii town trader Steve Arika said the bus park is full of cons and urged the police to act. Elsewhere, residents of Riobonyo in Nyangusu, Kisii, set on fire a serial chicken thief at the weekend. The identity of the suspect was not immediately established. His body was burnt beyond recognition. Ben Nyakweba, a witness, said the suspect was killed on Saturday night. Edited by Josephine M.
