Kenya Pipeline Company (KPC) has partnered with the National Youth Council to distribute free hand sanitizers to vulnerable members of the community in a bid to combat Covid-19. This comes at a time when hand-sanitizing is a key practice required to safeguard individuals from contracting the virus. Distribution of the free hand sanitizers targets the urban poor, low-income earners who would ordinarily find it a challenge to procure the sanitizers. “KPC is committed to joining hands with like-minded organization to kick corona out of our country,” KPC managing director, Irungu Macharia said. By Monday, April 23 a total of 614,256 litres of Government sanitizers had been produced in various blending plants in Nairobi and Mombasa. Of this, 310,812 litres has been dispatched to all the 47 counties, 172,560 litres to respective health CECs under the assistance of the Council of Governors. Previously, 138,252 litres had been received by county commissioners in various counties while 217,048 litres has equally been distributed to various institutions, community-based organizations (CBOs) and the political class to assist in the last-mile delivery to the informal settlements, market places and other potential hotspot areas across the country. Counties including Nairobi, Mombasa, Kilifi and Mandera emerged as Covid-19 hotspots after the Health ministry put out an alert over the massive spread of the virus outside Nairobi. The Company hopes to tap on the wide network enjoyed by the Youth Council to distribute the hand sanitizers at no cost and sensitize vulnerable members of the community on the novel coronavirus. To realize this objective, KPC has partnered with oil marketing companies(OMCs) and the private sector with the ability to blend to manufacture the hand sanitizers. Irungu added that last week, the company funded the production of 1 million face masks by the National Youth Service (NYS) at a cost of Sh55million.
