Diamond's baby mama Tanasha has sued Tanzanian radio presenter Mwijaku for claiming he is the real father of her son, Naseeb Junior. Mwijaku has been all over social media, saying he is the father of Tanashaâ€™s son and not Tanzanian singer Diamond Platinumz. Ray C is among the people annoyed by the story. She advised Tanasha Donna to sue the presenter. "There are things we do as human beings that are very stupid and to you Mwijaku you're not doing something good at all," Ray C commented. "In our neighbouring country, you would have been in jail for this. @tanashadonna, get a lawyer and sue this b*ch a* n**ga. This is beyond disrespectful." Tanasha then disclosed she's taking legal action. "Empty vessels make the loudest noise, sis. You know empty? He will be receiving a letter from my lawyer soon. Let's see if he'll still be as enthusiastic by the time he's in court," she said.
