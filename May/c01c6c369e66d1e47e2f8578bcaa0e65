Teargas, gunshots and stones flew as residents of Dandora and Kariobangi estates engaged the police in running battles following the blockage of access to Korogocho market. The residents on Friday woke up to a disruption after trenches had been dug at the entrance of Korogocho market, hindering food trucks among other items from accessing it. Korogocho market chairperson who sought anonymity told the Star that the main concern was the market supplies that were blocked in the wee hours of the morning. “We started protesting after finding road sections leading to the market closed. We have no problem with the government. Our main concern is that the roads enabling goods to enter the market was closed, “he said. “We found trenches dug and that’s why we called on the local authorities to explain to us why,” he added. The angry residents took their demos to Outering Road, where they lit tyres and barricaded. Police had a hard time quelling the tension. It was a push and pull as the local youths tried to outdo the police in vain. It took the combined effort of both armed police in civilian clothes, GSU and regular police to contain the situation. The situation almost got out of hand and police had to call for back up. In the midst of the fracas, some youths took advantage and looted shops. Hundreds of workers were left stranded in the melee. A section of the Kariobangi Dandora highway had to remain closed after a vehicle was set ablaze, rendering the route impassable.
