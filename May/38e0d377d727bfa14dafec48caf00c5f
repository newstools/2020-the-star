Bomet County Government wants the newly promoted National Super League sideÂ  Silibwet FC to play their matches at home and not in Kisii as they had earlier announced. And to ensure that this happens, the county has subsequently started upgrading the Silibwet Stadium in Bomet to save the team the cost and headache of shuttling to Gusii Stadium in Kisii. The team had already picked Gusii Stadium as their venue of choice with Kericho and Narok Stadia as the alternative venues. According to the head coach Lenny Kigen, their decision to play at Gusii was informed by the fact that most of their players are students at Keroka Technical Training Institute in Kisii. Silibwet FC now joins Bomet Administration Police in the league, bringing to two the number of teams from Bomet featuring in the NSL. Yesterday, the county sports chief officer, Job Towett, disclosed that they have already held talks with all the relevant bodies with a view to having the matches played in Bomet instead of Gusii. He said they have already awarded a tender to a contractor to level the Silibwet grounds, fence the facility and put up changing rooms as well as the main dais. The process, he stated, will take a month to be completed. Last week, FKF general secretary, Barry Otieno, announced the cancellation of the 2019/2020 season due to the coronavirus pandemic and used first leg standings to promote and relegate teams. It is, however, not clear when the first leg matches will kick-off.
