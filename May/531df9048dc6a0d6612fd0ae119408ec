The Public Service Commission has told Homa Bay Governor Cyprian Awiti to suspend the hiring of health workers. PSC is concerned about the leadership tussle at the County Public Service Board, which has rocked the process. Commission Secretary Simeon Rotich said they had received complaints from gruntled members of the board. “Kindly confirm the status of the Homa Bay County Public Service Board to enable the commission address the matter,” Rotich wrote on Friday. Rotich said board chairman Daniel Ogada, Secretary Collins Odhiambo and member Tobias Odundo claimed that they had been barred from the recruitment process. Ogada’s group were reinstated after Homa Bay MCAs impeached them over claims of corruption and abuse of office. The County Public Service Board has six members including Ogada, Odhiambo and Odundo. Others are Elijah Kodo, Lawrence K’Oteng, and Sarah Nekesa, who were sworn in on April 23. Governor Awiti appointed Kodo as acting chairman of the board and instructed him to spearhead the recruitment of the 120 health workers. But Ogada got an injunction from the Employment and Labour Relations Court in Kisumu blocking Kodo from the chairmanship. He also argued that in their absence, the board could not execute its mandate due to lack of quorum. Ogada also wrote to the Public Service Commission alleging that the recruitment is likely to be interfered with and marred with irregularities. “I am deeply concerned about the interference in the recruitment exercise by the county executive considering that the board is a body corporate which is supposed to operate independently,” he said. Reports indicate that the board had received a list with names of applicants from PSC to start the recruitment of the workers. The commission had directed counties to complete the process by April 30. Some 2,320 people from different cadres had sent their applications to PSC before it forwarded to the board.
