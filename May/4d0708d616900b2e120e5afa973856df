The Jubilee Party is set to expel nominated senators who snubbed the president’s Parliamentary Group meeting on Monday. Secretary General Raphael Tuju said the party will take action against rebels in parliament including a recall. The senators include; Falhada Dekow Iman, Naomi Jillo Waqo, Victor Prengei, Mary Seneta Yiane and Millicent Omanga. Tuju said on Wednesday that they were expelled for 'gross insubordination and misconduct'. "They received messages and did not even bother to send apologies for not attending the meeting," he said. President Uhuru Kenyatta summoned Jubilee senators for a Senate Parliamentary Group Meeting on Monday. While the agenda of the meeting was not made public, the outcome saw Senate Majority Leader Kipchumba Murkomen and Majority Whip Susan Kihika axed from their key positions in the Senate. The two are believed to be critics of the President. Murkomen and Kihika, dismissed the changes announced by Statehouse as null and void. Murkomen's plum position was taken by Kanu's West Pokot Senator Samuel Poghisio. Kihika was replaced by Muranga's Irungu Kang;ata who had been her deputy. "To the President, We cannot lead the country through forgery. You cannot forge the signatures of our colleagues," Murkomen later said. The two senators claimed that they never received any invitation alongside 20 other senators. Uhuru's apparent strategy to clip his deputy William Ruto's influence was planned for months. It began with the reorganisation of Jubilee Party's top organ — the National Management Committee — by installing new members loyal to the President. This paved the way for a post-poll agreement with Gideon Moi's Kanu, culminating in the purge of key Ruto allies from parliamentary leadership.
