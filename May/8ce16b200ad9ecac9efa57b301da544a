 Mwingi pastors have asked President Uhuru Kenyatta to declare three days of national prayers as part of divine intervention against the coronavirus pandemic. The call came after a nurse at the Mwingi Level 4 Hospital tested positive for Covid-19, the disease caused by coronavirus.. The hospital's medical superintendent Lawrence Mumo said the 22-year-old is suspected to have contracted the virus from a friend who works in a quarantine facility in Mombasa. The man is said to have visited the nurse between April 6 and 19. Mumo said the patient has been transferred to Kenyatta National Hospital in Nairobi and contact tracing activated. Local pastors say God is angry with the way the government and wants the nation to repent. They said Kenyans should fast, weeping, and pray to God to take away his wrath that is Covid-19. Pastor Stephen Mwasi of Jesus Holy Congregation Ministry said it was time to turn to God. He said all preachers and leaders should come together, pray and fast for three consecutive days and God will heal the nation. “When the nation will meaningfully repent and pray wholeheartedly, that is the moment God will answer their prayers,” Mwasi said. He said the global pandemic is a punishment from God. His colleague Joseph Leisido said God allowed coronavirus in the country with a purpose as people have been doing evil things. He said God decided to send the deadly disease to shut down the whole country and make people turn away from all evils and return to Him. “It is a moment when people need to realise they have wronged our maker and time to pray and seek for forgiveness,” Leisido said. He cautioned politicians planning to splash ill-gotten wealth to rollout their campaigns in 2022, saying God will send a disease to punish them. “The Lord is angry with how the poor are treated in this country. I urge top leaders to repent and follow God’s path, this way, our land will be healed,” Leisido said.  Edited by P.O
