The United States government, through its Embassy in Tanzania has issued a health alert over the situation of Coronavirus in the country. According to the Embassy, many hospitals in Dar es Salaam have been overwhelmed in recent weeks by limited hospital capacity which has resulted in life-threatening delays for medical care, including for those with Covid-19. "The Tanzanian government has not released any data on Covid -19 in Tanzania since April 29, so there is no current data on the number of people diagnosed with COVID-19 in Tanzania," the embassy wrote in a statement on Wednesday. The Embassy further warned its citizens in the country to prepare to remain abroad for an indefinite period. All international flights -commercial and passenger- no longer exist in Tanzania after the suspension took effect on April 11. "The US Government does not anticipate arranging additional repatriation flights in Tanzania at this time," the Embassy stated. The Embassy has also advised that US Government personnel and their families remain at home except for essential activities and substantially limit into private homes the entry of anyone but regular residents. "The risk of contracting Covid-19 in Dar es Salaam is extremely high. Despite limited official reports, all evidence points to the exponential growth of the epidemic in Dar and other locations in Tanzania". Tanzanian President John Pombe Magufuli has been accused of downplaying the rise of coronavirus cases in his country. On Tuesday, he was conspicuously missing in a meeting convened by the East African Community Heads of State members. Meanwhile, the Kenyan government has stepped up its efforts to contain border link infections by constructing a testing facility at the Namanga border point. Health CAS Rashid Aman last week said the facility will also solve the high demand for testing among truck drivers. The Ministry of Health will collaborate with the county government of Kajiado to build the facility.
