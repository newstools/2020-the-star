Civil society has petitioned President Uhuru Kenyatta to include them in the Covid-19 funds board and the Emergency Response Committee. The group, under the Civil Society Reference Group, argues that the sector contributes significantly to socioeconomic and political aspects of society, thus deserves a say in the manner in which the highly disruptive outbreak is being tackled. At the same time, it wants the government to start strategising how to reopen the economy, arguing that “by the time the country will flatten the Covid-19 curve, our national medical stockpile will perhaps be depleted.” The group’s national coordinator, Suba Churchill, said expanding the bodies by including members of the lobbies will widen the scope of public participation in the emergency response and enable enhanced accountability. “The sector plays a crucial role in all facets of life that have been shattered by the pandemic and the government cannot continue to ignore the sector on account of well-known prejudices that have since been overtaken by events,” reads the petition dated May 6 and addressed to the President and Interior CS Fred Matiang’i. The group argues that civil society and non-governmental organisations contribute significantly to the health sector, hence its representation in the Covid-19 bodies will give them a deserved say in the sector they have highly invested in. To emphasise the significance of its contribution, it cites that in 2018-19 alone, the civil society sector spent upwards of Sh13 billion, hence it should be considered at the policy and decision-making table. “The resilient and ever robust civil society is ready to support efforts to light the path for the poor and vulnerable, and bring on board their empathy and skills that will no doubt be required to help in supporting recovery efforts,” he said. The lobbies say the current situation requires an all-inclusive approach that harnesses “the empathy, skills and statistical rigour that public benefit organisations bring on board”.
