Nominated senator Christine Zawadi has pledged his allegiance to the Jubilee party hours after her name was included in a disciplinary list. In the list, Chief whip Irungu Kangata listed Zawadi, Falhada Dekow Iman, Naomi Jillo Waqo, Victor Prengei, Mary Seneta Yiane and Millicent Omanga. They are facing disciplinary actions for snubbing the president’s Parliamentary Group meeting on Monday. In a letter seen by the Star on Wednesday, Kangata said the senators should show cause why they did not attend the meeting. "Your responses to the party should be channeled through this office," Kangata said in a letter dated May 13. Immediately after they received the letter, Zawadi sent a letter explaining her absence from the meeting. "...i confirm that I did not physically attend the Jubilee coalition senate parliamentary group meeting held on May 11," she said. Zawadi said the transport and logistical barriers erected by the government to contain coronavirus, prevented her from going to State House. "I was out of Nairobi metropolitan as at the time of the meeting. However, i do hereby endorse the resolutions of the meeting...," she said. But the other five senators did not send an explanation to the chief whip making the party to take extra disciplinary measures. The Jubilee Party is set to expel the five nominated senators for snubbing the president’s meeting. Secretary General Raphael Tuju said the party will take action against rebels in parliament including a recall. Tuju said on Wednesday that they were expelled for 'gross insubordination and misconduct'.
