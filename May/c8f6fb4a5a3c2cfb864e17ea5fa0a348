The world on Thursday celebrated Menstrual Hygiene Day, a day that is dedicated to raising awareness about menstrual hygiene. Health CS Mutahi Kagwe on Thursday said the ministry is launching the Menstrual Hygiene policy 2019-24. "This policy is meant to create an enabling environment for implementation of menstrual hygiene and management interventions in Kenya. It will also ensure women and girls have access to safe and hygienic products," he said duringÂ  a press briefing in Kiambu. He added that Kenya is the first nation to develop a standalone Menstrual Hygiene Policy through a multi-stakeholder consultative and inclusive process. "We acknowledge the contribution of stakeholders in developing this policy and strategy in advancing the menstrual health and agenda in Kenya," Kagwe said. In the spirit of celebrating this day, the Move Up foundation in Mathare created awareness and donated menstrual cups to women at BMF Community resource center. The menstrual cups serve as a long-term solution to girls and women during their menstrual periods since they can be reused.
