Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana has dispelled news of possible coronavirus cases in the county. In a statement on Wednesday, Kibwana said the county's surveillance has not reported any positive case. According to the latest coronavirus tally by the Ministry of Health, the country now has 1,029 confirmed cases with one case attributed to Makueni county. "It is worth noting that there is no suspect in our holding facilities across the county. Equally, we have no submitted samples without results. So far all our suspected cases have all turned out negative," Kibwana said. He said the positive case is allegedly a truck driver who was tested in Miritini and by the time his results were released he was 4kilometres to Emali on his way to Rwanda. "He has no contacts within Makueni county. The truck driver was called by the Mombasa response team and asked to go back for management. He has since done that," he said. Kibwana reassured residents that there is no case attributable to the county   due to the vigilance  by sub-county, hospital, and County rapid emergency response teams
