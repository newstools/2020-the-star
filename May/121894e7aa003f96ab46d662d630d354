Police in Busia are investigating an incident in which unknown people abandoned pistol bullets outside a bar in Malaba town. Bars are currently closed following the government’s directive that all entertainment joints should not operate because of Covid-19. The ten bullets were discovered by residents who alerted the police. County police commander John Nyoike said they have begun investigating but no arrest has been made. Four of the bullets were dropped near a culvert that connects to Winkers bar, three were abandoned five metres away and the rest were found on a pavement along a cargo truck parking point. Equity Bank Malaba, which is under 24-hour guard by administration police, is less than 100 metres away. Residents asked at what time the bullets were left at the scene as Kenya is currently under a nationwide 7pm-5am curfew. A resident called Eve Juma said Malaba last experienced a spate of burglaries and robberies in 2014 and 2015. “We hope it is not a repeat of what happened five years ago," she said. Residents said they have not experienced insecurity apart from one case in January when an M-Pesa agent called Alvine Makokha was shot dead by gunmen. The three killers according to witnesses came at 8.30pm armed with an AK-47 and shot Makokha in the chest, killing him instantly. The trio then jumped on their motorcycles and sped towards Amagoro town along the Malaba-Bungoma highway. Edited by Frank Obonyo
