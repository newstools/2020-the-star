The approval of seven military officers to Nairobi Metropolitan Service (NMS) has continued to cause varying reactions from leaders. The Senate Majority Leader Kipchumba Murkomen is the latest to man to criticize the move taken by the government. During the Senate proceeding on Tuesday, Murkomen said that the move has deprived Nairobians of their democracy. “Nairobi County has been militarised. It’s no longer a civilian government...something that I would never have imagined when we passed the Constitution of Kenya 2010,” Murkomen said. The senator added that the decision to send active military men to NMS was an ill move when such people should be in barracks and manning our border points. Murkomen said he was against the takeover of the county from Governor Mike Sonko, which he said is against the Constitution. “I want to remain consistent. The militarisation of a civilian government in a county government is the worst form of violation and overturn of our constitution,” Murkomen added. The senator has also raised concern over accountability in NMS, saying it will be a ‘mirage’. “What the hell is happening in this country … the authority of the Senate and the authority of the Parliament must be restored. National Assembly must be restored,” he said. The top Kenya Defence Forces body (Kenya Defence Council) approved military officers joining NMS which was created in March following an agreement between Sonko and President Uhuru Kenyatta. The deal is however in turmoil as Sonko claims that he was blackmailed to sign the documents without understanding it. The deal saw Nairobi county handing four critical services to the national government.
