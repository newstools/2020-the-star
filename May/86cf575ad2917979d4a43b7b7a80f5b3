Catholic bishops have asked the National Health Insurance Fund to refund money owed to faith-based health providers. The health providers require the funds for the increased medical demands occasioned by Covid-19, the Kenya Conference of Catholic Bishops said in a statement read by Murang’a Diocese Bishop James Maria Wainaina. “We request the government to pay all genuine suppliers and providers so that they can continue providing the essential services. These funds will help the faith-based organisations deal with the increased demands of Covid-19,” Wainaina told Pentecost Sunday service at the Holy Family Basilica on Sunday. The KCCB also asked the government to waive taxes on essential tools for fighting  the pandemic. “We request that the government to waive taxes on sanitisers, PPEs and face masks to enable Kenyans easily maintain hygiene standards. In addition, we request that the government waive taxes on other medical products including ambulances.” The bishops supported the economic stimulus package announced last week by President Uhuru Kenyatta and urged Kenyans to adapt the new normal. “We have heard that the virus is here with us. We urge every one to learn new positive practices and live productive lives even at home,” the statement said. The service was attended by Nairobi  Archbishop John Cardinal Njue. Only a few priests, deacons and members of Zimmerman choir were present in conformity with the Health ministry's anti-Covid-19 containment measures.  - mwaniki fm
