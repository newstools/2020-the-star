Equip health facilities and pay workers well to win the war on Covid-19, Kilemi Mwiria has advised. He said if African nations had paid heed to former South African President Nelson Mandela to be self-reliant, we would not be quaking because of Covid-19. The President's adviser on education spoke at Machegene and Kaamu in Tigania West while distributing face masks, soap, food and sanitiser. Mwiria’s wife Sarah initiated the project. She marshalled her friends and fundraised Sh700,000 to buy the items. “This disease is an equaliser. It doesn’t recognise the rich from the poor, superpower countries from third world countries. I appeal to the President, the governors, MPs and other representatives to equip and raise the standards of at least two health facilities in their areas of jurisdiction,” Mwiria said. The former Tigania West MP praised the government for measures put in place to contain coronavirus, and cited the curfew. Mwiria said leaders have become their own enemies by refusing to develop their areas of jurisdiction. “We make health costly in our own country unlike the developed countries,” he said.
