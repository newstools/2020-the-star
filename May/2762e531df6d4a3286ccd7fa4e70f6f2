  Mwingi residents who have been lynching suspects will be arrested and charged with murder, police have said. Mwingi Central subcounty police commander Peter Mutuma on Saturday warned residents against taking the law into their hands and urged that suspects be handed over to the authorities. Last month, four lives were lynched in Mwingi town and its surroundings with many others injured after mob justice attacks. Mutuma said it was unfortunate that such cases were on the increase despite police warning. Three days ago, Rose Ndunda, a resident of Mboru near Mwingi town was woken up by a call from her daughter. The daughter reported that a goat was bleating in a a nearby thicket within their homestead. They suspected that a goat had been stolen from their homestead and screamed for help. Members of the public were alerted. A search was quickly mounted and suspect Stephen Mwangangi Mutemi was found with a goat in the thicket. He was rescued by police officers just before the mob lynched him. Mutuma said  thieves had taken advantage of reduced court activities. He warned residents against mob justice, saying police will probe the killings and arrest perpetrators. “Those taking law into their own hands will be investigated and charged with murder,” Mutuma said. He said police have intensified patrols in Mwingi to strengthen security.
