The CEO of Kenya National Commission for Unesco risks being jailed for removing one its programme directors from their payroll even after the court extended his contract. In March this year, John Omare, the programme director for culture at Knatcom for Unesco had gotten temporary orders stopping the company from replacing him and terminating his contract until his case was heard. However, Omare now claims that even though he served his employer with the court order he was not paid his salary and was allegedly removed from the payroll. “In total disregard of the court order Knatcom for Unesco has declined to pay the applicant salary and has not given him his payslip for the month of April,” reads court documents. He wants the court to summon the CEO Dr Evangeline Njoka to show cause why she should not be cited for contempt for disobeying court orders. Omare signed his contract in February 2016 and he argues that all this while he knew they would renew his contract but without any communication, in February this year the company advertised his position.
