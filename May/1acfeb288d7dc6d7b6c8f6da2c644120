A hotel manager in South Africa's North West province has told local eNCA news station that alcohol was the "main priority" of a group of robbers who raided his business at gunpoint. "First of all they requested access to the alcohol... and then they wanted access to the rooms to see what valuable items were in the rooms," Willie Kruger said. Alcohol sales are still banned under the lockdown in South Africa, which has been partially relaxed. CCTV footage broadcast by eNCA shows the criminals filling up a large bin with the contents of a fridge and then dragging it away. The robbery took place just after the night-time curfew began, the TV station reports.
