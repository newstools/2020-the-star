The Fairmont Norfolk has closed indefinitely following the effects of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. The company on Thursday said it could no longer operate as normal following the virus which struck the nation on March 13, 2020. Mehdi Morad, the country general manager, announced that the company cannot sustain its business and it will terminate its employee’s contract. “It is, therefore, the decision of the management to terminate the services of all its employees due to frustration by way of mutual separation and taking into account the loyalty and dedication the employees have put into the success of our company in the previous years,” Mehdi Morad said in a statement. The company has said its employees will receive their termination letters with the terms stipulated on June 5, 2020. At the same time, Fairmont Mara Safari Club will also be closed following the floods in the area. Several businesses have been badly affected by the virus. Recently, the government laid down directives to be followed by the restaurants and the eateries before reopening. Even after such directives, businesses are still at their knees and its future is unprecedented as virus cases in the country are skyrocketing. On Wednesday, the county announced that 123 people were confirmed positive for the disease in the previous 24 hours, the highest figure yet. The total number of cases in the country stood at 1,471 on Wednesday.
