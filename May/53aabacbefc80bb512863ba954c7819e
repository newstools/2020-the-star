A CMC Motors Meru branch employee was turned away from the Nanyuki office on Wednesday evening after it emerged that two of his colleagues had tested positive for the coronavirus. Multiple sources told the Star the employee had delivered a vehicle at the Nanyuki branch for repair. Employees and customers in Nanyuki hid inside the company’s workshop after the Meru staffer arrived with the vehicle. They were ordered to remain inside. “A phone call was made from our Meru branch that two employees had tested positive. Our colleague was ordered not to disembark from the vehicle and to go back,” an employee said in confidence. CMC regional manager Ben Kitenge declined to comment on the matter. Sources told the Star that a customer had delivered a vehicle for repair at Meru from Isiolo town and could be the one who spread the virus to CMC employees. The Star could not verify reports that all employees of the company in Meru were taken into quarantine and the branch ordered closed. “There is a process to source employees from other branches around the region to report to Meru branch so that work can go on,” another source said. The virus had by Wednesday infected 1,029 people around the country.  Edited by R.Wamochie
