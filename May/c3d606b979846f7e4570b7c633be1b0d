The government has locked down Eastleigh and Old Town as coronavirus cases surge. There will be no movement into and out of the areas effective Wednesday at 7pm for 15 days, Health CS Mutahi Kagwe said on Wednesday. "You cannot leave the area to go to another area. This will take place for 15 days," he said. Kagwe said that the residents are allowed to walk within the area, adding that, "We do not want to lock people in their houses." The Health CS said public transportation will also not be allowed to go to those areas. "This is to protect those within those areas. If you have a colleague in Eastleigh don’t let them come to stay with you if they have not taken a test," he said. "I request people to take responsibility." The CS also ordered that eateries in the areas remain closed during the lockdown. Kenya has recorded 47 new coronavirus cases bringing the number to 582 people. A total of 32 are from Mombasa, 11 from Nairobi. Two cases  were recorded in Busia, Kiambu had one and Kwale one. Kagwe on Wednesday said the cases in Mombasa are mainly in Old Town with 18 cases. Kagwe said 31 are male and 16 female. Another eight people have been discharged, bringing the total discharged to 190. Another two people have died. They are from Mombasa. This brings the number to 26. The government also said it will cater for the costs of quarantining patients in state facilities. "The cost of targeted testing and quarantine in government facilities shall be met by the government," Kagwe said on Wednesday. This is a relief to Kenyans who had complained about being asked to pay  quarantine costs.  The CS said it is not fair to expect police to focus their energy going after patrons of eateries instead of doing other important duties because they are flouting rules.
