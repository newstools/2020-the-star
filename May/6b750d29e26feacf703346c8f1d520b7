Covid 19 pandemic has turned able people into beggars because people are at home. l read with shock that the government has donated Sh38 million worth of sanitisers to boda boda operators. The sanitisers were handed to Boda Boda Safety Association. But there are very many riders in every county in Kenya. Their registration is according to the location or area stage in which they do business or stage.Â  Some riders are not in these groups or have just joined. In what form were the sanitisers given? And considering local leaders such as MCAs, MPs and governors are donating these sanitisers,why didn't the government give them fuel or food? The reality is that these riders lack business because their customers are at home. They used to be messengers for companies, shops and market traders, among others, who have also lost business. lt is surprising that the same government that ordered that sanitizers and handwashing water points be installed is now donating the same. This is duplication of efforts in the fight against Covid-19.
