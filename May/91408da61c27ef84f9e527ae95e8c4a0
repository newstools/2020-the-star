  President Uhuru Kenyatta's legacy and smooth end of his term in 2022 will depend on how he treats his deputy William Ruto, Kuria West MP Mathias Robi has said. Robi said if Uhuru is keen on finishing his two terms in peace and leave behind a great legacy, then the current mistreatment of the deputy president and division in the ruling Jubilee Party should end. Addressing the press in his rural home on Monday, Robi said Uhuru as the party leader has failed to create unity in Jubilee, which “is already completely dead.” “If Kenyatta wants to retire and end his two terms in peace and leave behind a legacy before 2022, then he should stop worshiping his handshake with Raila Odinga at our expense. I sense danger ahead,” Robi said. The MP said the President should remember Jubilee Party was formed with the support of several parties, while some people voted for him solely because of their love for Ruto which should not be taken for granted. The legislator said since the handshake, Jubilee legislators and members who voted and contributed their resources to campaigns have been sidelined in government with development stalling in their regions. “We voted and placed our resources knowing the President and his deputy will work together. Right now our sweat is enjoyed by Raila and his supporters as we don’t even see development for our people,” Robi said. He said it is hard to know who speaks on behalf of Kenya between Raila and Uhuru while “in Parliament, Senate and county assemblies Jubilee elected leaders are openly divided between Kenyatta and Ruto. “We have to be honest. As things are moving on in Jubilee Party and the country I see a major break up before long,” Robi said. He said the agreement by the Jubilee leadership to support Ruto for the presidency after Uhuru completes his term should be respected.  Edited by Henry Makori
