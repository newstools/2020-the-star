In the fight against Covid-19 in the country, Superfoam Limited on Thursday donated 30 high-density mattresses to the Kiambu County Fire Rescue Team. The Fire Brigade has allegedly been experiencing a shortage of mattresses which led to the sharing of mattresses amongst every two firefighters at each of their stations. Seeing it as a great risk following the country's Covid-19 situations, Superfoam saw the need to donate the mattresses to the institution to curb bed-sharing immediately. “Superfoam is very glad to hand over this donation to help curb the spread of the virus amongst our firefighter’s personnel. We wish for them to be adequately rested with social distancing precautions in place to ensure they are ready to combat any situation," Superfoam Ltd CEO Meeraj Shah said. "We are working on other similar initiatives set to provide support to our neighbouring community and to the nation at large during these tough times." Kiambu Governor, James Nyoro expressed his gratitude to the brand for their generosity and urged other well-wishers to join in the fight against the pandemic. “Kiambu County Government would like to express our sincere gratitude to Superfoam Limited for taking the initiative to support our fighters. This kind gesture will ensure the firefighters are protected from the risk of contracting Covid-19 and equally ensure the safety of our community in case of an emergency,” he said. “As a brand, We are guided by the service to our community virtues and during this pandemic, we are looking into all possible areas within our community where we could offer our help to curb the situation, both within and outside our organization. We are for the community and the community is for us," Sagar Shah, Superfoam Limited Production head said.
