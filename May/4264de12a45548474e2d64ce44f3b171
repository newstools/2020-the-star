The High Court will next week rule whether to release on bail a police officer charged with the murder of a man in Mathare slums in Nairobi county. Justice James Wakiaga fixed the ruling date for May 28 after hearing submissions by defence lawyer Geoffrey Omenke who is representing Constable Beckham Orwaru. The officer attached to Muthaiga police station has denied shooting Reuben Kiriinya, 26, during an operation to enforce the dusk curfew. Prosecution led by senior principal counsel Gikui Gichuhi alleges that on April 13, at Mathare 4 in Nairobi county, the accused murderedÂ  Kiriinya. In his submission for bail, Omenke urged the court to release his client saying Orwaru will comply with all the conditions as directed by the court. He told the court that the officer has suffered since he was arrested a month ago over the alleged murder. The lawyer said his client is not a flight risk as he is still serving as a police officer. Orwaru was arrested alongside police constable Joseph Mwendwa attached to Kamukunji police station and Harrison Mwanza, who owns the kiosk where Kiriinya was shot. They were chewing miraa at the kiosk at around 3 am when Kirinya was shot on the chest. He later succumbed to injuries. However, after investigations, detectives found no evidence to charge Mwendwa and Mwanza.  Edited by P.O
