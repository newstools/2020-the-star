National women’s hockey team coach Jacqueline Mwangi has assured youngsters that they are part of her plans for the upcoming African Cup of Nations qualifiers, which are currently on hold. The qualifiers were earlier set for Nairobi last week but Covid-19 has made it impossible for the competition to go on. Mwangi said she’s keen to build a team for the future and therefore, the need to elevate some of the Under-21 team players to the senior team. “All one needs to do is to train hard and prove that she deserves a place in the squad,” said Mwangi. “We have a lot of upcoming players who played in the Hockey 5-a-side tournament last year and we are thoroughly monitoring them. These budding players will surely play if they meet the required standards and show consistency,” she added. Mwangi, who was the assistant to Tom Olal for the Olympic qualifiers in South Africa, said the team is on course if their last performance in Stellenbosch is anything to go by. “Irrespective of the result, the girls played their hearts out against South Africa. It was a pointer for us that the future looks bright. With few integrations into the side, we can be a force to reckon with though we still have a long way to go. So far, so good as we continue rolling programs for the players,” she noted. Barbara Simiyu and Glennis Namasake both from Blazers were appointed as Mwangi’s assistants. She said the national team selection will be purely on merit. She said being affiliated to Blazers, which is her club, will count for nothing if a player can’t prove herself on the pitch. “Remember this is not a club affair and selection will be free and fair for everybody,” she added. She said the biggest beneficiary will be those who will be fit when things go back to normal. Kenya were to play Egypt, Burundi, Libya, Seychelles, Sudan, Tanzania and Uganda in the regional qualifiers.
