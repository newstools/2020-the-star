P-Square's former manager and elder brother Jude Okoye says he tried to unite the former Nigerian duo of identical twin brothers Peter Okoye and Paul Okoye. In an Instagram Live chat, Jude said P-Square’s split, which happened in 2017, was instigated by Peter Okoye, who had issues with him. He added that he had stepped aside as manager up to five times and had tried everything humanly possible to settle the dispute. “Peter has a problem with me. I have asked him several times what the problem is but he refused to say. How can I bring P-Square back when I’m the one they don’t want in the picture?" he said. “There is nothing humanly possible that someone can do that I haven’t done. I came to a point when I said even if it means sacrificing myself from the picture, no problem, let them both be. “Whether or not they come back should not be my business anymore. I was wanted out of the picture. I’m now out,” he said. According to earlier reports, the drama started after Peter married a woman from a different tribe. The Okoye family, who are Igbos, were not amused by Peter marrying a Yoruba girl, who they claim to be slightly older than him. Peter married Lola Omotayo, a Nigerian but of Russian descent.
