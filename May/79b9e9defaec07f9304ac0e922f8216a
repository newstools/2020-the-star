The Njuri Ncheke has appealed to President Uhuru Kenyatta to reopen churches and mosques because the coronavirus won't go away. Njuri Ncheke secretary general Josphat Murangiri said Interior CS Fred Matiang’i should gazette strict measures to guide congregations so worshippers can troop back to churches. The World Health Organization has declared that the virus will stay for months or years and urged countries to find ways of containing its spread. With the WHO advice, Murangiri said Kenyans should get ready to live with the virus and resume their daily activities even as they find effective ways to contain the spread of Covid-19. “The Ministry of Health and that of Interior should gazette procedures on how to reopen churches. Congregants are thirsty for spiritual nourishments and praying together. Kenya is a prayerful nation and we anticipate that opening churches will be a guide piloted towards how to open schools too,” Murangiri said. The Njuri Ncheke is the supreme council of elders from the Meru community. Murangiri asked the government to buy more equipment for the fight against the virus at the county levels, saying the disease has now spread to the regional units.
