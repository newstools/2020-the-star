Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru has distributed relief food to 3,200 families affected by floods. Most of the beneficiaries are from Kamuthanga village near Sagana and Marura in Kangai. Other vulnerable families hit hard by Covid-19 from Shauri Moyo and Maisha Kamili settlements also benefited. The governor said though the county is a major food basket, the rains have destroyed food crops and left many farmers desperate. “Most of these farmers may face starvation in a few months and will require assistance,” he said. Waiguru said her administration has been working closely with the national government to identify needy families for distribution of food rations. She said the food issuance programme will continue to ensure that vulnerable members of the community are taken care of. Last week, the governor flagged off relief food to benefit 2,750 households. She said the county government has received 1,500 bags of rice and 30 cartons of cooking oil from the national government to support the needy. The governor also distributed 15,000 masks produced by Kaitheri Apparel Factory, which is run by the county government. The masks were issued to boda boda operators and traders, with the governor announcing that production will continue until the pandemic is controlled. The county administration has also received 3,600 bottles of sanitiser from East African Breweries Ltd (EABL) to boost the fight against Covid-19. The sanitiser has been distributed to health facilities for use by health workers. Edited by A.N
