Kiambu MP Jude Njomo has launched a counselling programme for persons affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. Speaking in the constituency offices in Kiambu town on Thursday, Njomo said the programme was facilitated by Jude Njomo Foundation in conjunction with Kenya Institute of Business and Counseling Studies (KIBCO). It is a personal initiative after he received many calls from his constituents seeking help, he said. “We know that there are a lot of people who are undergoing difficulties during this time of Covid-19. Some are not able to fend for themselves or feed their families. Others were going to work everyday but today they are not going,” Njomo said. Njomo said some residents had turned to alcohol to get away from family problems but now that they are at home throughout problems escalate. Njomo said he had given out his office space to be a call centre where those in need will call hotlines. They are 0789808063 and 0792885401. He has a list of 50 counselors who have volunteered to help out. The MP said the hotlines are not limited to Kiambu people only but to all Kenyans in need. “ We are using hotlines so that we can solve people’s problems without physical contact. We will use technology to help out and where physical contact is needed we will make arrangements,” Njomo said. Prof Catherine Gachutha, the chief executive officer of KIBCO, said they offer mental health psychosocial support and have partnered with health practitioners to help those affected directly by Covid-19. “There are those that have coronavirus and are stigmatised as they are in isolation and are not allowed to come into contact with anyone. They are undergoing a lot of mental issues and we are reaching out to them as well as those who have recovered and are having a hard time being integrated into their families or community as people are afraid of them,” she said.
