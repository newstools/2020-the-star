Western Kenya will not blindly support the ongoing political realignments without first knowing ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi's position, Lurambi MP Titus Khamala has said. Khamala said Mudavadi must be consulted on behalf of the region about what its stake is in the unity government and future political arrangements. "We're seeing the ongoing arrangements but no one is talking about Mudavadi. They are consulting Gideon Moi, ODM's Raila Odinga and Kalonzo Musyoka. We are not opposed to the ongoing realignments but we want to tell them that we will not back them without Mudavadi on the table," the legislator said on the phone. "They should know that it will not be business as usual where they are used to fishing in an open pond, be it a referendum or the 2022 elections." The MP was making reference to last week's post-election deal between Jubilee and Kanu. ODM is said to be in the process of actualising a coalition deal with Jubilee in coming days. The realignment is a precursor to the much-touted national unity government President Uhuru Kenyatta plans to form to help him push his development agenda following the implosion of Jubilee. On Thursday, Khamala said Kenya cannot be led by antagonism but soberness. "Kenya needs a President whose agenda will be revival of the badly beaten economy like retired President Mwai Kibaki did," he said. Kakamega ANC youth leader Jeff Mwenje and Ikolomani party subbranch chairman Tony Maleche said the antagonism between the President and his deputy was unhealthy for the country. Maleche said Kenyans were going through hard times due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the leadership should focus on discussions to alleviate the suffering. Edited by Henry Makori
