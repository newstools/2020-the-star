 The High Court in Eldoret has certified as urgent a case in which a retired police officer has sued NHIF, Health CS Mutahi Kagwe and a Nandi hospital for negligence. Fredrick Egunza, 82, says he was denied treatment at Real Hospital in Kabarnet town despite being an NHIF cardholder. He says the hospital accepts the card and that it was listed with the National Hospital Insurance Fund as his preferred health facility. Egunza is suffering from diabetes and hypertension. He said he visited the hospital on March 17, and was attended to by a doctor who gave him prescriptions for drugs. But he was denied the medicines by a hospital administrator despite being an up to date NHIF cardholder which was to be used to pay for the drugs. He claimed the administrator told him to return for medication on March 27 despite the fact that his condition was worsening. Egunza said the act of the hospital put his life at risk given he is supposed to take drugs daily. He said he went to a nearby public hospital where he was given the same medicine to save his life which was in danger. The petitioner has sued NHIF together with the Ministry of Health for recommending the hospital to him yet the hospital neglected him at a critical moment when he needed the services. He said he was denied his constitutional right to good health services. “I almost died due to the negligence of this hospital. They ought to have treated my case as an emergency by using all available means to give me the medicines,” the petitioner says. He has accused the hospital of going against their oath of office to save life as an issue of first priority. Egunza filed his petition on May 13 before Eldoret High Court Judge Stephen Githinji who certified the application as urgent. The petitioner is seeking special compensation of Sh250,000 among other demands. The hospital has also submitted its response. The parties will be heard on July 1.  Edited by P.O
