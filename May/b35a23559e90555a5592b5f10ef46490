Kenya Cup clubs have proposed a deadline of October to complete the 2019-2020 season. Caucus chairman, Xavier Makuba, yesterday said should the season not end by then, then it should be called off. “October is the date the clubs have zeroed on and I believe it gives a couple of scenarios to look at. I am confident we should be able to play some rugby before then,” added Makuba. Makuba said the window gives both the union and the clubs adequate time to complete the season. “As a bare minimum, we have July, August and September and we can look at playing the Sevens at the same time. We, therefore, have time on our side,” noted Makuba. Makuba, who is also the KCB chairman, said the players will need a minimum of three weeks of pre-season to complete the league. “The players will adjust accordingly to the time frame given to complete the season,” he added. Some of the other proposals include the scrapping of the Enterprise Cup, Kenya’s oldest rugby competition to accommodate the end of the league season. Director of rugby, Thomas Odundo, acknowledged receipt of the proposals by the clubs and said that the union will harmonise with what they have. “We have received their proposals and we are looking at them as well as other scenarios to see the best way forward and complete the season,” he added. The former internationals decision on the way forward will be communicated early next week. The  2019-2020 season was first cancelled by KRU last month before the union made a turnaround to give room for consultations following protests from clubs and stakeholders. The season was stopped in mid-March following the first case of the pandemic reported in the country. The league was headed for the playoffs when it was halted due to coronavirus. Impala were set to host Mwamba while Homeboyz had been pitted against Menengai Oilers. Kabras top the standings with 74 points with champions KCB second on the log with 71 points.
