A 27-year-old pregnant woman was stabbed to death in Mutituni, Machakos county, on Saturday. The woman was stabbed in her chest with the suspect being her husband. The suspect who works as a waiter in a hotel in Mutituni, allegedly stabbed the woman and escaped. The motive behind the killing is not yet known. Ruth Mutinda, a neighbour, said she heard noise coming from the couple's house on Saturday morning. She said on going out to see what was happening, she found the woman's body lying on the ground in the compound and the husband had fled. Mutinda condemned the act and said the family of the suspect should perform a ritual 'to appease the gods who will keep on yearning for more blood if something will not be done'. She said Kamba traditions require a goat be slaughtered to make sure a similar incident is not repeated since it's a taboo to kill a pregnant woman. Jonah Munyao, the area MCA, visited the scene and condemned the act and urged the police to make sure justice is served. While confirming the case, Machakos county police commander Karanja Muiruri said they recovered a kitchen knife which was used to commit the act. He said investigations have commenced and urged the residents to remain calm. Police moved the body to Machakos Level 5 Hospital mortuary.
