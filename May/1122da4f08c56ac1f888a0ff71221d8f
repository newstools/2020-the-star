Kenya Basketball Federation (KBF) Premier League side Umoja have signed three players ahead of the season. Assistant coach Steve Kuta said the self-supporting club recruited the young talents during the close season and were all set for the league before coronavirus pandemic altered their plans. He said the new recruits including Wieu George, Ferdinand Otieno (guards) and forward Shema Nicolas have what it takes to turn the team’s fortunes around. Umoja, who failed to make it to the playoffs last year, have also welcomed back Jason Sakwa from the provincial side, PBC Eastgate. “We want to reach the second round of the play-off games. We intend to give our young talent a lot of playing time so that they adapt to the league quickly,” said Kuta. He said the team remain intact having not lost any player this time around. The recruits have been training and expect to gel with the rest. “Most of our players are training in isolation individually,” Kuta said, adding: “We have various training challenges which we post on our group.” He added: “We also host zoom meetings just to check up on each other and share experiences on how we are coping up with this situation.” Kuta said the club is more than just a basketball outfit. They also help each other out on all fronts when not engaged in the game.
