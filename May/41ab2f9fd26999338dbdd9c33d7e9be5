About 420 families affected by floods in Turkana have received food donations from the national government. Turkana county commissioner Boniface Muthama said the relief food will cushion the families from hunger. Muthama spoke during the distribution of rice and cooking oil to the flood victims in Napetet in Turkana Central. “All the victims will receive at least 25 kgs of rice and cooking oil to cushion them from hunger,” he said. Muthama said 11 people were killed by ravaging floods and 146 livestock belonging to pastoralists at Kanakurudio in Turkana North were swept away. The administrator advised residents living along the riparian areas to move to higher grounds to avoid being swept by floods. “We are still experiencing heavy rains. When it continues to pour, definitely the Turkwel Gorge Dam will overflow and those living along River Turkwel might be swept by the flooded river,” he said. Two weeks ago, the government had announced that the Turkwel Gorge and Masinga dams have filled to the maximum capacity. Overflow water will affect those along Garissa and Tana River, the government said. (edited by o. owino)
