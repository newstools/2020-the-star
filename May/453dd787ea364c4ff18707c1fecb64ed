A Makongeni police officer stoned by a curfew defaulted is in critical condition at the Metropolitan Hospital in Buruburu. Constable Peter Kamau's alleged assailant John Wahu appeared before a Makadara court but did not plead to any charges. Investigating officer Edward Nzaka told chief magistrate Emily Ominde that he needed to detain the suspect for four days to conclude investigations. Nzaka said that he has not recorded a statement from the victim who is being treated in the Intensive Care Unit. “Your honour, the officer sustained serious head injuries. He can’t speak. I am yet to file the P3 Form and to record a witness statement,” he said. He said that the officer was injured while enforcing the dusk to dawn curfew. The officer was on patrol near World Bank Houses next to Kenya Power Substation along Likoni road when was hit with a stone, lost control and fell down unconscious. Kamau bled profusely. He was later rushed to the hospital and Wahu was arrested. The suspect is awaiting either murder or attempted murder charges depending on the outcome of Kamau’s treatment. Ominde allowed police to detain the suspect and directed the matter to be mentioned on May 20. (edited by o. owino)
