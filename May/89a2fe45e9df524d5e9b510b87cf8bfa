Long queues of trucks have built up at the Uganda border as drivers wait to be tested for coronavirus. Previously 500 trucks a day could cross into Uganda but now it is only 50 trucks as drivers wait for their test results. This damages the economies of both Uganda and Kenya and a solution needs to be found quickly. The problem is that seven Kenyan and three Ugandan lorry drivers have tested positive. Drivers coming back from Tanzania have also tested positive. Clearly truck drivers need to be educated on how to stay safe - to use masks, regularly wash their hands and not touch their faces. But it becomes a risk in itself if the drivers have to wait two or three days for clearance at Busia or Malaba. East African governments should introduce a Covid-19 passport for long-distance truck drivers. The test costs Sh6,000 but governments should foot the bill because efficient economic integration is vital for the East African Community. There should be a new test for the passport before each journey. This will minimise the risk of a Covid-positive truck driver crossing borders.
