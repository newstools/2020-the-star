Former WCB labelmates Harmonize and Rich Mavoko could team up again under Konde Gang if the latter accepts an invite. They left Diamond's stable at different times after a disagreement with Diamond. Mavoko left the record in 2018 over contractual issues and even involved Basata (Barasa La Sanaa Tanzania) when things between him and the label got thick. Last year, Harmonize followed suit and because his contract had not ended, he was told to pay millions of shillings, which he revealed he was in the process of paying. Harmonize then started his record label, Konde Gang, and is inviting Mavoko to join him. In an interview with Clouds FM, Harmonize said he doesn’t mind signing the singer since he (Mavoko) was an inspiration to him in his upcoming days. “Rich is my brother and he is talented and if there is that opportunity to work with him, why not?” he said.
