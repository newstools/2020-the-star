Kisumu All Stars chief executive officer, Nicholas Ochieng, says the Football Kenya Federation should have waited until June to make a decision on the fate of the Kenya Premier League. “Why was the federation president (Nick Mwendwa) in a hurry to make a decision to cancel the entire season? As Kisumu All-Stars,  we are against the decision and I feel there is still time to conclude the remaining matches,” said Ochieng. Speaking yesterday morning, the CEO added: “The KPL Governing Council will meet and make a decision which will be communicated officially to FKF. I feel that if the situation will not change by June, then a decision can be taken but after consultations.” He said KPL is an independent body and have full mandate to decide the fate of the Kenya Premier League. “The federation should respect KPL,” he added. Ochieng further added that the Confederation of African Football (CAF) did not ask FKF to cancel the league but inquired about the current league situation, the number of remaining matches and strategies to conclude the games. “Even Caf have not cancelled their competitions. If the coronavirus containment restrictions are lifted by June, then we should resume the league and finish the remaining matches,” added Ochieng. Ochieng exuded confidence that the team will maintain their Kenya Premier League status. “The players are ready to resume the league and will seek to remain in the top tier league. They are currently training on their own and the coach is closely monitoring them,” he revealed. On Thursday, FKF CEO Barry Otieno said Kisumu All-Stars who are  16th on the log will play Vihiga United in the KPL/National Super League playoff. Vihiga United finished third in the NSL log while champions Nairobi City Stars and second-placed Bidco United gained direct promotion to the KPL. The decision by FKF has, however, caused an uproar with most KPL clubs rejecting it.
