A lobby group has called on the government to set aside a budget for the youth to help them combat problems faced due to Covid-19 pandemic. Many youth have lost jobs, while others are unable to work because of restrictions to contain the spread of the coronavirus. Dream Achievers Youth Organisation director Seif Jira called on stakeholders to join hands and help stop the spread of the virus. “This war against coronavirus requires a multifaceted approach, it is high time that we work together as stakeholders,” he told the Star on the phone. Meanwhile, Mombasa Youth leader Ibrahim Jey expressed concerns over the increasing numbers of Covid-19 cases. “It is sad to note that Mombasa county has been hitting the record as far as coronavirus is concerned. People believe when they see,” Jey said. He said that the county government has not done enough to sensitise the community on the virus. Many are still unaware of the virus and they are confused about its existence, he said. Coast Region Student’s Association secretary general Edwin Shamir urged the county government to focus on food distribution, especially in slum areas. “We want to see the government do something in slum areas. This is where the real pinch of the coronavirus is felt,” Shamir said. Shamir asked Governor Hassan Joho to open an alternative market for traders accused the county officers of harassment to traders. (edited by o. owino)
