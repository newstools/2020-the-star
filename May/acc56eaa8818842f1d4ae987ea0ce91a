Health ministry acting director general Patrick Amoth said those taking care of patients who have died of coronavirus are at a high risk of infection. "Those who take care of them are at a high risk of acquiring the infection. Ensure that if you feel unwell, call 719 quickly," he said on Thursday. Kenya on Thursday recorded three more deaths raising the number to 29. On Wednesday there were two deaths. Amoth said the two deaths recorded on Wednesday in Mombasa both died at home. Then we have three deaths today, out of which one died from home in Eastleigh. "Deaths at the community level are a real concern to us, it is a sign of intense community transmission of the disease," Amoth said. He further noted that the critical patient on a ventilator is off the machine now. "Four others on supplemental oxygen are doing well and will be weaned off progressively to see how they will respond," he said. Kenya has recorded 25 more people who have tested positive for coronavirus disease, bringing the total to 607. CAS Rashid Aman on Thursday said they tested 632 samples in 24 hours. From this, 22 are Kenyans, one Ugandan, one Tanzanian and one Chinese. A total of 21 are male and four are female. He said that 17 are from Nairobi, two Wajir, two Kajiado and one each from Migori, Mombasa and Isiolo counties. This marks the first case in Isiolo. Aman said Eastleigh is leading with nine cases.
