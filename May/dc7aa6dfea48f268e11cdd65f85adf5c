Three people died on the spot while eight others suffered multiple injuries in an accident involving a staff bus and a 14-seater matatu along the Nairobi-Mombasa highway. Athi River subcounty police commander Catherine Ringera confirmed the accident which occurred around Konza City on Wednesday evening, a few kilometres from Kyumbi Junction. She said the accident occurred when the Konza staff bus “took a careless turn” to a nearby petrol station and collided head-on with the matatu belonging to Chania Executive Cool Company. It was going to Makueni county from Kibwezi. "The matatu was ferrying eight passengers before the crash that killed three," Ringera said adding that the bus did not have any passengers. It is alleged that the drivers were trying to beat the curfew. Those injured were rushed to Machakos Level 5 Hospital while the three bodies were moved to the hospital’s mortuary. The OCPD warned drivers to be extra careful and follow traffic rules. "You don't have to rush home and kill innocent people. If you are in a place where you cannot reach your residential area before the curfew hours, stay where you are and travel the following day instead of heading to the mortuary," she said.
