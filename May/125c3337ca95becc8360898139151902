The government has bought a new ferry to allow for adequate social distancing for residents crossing the Likoni Channel. Transport CS Jamas Macharia said on Wednesday said, "Social distancing has been one of the key interventions. We have now introduced a brand new ferry which will be commissioned tomorrow." The CS said the new ferry arrived in Kenya on April 25 and will be launched on Thursday. He said there will be no more excuses from the residents as to why they do not observe social distancing. At the same time, the CS said the government has put in place measures to ensure about 350,000 jobs in the horticulture are safeguarded. He said the government has boosted the export of horticultural produce by approaching 12 other airlines to compliment two freighters owned by Kenya Airways. "We are discussing how this additional capacity will be implemented through these additional 12 airlines which we have agreed will supplement in terms of airlifting the cargo," the CS said. Macharia added that all truck drivers are required to be tested before moving to neighbouring countries. Truck drivers entering the country will be required to provide certificates indicating that they have been tested. "Truck drivers must also produce a Covid-19 certificate before they are allowed to come in and go out of our border," Macharia said.
