Matuga boda boda operators have been warned against violating Covid-19 rules and flouting the ban on movement out of Kwale county. Matuga subcounty police boss Francis Nguli said the riders have become notorious for bending public health directives. Nguli cautioned that the government will take more stringent actions against them. “The disease doesn’t care who is innocent, it will wipe us all if carelessly treated. We won’t sit back and watch you risk lives,” he said at the weekend in an interview. The officer revealed that many of the riders do not observe the one-passenger rule and the use of face masks. He said their motorbikes will be impounded and that both passenger and rider risk a jail term when caught. “You won't like it when we catch you because those bikes will be seized and each one of you will be charged individually in court," he said. Nguli said they will launch an operation to hunt all those flouting regulations in all subcounties. He said people have no excuse not to follow orders “after the government has done its best to cushion them from the effects of the coronavirus". He said free face masks, sanitiser and relief food have been provided by the government. The OCPD added that jobs for the youth have also been created. Nguli warned that any senior official who contravenes the laid down Covid-19 regulations will be punished. Matuga boda boda chairman Juma Gamtoni promised that his colleagues will change and offenders must be used as examples. Edited by R.Wamochie
