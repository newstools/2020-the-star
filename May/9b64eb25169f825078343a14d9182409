Residents of a Naivasha village are in mourning after a 10-year-old girl slipped and drowned in River Malewa while collecting firewood. The Standard 4 pupil had accompanied her friends in DTI village when she accidentally fell into the river. Efforts by residents to rescue her were unsuccessful as the river is swollen following heavy rains. The incident occurred a few metres from where another child fell and drowned while playing with his friends a few months ago. Elder Peter Kuria said water levels in the river that drains in Lake Naivasha have risen sharply in the last two months. Kuria said the girl’s friends sought help but it came too late “By the time members of the public arrived it was too late and it was raining heavily making it hard to rescue the minor,” he said. Naivasha OCPD Samuel Waweru said the body has been retrieved and taken to the mortuary. “We are asking members of the public to be cautious while passing near rivers or dams,” he said. Meanwhile, the woman who tested positive for the coronavirus in Naivasha has recovered a week after she was admitted to Naivasha Subcounty Hospital. She, however, has to undergo a second test before she is released from hospital. The patient was picked along the Nairobi-Nakuru highway on Sunday on her way back to Nairobi from Vihiga where she had attended a burial. She was placed in an isolation ward at the subcounty hospital. A medic at the facility, who is not authorised to speak to the press, said the woman has recovered and is in high spirits. “We sent the first sample and it has returned negative. We shall send another in a couple of days before deciding if it’s safe to release her.” Edited by R.Wamochie
