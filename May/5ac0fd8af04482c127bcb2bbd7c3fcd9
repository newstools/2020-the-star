Nairobi City Stars' defender Tedian Esilaba is relishing a chance to partner Abdalla Salim aka Shitu at the heart of the team’s defence. “It will be a Berlin Wall when the day comes,” said the centre back who joined the newly promoted Kenya Premier League side in January transfer window from Fortune Sacco. Shitu has been partnering with Wycliffe Otieno this season but Esilaba is confident he will break the partnership soon. “I am really looking forward to that day. The chemistry between me and Shitu is on another level. We really understand each other,” he told the club’s website. “Then the qualities we share also says it all. We are both ballplayers on one on one situations and we are also scoring defenders,” he emphasized. “We played together back in the days when I was on trials at AFC Leopards. We partnered in all friendly matches with him,” added Esilaba. Prior to arriving at Fortune Sacco, Esilaba was at Bidco United, a club he joined from Vihiga United. City Stars, popularly known as 'Simba wa Nairobi' gained promotion to the KPL after five seasons in the second-tier league. The promotion came following the premature end of the league with 26 games played and ten matches pending. City Stars garnered 43 points from 13 wins and four draws and had a seven-point buffer over second-placed Bidco United, who have also been promoted. Vihiga United beat Nairobi Stima to playoff third place on goal difference and will go on to played team number 16 in the Kenyan Premier League (Kisumu All-Stars) over two legs for a chance for a quick return to the Premier League.
