Movement from Kakamega to Bungoma and Busia counties has been disrupted after water gushing out of River Nzoia damaged parts of the road at Shibale bridge. The road is the major highway connecting the three counties. Following heavy rains upstream, the raging water ate into more than half of the road, making it impossible for motorists to use the bridge. On Monday, police officers cordoned off the area to prevent access by hundreds of travellers who were stranded on both sides of the bridge, as some residents threatened to cross despite the glaring dangers. Kenya National Highways Authority officials spent the better part of Monday assessing the damage. Mumias West deputy county commissioner Peter Thiong’o urged motorists to use alternative routes as repair works get underway. “We are carrying out an assessment of the bridge at large and at the moment we are advising motorists and pedestrians to use other alternative roads,” he said. The nearest route to both sides is the Mumias-Indagalasia-Ogalo murram road that is in poor condition. It is not maintained and also has another risky bridge, which is nearly impassable when it rains heavily. Most Mayoni and Matungu residents were trapped at Shibale just two kilometres across and had to use a 30km alternative route. "I work in Mumias and live at Mayoni. It will be hard for me to be using an alternative route of 30 kilometres from the daily two kilometres I'm used to,” Mary Oresi said. Musa Bilal said, "The government should be on the ground already and even the army [soldiers] should be deployed to repair the road and help ensure movement on this busy highway is restored faster." Since last week, the floodwaters have displaced families living near the river. More than 20 families have left their homes and now camp at Shibale Primary School. Victims are from Matungu and Mumias West.  (Edited by F'Orieny)
