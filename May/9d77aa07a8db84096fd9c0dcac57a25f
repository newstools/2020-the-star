Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang'ula's brother, Anthony Waswa, was on Wednesday laid to rest at his Mukhweya home. Crowds were kept away from the burial, which was carried out under tight security and concluded in under an hour. People wearing hazmat suits carried the coffin, wrapped in plastic bags, to Waswa's final resting place. Waswa, 48, died at the Aga Khan University Hosipital in Nairobi last week. Waswa was the personal assistant to his brother and Westlands MP Tim Wanyonyi. Among those who attended the burial were Bungoma Woman Representative Catherine Wambilianga, Sirisia MP John Waluke, Wanyonyi and Bungoma Deputy Governor Charles Ngome. Others were Kwanza MP Ferdinand Wanyonyi and Trans Nzoia Woman Representative Janet Nangabo.
