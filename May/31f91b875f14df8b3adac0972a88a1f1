Seven former employees of the Geothermal Development Company have been handed a lifeline after the Supreme Court suspended their prosecution for alleged corruption. The court on Thursday determined that Peer Ayodo Omenda, Nicholus Weke, Caleb Mbaye, Abraham Saat, Michael Mbevi, Godwin Magae and Bruno Linyuri, who were members of the GDC tender committee, had demonstrated an arguable case. They were in 2015 charged with failure to comply with the law relating to procurement in connection with a tender for the provision of rigs for the Menengai geothermal project. The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission accused them of inflating the rig movement charges from Sh15 million to Sh42 million per rig, a total of Sh1.7 billion in one year without following tender regulations.. They challenged their prosecution before Justice George Odunga of the High Court, who after hearing barred the Director of Public Prosecutions from proceeding with the case. The EACC successfully appealed the decision and the appellate court found that Odunga had not exercised his discretion correctly. His ruling was subsequently set aside. The GDC moved to the apex court, citing constitutional grievances. Supreme Court judges David Maraga, Philomena Mwilu, Mohamed Ibrahim, Smokin Wanjala and Isaac Lenaola concurred with the ex-employees that the decision of the appellate court will subject them to a criminal trial. The judges said this will violate their constitutional rights to fair trial and equal benefits and protection of the law, moreso, as set out in the petition of appeal. “We allow the application. The decision of the Appeal Court delivered in September 2019 is stayed pending hearing and determination of the appeal,” they said.  - mwaniki fm
