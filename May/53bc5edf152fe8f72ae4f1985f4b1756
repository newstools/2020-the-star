@robertomollo3  More than 2,500 vulnerable families living in Homa Bay town slums have received relief food from the county secretary Isaiah Ogwe's Food Mashinani programme. The door-to-door distribution of the food was conducted in Makongeni, Sofia, Koginga, Kotieno, Mbuni, Shauri Yako, Got Rabuor and Koduogo slums. “Covid-19 pandemic has come with several challenges to many people. It’s important to join hands and assist residents who are hard hit to help them overcome these challenges,” Ogwe said. He was speaking on Saturday when they distributed beans and maize. The programme's leader Michael Okuthe said most beneficiaries were widows. Okuthe identified youths were tasked with distribution to avoid overcrowding. “The team is on the ground to deliver the already packed food to the identified families.  We hope the initiative would cushion the less fortunate families and help them put food on the table,” Okuthe said. The initiative uses Ogwe's personal funds and contributions from his friends. He said they will extend the programme in already marked areas in Ndhiwa, Rangwe and Karachuonyo constituencies. Okuthe said they were also giving soaps and masks to elderly persons and the disabled. The category of the people targeted cannot afford basic needs because they are either not working or the people they depend on have had their businesses affected by the Covid-19 interruptions. “The beneficiaries depend on others for basic needs. Many people in the jua kali sector have also been adversely affected by the virus.” Beneficiaries Mary Abich and Philgona Atieno said they are facing hardships due to the pandemic. Abich said she and two orphans used to have three meals a day but since only eat a meal a day since the outbreak of coronavirus. “I have been having food rations in my family since the pandemic began. The donation I have received will help my family eat what they have been missing for a long time,” she said.  Edited by P.O
