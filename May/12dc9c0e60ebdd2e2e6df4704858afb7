AFC Leopards have said plans to retain their striker Elvis Rupia are at an advanced stage. The burly forward's short term contract with the club ended last month but according to chairman Dan Shikanda, his office is keen to hand the player a lengthy stay at the club. Shikanda said he has already swung into action and launched negotiations with the former Nzoia Sugar man following recommendations from the Anthony Kimani-led technical bench. Rupia joined the den in January from Wazito. Prior to his Wazito sojourn, Rupia plied his trade with Zambian side Power Dynamos. The former Kenyan international disclosed that the cessation of movement imposed on Nairobi had locked the striker upcountry hence blocking him from finalising the negotiations and signing the new deal. Rupia confirmed that he had received another offer elsewhere but was hopeful of either extending his stay at Leopards or finding a new home. “The technical bench has asked us to retain him by all means and we have negotiated with him and agreed on everything. He would have already put pen on paper had it not been the cessation of movement which has locked him upcountry . Once the restrictions are lessened and he is back in Nairobi, we will finalise everything and tie him down to a lengthy contract,” he said. Shikanda in the meantime said he would not stand in Rupia's way should other teams offer him a better package. He downplayed the use of online to tie down the striker ahead of any other interested clubs, saying he preferred the traditional and physical way of unveiling new players. “Our policy is clear! We do not block or frustrate players when they get better offers elsewhere. The door is always open for players to advance their careers in other countries. If he has a better offer elsewhere then we will have to look for another striker. We would have wanted him to sign the contract online but we want him to do it physically and in the presence of the media,” he added.
