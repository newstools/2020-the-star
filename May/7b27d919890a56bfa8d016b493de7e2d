Fourteen families in Githunguri subcounty are calling for help from national and county governments after water seeped from the ground and flooded their homes. The families from Mitahato village said they reported the matter to the authorities but no aid has come their way. The water from the ground has formed a mini lake and spread over seven acres. “It started like a spring before it flooded our houses within two weeks,” resident Peter Njuguna said. Resident Veronica Njambi said the area has never flooded, and they were shocked by the occurrence. “We lost animals and crops as we could not save them. Now we are homeless, and we are forced to seek refuge in well-wishers houses,” she said. Residents said the water could cause more destruction since it is increasing by the day. They said they dug trenches to channel the water into a river over 10 kilometres away, making roads in the area impassable. “We had to find ways of redirecting the water before it wreaks more havoc," James Karanja said. He said they fear contracting waterborne diseases because the cemetery in the area has also been covered by water. Edited by A.N
