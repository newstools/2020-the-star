Amendments to the Retirement Benefits Act to cushion Kenyans against the effect of Covid-19 are unlawful and should be halted, activist Okiya Omtatah has said. The government had proposed changes to the law to allow the use of retirement benefits to buy a residential house. Omtatah said in a petition to the courts that the amendments were not in the Bill and were never considered and passed by Parliament. The activist said that given that the Tax Laws (Amendment) Act, 2020 was enacted to address the challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic, it was irregular to change the law to support the state's housing plan. President Uhuru Kenyatta on April 25 said the changes to the RBA Act were to increase homeownership in the housing pillar of the Big Four agenda. But Omtatah says that since Section 38 of the Retirement Benefits Act imposes restrictions on the use of scheme funds, any amendments must involve public participation. He reiterates that the far-reaching amendments were not in the Tax Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2020 which was subjected to due process for enacting legislation, including public participation. “There is no record anywhere, including in the Hansard reports, of the National Assembly having proposed, considered, and approved, under the Bill it passed on April 22, 2020, any amendments to the Retirement Benefits Act,” Omtatah says. He says there might be third parties with ulterior motives who sneaked in the amendments for their benefit to bypass Parliament. (edited by o. owino)
