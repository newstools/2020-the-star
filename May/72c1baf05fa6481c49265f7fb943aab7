Kenya has confirmed 28 new cases of Covid-19, raising the total to 649. Health CAS Rashid Aman on Saturday said 1,611  samples were tested in the last 24 hours. The government has so far tested 31,041 samples. Of the new cases,  24 are Kenyans, while four are Tanzanians. Meanwhile, five more people have been discharged after recovering from the virus, raising the number to 207. On a sad note, one more patient - from Mombasa - succumbed to the virus, bringing the number of deaths to 30. Out of the 28 new cases, 17 are male while 11 are female. Ten were from Mombasa, nine from Nairobi, four from Migori and two from Kajiado. Cases in Machakos increased from one to two, while Kiambu and Homa Bay had one case each. Aman urged Kenyans to observe social distancing, wear masks and stay at home. The government raised concerns that Nairobi residents have started going back to their normal business even as more cases are being reported. Aman asked Eastleigh and Old Town residents in Mombasa to observe the measures put in place in order to reduce the spread of the virus. The government put Eastleigh and Old Town on lockdown following high number of positive cases reported. He added that the government has prohibited hawking, gatherings of whatever nature, and ordered continued closure of markets, eateries, and malls in Eastleigh and Old Town. At the same time, the CAS said restaurants and eateries that open their businesses without observing state guidelines will face the law. "All requirements must be met before restaurants can go back to business. The facility must be inspected by a health officer before the business can resume. Protocols and measures to be met are on the Ministry of Health website," Aman said. On Friday, the country had 14 cases collected from 922 samples where 10 of the new cases were from Nairobi, three are from Mombasa and one is from Machakos.
