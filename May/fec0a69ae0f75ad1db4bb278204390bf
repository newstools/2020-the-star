The Kenya 15’s technical bench has come up with a coaching and management manual to help clubs once normalcy resumes following the coronavirus pandemic. The manual covers strength and conditioning, medical, mental skills, defence, attack, forward play, backline play and general skills. They are also working towards including match officials’ section. Paul Odera said he intends to use the manual for the duration of his tenure as Simbas’ head coach. “It is important that we keep reviewing it constantly so that it evolves and adapts not only to our Kenyan environment but also to the international demands as well,” added Odera The former Kenyan international said the country lacks a distinctive style of play as compared to the powerhouses like world champions South Africa, New Zealand, England Australia and France. “Our style needs to incorporate our racial, ethnic and social diversity. It needs also to recognise the limited resources we have and maximise on our physical athletic ability,” he added. Simbas had started their training in early March ahead of the international calendar but were immediately halted after the government’s ban on all sporting events due to the pandemic. The Simbas were due to play Morocco, Uganda and Zimbabwe in the Africa Championships but the tournament has been postponed. The Simbas came very close to qualifying for the 2015 Rugby World Cup but lost to Namibia in a frantic finish. For the 2019 edition, the Simbas finished second to Namibia in the African qualifier but performed dismally at the repechage, losing to Canada, Hong Kong and Germany.
