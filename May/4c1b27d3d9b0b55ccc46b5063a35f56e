Nine people accused of breaking Ministry of Health measures to curb the spread of Covid-19 have been charged at Nyando law courts in Kisumu. Christopher Odhiambo, Gabi Dennis, Josiah Otieno, Tobia Onyango, Felix Odhiambo, Vincent Otieno, Jack Otieno, Shem Otieno and Wilson Omollo were charged with unlawfully not wearing masks in public or incorrectly wearing them, hence putting the lives of citizens at risk. They all pleaded guilty before senior resident Reuben Sang and were released on Sh1,000 fine. While responding to the outbreak of Covid-19 cases recorded in the country, the Ministry of Health issued guidelines to combat its spread. They include handwashing with water and soap, sanitising hands, social distancing and wearing a face mask in public places. Most of the suspects were nabbed on May 16 at Katito, Sondu and Masogo townships within Nyakach and Nyando subcounties. One told the court that he was wearing a mask but that being a rider, the mask had slipped off its position. “I had a mask which was loose because I was riding a bicycle, the mask then hung on my neck,” he said. He said, however, that he was willing to do a day’s manual work within the compound as ordered by the court. Jack Otieno told the court that he was sent to buy mask but was intercepted by police and arrested, adding that the fine was too high. Two of the suspects managed to raise Sh500 for bail each after the magistrate Sang halved the initial fine. The rest were supplied with slashers and jembes to work for a day as ordered by the court.
