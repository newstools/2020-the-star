Senate Majority Leader Samuel Poghisio flashed back to his dark days with the independence party, Kanu, that saw him once expelled as an MP in record time. The West Pokot senator said during the sixth Parliament, when the country was a single party democracy, “I was an MP in the morning and by 4'oclock I was a stranger in the House." “ I was lucky to have been elected a member of the sixh Parliament. That day my party sat in this old chamber and I went out to have tea at 4'Oclock it was announced to me that I was a stranger in Parliament,” Poghisio said. The Senator spokeon Friday  as he made his contributions in the Senate in support of a motion to impeach Deputy Speaker Kithure Kindiki. Kindiki was voted out by a majority of 54 senators against seven. Pogisio reminded Kindiki that when he was kicked out of Kanu then, he did not harbour any grudge and went on to do other things. “I considered that the greatest thing that happened to me because I went on to do other things and I found my way back to this House later,” Poghisio said. Poghisio said that the decision to oust Kindiki was part of the Jubilee party's decision to strengthen the party and was nothing personal. “In my longest history in politics, I have seen the role the part can play to determine whether you move forward, backward, sideways or drop out completely,” he said, adding that Kindiki should not take his removal personal. The West Pokot lawmaker, however, warned Kindiki against being misled by some politicians that one can disrespect a party leader and then continue to enjoy party benefits. “One has said that it doesn't matter whether you respect your party leader or not, those are the same people who will put you in a lot of trouble,” he cautioned Kindiki. He said even those who will vote for his removal will still remain his great friends.
