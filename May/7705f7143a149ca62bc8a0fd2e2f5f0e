More than 200 women from Mwingi North and Mwingi Central have been given sanitary towels, masks, soap, sanitiser and handwashing units. The drive, spearheaded by the Centre for Human Rights and Civic Education and Action Aid, is aimed at reaching out to women in rural areas who have been adversely affected by the pandemic. Mary Muthini, a resident from Ngaaie in Mwingi North, said they are facing challenges because they can no longer attend table-banking meetings after the government banned gatherings. “We depended on borrowing from our savings to do our small businesses then return the money with interest but since the coronavirus struck, we have been unable to meet,” she said. Kitondo Muli, another resident, said she has been forced to close her hotel as most people are staying away from eateries. She said times are hard, especially for breadwinners. “My son who worked as a casual labourer in one of the firms in Nairobi, came home over a month ago after the cases started increasing there and their company directed them to stay home. He does not know when they will resume work,”  Kitondo said. Mulewa Ngoki said her biggest worry is that churches have remained closed for more than six weeks now. She hopes the wave will pass. Christine Kalikanda, who works with CHRCE, urged the Kitui government to reach out to women in remote parts of the county who are suffering silently. Edited by A.N
