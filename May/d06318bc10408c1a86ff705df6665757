This year’s Madaraka Day celebrations will be unique due to Covid-19. Interior PS Karanja Kibicho said on Tuesday the government had put in place mechanisms for virtual celebrations of Madaraka Day from State House, Nairobi. The June 1 celebrations will start at 8am and will culminate in the live address by President Uhuru Kenyatta. The government said the step had been taken in order to observe the measures given by the Ministry of Health to curb further spread of the virus. The 57th national celebrations will be streamed through all local media houses and also through online platforms. He said, "Madaraka Day celebrations will be packed with entertainment and documentaries that highlight this great nation’s culture and development milestones." Kisii county had been scheduled to host Madaraka Day celebrations before the virus struck the nation. Governor James Ongwae had said his administration was making final touches to the Gusii stadium for the celebrations. Major roads and streets in Kisii town were to be recarpeted and street lighting improved.
