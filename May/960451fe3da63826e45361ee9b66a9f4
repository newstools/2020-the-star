The government is expected to hire 870 additional doctors across three cadres to handle the over 500 Covid-19 cases in the country. Additional medics should include medical doctors, pharmacists and dentists. The Kenya Medical Practitioners Pharmacists and Dentists’ Union also projected that the country will need an additional 2,570 medics to handle 1,000 patients if the cases continue to rise. The union came up with the projections of human resource needs based on the number of expected cases. Doctors on Wednesday said they submitted a database of unemployed doctors to the ministry a month ago. They have expressed concerns that despite the directive that required the hiring of additional health workers, the process is yet to be finalised. “We urge the ministry to immediately employ these doctors. KMPDU notes that the number of cases will continue to rise as we adopt targeted community testing,” Ag secretary general Chibanzi Mwachonda said. The union also said it is only through the creation of a Health Service Commission that the management of human resources for health would be centralised and standardised. Mwachonda said having such a commission in place would help sort out human resources matters, improve health service provision and prepare Kenya for future epidemics. The union expressed concerns over the shortage of PPE kits for health workers. Officials said their members are still exposed and if the trend continues, there will be no health workers left to attend to patients in health facilities.  Edited by A.N
