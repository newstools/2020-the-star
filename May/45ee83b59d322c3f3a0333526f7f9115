The body of a 22-year-old who drowned in the Kathita River near the Giantune area was retrieved on Friday. The deceased, only identified as Jesse, drowned on Monday after trying to cross the river on a motorbike. Eyewitnesses said he ignored their pleas not to cross. The river swelled following downpours. North Imenti MP Rahim Dawood visited the scene and mobilised the youth to search for the body. Firefighters and police from Meru arrived at the scene and helped pull it out on Friday afternoon. It was trapped in the middle of the river. “The body was found at Njuki Njiru area near Nkabune,” Dawood said. He urged the national government and county disaster management teams to hire divers to help during rescue and recovery missions. The lawmaker said the constituency has been affected by floods and two people had already died after being swept away while crossing rivers. The MP appealed to residents to avoid rivers and flooded areas during rainy seasons. Three bridges have also been swept away. "Nchaure–Ambira near Mulathankari, Thuura bridge and Gitebe-Gachiege bridges have been swept away,” he said. On the coronavirus crisis, he urged residents and leaders to join hands to defeat the scourge. He said the county Covid-19 committee should be advised on the best ways to deal with the disease. "I want to put up booths in Meru town and I do not want them demolished, so I have written to Meru county executive in charge of Health Misheck Mutuma,” he said.
