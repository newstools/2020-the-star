It is double tragedy for flood victims in Lamu county who have been warned of attacks hippos, crocodiles and snakes as heavy rains continue. The Kenya Wildlife Service has said herds of hippos, crocodiles and poisonous snakes are likely to be displaced and invade residential areas. In Lamu, over seven villages in Witu division, Lamu West, have been affected by the floods, with many residents reporting having spotted hippos, crocodiles and cobras in their areas. Speaking in Lamu on Friday, Lamu’s KWS senior warden Mathias Mwavita said his office had received reports of the dangerous sightings and is making arrangements to trace the animals and have them removed from residential areas. The animals are believed to have been washed in from their habitat in River Tana. This poses a serious safety threat, with locals urging KWS to move with speed and have them removed from residential areas. Mwavita warned children and locals against swimming and fishing in flooded ponds, lakes, dams, rivers and other water bodies as they could easily be attacked by the animals. "Floods have caused a lot suffering and unfortunately, that includes wild animals that are also finding themselves in human habitats. We need to be vigilant to stay safe." "Keep away from all water bodies as they are possibly hiding there. We have, however, deployed officers to help the affected villages,” Mwavita said. Women have also been asked to desist from washing clothes in rivers and ponds. Mwavita also asked locals to avoid putting up houses and homes closer to  water areas because it makes them easy targets. “Many of these problems are created by us. People have encroached into wildlife reserves and set up homes without thinking about where these animals will go. Even as we help you, stop inviting trouble and obey the law,” Mwavita said.
