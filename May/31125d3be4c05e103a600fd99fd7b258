Uganda’s long-serving President Yoweri Museveni has said it would be wrong to hold a presidential election due early next year if the coronavirus persists, signalling for the first time a possible postponement. “To have elections when the virus is still there... It will be madness,” the 75-year-old Museveni, whom opponents cast as an authoritarian clinging to power, said in an interview with the local NBS Television aired late on Monday. Uganda has recorded a relatively low case load of the COVID-19 disease: 121 infections and no deaths. The Government begun easing a strict national lockdown a few days ago. Though no date had been fixed for the 2021 election, it is typically held in February. In power since 1986, Museveni–a former rebel fighter –has not confirmed whether he would run again.
