Some 700 sanitation stations will be set up countrywide thanks to a partnership between Stanbic Bank’s flagship women’s proposition Dada and Rotary District 9212. The deal was unveiled on Wednesday as the Sh3 million stations were handed over to Rotary's Emergency Response Team at Four Points by Sheraton Hotel in Nairobi. Stanbic head of business banking Tom Bisonga said, “The sanitation stations will play a significant role in stopping the spread of the dangerous coronavirus.”
