The government on Thursday distributed 750 bags of rice donated by the Chinese government to 1,125 families affected by floods in Migori county. In North Kanyamkago ward, Uriri constituency, 100 families benefitted from 200 bags of rice and in Nyatike constituency, 1,025 families shared 550 bags. “Most Kenyans affected by floods have been ignored by the government, which has concentrated on the fight against floods. We need the country to declare floods a national disaster,” Uriri MP Mark Nyamita told the Star on the phone on Friday. He said the distribution covered Kamgundho, Komenya and Katieno villages, where several families were left homeless after River Kuja burst its banks. “We have several families still displaced, crops swept away and roads destroyed by floods. We will need more food distribution,” Nyamita said. Nyatike subcounty commissioner Solomon Komen said Kabuto, Angugo, Modi, Sagama and Nyora villagers also received donations. “We helped in mapping out victims through Nyumba Kumi elders, chiefs and their assistants. The contribution will go along way in aiding those affected,” he said. Earlier, Komen said, “The government also gave Sh5,400 cash to cushion over 400 families in affected areas, more food is in the pipeline.”
