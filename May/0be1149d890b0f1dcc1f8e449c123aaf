Ninety people have been charged with different counts of Covid-19 related offences at the Moi International Sports Center Kasarani. All offences related to Covid-19 were moved to the Kasarani Stadium arena in a bid to avoid congestion in court. Chief Magistrate Martha Mutuku and Senior Resident Magistrate Zainab Abdul handled all the matters. Offenders were fined Sh5,000 each, but those unable to pay were committed to community service. State Counsels Joseph Riungu and Jacinta Nyamosi represented the DPP in the cases. Riungu and Nyamosi alongside other court officials coordinated the setting up of the court in the stadium. Some the charges include driving past the curfew time and loitering. According to the officials, the stadium was fumigated on Thursday morning in preparedness for the court sessions. The court and the accused persons have agreed that those who will not be able to pay their fines will be given community service orders to be supervised by probation officers. Riungu said those who will manage to pay the fine will be released and go home while the rest will do community service and then be released.
