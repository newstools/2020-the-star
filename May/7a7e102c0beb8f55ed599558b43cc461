Police in Machakos are looking for a man accused of killing his estranged wife on Tuesday. Mutisya Mbatha from Kaewa in Kathiani subcounty allegedly beat his wife Eunice Mwongela, 36, to death with a blunt object and reported himself to the assistant chief. Kaewa chief Titus Kivuva said the couple had separated and the man moved to a rented room in Kaewa market after selling his property. He said Mbatha went to his parents' home and picked a quarrel with them before going to a nearby homestead where the wife was staying. "The suspect, who is on the run, reported himself to the assistant chief. When I was informed I went there with the OCS and found the body on the ground. The man had already fled into hiding with his youngest son," the chief said. He left two other children behind. Kathiani subcounty police commander Lazarus Tarus said the two had marital problems. He said police and community policing volunteers have launched a manhunt. "We are yet to confirm whether it's true he took his son but we are looking for him and the child," Tarus said. Police took the wife's body to Kathiani Level 4 Hospital mortuary for postmortem. The killing came days after Machakos police arrested a man for fatally stabbing his 27-year-old pregnant wife in Mutituni. The killing took place last Saturday. Edited By Josephine M. Mayuya
