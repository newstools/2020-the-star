An unknown number of suspected al Shabaab militants on Saturday morning launched an attack at Khorof Harar police post, Wajir East. No fatalities have been reported in the pre-dawn attack. Reports indicate heavily armed attackers raided the police post with motors and grenades and lunched heavy gunfire that saw police officers retreat to nearby bushes. Police bosses have refuted claims that the militants might have escaped with the armoury. North Eastern Regional Coordinator Nicodemus Ndalana said a hunt for the attackers has been launched. “We responded immediately they attacked. All officers are safe,” he told the Star on phone. A communication mast is said to have been destroyed during the attack. It is not the first time are attacking the police establishment. The attack comes at a time when police troops have been deployed to enforce coronavirus directives across the country. Militants have made North Eastern a playground for years, launching fatal attacks over the period.
