The Ministry of Water has donated 10,000 Hass avocado seedlings to farmers in Nyandarua to boost forest cover and increase food security. The seedlings will benefit women and youth groups across the five constituencies in the county. The beneficiaries will be identified by Nyandarua county commissioner Boaz Cherutich and Agriculture executive James Karitu. The distribution of the seedlings was launched on Monday afternoon by Irrigation Secretary Aboud Mueva at Nyandarua county commissioner’s grounds in Ol Kalou. He said the ministry targets to distribute 800,000 avocado seedlings in 30 counties across the country. “It is expected that on maturity, the 800,000 avocado trees will produce fruits with an estimated value of Sh7 billion per year,” he said. Experts, he said, have indicated that the Hass avocado variety would do well in the county due to the good climate. From the distribution, Ndaragwa constituency farmers got 2,500 seedlings, Ol Kalou 2,500, Mirangine 2,000 seedlings and Ol Joro Orok got 2,000 seedlings. Other areas are that received donations are Kipipiri (600 seedlings) and Kinangop (200 seedlings). The two constituencies got seedlings only for demonstration as the climate is not favourable. Ol Kalou MP David Kiaraho hailed the initiative, saying it would go a long way in enhancing food security in the future. Kiaraho said time has come for Nyandarua farmers to diversify to fruit production and stop over-relying on maize and potatoes. County commissioner Cherutich said a committee to ensure the seedlings reach the targeted beneficiaries has been formed. Edited by A.N
