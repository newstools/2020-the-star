Limuru streets are cleaner, less congested one month after the Kiambu government opened the town's main market. Residents have applauded the administration, saying the environment is more conducive for business. Kenneth Kamau, a motorist, said there was no traffic jam as traders who used to display their wares along the road, leaving a small path for pedestrians, cars and motorcyclists to use have been moved. “It was hectic for a motorist to pass in the market. One would take two hours on a distance of 2km” he said. Governor James Nyoro’s adviser John Mugwe said traders also squeezed with customers outside as they did their business. Mugwe said the food market that accommodates 1,000 traders was opened with 700 traders. Others were relocated to the clothes market which had fewer traders. It was also spaced out according to the Ministry of Health guidelines to control the coronavirus' spread. “A lot of people were shocked when they learnt that all the traders who operated outside the market would not fit inside the complete market, but we thank our governor for allowing those who did not get space inside the market to be placed in the clothes market. This was because of social distance,” Mugwe said. Nyoro said the placement of traders will be done by Health ministry officials, Limuru deputy county commissioner, the police boss and county market officials to enforce anti-Covid-19 rules. Another trader, Salome Wanja, urged the government to ensure that hawkers are kept off the streets so that customers can enter the market to buy commodities. “The streets will also be clean, collection of garbage will be done easily with county officials not squeezing in with traders,” Wanja said.
