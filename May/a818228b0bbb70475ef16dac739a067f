The Nubian Youth Council recently held a food drive that fed hundreds of vulnerable families in Kibera. The event involved door-to-door food distribution to encourage locals to stay at home as a measure directed by the national government to contain the coronavirus. "Kibera is mainly inhabited by low-income earners, whom during these tough times we know most families are starving," Nubian Youth Council chairperson Hussein Ibrahim said. "We have identified a lot of families in need of help but we canâ€™t afford to feed all of them. I, therefore, call upon the government and other well wishers to intervene."
