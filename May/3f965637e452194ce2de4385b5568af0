President Uhuru Kenyatta has announced that Kenya will hire an additional 5000 health workers. This will be those with Diploma and Certificate. Speaking in State House on Saturday, Uhuru said they will serve for a period of one year. He further said Sh1.7b will be allocated to public hospitals for bed capacity. Uhuru further noted that the government will input resources into our research facilities. "...to generate new innovations that will help us with coronavirus and other diseases," he said. President Uhuru Kenyatta was outlining his government's stimulus package to help the economy through the ongoing pandemic. He urged the August House to consider, on a priority basis the Budget Proposals to anchor his 8 - Point Economic Stimulus Programme in order to release this money to Kenyans who are in need. The Head of State has also announced that there are 31 new cases of Covid-19 bringing the number to 1,192. Last week, doctors said they were worried about the delay in hiring additional health workers despite the rising number of Covid-19 cases across the country. The Kenya Medical Practitioners Pharmacists and Dentistsâ€™ Union decried lack of progress in recruiting new workers yet an advertisement inviting applications for 5,000 healthcare jobs was made nearly a month ago. The union, in a statement, blamed conflicted interests in county and national governments for the state of affairs.
