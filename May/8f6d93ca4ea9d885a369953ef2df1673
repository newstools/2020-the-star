At least 194 Kenyans have been killed by floods occasioned by heavy rains in the last three weeks, Devolution CS Wamalwa has said. He on Wednesday added that over 100,000 other people have been displaced due to the heavy rains. The government has further said that it will evict Tana River and Garissa residents who have refused to move to higher grounds as floods cause destruction in the  area. "Please, if you are living close to a water body like Trans Nzoia please move. Listen to what the government is asking you. County commissioners know where to relocate people," Wamalwa said. He added that the government will offer support to those who have been affected. Interior CS Fred Matiang'i also said that the government will forcibly move people living in flood-prone areas. "We have an operation and we are moving people away from danger and that level of alert will be addressed until we are out of danger. If we don't move people along water bodies it will be disastrous. We have no option but to move those who live there by force," Mating'i said. Matinag'i added that, " We have been warned several times about our behaviour especially in certain estates in Nairobi and in Mombasa. Government is putting forward scientific information- let’s change our behaviour. Now, we are going to be forced to have to do certain things that we ourselves as Government didn’t want to do to secure the lives of our people and, especially, the lives of innocent Kenyans," Matiang'i said. "If we tell you a certain place is not safe please listen." The country has been experiencing heavy rains and President Uhuru Kenyatta also advised all those living close to water bodies to move to higher grounds. He said that people living in Masinga, Kitui, Tana River counties should move away from water bodies. "We must be ready because we don't know which other damage we can have because of the heavy rains. We've told people to move away from areas that are close to water bodies," he said.
