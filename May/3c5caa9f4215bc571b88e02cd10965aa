Muguka transporters in Embu have been directed to get tested after ferrying the stimulant from other parts of the country to prevent spreading Covid-19 County director of Public Health Rosaline Kaugu said the transporters present the highest risk of spreading the virus because they move between counties, including hotspots. Kaugi revealed that so far, following concerted efforts of preventing the spread of the virus, the county has not confirmed any positive case. Suspected individuals have been quarantined. She, however, expressed apprehension that if extra measures are not taken against the muguka transporters, they may spread the infection. “After returning from transporting the muguka, every driver will have to take tests to find out whether he has caught the virus and thus he has to report to us immediately on arrival," she said. Kaugi said the county and national governments have agreed to be monitoring the drivers keenly and thus testing them every time they get back from outside the county. They have been made to fill forms indicating the places they visit, the director added. The director was speaking on Saturday when she launched two handwashing tanks — one at the Meru, Ishiara, Runyejes-bound matatu stage and the other at the gate of Embu Level 5 Teaching and Referral Hospital — which were donated by the Kenya Medical Training College in Embu. She was hosted by Eastern Regional Coordinator of KMTC Richard Otieno and Embu Campus’ Principal Dr Caleb Mutua. They urged people to follow the government’s cleanliness guidelines to curtail the spread of the virus. Otieno and Mutua called upon the local youth to enrol for medical causes at the college in order to help in developing the county in the health sector and for self-reliance. Edited by R.Wamochie
