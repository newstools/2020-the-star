 Residents of Ngage village in Tigania are mourning their son who was killed in a road accident on the outskirts of Meru town. Pastor Sebastian Kariithi was riding his motorcycle when he was hit by a lorry near Giaki market. He died on the spot. He was on his way home from Meru town. The pastor preaches at the Pillar in The Community Miracle Church. His family wants justice. Karithi’s wife Leah told the Star police were yet to give them a conclusive report on the investigations. “We have written statements. But we are yet to know if the driver who caused the death was processed. They told us he was arrested after he escaped from the scene,” Leah said. Villagers said Karithi was the first man to acquire three bachelor's degrees and a masters degree in Ngage village of Thangatha ward in Tigania East. Kariithi served as the IEBC deputy returning officer in Tigania East during the 2017 General Election. His burial has been scheduled for Friday. Siblings Julia Karithi and Njoroge Jakubu were overwhelmed by emotions when the Star visited their rural home. Karithi was involved in several community development projects. Karithi graduated with a master's in project planning and management and had a bachelor's degree in theology. He also had a master's degree in theology. Police officer John Gichunge said they grew up together with Kariithi and that it was unfortunate that a road accident had robbed the community of a humble man of God. “We have lost a very important person in our community. I can’t imagine. As agemates we were used to staying together either at their home or ours as grew up. He was at my home when I came to the village for leave and we spoke for five hours on friendly and community issues. He has left behind a very young family,” Gichunge said. North Imenti subcounty police commander Robinson Mboloi said the driver recorded a statement. He said investigations were ongoing.
