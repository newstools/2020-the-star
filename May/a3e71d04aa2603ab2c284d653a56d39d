YouTuber and media sensation Maureen Waititu says being a good mother when her relationship failed was a great challenge. She took to social media to address the difficulties she faced after her public breakup with Frankie Just GymIt. "Being a good mother when my heart was breaking was one of the hardest roles I’ve ever had to play," she posted. "For a breaking heart out there, I’ll leave you with these two verses: Psalm 34:18: ‘The Lord is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit.’ Matthew 11:28: ‘Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.’" The couple let us into their lives through their YouTube channel, Alpha Beta, where they made headlines for serving couple goals a few years back. They separated last year.
