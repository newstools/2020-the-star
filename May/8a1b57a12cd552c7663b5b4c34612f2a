Members of Ranen Got SDA church held special prayers for six officers from Awendo police station they accused of raiding the premises on Saturday and making away with tithe and offering. The church’s pastor, Jack Oyungu told the Star on Sunday that a group of five officials were at the compound doing administrative work which included counting weekly collection of tithe and offering when the officers struck. “There was no church service as instructed by government, the five were officials who were counting tithe and offering from members in basins when the officers came in,” Oyungu said. He said the money was brought in individually by congregants throughout the week. The cleric  said the five were wearing face masks, had maintained the social distance rule when the officers came in. “I was in my house which is in the church compound. When I heard the commotion, I went to check and the officer threatened to arrest me when I asked why they were harassing people inside the church,” Oyungu said. According to Oyungu, the officers took a total of about Sh35,000 which had been counted, and an unknown amount which was in tithe and offering baskets. “They pretended to have arrested the five people, walked with them about 300 meters from the compound and released them before returning the money and taking off with about Sh6,000,” Oyungu said. Oyungu said, “We were robbed by men in police uniform, we will offer special prayers for them to return to what belongs to God, apologise and get salvation.” Speaking on the phone, Awendo OCPD Mary Musyoka said the church officials are yet to officially make and lodge a complaint to commence investigations over the matter. “We need them to give an official complaint for investigations to commence, so far we only heard their complaints through the media,” she said.
