Health CS Mutahi Kagwe has acknowledged the existence of 'criminals' and 'mad cases' at Afya House who are hurting Kenya's bid to fight the coronavirus. "This building has some very hard working Kenyans.... but this building also has its fair share of criminals and mad cases," the CS said on Wednesday. He was responding to a case police are investigating involving a woman allegedly obtained Covid -19 testing kits and Personal Protective Equipment (PPEs) worth Sh5 million after forging Ministry of Health tender documents. Kenya on Wednesday recorded 123 new cases of Covid-19, raising the country's total number to 1,471. This is the largest number recorded since the first case on March 13. The new cases were out of the 3,077 samples that were tested in the last 24 hours. This is also the largest number of tests that have been done so far. Of the new cases, Nairobi had 85 cases, Mombasa, 24 and Kiambu four. In Nairobi, 33 Mathare residents were recorded as positive. Three more people have died of Covid-19, raising the number to 55. All of the patients had pre-existing conditions; two had diabetes and one had hypertension. "When testing is happening, kindly volunteer yourself...," Kagwe said. "People die alone... so it is important to protect yourself." Kagwe reiterated President Uhuru Kenyatta's message last Saturday that it is up to Kenyans to look after themselves and their neighbours in the war on the coronavirus. "There cannot be 47 million police officers for every Kenyan... we must cooperate," he said. More follows...
