Government Spokesperson Cyrus Oguna has clarified it is not a requirement to wear a face mask inside a private vehicle. Oguna said no one should be arrested if found without a mask in a private car though it should be encouraged to have one before leaving his house to help cement the culture of wearing them in public places. During a press briefing at Afya House on Monday, the spokesperson said the police are 'enforcing the rule' to help Kenyans get used to the new norm. "If you are stepping out of your house, wear a mask," Oguna said. He said every Kenyan must find a way to achieve compliance to what the government has set.
