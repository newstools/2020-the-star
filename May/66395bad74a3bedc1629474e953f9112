Thailand has loosened some of its coronavirus restrictions as the country appears to have prevented a larger outbreak. The daily tally of new cases is down to single digits and 92% of the 2,969 confined infections have recovered. The death toll stands at 54. The easing of the lockdown means food stalls and restaurants can re-open, and shops are allowed to sell alcohol again for drinking at home. Until Sunday, only takeaway was allowed but now customers can dine-in again as long as they observe social distancing. Last week, Health CS Mutahi Kagwe warned that the opening of restaurants is not a permit for bars to start selling alcohol. While announcing the reopening of restaurants, Kagwe was quick to note this was not a licence to start opening bars and sale of alcohol across the country. Kagwe added that the restaurants will operate only between 5 am and 4 pm even as the country grapples with coronavirus.
