Seven people including a child died on the spot on Monday in a road accident involving a lorry ferrying sugarcane and two other vehicles on the Kisumu-Busia highway. Kisumu county police commander Ransom Lolmondoni said the 4pm incident at Kisian junction killed five women, a man and a male child. He said the truck from Bondo ferrying sugarcane to Kisumu lost control when the driver was trying to avoid hitting another vehicle. “During this process, it rammed into a Nissan matatu which was carrying eight passengers and a Noah Voxy which had two passengers,” Lolmondoni said. The county commander said seven of the people in the Nissan died on the spot while two in the Noah sustained injuries. Lolmondoni said the driver of the Nissan was yet to be found and they were not sure whether he was still alive or not. The three survivors were admitted to Chulaimbo hospital while the bodies were taken to Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital. The driver of the lorry carrying sugarcane tried to escape but was caught by members of the public who beat him up. He was saved by police officers. The lorry was burnt by residents. Witness Walter Odinde said the lorry driver might have lost control before ramming into the Nissan and hitting other vehicles. "Most people in the Nissan died. we managed to save a three-month-old baby and the conductor," he said. Another resident William Opiyo said, “The problem we have here in Kisian is speeding on this road." Rosemary Awino called on the Kenya National Highway Authority to erect bumps within the area to stop speeding. “We are tired of witnessing accidents and deaths along this road. We need bumps to be erected,” she said. Edited by Henry Makori
