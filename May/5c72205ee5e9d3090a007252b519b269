Health CAS Mercy Mwangangi has urged the public to stick to the directives given on staying safe, wearingÂ  masks, practising social distancing and washing hands with water and soap. During a press briefing on Friday at Afya House, she said that the government has noted that some people have thrown caution to the wind and for such individuals, life is back to normal. "Containment measures have been disregarded in boda bodas, estates, matatus, supermarkets, banks among others. I want to remind our people that our situation has not stablised. A negative test is not a ticket to ignore measures," Mwangangi said. She also warned Kenyans who are using unofficial routes (panya routes) to get in and out of the restricted areas. "I want to remind such people that Nairobi and Mombasa are currently the counties with the highest number of infections. Sneaking out of these areas is equivalent to sneaking the virus into the other counties," she said. She told those engaged in the practice they may think it is 'heroism', but "you may just have taken the virus to your family or friends". "Let me caution them that action shall be taken against such individuals. I want to appeal to our people in the other counties to be vigilant and report to the police anybody who may have recently travelled from Nairobi or Mombasa," Mwangangi said. "If we have to contain this pandemic,every Kenyan must take personal responsibility in this fight.
