The government has been urged to enhance mass testing capacity to get the real figures of those infected and stop the spread of the coronavirus. Nominated MP Godfrey Osotsi said the government should allocate more money to the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) to facilitate speedy and efficient mass testing. He further proposed that all the money allocated to other projects, including roads, be diverted to the Covid-19 kitty. “Asymptomatic people are still spreading the virus and only mass testing can give us the real figures of those infected and help flatten the curve,” the lawmaker told the Star on the phone. He said Kenya should act fast so that infections do not reach unmanageable levels, further crippling the economy. Edited by A.N
