A surveyor working with Embu Land's office was on Saturday morning found murdered in her car. Her throat had been slit, hands tied with a rope and a piece of cloth tied across her mouth. Beatrice Wanjiku Gitura, 57, went missing on Friday after leaving work. Her body was found in Njukiri, Embu West subcounty - about 20km from her residence in Muthatari. The body was in the passenger's seat and the car abandoned on the roadside. Charles Wangware Muchue, her brother-in-law, told journalists that Wanjiku's house help called him at around 7pm on Friday, saying the surveyor had not returned home. They could not reach Wanjiku on the phone as it had been switched off. Muchue said he started making phone calls to various people, including the police. Police found her car and the body in the morning. Embu West subcounty police boss Charles Kinyua said they are investigating the murder. The body was taken to the Embu Level 5 Teaching and Referral Hospitalâ€™s mortuary.
