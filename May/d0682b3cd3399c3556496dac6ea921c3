Most Nairobi estates will today briefly experience dry taps due to the shutdown of Ng’ethu treatment works to stop the flow of untreated water into homes. "There has been increased river flow causing high turbidity in the raw water which is flowing slurry (semi-liquid mixture of suspended particles in water) suspected to be caused by a landslide upstream," the Nairobi City Water and Sewerage Company said on Friday. The company expects to resume supplies from 6pm. It said the closure of the treatment plant was meant to avoid transmission of water "which does not meet the World Health Organisation standards". Ng’ethu serves 85 per cent of Nairobi with water. It is designed to treat water with less turbidity. "The raw water flowing into the treatment plant has failed to respond to several types of chemical treatment and solutions are underway to ensure the treatment process is operational and normalised," NCWSC said. The supply from Sasumua, Kikuyu Springs and Ruiru dam is not affected. But the three only supply 15 per cent of the entire water production capacity and implies that the whole of Nairobi and its environs are without water. The shutdown has affected the City Centre, University of Nairobi main campus, Coca Cola factory, Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, EPZ-Athi River, South B, South C and the neighbourhoods. The whole of Industrial area, Mlango Kubwa,  Mathare, Eastleigh, Moi Airbase, Huruma, Kariobangi and Pangani also be affected. The others are Maringo, Buruburu, Bahati, Outer-Ring road, Baba Dogo, Dandora, Dandora KCC factory, Umoja, Doonholm, Fedha, Tassia, Avenue Park, Nyayo and Embakasi. The taps are also dry in Ruai, Njiru, Kayole, Komarock, Kenya Breweries, Kenyatta University, Kahawa Barracks, Kasarani, Mwiki, Kahawa Sukari, Garden Estate and Thome Estate. Along Limuru Road, the areas affected are Parklands, Ngara, Aga Khan Hospital, University of Nairobi's School of Law, City Park, Gigiri, United Nations and Muthaiga. - mwaniki fm
