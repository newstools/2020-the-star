Health CS Mutahi Kagwe has raised concerns about the number of Covid-19 deaths being registered in homes. A total of 15 out of the 50 reported deaths were registered in homes. This represents 30 per cent of the deaths. The CS, during the daily Covid-19 briefing, said the majority of these deaths were recorded in the Coast. "If someone is unwell, take them to hospital. If someone is sick, chances are you will also get sick," Kagwe said. He lauded Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho for his stringent measures in ensuring residents observe rules to contain the spread of the virus. Kenya on Tuesday recorded 51 new Covid-19 cases, bringing the total number of positive cases to 963. To date, 358 recoveries have been recorded and 46, 784 samples have been tested. Kagwe further stated that out of 214 positive Covid-19 cases detected at the Kenya-Tanzania border, 182 are foreigners and have been turned back. Kagwe added that the main age group where infections are are between ages 20-39. "We call them ‘mosquitoes’ because a lot of them carry the virus but do not succumb to it," he said. Out of the 963 Covid-19 cases, 62 per cent are male, while 38 per cent are female.
