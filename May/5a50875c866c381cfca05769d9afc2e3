Fourteen employees of the British Army Training Unit in Kenya traveled from Nairobi to Nanyuki on Tuesday without certificates showing they were coronavirus free. The 14 civilians in the department of mechanics and transport are said to have travelled from Kahawa Barracks despite a government ban on movement of people into and out of the city. They were intercepted near Tropic Air at the border of Laikipia and Nyeri counties where testing of Covid-19 is conducted. Residents wondered how they travelled in a bus all the way from Nairobi without being detected at various police roadblocks and Covid-19 testing points. Other employees at the Nanyuki BATUK camp were left in a panic upon learning that their colleagues were on the way coming. Laikipia county commissioner Daniel Nyameti confirmed the reports and said the 14 were directed to go for a 14-day quarantine at the BATUK camp. “We have agreed that the 14 people be taken for 14-day quarantine at the camp. We do not want to take chances since they were living in different estates within Nairobi county” Nyameti said. Details emerged that the employees were caught up in Nairobi since the cessation of movement was imposed by President Uhuru Kenyatta. A source at the BATUK camp familiar with the happenings told the Star in confidence that the 14 employees were allowed in the camp shortly before 3pm after other employees were given permission to go home. “As we speak, they are still in the bus in the compound waiting for the houses at the Nyati camp for quarantine to be prepared,” the source said.
