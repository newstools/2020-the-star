E-commerce platform Jumia Kenya has partnered with MasterCard to encourage cashless payment by offering customers 10 per cent discount on orders paid through the card. “We are proud to partner with MasterCard and happy to support our customers by offering them a strong incentive to use cashless payments and providing access to essential products with affordable prices during this challenging time,” EVP financial services at Jumia, Sami Louali, said. Consumers who purchase essential products using their MasterCard on the Jumia platform will receive a 10 per cent discount on their order. “Our partnership with Jumia seeks to encourage Mastercard consumers to stay safe by using available digital payment platforms to purchase their essential items all from the comfort of their own homes in a clean, seamless and convenient experience,” said Mastercard division President, Sub-Saharan Africa, Raghav Prasad. The offer will be available in Kenya, Nigeria, Egypt, Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana. Consumers can log on to the Jumia platform, shop and pay for essential goods on the JumiaPay portal using their MasterCard. “This partnership supports the various government cashless payment policies in each of these countries. This is an additional step to limit cash exchange at this time,” Louali added.
