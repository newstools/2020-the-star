ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi on Friday held talks with former Gatanga MP Peter Kenneth, Narc Kenya party leader Martha Karua and Sally Kosgey, who served as head of Public Service during former President Daniel Moi's regime. Mudavadi's latest meetings come in the wake of a series of others he has held with other politicians in the last week, including with his Ford Kenya counterpart Moses Wetang'ula and several MPs allied to Deputy President William Ruto. Mudavadi's communication team said the leaders, who met at Village Market, discussed political issues, the country's state of the economy, the management of Nairobi city, and the Covid-19 situation. The ANC tweeted, "Catching up with Hon. Martha Karua, Ambassdor Dr Sally Kosgei former Head of Public Service and Hon Peter Kenneth, discussing the challenges facing our nation and agreed to jointly with other like-minded Kenyans put our heads together in search of sustainable solutions." Mudavadi's meetings have sparked speculation amid claims of a possible political alliance brewing ahead of the 2022 polls. Kenneth and Karua have been presidential candidates while Kosgey is an influential personality in the Rift Valley region. Kosgey stole the show when she gave a moving tribute during the burial of the late and former President Moi. She explained at length how Moi ran the government with strictness. In the last one week, Mudavadi has met Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago, MPs Didmus Barasa, Dan Wanyama, John Waluke and Senator Kimani Wamatangi.
