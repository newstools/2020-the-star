Sarova Hotels and Resorts Kenya will cease the management of two lodges within Taita Hills Wildlife Sanctuary effective July 1, 2020. "We announce that effective 1 July 2020, Sarova Hotels and Resorts Kenya will cease management Sarova Taita Hills Game Lodge and Sarova Salt Lick Game Lodge both located within Taita Hills Wildlife Sanctuary. As such from that date, we will no longer be operated under the Sarova Hotels portfolio," managing director Jimi Kariuki said in a statement released on Wednesday. This comes after 13 years of operating Sarova Taita Hills Game Lodge and Sarova Salt Lick Game Lodge. He added that all contractual obligations and commitments made by Sarova Hotels in relation to these two lodges up to June 30 will be fully honoured and they will ensure a seamless transition. In September 2019, Sarova Hotels and Resorts announced its plan to cease management of the Spirit of the Masai Mara starting November 2019. The hotel said the move followed a mutual agreement between the lodge owners and Sarova Hotels. Kariuki in the statement said from November 1, the property will no longer be a member of the Sarova Hotels Signature Collection brand.
