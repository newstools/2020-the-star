@ppcheti Seven Kenyans stranded in Somalia after a work trip have pleaded with the government to allow them back into the country. Patrick Mwangala, Martin Mwaghazi, Ignas Mwanyumba, Michael Mjala, Gabriel Otieno, Elia Mwalili and Abas Mutuku left Kenya between January 6 and 25 for a welding job in Kismayo. They finished the assignment on March 31, began their journey back to Kenya by sea and arrived in Kiunga on April 5. At Ras Kamboni, Kenya Defence Forces and Jubaland police manning the border denied them entry. The border had been closed due to the coronavirus pandemic. Their travelling documents were also confiscated. Mwangala said they had been cleared to travel by the relevant authorities. Muslims for Human Rights lobby has called for the intervention of authorities to ensure the Kenyans are allowed to enter the country. Muhuri chairman Khelef Khalifa urged Lamu county commissioner Irungu Macharia to intervene. Khalifa said the Kenyans could be quarantined for 14 days once back in the country. But Macharia said he cannot assist the seven as the Kenya-Somalia border is currently closed. “We are aware their travel was legal. Unfortunately, they can’t fly back as flights remain suspended due to Covid-19,” he said. Macharia directed the individuals to seek help at the Kenyan Embassy in Somalia. Khalifa said the men have exhausted all their savings on accommodation and food and are now sleeping on the streets. He said the situation puts them at more risk of contracting the disease and hence the need to rescue them. The families of the seven are destitute and worried for their kin, he said.
