Bungoma county assembly’s newly elected top leadership has warned the staff of Governor Wycliffe Wangamati to respect Senator Moses Wetang'ula. Led by Majority leader Joseph Nyongesa, they warned the governor’s staff against abusing the Ford Kenya party leader. Nyongesa said Wetang'ula should be respected by all Bungoma residents regardless of where they work. The majority leader regretted that it has become a routine for county staff to attack and insult the senator for no reason. Nyongesa asked Wangamati to stop his officers “or else they will turn their guns on him”. The Tuuti Marakaru MCA, who was installed last week as the majority leader, said Wetang'ula was doing his oversight role and nobody should attack him for it. The bad blood between Wetang’ula and the governor’s supporters arose after the senator raised an issue in the Senate concerning the purchase of 20-litre jerrycans by the county government at Sh10,000 each to fight the Covid-19 pandemic. Nyongesa warned that if the county employees don’t stop attacking Wetang’ula, it will indicate that they were doing so under the instruction of their boss. ''We demand that they give him due respect or it will mean they are being instructed by Wangamati and we shall not spare him either'.” The assembly made changes last week when Nyongesa and Elizabeth Tindi were elected leader and deputy of the majority respectively. Former Majority leader Florence Wekesa (Maeni ward) was ousted by MCAs who accused her of working in cahoots with the executive. The Ford Kenya members had accused her of failing to play her role and being manipulated by the executive. Nyongesa said it was a new dawn for the assembly leadership that will take oversight roles to a new level. “I want to assure my colleagues and our bosses (voters) that you are going to experience a new dawn in the assembly’s leadership, we will play our oversight roles well as stipulated in the Constitution,” he said.
