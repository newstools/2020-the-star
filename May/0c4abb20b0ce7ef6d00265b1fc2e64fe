Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho has reprimanded Imams who are opening mosques for people to pray in groups in Old Town. Addressing the media on Saturday, Joho scolded the imams for encouraging people to go to mosques during this Ramadhan period while going against the government directive of social distancing. "Hizi ndizo fitina hatutaki. You are opening the mosque, then allowing people to sneak in. When the police come, you start talking badly," he said. "Where is your mind, what kind of laziness is this?" Joho said that the government has brought mass testing to the residents in but they do not want to commit to the testing. "What kind of laziness is this. You get to social media and oppose everything. You are not protecting me my friend. IÂ  have my mask, I have my gloves.. Everybody talks of being tested and you don't want to be tested? Stop joking, stop excuses!," he said. Joho said out of 28,000 people in old town only 130 people have been tested since they begun the drive. "...we have already buried six people from old town and yet you have time to argue.. what is wrong with you? Use your common sense ..stop joking with lives." County commissioner Gilbert Kitiyo said those found opening the mosques will be arrested and taken to court in addition to quarantine. "This is the epicenter of coronavirus. Please let us follow the rules. We will monitor those who come for mass testing.. If they are less, we will close old town and force you to do mass testing," he said. "There are people who do not care, it is not Malaria or cholera that we are used to, this is another disease."
