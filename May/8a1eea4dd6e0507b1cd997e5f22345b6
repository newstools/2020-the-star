After giving residents of Nuu in Mwingi East sleepless nights, a buffalo that killed a woman at Ukasi has been killed. It was one of two which were said to have come from Endau in Kitui East all the way to Nuu and Ukasi. The wild animal was killed on Saturday by Kenya Wildlife Service officers who shot it from the air at Nyanyaa village in Waita, Mwingi Central. The other is still at large. Kitui Deputy Governor Wathe Nzau confirmed the killing of the buffalo saying it had injured several people both in Mutito and Nuu wards. Nzau sent condolences to the family of the deceased while he wished those injured a quick recovery. Kitui County Warden Joseph Kavi said the animal had disturbed residents since May 14. He said they came from Endau through Mutito wa Ndooa to Mwingi East. Along the way, the two animals hurt four people in Mtito wa Ndooa and three others in Mwingi East. The warden said the other buffalo in Ukasi was still being hunted. Nuu MCA Alex Musili, who led the group of people following the animal from Nuu to Waita, lauded the KWS officers for their efforts. “We hope the second animal will be eliminated from the midst of residents as soon as possible,” Musili said. Nyanyaa resident Kyambi Katumo was thankful after the animal was killed saying that three years ago, her son was attacked by a buffalo. “We are grateful that the animal has been killed before causing any further harm,” Kyambi said. Stephen Kithuka, a Nuu resident who was among those who followed the animal, said their efforts finally bore fruits and hoped the other one would soon be gunned down. Christine Mwia said she saw KWS officers hunting for the buffalo on Wednesday and was happy the animal was finally killed. “We did not know how we could have coexisted with the dangerous animal but we are happy it is dead now,” she said. Residents were treated to the meat as KWS officers took the head of the animal. Edited by R.Wamochie
