At least 30,000 health workers including morticians have issued a notice to go on strike on May 18. They accuse the government of favouring doctors and failing to grant the other cadres proper risk allowance, promotion and employing them on contract. The Ministry of Health, they say, is controlled by a cartel of doctors who are responsible for the current mess in healthcare. The workers, all from public health facilities, issued the 14-day strike notice in Nairobi yesterday.They include nurses, clinicial officers, laboratory staff and nutritionists. Others are non-unionised staff under the Kenya Health Professionals SocietyÂ  including mortuary staff. They belong to the Kenya National Union of Nurses, Kenya Union of Clinical Officers and the Kenya National Union of Laboratory Officers, Kenya National Union of Pharmaceutical Technologists, the Kenya Union of Nutritionists and Dietitians and the Kenya Health Professionals Society. KUCO secretary general George Gibore said while doctors receive a minimum Sh20,000 risk allowance every month, other health workers receive nothing. Only nurses and clinicians get about Sh3,000. "We request for harmonisation of the same allowance to Sh30,000 across all health cadres. The health workers have been calling for harmonisation of these allowances in vain," Gibore said. Gibore said clinicians and nurses have the most contact with patients and therefore bear the greatest risk. He said 12 clinical officers have been infected with coronavirus at work while 147 are currently quarantined after being exposed to the virus. According to Mohamed Duba, chairman Kenya Union of Health Professionals, they have tried diplomatic means but have failed to get an audience with the government. The unionists said health workers had stagnated in the entry job group for over eight years both in the Ministry of Health and counties despite agreements for promotions.  Edited by Henry Makori
