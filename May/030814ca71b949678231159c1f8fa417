 Fafi MP Abdikarim Osman has appealed for humanitarian aid to victims of floods in his constituency. Osman on Sunday said much of the help has been distributed to flood victims in urban centres with those in villages largely ignored. He asked corporate organisations, well-wishers and NGOs to donate funds and material support to help the victims. He spoke in Mansabubu town where he donated food items including rice, cooking oil and dates and hand sanitisers to flood victims. Tens of families have been displaced from their homes after River Tana burst its banks. Osman said more than 500 families have been affected by the floods in his constituency. "We need to feed the vulnerable members in our communities during this holy month especially now when they face even more hardships because of the coronavirus pandemic. I am appealing to the authorities, NGOs, and well-wishers not to forget these groups when they are making donations,‚Äù Osman said.   The MP said most of the victims live along the river and practice crop farming. "They are counting double losses because the crops have been destroyed by floods and farm equipment also damaged," he said. The Red Cross says more than 3,000 families in Garissa county have been affected by floods. The organisation's Northeastern regional boss Mohamed Abdikadir said they were already distributing non-food items to the affected families in Ijara, Fafi Balambala and Dadaab subcounties. He said heavy rains that have persisted in the region have worsened the situation and made it difficult for humanitarian agencies to reach those in need. Last week, Garissa Deputy Governor Abdi Dagane said they have enlisted vulnerable households that need to be supported with relief food.  Edited by P.O
