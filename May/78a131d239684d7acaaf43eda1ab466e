Kenyans who were stranded in India arrived at JKIA Thursady evening. Among them were a family of three, Naomi Maina and her husband David Mwaniki from Hyderabad, India where they had gone for treatment of their 2-year-old son Jonathan Wise. This comes after the state will be evacuated on Thursday and Friday respectively. The state has organised chartered flights to allow Kenyans to travel back at their own cost. "Those travellers in Maharashtra (Mumbai) should ensure that they arrive at the airport in Mumbai (Terminal 2) not later than 1200hrs," High Commissioner Willy Bett said in a May 4 notice. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed it would fly 223 Kenyans from India. The ministry was still compiling the list of Kenyans in China.
