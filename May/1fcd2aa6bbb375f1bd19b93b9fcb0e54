A court has stopped the removal of Narok Senator Ledama ole Kina as chairman of the Senate County Public Accounts and Investments Committee. Justice Weldon Korir said Ledama's petition had an arguable case. “Pending inter-parties hearing and determination of this application and this petition, order is issued staying the Senate’s reliance upon and enforcement of letters dated May 4, 6 and 8  from the minority leader to the Speaker threatening the withdrawal of minority party membership to the County Public Accounts and Investment Committee and removing Ledama from the membership of CPAIC Senate business committee and Chairperson,” reads the order. The court has equally suspended the Senate's by-election to replace Ledama. The case will be mentioned on May 14 for direction on hearing. Ledama, through lawyer Nelson Havi, argues that he was validly elected as a member of the minority party in the Senate and without notice to him as required by the Standing Orders, the Speaker and Minority leader have threatened to remove him from the position. “The business committee and the CPAIC are scheduled to sit on May 11 when an election will be conducted to replace him as the chairperson after they procured his discharge and removal as a member of CPAIC,” reads the petition. Ledama says he is not guilty of any misconduct to warrant being de-whipped in the manner intended by the Minority leader. The legislator argues that since his election to the Senate in 2017, he has been a member of the County Public Accounts and Investments Committee. Edited by Josephine M. Mayuya
