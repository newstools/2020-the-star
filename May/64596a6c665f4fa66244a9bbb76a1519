Migori residents have built houses for seven families whose homes were destroyed by floods. The residents of Suna Central contributed money for iron sheets, nails and poles, while others offered labour. The mobilisation was done through WhatsApp groups, church and community leaders. More than 200 Kenyans have been killed by floods and thousands of others displaced. “The nation is focused on fighting Covid-19 and neglecting flood victims. Since most politicians live in Nairobi, we decided to come up with our own community initiative,” said Alex Otieno, a dentist at Migori Referral Hospital. Otieno and members of several churches in Suna Central ward identified widows and elderly people in Onding Mon, Aroso, Onyalo, Ngege and Midoti villages. "We worked as a community to pool our resources. We have a blind woman, an elderly couple and widows. We could not wait for the government when our colleagues are suffering," Otieno said. Mary Adhiambo said, "I had a leaking roof and a collapsed wall that I could not repair because I am visually impaired.” Aroso SDA Church built a house for Margret Akeyo, 92, and her husband who is 97. Nyakwar Nyogallo, an administrator at ‘The Uriri We Want’ WhatsApp group, said they also built a house for Mama Eunice together with her four children in West Kanyamkago village. A number of Migori families are living in camps after water destroyed their homes in Nyora, Kabuto, Oria and Sagama villages in Nyatike and Uriri constituencies. The county government last week donated 750 bags of rice to 1,100 displaced families. Edited by Frank Obonyo
