The Emuhaya MP has threatened to write to the anti-corruption commission to investigate where the Sh2,000 fine collected from residents without masks goes. Omboko Millemba wants Interior CS Fred Matiang’i to intervene and stop rogue officers from exploiting Kenyans during these hard economic times. He said police should be used to distribute masks to the public and sensitise citizens on the importance of wearing them, instead of arresting and exploiting them. He criticised police officers for going into homesteads and arresting residents for not wearing masks, saying this is unlawful. “I have received complaints from the people within Luanda and Emuhaya that they are picked from their homes and bundled into police vehicles, and taken to police cells,” Omboko said. “I have personally witnessed police randomly arrest innocent residents, bundle them into police vehicles and ask them for money before they are freed." He said there is no social distancing in police cells. "It sounds so awkward to arrest someone for not wearing a mask and then pile them in a cell or police vehicle where social distancing is not observed," he said. "That will only help spread the virus even further instead of combating it.” Edited by Josephine M. Mayuya
