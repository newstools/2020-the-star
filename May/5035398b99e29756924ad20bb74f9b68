The Kenya Railways Corporation has halted its repair works on sections of damaged Meter Gauge Railway after one of its employees died. KRC managing director Philip Mainga yesterday said the employee was among a dozen repairing a section recently washed away following heavy rains. "The board and management of staff deeply regret to announce that on Saturday 16th May 2020, 12 members of staff working on the Metre Gauge Railway line at Kijabe were caught up in flash floods," he said. “Our hearts and prayers are with the family and loved ones of the staff who lost his life during the operation. We wish a quick recovery to all the affected staff." Mainga said the other 11 members of staff were safely rescued and evacuated to the hospital for monitoring and subsequent treatment. "The injured workers were rushed to hospital and eight have since been discharged, while the other three remaining are still being observed." The railway was trying to resume cargo operations. Mainga and a team of engineers visited the area this morning to evaluate the extent of the damage. He said the corporation is responsive and is working closely with other agencies to ensure safety for all, hence the quick turnaround to evacuate the staff. Mainga directed that all operations at the site be suspended until further notice.
