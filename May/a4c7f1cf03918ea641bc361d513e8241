Operations at Nyando law courts have been suspended until June 2 due to Covid-19, leaving those with ongoing cases in dilemma. The residents, most of whom had pending criminal cases, had flocked at the courts' entrance as early as 9am on Tuesday but were either turned away or requested to submit their case file numbers after which most were pushed to further dates. This was unusual as operations were running normally, only that users were required to adhere to Health ministry directives. However, officer in charge of Nyando law court Samson Temu said they will still admit fresh cases from the police. He said judgments on civil and succession cases will be delivered as required by the law. "There are few changes we have made with the criminal cases. Due to Covid-19, we have noticed that witnesses do not show up in court because they fear contracting this disease. This in turn might greatly affect the cases. Most cases will collapse’’Temu told the Star in an interview. The changes include limited entry into the court compound and only officials and a few were allowed in, subject to interrogations and approval by the security personnel manning the gates. George Nyandol, a court official, told those who had showed up that suspension will last for at least a month. "We shall give new dates to everyone whose cases are ongoing. There are cases that were heard under this shade last week, we shall not proceed with cases in the courtrooms from today to limit chances of crowding,"  he said "New cases will be mentioned and heard under the shade," he added.
