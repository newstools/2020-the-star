The government has clarified that its latest directive on closure of malls, eateries and restaurants only applies to Eastleigh in Nairobi and Old Town in Mombasa. Government Spokesman Cyrus Oguna said in a statement on Wednesday thatÂ  facilities in other counties are not affected by the directive. However, hoteliers must continue to observe regulations given by the state to ease restrictions on business operations. Health CS Mutahi Kagwe announced the new directive on Wednesday when an extension of the partial lockdown in Eastleigh and Old Town in Mombasa was also announced. The cessation of movement will be in effect until June 6. "The restaurants and malls are to remain closed until then," Kagwe said during his briefing. Kagwe said the extension was because the areas were still a challenge in regards to surging Covid-19 cases. "Mombasa continues to be a challenge. Thirty of the 66 cases reported today are from Mombasa," Kagwe said. This comes as the country's virus cases shot to 1,029 after 66 new infections were recorded.
