The Kenya Transporters Association has opposed the directive for the cargo haulage from Mombasa to the Naivasha Inland Container Depot Transport CS James Macharia on Friday last week directed that all cargo to East Africa Community countries be transported via the standard gauge railway from Mombasa to Naivasha. But in a press statement on Saturday, Kenya Transporters Association CEO Dennis Ombok said the directive would render many transporters jobless. “We appeal to the government to listen to its citizenry, consider the impact of this directive to the business community and the wider Kenyan population who rely on road transport for their daily bread,” Ombok said. Ombok said the Naivasha ICD should not be forced down the throats of transport stakeholders. “KTA appreciates the considered opinion by the Uganda Government that the use of Naivasha ICD is part of long-term regional infrastructure development and should remain optional,” Ombok said. Apart from KTA, the Long-Distance Drivers and Conductors Association has expressed fears for job losses for thousands of truck drivers and conductors. Macharia's directive has been opposed by other EAC states including South Sudan, Uganda and Rwanda, which rely on Kenya to transport cargo. In a statement by Gen Edward Katumba-Wamala, Uganda said that restricting cargo transportation to rail would not reduce traffic at border points. “Using Naivasha ICD for transit cargo would not reduce human traffic movement as truck drivers will still be required to pick the containers from Naivasha to their destinations,” Wamala said. While issuing the directive, Macharia cited the need to contain the spread of Covid-19 at various border points.  Edited by P.O
