John Orinda, DJ Evolve’s father, has rubbished claims his son has been discharged from hospital. The disc jockey, whose real name is Felix Orinda, has been recuperating since being shot in an incident involving Embakassi MP Babu Owino in January. In an interview with Jalang’o on April 30, Babu claimed he had settled the hospital bill and Evolve was discharged. "He is just waiting to be taken home. The reason why he has not been taken home is because of the coronavirus situation," Babu said. But speaking to Word Is on Sunday, DJ Evolve’s father rejected the claims. "He is still in hospital and as we speak, I’m in the ward with him. The bill is still too high. Babu paid only Sh5 million of the Sh16 million bill." "He has been moved to the general ward, but he can’t sit," he said. "His upper body is okay, his hands can move, he can talk, but he has a pipe in the oesophagus to pass out mucus. So he can’t talk when it’s inside. His legs are still unresponsive." A post was uploaded on DJ Evolve’s Instagram account, which prompted a response from B Club. "Welcome back home king @dj_evolve (lowkey assassin, we can’t wait to dance to your vibe once this lockdown is over," B Club posted. Addressing this, Orinda said his son didn’t post anything and it may be just one of his friends. "He can't post anything for now," he said. Another family membe, who sought anonymity, told the Star, "I can confirm to you that Felix has not been discharged from Nairobi Hospital." Adding, "Kindly disregard and treat the rumour that has been doing rounds on social media (initiated by B Club’s IG account) as fake news." Edited by T Jalio
