President Uhuru Kenyatta should not open the country yet as the number of Covid-19 cases is still rising, civil servants have said. Movement in and out of five counties and several estates has been stopped for over a month now in a bid to combat spread of the viral disease. Nairobi and Mombasa counties have recorded the highest cases, with the disease spreading to over 21 other counties. Union of Kenya Civil Servants deputy secretary general Jeris Ole Kina urged  the President not to open the country as cases have started hitting over 100 each day. Uhuru has hinted at opening locked down places, something Kenyans are eagerly waiting for as June 6 approaches, the set date by government to announce way the forward. Ole Kina said the disease might spread to every corner of the country if Kenyans were allowed to move about in a bid to rescue the collapsing economy. He said the economy might be on its knees but revival can wait until the curve of coronavirus flattened. “It is better for us to rescue the economy later than to allow all operations to resume in the midst of Covid-19,” Ole Kina said. He spoke in Mwingi town when he issued all civil servants in Mwingi with face masks and sanitiser. He distributed the items to businessmen at Mwingi-Garissa stage among other busy points within the town. Edited by Henry Makori
