All illegal structures at Luanda market will be demolished to rid the area of drug peddlers, Vihiga county commissioner Ochillo oyugi has said. Most of the structures on the sewage line are used to supply illegal drugs within the market, Oyugi said. He said no structure would be allowed along the sewerage line as they had made it hard to clean the town. “And most of the structures within the market are owned by cartels who are overcharging genuine business people within the market," the administrator said. "Therefore we don’t want them there. We shall destroy them all and ensure only genuine traders are catered for.” He addressed the press at the county headquarters in Mbale town on Thursday during the Covid-19 Emergency Committee meeting. Oyugi further said residents who had converted eating points to drinking joints shall face the law. “We shall only allow those eating places that will comply with Covid-19 prevention orders,” the administrator said. He said security personnel in the county and health workers will be issued with enough personal protective equipment as they help in combating Covid-19. The county received enough PPEs from the national government that will be distributed from Friday. Oyugi said the county was still putting up more measures in place to curb the spread of the virus. “Social distance in all our markets especially the crowded Luanda has now been observed. Hand washing points have been set up and we hope that our people will adhere to the Ministry of Health guidelines while transacting business,” he said. Edited by Henry Makori
