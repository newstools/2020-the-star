Fifty-two per cent of the tests done on remandees and prisoners during a targeted mass testing drive have turned positive for Covid-19. A total of 59 samples had been taken from remandees and prisoners on Thursday. The individuals had just completed 21 days in quarantine at the Nairobi Remand and Allocation Prison where they had been admitted from various courts. Kenya Prisons Service commissioner general Wycliffe Ogallo on Sunday said,"From the results received on Saturday, May 30, 2020, 31 samples had tested positive for the coronavirus after which the Nairobi County Emergency Response Team promptly moved in and evacuated the patients to various treatment centers for case management." He said all the convicts and remandees currently in custody are safe. Ogallo said mechanisms to prevent the spread of the disease are regularly being reviewed and radical measures might be taken if need be. He said the suspension of all visits to prison stations, borstal institutions, and youth corrective training centres has been effective in mitigating the spread of the virus. Last month, 11,000 petty offenders and convicts who had already served the entirety of their respective jail terms were released. Earlier this month, Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiangâ€™i said the government had set aside a 500-bed isolation facility for remandees to ensure they do not mix with inmates.
