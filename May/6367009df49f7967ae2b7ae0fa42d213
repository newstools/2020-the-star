Garissa parents have been advised to keep their children indoors to protect them from contracting coronavirus. Speaking to the press in Garissa town, Garissa Child Services coordinator Mohamed Hussein said parents should not allow their children to go and play in open grounds as that would expose them to the virus. Mohamed said social distancing is key to keeping the virus at bay and that children while playing, will not be able to observe one of the key Ministry of Health guidelines. “It’s obvious that out of excitement children will hug, shake hands during their playtime and there are high chances that those infected are not showing any signs could spread the virus among their peers,” Hussein said. The official said his office was closely monitoring all playing fields within Garissa town to ensure no children are allowed to congregate and play. “It has not been an easy task trying to keep children off these playing grounds especially now that schools are closed. We involved the chiefs, elders and leaders of Nyumba Kumi and we have made tremendous progress,” he said. “We are also collaborating with other stakeholders to ensure we limit the spread of the virus. This is a campaign that can only be won if all of us come together knowing that no one is safe from this deadly virus.” He said traders should leave their children with responsible daycare keepers who will not allow the children out of their homes. According to the Health ministry, social distancing is an effective way to slow the spread of Covid-19. The ministry has advised against kissing, hugging, shaking hands or being less than two metres from other people.  Edited by R.Wamochie
