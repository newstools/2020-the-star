US Ambassador Kyle McCarter delivered 10 Toyota Hilux pickups to the Directorate of Criminal Investigations and the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission. The ambassador said the vehicles will help investigators from the two agencies combat corruption and drug trafficking. The donation was made by the United States Department of Defense US Africa Command (AFRICOM) in coordination with the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and US Homeland Security Investigations (HSI). Speaking during the handover on Friday, McCarter said the US is proud to stand alongside Kenya and support mutual law enforcement efforts. “The important work of the DCI and EACC in rooting out corruption and holding corrupt individuals accountable is critical to a strong democracy.” "During difficult times, neither law enforcement officers nor true friends shrink from their commitments, and the United States will continue to stand with Kenya.” He further said the donation will help further efforts between the government of Kenya and the US in their anti-corruption and anti-drug trafficking efforts, as well as the investigation of transnational criminal organisations. “The United States is committed to working with its Kenyan law enforcement partners to help preserve and strengthen the rule of law in Kenya.” The office of the DCI Counter Narcotics Program in a statement said it has immensely benefitted from the assistance extended by the US government through the DEA, in establishing a Formal Vetted Unit that was subsequently upgraded to a Sensitive Investigative Unit. EACC said the US has been a great partner through valuable technical support, collaboration in capacity building staff training, and logistical resources to boost efficiency, especially in cross-border investigations.
