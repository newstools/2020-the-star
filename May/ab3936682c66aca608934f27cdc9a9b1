Two suspects accused of fraudulently obtaining Sh3.7 million from a businesswoman have been charged at a Makadara court. Mwangangi Mengi and Angela Mutheu Mweu are accused of  obtaining Sh3,705,000 from Ann Mutio Mwanzia  purporting to supply her with 900 bags of maize each weighing 90kg. They allegedly committed the offense between February 19 and April 24  at South B in Industrial Area, Nairobi county. The duo was also charged with stealing and impersonation, where they were accused of stealing a national ID card which they used to register a phone number they used in the alleged fraud. The ID card belonging to Dennis Mwangangi Mutua was used to register a Safaricom SIM card, which they used in communication with Mutio during the period the alleged fraud was committed. They have been in custody at Industrial Area police station for the last two weeks during investigations after corporal Daniel Wambua obtained court orders to detain them for the period. The two suspects were arrested on May 7. The two are  accused of conspiring with a third person yet to be arrested. Police believe there are still more Kenyans who  have been innocently defrauded of their cash. They alleged that Mengi and Mweu together with others not before court are running a syndicate that has conned people in pretense of  supplying maize to a Mombasa Millers company. The two accused persons denied the charges before Makadara senior resident magistrate Steve Jalang’o . They were freed on a Sh1 million bond each with an alternative cash bail of Sh500, 000. Hearing of the case starts on August 6. Edited by Henry Makori
