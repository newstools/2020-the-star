Kenya Hockey Union in conjunction with Kenya Red Cross and other stakeholders yesterday handed food hampers to needy players and technical officials at the City Park Stadium. The inability to afford basic needs due to lack of income exacerbated by the COVID-19 Pandemic, made KHU rethink how best they can cushion players from hunger. The food hamper consisted of green grams, cooking oil, salt and flour among other things. KHU president Nashon Randiek said the initiative will be extended to other counties in order to reach out to players outside Nairobi. “We are trying to assist our players in the best way we can. The well-wishers and donors have come in handy for this exercise and the red cross has assisted in the distribution. We are keen to see players from other counties also benefit,” he said. He added: “We are engaged in discussion with county associations on the best way to do it. You see we can do much in Nairobi as opposed to other regions because of the current crisis but we hope to achieve our objective of trying to satisfy the needs of all players.” The union has also submitted names of needy players as required by the government through the Ministry of Sports and the chairman is optimistic that things will finally work out. “We presented all the details of the players who will benefit from the exercise on Sunday before Monday’s deadline. It is not the first time we are putting forward the list but I hope the beneficiaries will finally get assistance.” A list of 34 women and 27 men—both players and technical officials in each category were submitted to the ministry, according to Moses Majiwa who is the deputy match and fixture secretary.
