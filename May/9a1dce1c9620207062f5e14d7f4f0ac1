The leading short-form video platform, TikTok, announced it will be donating $10 million (Sh1 billion) to Gavi the Vaccine Alliance. This will go towards supporting efforts for routine vaccinations against existing infectious diseases in Africa, as well as future deployment of corona vaccines. The contribution will be matched by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation through its support to the Gavi Matching Fund,Â a public-private funding mechanism designed to incentivise private sector investments in immunisation, bringing the total package of support to US$20 million (Sh2 billion). In addition to supporting immunisation in Africa, TikTok has also continued to support front line medical workers, educators, and local communities affected by corona. Gavi CEO Dr Seth Berkley said, "This important contribution to Gavi will not only help us to deploy vaccines, once developed, against corona but also prevent a potentially catastrophic impact on immunisation programmes across the developing world."
