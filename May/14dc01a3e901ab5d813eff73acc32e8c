President Uhuru Kenyatta has appointed former Budget Controller Agnes Odhiambo as chairperson of the NTSA board. In a May 13 gazette notice, the President said Odhiambo will steer the board for the next three years. She will take over from Alice Chesire who has been holding the fort in acting capacity after joining the board in February 2019. Odhiambo was the country’s first Budget Controller after the office was created by the new constitutional dispensation. She left office in August last year having served an 8-year term and was replaced by Margaret Nyakang’o. Odhiambo will steer a team comprising of George Njao - NTSA director-general; Treasury CS Ukur Yatani; PS Transport Solomon Kitungu; Attorney General Paul Kihara; Inspector General of Police Hillary Mutyambai. Others are Francis Mwongo (member); Moses Nderitu - Private Sector Representative; Catherine Waweru (member); Meshack Kidenda (member); and Wilfred Nyamwamu. The President also appointed former JKUAT Vice-Chancellor Prof Mabel Imbuga to chair the NACADA board. President Kenyatta did not specify how long the don would be at the helm of the anti-drugs agency. The 12-member NACADA board has been under the stewardship of vice-chairperson Margaret Moitallel.
