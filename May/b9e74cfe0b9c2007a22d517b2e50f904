The Garissa government has hinted at increasing the number of families getting food aid during Ramadhan. County secretary Abdi Ali said on Thursday another 7,000 families displaced by floods would be added to the 6,000 vulnerable groups the administration had listed to receive food aid, bringing the total number to 13,000. The county official spoke at the  Kenya Forestry Research Institute centre in Galbet ward where he witnessed the distribution of food to 200 families whose crops were washed away by floods. The 200 families are from Bulla Medina and Hagar. "Despite our initial plans to provide food aid support to 6,000 needy families, the floods displaced many other people who are now in need of urgent intervention,” Ali said. He said plans are underway to reach additional beneficiaries as the Ramadhan food support programme continues to be extended to the remaining subcounties of Hulugho, Ijara, Fafi, Dadaab, Lagdera and Balambala. The county secretary, who represented Governor Ali Korane during the event, said the situation across the county was worsening by the day. The beneficiaries received maize flour, cooking oil, sugar and wheat flour. They also received free masks to limit the spread of the coronavirus. The county secretary urged residents to strictly observe all guidelines issued by the Ministry of Health to contain the spread of the virus. Housing CEC Abdi Omar appealed to corporate entities, people of goodwill and non-governmental organisations to continue donating funds and material support to the County Emergency Response Committee. “Initially we were talking of the coronavirus which led to job losses but now we are also dealing with floods which have equally affected a big number of our people. We all need to be our brother’s keeper,” Omar said. Edited by A.N
