The CAS urged Kenyans to keep following guidelines given by the government to curb the spread of the coronavirus.

Meanwhile, Aman warned Kenyans using panya routes to beat movement restrictions. Earlier on Friday, 237 Kenyans returned to the country from India and proceeded to self-quarantine. The repatriation comes after the state organised chartered flights to allow Kenyans to travel back at their own cost.
