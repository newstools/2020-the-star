The government has launched a manhunt for 140 Covid-19 patients who cannot be traced. Public Health Director Dr Patrick Amoth on Friday said the 140 were among those who came for the voluntary mass testing that is currently undergoing across the country. According to Amoth, they gave the wrong contact information and when their samples turned positive, they couldn’t be found.“As the CS said, they can run but cannot hide from the long arm of the government. They can choose to present themselves before the disease puts them down,” he said. Amoth’s statement comes a day after a patient escaped from the Mbagathi Hospital after threatening security personnel with a screw driver and a knife. So far, Kenya has reported 1,745 positive cases, with 438 recoveries and 62 deaths. Some 671 cases are active in 37 hospitals across the country. According to Amoth, some 130 patients are in self-isolation in their homes while 30 foreigners were returned to their home countries after testing positive on various entry points.
