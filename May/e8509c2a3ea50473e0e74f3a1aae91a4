Water from Lake Baringo on Wednesday flooded Kampi ya Samaki health centre. The Baringo county public health chief officer, Dr Winnie Bore, said the hospital, which is on the border of Baringo North and South subcounties, serves between 1,000 and 2,000 patients daily. She said they are planning to build a new health facility to serve the population near Lake Baringo and its environs. “But we must treat the disaster as an emergency and ensure our people get access to basic health services first,” Bore said. Apart from the hospital, water from the swollen lake has also displaced over 3,000 families. Anglican Church of Kenya (ACK), a fish factory, hotels and government offices have also been affected by the floods. While distributing food to victims on Wednesday, MP Charles Kamuren urged residents whose homes have been affected by the floods to move to safer grounds. "Water levels are currently overwhelming in Lake Baringo, Lake Bogoria and River Perkera,” Kamuren said. Community leader Bonface Lesaris urged the national government to help clear the overgrown prosopis juliflora weed, locally known as mathenge, along River Perkera to drain water safely into Lake Baringo. Governor Stanley Kiptis said his government is trying to partner with the national government to supply food to the affected families. Edited by A.N
