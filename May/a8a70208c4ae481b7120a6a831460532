Kisii Governor James Ongwae has called for stringent measures along the Kisii-Migori border to control Covid-19 spread. The governor's concern follows cases of coronavirus being reported in the neighbouring county. Kisii has not recorded any case so far. Migori borders Tanzania, which has lax coronavirus control measures. A number of cases of people who travelled to Tanzania and back have been recorded in the country. Ongwae said the national government has the authority to order surveillance along the border. “I will consult the national government to take measures along the border with our neighbours due to rising cases in that area,” he said. Kisii has allocated Sh298 million in the supplementary budget to the fight against Covid-19 in the next three months. Ongwae said the money will be used to address other challenges such as flooding and landslides. The governor said all 13 surveillance points are under tight security and health personnel are checking the temperature of individuals entering Kisii. “Isolation centres at Kisii Teaching and Referral Hospital and Kenya Medical Training College are prepared for an outbreak,” Ongwae said. He said the county has consulted partners to help distribute face masks and other equipment. The county has also provided funds to local polytechnics such as Nyaore to produce face masks.
