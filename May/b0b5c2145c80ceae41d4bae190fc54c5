Former Cecafa Secretary General Nicholas Musonye has joined the list of candidates gunning for the Football Kenya Federation top seat. The veteran football administrator, who resigned from steering the regional body last year, said he joined the fray owing to the numerous calls from stakeholders who believe he has what it takes to take the game to the next level. Musonye, who had not shied from expressing interests in the Kakamega County gubernatorial seat in the 2022 elections after exiting Cecafa revealed that the FKF seat topped his priority list. “I am officially in the race. I have received numerous calls from stakeholders including administrators, clubs and referees who wanted me to give it a try. I have heeded the call and I will seek to work with everyone to better the game. My immediate target is to concentrate on winning the seat and God willing, I may consider pursuing my 2022 dream,” he said Musonye will face incumbent Nick Mwendwa, Gor Mahia Chief Executive Officer Lordvick Aduda, former FKF chief Sam Nyamweya, former Coast NEC member Twaha Mbarak and former Kefoca deputy Secretary General Hamisi Shivachi.
