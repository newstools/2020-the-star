Omar Lali, the 54-year-old boyfriend of the late Tecra Karanja was on Monday presented at the Lamu law courts facing suspected murder charges. Tecra, the daughter of  Keroche Breweries CEO Tabitha Karanja, died last Saturday in an accident. The court session took place via video link and was presided over by Lamu principal magistrate Allan Temba. Tecra suffered cerebral-oedema resulting from a fall from a staircase at a house she shared with Omar in Lamu on April 27. Omar was arrested last Sunday by homicide detectives over suspicions that he could have been involved in her death. He is also said to have given differing accounts of Tecra’s death leading police to believe he was hiding something. When appearing on the live court session on Monday, Temba granted the police request to detain Omar for 21 days at the Lamu police station to enable them to conduct comprehensive investigations into the suspected murder of Tecra. “They are allowed to detain the suspect as long as they allow him access to legal advice from his advocates,” he said. The application to detain the suspect was made by the office of the DPP and the Investigating Officer. During the 21-day period, the DCI will record witness statements, analyse the crime scene, conduct post-mortem examination and analysis of the phones, CCTV and/or computers if any, of the deceased and the suspect. The investigators will also visit the deceased’s homes in Nairobi and Naivasha to collect additional evidence. Tecra, a frequent visitor to Lamu is said to have arrived in the region early last month to visit her boyfriend Omar, in Shella Town within the island. The two met mid last year when their relationship started. The investigations are being conducted by DCI officers from Lamu and homicide detectives from Nairobi. The suspect was represented by advocates Alfred Omwancha and Susan Kai. The case will be mentioned on May 26 for further directions and report from the investigator.
