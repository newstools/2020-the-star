A buffalo has attacked and killed an elderly woman in Mwingi. Three other people have escaped with injuries. The attacked happened after two buffaloes strayed into a village. "Kenya Wildlife Service teams are currently in the process of driving back two buffaloes that have strayed into human settlements in Nuu village, Mwingi subcounty, into a protected area," KWS said on Friday. It said ground and aerial KWS teams are in the village. The organisation said its Problem Animal Management Unit and security personnel from Mwingi and Kitui stations are working hard to drive the animals to either Mwingi National Reserve or South Kitui National Reserve. The buffaloes are suspected to be from South Mwingi National Reserve. Edited by Josephine M. Mayuya
