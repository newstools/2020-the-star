Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has celebrated Gift Osinya after he turned 19 years old. Gift Osinya is the brother of three-year-old baby Satrin, who survived a gun attack at a Likoni church on March 3, 2014. Six people died in the raid, including 18-month-old Satrin Osinya's mother. Doctors believe the bullet which killed her while she was shielding her son exited her body and buried itself in his head during the attack. "Happy birthday Gift Osinya, another year older and another reason to celebrate, as you turn 19 today, the seven years we have so far shared with you while growing up are like treasures to our family," Sonko said. In a post on Facebook On Sunday evening, Sonko said he can remember Osinya's moment of tears during his first difficult days when he first joined the family. "But today I tell the rest of the world that the devil is a liar for God wiped your tears with abundant happiness and love," he said. "Gift, you are a gift of blessing as part of our family, may you be gifted with life's biggest joy. Thanks for being a wonderful son to us. We are so fortunate to have a fantastic son like you. Happy birthday once more." Gift and Satrin were attending a church service at Joy Church in Likoni when it was attacked. They lost their mother Veronica Atieno. Sonko adopted the two children a month after Satrin underwent brain surgery at the Kenyatta National Hospital to remove the bullet lodged in his head.
