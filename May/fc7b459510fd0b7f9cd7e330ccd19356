Ford Kenya's NEC has resolved to dismiss Moses Wetang'ula as party leader, citing gross misconduct, secretary general Simiyu Eseli has said. A special NEC meeting was convened on Sunday, in which Kanduyi MP Wafula Wamunyinyi was picked to take over as party Leader on an interim basis. "Party leader Moses Wetang'ula is hereby dismissed on account of gross misconduct," the NEC resolved. Wamunyinyi said, "In the recent past, the influence of our party has been waning. I am aware of the weight of the challenge ahead. We are going to work to restore the party, we will unite the members and strengthen the party." Bungoma Governor Wycliffe Wangamati said, "Ford Kenya has a very low history. As we speak, Ford Kenya has two governors and they are both in support of the changes." "There is a lot of realignment happening at the national level and as a party we want to be part of those realignments and also be in government in 2022." Earlier, there was chaos as Kwanza MP Ferdinand Wanyonyi was ejected from the meeting. Speaking outside the hotel where the meeting was convened after being pushed out, Wanyonyi claimed the meeting was illegal, adding the party's Constitution was not followed. "I am an MP and Ford Kenya chairman in Trans Nzoia. I came because I was told this is a Ford Kenya meeting, I came to see what was happening and they told me to move out, they even pushed me out," he said. The lawmaker said he would not accept any attempt to takeover the party "through the backdoor".
