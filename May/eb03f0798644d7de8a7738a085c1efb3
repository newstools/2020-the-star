A Mwingi-based artist has urged colleagues across the nation to step out and sensitise communities about the Covid-19 pandemic. Joseph Nyange, a comedian, has taken to Mwingi streets to sensitise members of the public through his work. He enlightens the residents through art on precautionary measures set by the Health ministry to combat the spread of the disease. Nyange said he did it out of goodwill and no one was paying him to sensitise the community. He has painted walls in Mwingi town and its outskirts with health messages. The comedian challenged other artists to come out and sensitise communities as coronavirus is real. People needed to be reminded of its adverse effects on personal health, the economy and social life, he said. “Get out of the houses and enlighten the community on ways to protect themselves from this viral pandemic,” the artist said. He called on well wishers to step in and help artists willing to enlighten the community on the pandemic. “Some artists are willing to sensitise the community, only that they have no money to do so. I urge any persons of goodwill to step in and help us,” Nyange said. He the cessation of movement in and out of Nairobi had adversely affected him as he cannot do shows in the city and he is restricted to Mwingi town. “I get calls to go and perform in Nairobi but I cannot make it because of transport barriers,” he said. Although he termed the presidential order effective, he pleaded with the President to find a way of cushioning artists and ensuring they are allowed to move around as essential services providers.
