Former CEO and four managers of the National Water Harvesting Authority are to be questioned this week over claims of irregular tendering. The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission has summoned Geoffrey Sang (former CEO), David Gitau (project manager), Job Kiprotich (chairman of Evaluation Committee), John Musyoka (chief procurement officer) and Margaret Kithunzi (chief finance officer). The five are suspected of malpractice in the award of tenders to J&K Investment Kenya Ltd to construct Naku’etum Peace Dam in Turkana county. Gitau and Kiprotich will be the first to appear before EACC investigators on Wednesday morning at Integrity Centre. On Thursday, it will be the turn of Musyoka and Kithunzi while Friday has been reserved for Sang. The five are required to wear face masks when they present themselves before the detectives in line with guidelines to contain Covid-19. “The commission shall provide sanitising materials and ensure social distance is maintained during the exercise,” says the April 30 letter signed by Humphrey Mahiva on behalf of EACC boss Twalib Mbarak. On Monday last week, charges preferred against the officials by the Directorate of Criminal Investigations flopped in court after the Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji declined to approve them. Sources within the ODPP said part of the reason the charges were not approved is that questions were raised as to why DCI hurriedly preferred the charges when the EACC had been on the case way before them. Both the DCI and EACC had agreed to synchronise their investigations to avoid overlapping their operations. Sang and some of the officials were arrested by DCI detectives from the Serious Crimes Unit but they were released on police bond on Monday. Some of the charges the DCI had preferred on them include abuse of office, neglect of official duty, breach of trust by persons employed in the public service and conspiracy to defeat the execution of written law.
