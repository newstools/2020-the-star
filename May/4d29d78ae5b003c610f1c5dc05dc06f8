Singer Avril says she is not in any way going to expose her son's photos on social media. Speaking in an Instagram Live session with fans, the mother of one said she wants her son to make his decisions. “I want him to have his own life. When he gets to the right age, 18 years old, then he can decide whether he wants to be in the limelight or not," she said. She, however, said she does not blame anyone who chose to expose their children on social media. "I am not throwing shade at anyone who has chosen the social media life for their children, but it is important to realise you are raising a child and a human being for that matter,” Avril answered a fan. "That human being should have choices to make and a right to privacy, and that is the path I have chosen for my son."
