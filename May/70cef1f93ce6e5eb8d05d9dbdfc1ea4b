The Ethiopian military commander in Somalia Alemi Ayene said they believed the African Express aircraft was a threat. "The aircraft was flying out of the usual site repeatedly closer to the ground. The troops suspected that the aircraft was a suicide attacker and finding a target to attack," Alemi said.
