A boda boda rider accused of raping a woman in Kaloleni, Nairobi, during curfew hours, was on Friday charged in a Makadara court. Brian Duke Nyomia is accused of raping the woman on the night of May 16 as he was ferrying her to meet her boyfriend at City Stadium. The complainant, a resident of Soweto, said she boarded a boda boda at Kayole junction, but they were intercepted by police officers on reaching Likoni area, Jogoo Road. They were taken to Makongeni police station where the motorbike was confiscated and the rider was detained. One of the officers requested another rider to ferry the complainant to her destination. On their way, the rider allegedly took a shortcut through Kaloleni estate. He had all along been pretending to be a police officer. On the way, the accused allegedly raped the complainant. After the incident the woman called her boyfriend and asked him to go to where they were in Kaloleni and pay the rider as she did not have cash. The boyfriend, who had been informed what had transpired, told Duke to accompany them to the police station so he (the boyfriend) could also pay the first rider. But on reaching the police station, Duke fled. He was later called and informed that the woman had lost her phone and he was suspected to have stolen it. He was arrested and after medical examination on the complainant which showed the woman had been raped. The accused is also facing a second count of an indecent act. Duke denied the charges before Makadara senior resident magistrate Merissa Opondo. His lawyer requested a lenient bail. He said his client has a sick wife and as a boda boda rider, his income is meagre. Opondo ordered him freed him on Sh50,000 bail or Sh100,000 bond. The hearing starts on August 4.
