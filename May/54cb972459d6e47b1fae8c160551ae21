Three-time world record holder Henry Kirwa has turned to logging in a bid to make ends meet as coronavirus pandemic restrictions bite hard. The Nandi County-based Paralympian observed that the trees are his only easily disposable assets as he fights to put food on the table for his family. He lamented that some of them, especially the disabled, have been left out of the government programme to cushion athletes and have no one to turn to apart from their assets and farm produce. The reigning Paralympic Games 1,500m bronze medalist, who specialises in the T12 and T13 categories observed: “I know the dangers of cutting down trees especially in Nandi County, which is a water catchment area but at the moment, I am left with no other option.” “There are no races due to the crisis and the Paralympic Games have been postponed to next year, leaving us with nothing much do to in order to survive,” added Kirwa, who is coached by Ruth Ndalut. Kirwa, who broke three world records  (1,500m, 5,000m and 10,000m) during the 2008 Beijing Paralympic Games said: “As Paralympians, we have to wait for four years before we compete in Paralympics Games to earn some money but in between, we suffer a lot.” “The government should come to our aid. In this coronavirus period, we are hit hard compared to other athletes or people around the world because of our disability,” said Kirwa. He said his farm has 40 eucalyptus trees, which will fetch him about Sh50,000 ‘to cover some debts as well as domestic expenses’ “Life is very tough at this moment and as a disabled person, the government should cushion some of us. I have represented this country for many years, winning medals but we are never appreciated. This is the right time for the government to extend a helping hand to us,” said Kirwa.
