Kenyan artistes and friends of Benga musician Jimmy Githinji, popularly known as Jimmy Wayuni, are still mourning him. Wayuni died on Tuesday night after his car rammed into a lorry at Kahawa Sukari near Githurai 45, as he headed to Nairobi from Ruiru, Kiambu county. He has left behind a wife and four children. The retired Kenya Revenue Authority deputy commissioner was with his fellow musician Jacksam Kibandi when the fatal accident happened. His friend survived unhurt. Fellow musician Kigia Wa Esther says Wayuni was seriously injured and was rushed to St Joseph Hospital, where he died while undergoing treatment. Speaking to Word Is, Kigia condoled with Wayuni's family and fellow musicians. "He has left about 10 albums of his music but none of the songs has a video. He wanted to record videos of his songs after retiring from KRA," he said. "I met him in 1985 and we have since been friends and so when I got the news of his death, it was very sad." Kigia said the music industry will try to give him a decent send-off, despite the corona pandemic. "To the family, be strong and know God planned that. To the wife, take care of your children and his investments, which he has worked so hard for," he said. Away from music, the retired taxman also had an interest in filmmaking, having acted in several homegrown movies. Wayuni, who hailed from Kiamwangi in Gatundu South, Kiambu county, had settled along the Eastern Bypass. In August last year, another Kikuyu Benga musician, John Demathew, also perished in a crash involving his car and a lorry near Thika town.
