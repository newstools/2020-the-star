The Wiper National Executive Council has authorised party leader Kalonzo Musyoka to seal a co-operation agreement with Jubilee and Kanu. The resolution was reached during a virtual meeting held on Friday by more than 50 members under its leader. The members unanimously backed the immediate implementation of the cooperation agreement. "Meeting under the leadership of the Party Leader Kalonzo Musyoka, has today authorised Hon. Musyoka to seal a Cooperation Agreement with Jubilee and Kanu with immediate effect," part of the statement reads. The party NEC added that once the agreement is sealed, it will be signed by party chairman Chirau Ali Mwakwere and secretary general Judith Sijeny. The party is set to hold a National Delegates Conference to endorse the formation of an agreement. During the meeting, Kalonzo said that its membership to the National Super Alliance (NASA) will not be altered by the coalition. "This Cooperation Agreement does not breach our agreements under the NASA Coalition," Kalonzo said. This comes after Jubilee party and Kanu signed a coalition agreement. The agreement saw West Pokot Senator Samuel Poghisio of Kanu being named the Senate Majority Leader.
