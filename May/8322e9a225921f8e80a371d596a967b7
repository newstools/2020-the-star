Moi South Lake road which leads to tens of flower farms and the geothermal-rich area of Olkaria in Naivasha has been cut off by heavy rain. Sections of the road have been washed away, disrupting transport to the anger of farmers and motorists. The situation has been worsened by ongoing rehabilitation of the road, with the contractor leaving open trenches that have been flooded. The chairman of Naivasha South Lake Hoteliers Peter Mehta said the most affected was a section near Chabai hotel. He accused the contractor of failure to cover the trenches, leading to the current crisis. “Transport along Moi South Lake road has been completely cut off due to the rains and we are asking that the contractor be compelled to fix the flooded sections,” he said. Meanwhile, two minors are missing in Ndabibi area of Naivasha after a dam in the nearby Eburu forest burst flooding several villages. During the midnight incident, over 300 families mainly in Central trading centre were displaced and property worth millions of shillings destroyed by the water. Marumanet dam which at one time supplied water to area residents spilled the water, which in turn swept away homes and roads in the area located 60km from Naivasha town. The incident came two days after the county government donated food and personal effects to over 400 residents displaced by River Marumanet. Area MCA Gathariki Kamanu said several children and elderly persons could not be accounted for following the incident. "The dam burst its banks in the night sweeping away logs and soil downhill and in the process several people are missing," he said. Naivasha subcounty commissioner Mathioya Mbogo was, however, quick to note that no lives were lost during the incident. “The dam inside Eburu forest burst its banks sweeping everything on its way and fortunately no life has been lost,” he said.
