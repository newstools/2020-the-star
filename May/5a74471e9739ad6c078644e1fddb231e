Four crime suspects were shot dead in a shootout with the police in Nairobi on Wednesday. A police officer was wounded in the incident that happened at Mowlem on Kangundo Road. Buruburu subcounty police boss Adamson Bungei said police had been trailing the gangsters for days. Bungei said the four had been harassing Umoja, Komarock, Dandora and Buruburu residents. “We have been pursuing them. Our officers ambushed the four on Kangundo Road this morning. Police flagged down the vehicle they were in, but the four gangsters jumped out of the vehicle and started shooting at the officers," he told the Star by phone. "The gangsters were felled in the ensuing shootout,” he said, adding: “One of our officers was shot in the thigh.  He is in a stable condition at a city hospital.” The police found two pistols and 13 bullets at the scene. The ownership of the vehicle used by the gangsters is being investigated, the Buruburu police chief said. “We have sent the vehicle’s details to Natioanal Transports Safety Authority to get details of its owner.” Yesterday's incident happened barely a month after two criminals said to have killed a university student in Umoja were gunned down in a shootout with detectives in Ruiru. Police linked the two to the killing of Rodgers Opiyo, a fourth-year student as he bought medicine for his mother at a chemist's shop. - mwaniki fm
