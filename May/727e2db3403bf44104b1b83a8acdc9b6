The resumption of schools games will depend on the directives the Ministry of Education will give. David Ngugi, the Kenya Secondary Schools Sports Association (KSSSA) secretary-general, said if the proposal to extend the second term is expedited, then they will manage to conduct pending business on the courts and pitches. The Term One school programme had already started at the sub-county level before the coronavirus pandemic brought everything to a halt. Kapsabet Boys High and Kapsabet Girls High schools in Nandi County were set to host the April holiday games involving six disciplines including basketball, hockey, netball, swimming, rugby 7s and 15s as well as athletics for boys and girls. Meanwhile, Ngugi disclosed that plans are at an advanced stage to start a unified African schools championship following the success achieved in East Africa over the years. “We are moving out of the region because of the work we have done. And I am also happy that we are being recognised internationally,” he said. Ngugi said that they invited the International Schools Sports Federation (ISF) to the regional games in Arusha last year, who gave them rare reviews. “They were impressed by the way our games were being done and especially Kenya’s performances. That’s how we got invited to the World Games,” he observed. Kenya will send a team to the World School Games (WSG) in China.
