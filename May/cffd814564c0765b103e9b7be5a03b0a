Property worth millions of shillings has been destroyed following the sharp rise in water levels in Lake Naivasha. Flower farms, hotels and estates that had encroached on riparian land around the lake are the worst hit. According to the latest data, the lake’s level is currently 1891m above sea level, 11 metres higher than it was in December last year. Its four landing beaches have been submerged and residents of Kihoto estate, which borders the lake, have been advised to relocate to safe grounds. The Lake Naivasha Boat Owners' Association chairman, David Kilo, said the ongoing downpours, mainly in the Aberdares, are to blame for the flooding. Speaking after a tour of the lake, he said tens of property belonging to hoteliers, farmers and Kengen were destroyed. “This is the highest water level in this lake and all the landing beaches, several flower farms and homes are now submerged,” he said. Kilo said the structures around the lake pose a major threat to its fragile ecosystem, adding that with the rains, pollution has become the norm. “With the rise in the water levels, there has been an increase in the fish catch, but we are worried by the pollution, mainly from nearby informal settlements and institutions around the lake,” he said. Weighing into the issue, Kamere landing beach chairman Daniel Othim said the rise in water levels took a heavy toll on boat operators who had to relocate. Othim said tens of people lost their livelihoods after their equipment was damaged following flooding of the beach. “This is a double blow to many of us, as we have lost our jobs to the rains, while Covid-19 pandemic has affected the whole country,” he said. Fisherman Simon Ouko said the lake was "reclaiming its land", noting that for years, individuals had continued to encroach on the riparian land. “We've never seen anything of this kind in the lake and this is nature. There's very little we can do, though we're concerned about high levels of pollution,” he said.
