A former MCA in Homa Bay has claimed his life is in danger after attackers invaded his home at night and destroyed his car. The former Kanyadoto MCA, Lawrence Mula, said a group of people accessed his home in Homa Bay town on Saturday at 1am by cutting through the barbed wire fence. He said the invaders first deflated the front left tyres of the vehicle, smashed it and set it on fire. He said with the help of neighbours, he was able to put out the fire before it completely destroyed the vehicle. Mula said the assailants had also tried unsuccessfully to break into the house where he was sleeping. “They first attempted to break into my house but they failed. I then heard a loud popping sound and when I looked through the window, I saw my vehicle on fire,” Mula said. Mula told journalists he raised the alarm and neighbours helped him put out the fire. The former MCA attributed the attack to politics. A week ago, a group of youth from the ward attacked him. “What is happening makes me fear for my life,” he said. Homa Bay Directorate of Criminal Investigations commander Raphael Wawire said they are investigating the incident. “Officers have visited the scene and the matter is being investigated. We want to know who undertook the attack and the motive behind it,” Wawire said.
