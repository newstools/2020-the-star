Eastleigh was under tight security on Thursday following the extension of the lockdown of the area for another 15 days. The cessation of movement will be in effect until June 6, the government announced on Wednesday. During the period, restaurants, eateries and malls are to remain closed. On Thursday, men were seen ferrying food to estates using carts, popularly referred to as mkokotenis. County workers were also seen fumigating the area. Motorists were stopped as they sought in entry into Eastleigh as they showed their certificates verifying they were essential service providers. Eastleigh and Old Town were partially locked down by the government on May 6 after they emerged as the country’s coronavirus hotspots with most of the positive cases. Movement of people within the two areas is, however, allowed. The directive is expected to further hurt the operations of small and medium size enterprises especially in Eastleigh which is already suffering from broken supply chains owing to the Covid-19 pandemic.
