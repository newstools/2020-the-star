Kenyans stranded in India and China because of the Covid-19 pandemic will be evacuated on Thursday and Friday respectively. The state has organised chartered flights to allow Kenyans to travel back at their own cost. "Those travellers in Maharashtra (Mumbai) should ensure that they arrive at the airport in Mumbai (Terminal 2) not later than 1200hrs," High Commissioner Willy Bett said in a May 4  notice. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed it would fly 223 Kenyans from India. The ministry was still compiling the list of Kenyans in China. “Most of the people in China are businessmen and women while those in India are students and patients who were worst hit when the lockdown was imposed due to the coronavirus,” a ministry official told the Star. On May 1, the Embassy in Beijing asked Kenyans ready to travel home to notify its offices. Those interested would pay for their tickets and produce a Covid-19 free certificate. They also needed to have a Kenyan passport with a valid Indian or Chinese visa. “Please note that the departure will be from Guangzhou on a date to be determined immediately the above information is availed,” the notice said. The chartered flights will facilitate the internal movement of Kenyans from New Delhi, Ahmedabad, Chennai, Bangalore and Hyderabad to Mumbai at indicated times. The embassies demanded all travellers to reach their nearest airports three hours before departure for clearance. "The mission is working towards obtaining ground movement clearance from the relevant authorities," Bett said. The domestic airline shall not provide any food, beverage or other refreshments to passengers other than drinking water, Bett said.  (edited by o. owino)
