MyCredit Kenya donated food to vulnerable families in Kibra constituency last week at the Undugu grounds. The company decided to help donate food to poor families due to the effects brought about by Covid-19, where most of them cannot access money to buy basic needs like food. Present were Ponty Pridd MD Anthony Wainaina, Greencard Mtaani chairwoman Njoki Kariuki and MyCredit MD George Mbira.
