Kitui MCAs on Wednesday rejected Governor Charity Ngilu's six nominees to the Kitui County Public Service Board. The heated debate continued late into the evening, leading to the rejection of the team whose chairman would have been Francis Kiliku. The other members whose nomination was vetoed by the Kitui assembly special sitting are Esther Kasyoka, Jane Kibati, Benard Munyasya, Joseph Kyavoa and David Munyao. Speaker George Ndotto had recalled the MCAs, who were on a sine die adjournment, to have special sittings on Tuesday and Wednesday to dispense with the CPSB matter. MCA for Tharaka Fredrick Nthuri said the decision by the assembly was a clear indication that the appointing authority had picked persons not qualified to serve in the board. In the initial motion, the committee on appointments proposed to have Kasyoka, Kibati and Munyasya approved but the other three dropped. The motion was moved by majority leader Peter Kilonzo on behalf of the committee chaired by Ndotto. The assembly shot down an amendment motion by Mbitini MCA Nicholas Mwalali that proposed having all six CPSB nominees approved. Mwalili argued that it would be unfair to reject the nominees as they had surpassed the pass mark set by the vetting team until other considerations were invoked. Edited by A.N
