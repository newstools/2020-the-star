Deputy President William Ruto on Saturday wished Bishop Margaret Wanjiru a quick recovery after she tested positive for coronavirus infection. The former Starehe MP  is in hospital after being diagnosed with Covid-19. Sources tell the Star that the former MP and founder of the Jesus Is Alive Ministries had hosted 18 people at her house before she fell ill. The government, in its directives, has forbidden the gathering of more than 15 people in a bid to contain the spread of the coronavirus. "We are determined to do everything within our God given capabilities to check the spread and defeat Covid-19," Ruto said. "...and the GoK economic stimulus package will mitigate the economic damage caused.We stand with those being treated.Quick recovery gallant soldier of the Lord @bishopwanjiru ." Ruto’s message comes hours after President Uhuru Kenyatta rolled out an 8- point economic stimulus programme to cushion Kenyans. During the briefing, Uhuru said a total of Sh53.7billion was injected into different sectors such as education, healthcare and agriculture. The first case of the coronavirus that has infected over five million globally was confirmed on March 13 in Kenya. Since then, 50 people have died.
