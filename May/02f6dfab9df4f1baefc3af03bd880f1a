Homa Bay county officials on Wednesday visited a man who complained of overstaying in quarantine and threatened to kill himself. By Wednesday Kelvin Aura, 27, had stayed at Malela Covid-19 isolation and treatment centre for 40 days. Aura one time recorded himself saying he was not sick and posted the video on social media. Last week, he threatened to commit suicide. “I stated that I’m not sick [with] Covid-19. I repeat that I have never felt any signs of illness since I was isolated in this centre, hence, it's prudent if I get discharged,” Aura said. A 45-year-old woman who attended a funeral in Tanzania has also been isolated for 19 days at Malela. Deputy governor Hamilton Orata, Health executive Richard Muga, Health chief officer Gerald Akeche and Director of Health Services Gordon Okomo visited the two on Wednesday. Orata said they are hopeful that the two will be discharged after full recovery. He urged their family members to stay calm, saying the two are receiving the necessary medical attention. “I assure the families that we are handling the patients with utmost care,” Orata said. He said they will be discharged if they test negative. Muga said Aura has tested positive five times. “He is very active and we will continue testing him until we are sure that he is negative. Once he heals, we’ll discharge him,” he said. Homa Bay county commissioner Yatich Kipkemei expressed concerns over Tanzanians who sneak into the country and intermingle with residents. Kipkemei said the 45-year-old woman, who tested positive, contracted the virus when she went to Tanzania. “Legal action will be taken against anybody found crossing into Tanzania,” he said. Kipkemei urged residents to cooperate with security officials to help fight Covid-19. “I urge you to comply with Nyumba Kumi initiative to curb the possible spread of the virus,” he added.
