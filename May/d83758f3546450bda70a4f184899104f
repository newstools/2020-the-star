Kenya Harlequins have signed Mark Wandetto previously of Homeboyz as they await the Kenya Cup season to start. The fleet-footed winger, who has been capped by Shujaa under the watch of former Kenya Sevens coach Paul Murunga, is expected to play at the start of the national Sevens circuit either in July or August. Wandetto has played a crucial at the Deejays for the past two seasons, catapulting them into a force in the shorter version of the game. Speaking yesterday, Quins’ chairman Michael Wanjala, said he believes the signature of Wandetto will be a big boost for the team as they seek to bounce back from a disastrous 2019-2020 season which saw them finish ninth. “Wandetto’s signature is key. He brings a lot of speed and finishing ability on the wing as he seeks to ensure there is enough firepower across the pitch,” Wanjala noted. He said a lot of the young players will be promoted from the Eric Shirley side to the first team. “We have a good crop of young players coming through and we hope they can transition from the second team to first,” he revealed. Wanjala said the likes of Kenya Under-20 skipper Boniface Ochieng, props Elisha Koronya and Melvin Thairu who featured for the Simbas last year, will play pivotal roles in the coming season. “I expect them to be at the forefront. They are young; they have played for Kenya and have leadership qualities which will be vital for the side,” he added. Wanjala noted that with a good pre-season, the team can be competitive come next season. “One of our biggest challenges last season was that we did not have a pre-season and it was reflective in our performances. We started well but in the second half, we collapsed. We have learnt our lessons and we will come back stronger,” he pointed out. Quins finished ninth on the log with 28 points, winning five matches and losing 11. Quins have also signed Leroy Mbugua from Blak Blad.
