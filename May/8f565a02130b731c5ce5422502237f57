Lugari MP Ayub Savula has said the decision by Jubilee and Kanu to sign a post-election deal is welcome. Savula said efforts by President Uhuru Kenyatta to achieve national cohesion and stability should be supported by all well-meaning leaders. He said ANC was ready to work with the government to better lives and end divisive politics that have disrupted development after every election. "For us in NASA, there is a lacuna because of the coalition agreement affiliates signed and deposited with the Registrar of Political Parties ahead of the 2017 General Election. Unless we withdraw it, we can't go into another coalition," he said. NASA brought together ODM, ANC, Ford Kenya and Wiper. Savula spoke when he distributed food donated by the national government to those displaced by floods. He was accompanied by nominated Senator Naomi Shiyonga and Lugari deputy county commissioner William Lenaremo. Shiyonga said unity is critical for the government to achieve its development agenda and economic growth. Kanu secretary general Nick Salat on Monday confirmed that Kanu and Jubilee had finalised a coalition agreement, perhaps opening the door for the much-touted government of national unity. Jubilee leaders allied to Deputy President William Ruto have faulted the Jubilee-Kanu deal, saying procedures were violated. Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka on Monday said his party was ready to join the Jubilee-Kanu post-election deal. The former vice president held consultations with Ford Kenya leader and Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang’ula, whose details remain scanty. President Kenyatta and Kanu chairman Gideon Moi have signed a post-election deal to work together. Jubilee is also reported to be keen to sign a similar deal with Wiper's Kalonzo. Savula said ANC will work with the government through consultation with Uhuru. “We will, however, not forget our role of opposition by working with the government,” he said. Edited by Henry Makori
