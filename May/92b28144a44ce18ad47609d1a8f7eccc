Eugene Mbugua, the executive producer of 'Our Perfect Wedding', says the show has enhanced his perception of culture in marriage. 'Our Perfect Wedding' is a wedding reality show produced by Mbugua’s production company Young Rich Television. It airs on Maisha Magic and Showmax. "I have come to appreciate the role of culture in marriage," he said in a recent interview with Showmax. "Also, I respect the vendors and suppliers who go out of their way to make couples’ days memorable. My thoughts on love have, however, not been changed." Mbugua spoke about his experience producing OPW for the last four years, his love for realities and documentaries and some of the unique experiences he has had producing it. He says the most dramatic experience was a couple who threatened to hold demonstrations outside their office because they didn’t like the ending of their wedding on the show. "The most interesting thing for me has been the fans' relationship with the show’s hosts. OPW has a very loyal and vocal fan base," he said. Winning the 'Best Wedding Show' for every wedding award ceremony that’s been put together in Kenya in the last few years is among the things he is proud of. "We also won Best Reality Show at the 2019 Kalasha Awards and this was a great moment," he said. Mbugua, 29, has been named Kenya’s youngest millionaire. He says with enough resources, he would love to delve into the inhumanity, injustices and the lasting effects that colonialism had on Kenyans and make an in-depth documentary series on the same. In 2016, he was among Forbes’ 30 Most Young Entrepreneurs in Africa, and in 2017, he made the cover of Forbes Africa as one of the 30 Under 30 Most Promising Young African Entrepreneurs. He is working on other productions, including a musical project, as well as the biggest reality show that East Africa has seen, due to premiere in June.
