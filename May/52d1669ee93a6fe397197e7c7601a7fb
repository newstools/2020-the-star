Porous borders are now high-risk areas in the transmission of the coronavirus, CAS Mercy Mwangangi has said. Mwangangi said the government is putting in place interventions to curb further spread even as eight positive cases were recorded on Thursday and denied entry to Kenya. Seven of these cases were from the Namanga border and one from the Isebania border in Migori County, she said during her daily briefings on Thursday at Afya House. "As EAC we are in constant communication in dealing with this. We are closely monitoring these areas. Kenyans should remain calm," he said. She appealed to communities leaving in border points to be vigilant. "Since this disease struck Kenya all of us have been affected directly or indirectly. We are aware that it has not been easy for all of us," she said. The CAS said the government was in constant communication with border countries as to what the status of their infections are and call upon those living in border towns to practice Nyumba Kumi and report those using "panya routes". Kenya on Thursday recorded 21 new cases of Covid-19, raising the country's total number to 758. This is out of the 1, 486 samples that were tested in the last 24 hours. The government has now tested a total of 36, 918 samples since the index case on March 13. Mwangangi announced two more deaths from the disease raising the total fatalities in the country to 42. On Wednesday, 25 truck drivers from Tanzania who tested positive for Covid-19 at the Namanga border point were denied entry into Kenya. CAS Rashid Aman said 23 of them are Tanzanians, one Rwandan and one Ugandan.
