The Treasury has allocated Sh904 billion in the next budget for the repayment of interest and to redeem government loans. This represents almost a third of the country's Sh2.8 trillion spending plan for the financial year 2020-21. Executive budget is Sh1.75 trillion; Sh316 billion is set aside for counties; Parliament gets Sh36.22 billion and the Judiciary is allocated Sh18.05 billion — factoring 2020 Budget Policy Statement ceilings. The 2020-21 financial year estimates by Cabinet Secretary Ukur Yatani show that Sh463 billion will be paid for interest accrued from various loans. At least Sh441 billion will be spent to repay the loans taken between 2007 and last year. The scheduled payments affect loans which are due this year to 2044, with the amounts set to rise through successive financial years. In terms of interest repayment, Sh308 billion is set for internally borrowed loans while foreign lenders will be paid Sh154 billion. The estimates show that Sh261 billion will go into the redemption of internal debt due between September 2020 and May 2021. About Sh180 billion will be spent on redeeming external debts with no funding allocated this time around for debt guarantees to state agencies. In this regard, Yatani has allocated Sh43 billion to repay loans due to Exim Bank of China and Sh18.7 billion for China Development Bank. Another Sh53 billion has been allocated to repay syndicated loans from the Trade and Development Bank; Sh17.6 billion for the World Bank. The allocations spotlight how Jubilee administration's borrowing appetite has turned to be strenuous to the country’s coffers. Internal debt interest is set to rise to Sh297 billion, Sh309 billion, and Sh325 billion in the next three financial years respectively. For external lenders, Yatani has allocated Sh29.8 billion towards repayment of interest owed to the Exim Bank of China and another Sh3.1 billion to China Development Bank. About Sh29.3 billion has been set aside for interest on new loans and a further Sh15 billion for the debut $2.75 billion sovereign bond. Treasury seeks to spend Sh17 billion for the $2 billion sovereign bond issued in 2018; Sh10 billion in interest repayment for $1.2 billion sovereign bond issued in 2019. Sh6.9 billion has been set aside for the $900 million sovereign bond issued in 2019; and a further Sh8.9 billion to World Bank loans. Yatani has also proposed Sh3.7 billion to cater for interest on loans from Africa Development Bank and Sh1.4 billion for French loans. Treasury also plans to spend Sh2.4 billion in respect of interest repayment for monies borrowed from Italy – largely for dams which have stalled. Records show that Sh22 billion will go towards interest on syndicated loans borrowed from the Trade and Development Bank. Yatani has proposed Sh619 million to pay interest on loans borrowed from Germany and a similar amount for Japanese loans. At least Sh456 million has been set aside for borrowings from the European Investment Bank; Sh234 million for Israel; Sh175 million to International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD); Sh40 million to Saudi Fund; Sh24 million to Poland; Sh20 million to Austria; Sh110 million to Belgium. The government also plans to pay Sh404 million to Spain; Sh53 million to Kuwait; Sh29 million to Bank of Korea; Sh20 million to Nordic Development Fund; Sh188 million to Exim Bank of India; and Sh17 million to Abu Dhabi. Treasury intends to borrow Sh222.9 billion from domestic sources in the next financial year as the resolve to favour local lenders takes root. “Of the Sh222.86 billion net domestic borrowing, 100 per cent is assumed to be through bonds,” Yatani said. In the current financial year, taxpayers footed Sh768 billion in repayment of interest and redemption of the borrowing. The debt pressure comes amid uncertainties in the country’s revenue projections which have been hurt by the Covid-19 pandemic. The revenues for 2020-21 are projected at Sh1.87 trillion of which ordinary revenue will be Sh1.6 trillion and the rest sourced through borrowings. Treasury revised downwards this year’s economic growth projection to 2.5 per cent, even possibly to 1.8 per cent. This is against the projection of 6.2 per cent after last year’s 5.4 per cent, signalling that Kenyans should brace for tough times. Kenya's debt is about Sh6 trillion, a figure that forced the state to raise the limit to Sh9 trillion - nominal term other than a percentage of GDP, after it nearly lacked leeway to borrow.
