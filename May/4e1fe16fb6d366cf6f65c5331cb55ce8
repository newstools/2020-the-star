The heavy rains and across the country and the floods being witnessed in some parts of the country have caused massive destruction. Many families have been affected by the floods, some being forced to move from their homes to safer grounds. Devolution CS Eugine Wamalwahas said 164 people have been killed in the country during the short rains. The CS toured Budalang'i, Busia county, on Monday to observe the situation on the ground. Budalang'i is one of the most affected areas by the floods. "Several counties have been affected with 164 lives lost and thousands displaced," Walamlwa said. Several families which have been affected by the floods in Budalang'i have moved to nearby schools for shelter after their homes were marooned by floods. The CS said the government had issued warnings to Kenyans in April of impending floods and asked people in areas prone to floods to move out. Heavy rains are still being experienced in many areas including Rift Valley, Nyanza, Western, Coastal areas, Central, North Eastern, Eastern and Nairobi. By April 29, 116 people had been killed by the floods in 29 affected counties.
