At least 30.5 per cent of Kenyan households were unable to pay May rent on agreed dates due to tough economic times caused by Covid 19, a  KNBS report has revealed. The report, released on Tuesday, also showed that at least 43.2 per cent of the active labour force is not contributing to economic activities due to the coronavirus pandemic. Treasury CS Ukur Yatani said, "For targeted response and sound formulation of strategies and policies, accurate quality data is important." "It is in recognition of this that the National Economic & Business Response Working Group tasked KNBS to undertake a survey on Socio-Economic Impact of COVID-19 on Households." The report showed that about 21.5 per cent who usually pay rent on agreed date with landlord were unable to pay rent for April on time. Approximately 59.8 per cent of those who usually pay rent on the agreed date were able to pay rent for the month of April on time. The main reason for the households’ inability topay rent for the month of April 2020 was the reduced income and earnings (52.9 per cent). The KNBS report shows only 8.7 per cent  of tenants have received a rent waiver or relief. The report also analysed health, knowledge of coronavirus and coping mechanisms. The KNBS survey is being implemented in six waves on a biweekly basis. This means that repeated observations are derived by following a sample of persons and collecting data from a sequence of interviews. A total of 15,840 people were interviewed with a 97 per cent response rate. The distribution of the respondents was as follows: females -52 per cent and males - 48 per cent. The survey targets adults aged 18 years and above The survey is being implemented using Computer Assisted Telephone Interviews (CATI) approach in which the interviews are conducted through telephone and the responses are captured in tablets and transmitted to a central server for data processing. Data collection for the first wave was undertaken between May 2 and 9.
