An 11-year-old boy from Passenga in Ol Kalou, Nyandarua county, is missing. His mother, Peris Wangari, said on Thursday Ken Nyai Ng’ang’a, got lost on Friday, May 1, while playing with other children. He had a red motorbike he was riding with his friends and it is suspected he could have lost his way back as he was not well familiar with Passenga area. The family, Wangari said, relocated to Passenga from Kiambogo, Nakuru county, in February. Wangari said Nyai, who is brown and slim, wore a red sweater, light blue trousers with white side straps and black gumboots at the time of his disappearance from Passenga centre. Passenga chief Daniel Muniu said some information indicated the boy was last spotted in Ol Joro Orok area. The family is appealing to anyone who may have any information about the boy’s whereabouts to reach his mother through phone number 0728 202 643. “We have been looking for him all over for the last two weeks without success,” Wangari said.
