The Kisumu government has dismissed claims that it repossessed dairy goats given to farmers. Agriculture, Livestock, and Fisheries executive Gilchrist Okuom said only one goat was repossessed from the Metropolitan Self-Help Group, which was accused of starving the animal. Okuom on Wednesday said the goat repossessed last week has shown commendable improvement in its temporary rehabilitation home. He said the farmers starved the animal despite having been trained in good animal husbandry, hence their decision to take it back. The county has so far distributed 509 dairy and Galla goats. Last month, 222 goats were given to farmers. Okuom cautioned that they will take away neglected goats from those found starving them. He told farmers to be responsible, saying public funds were used in purchasing the animals. "We are continuing with surveillance and monitoring through physical visits by my teams from the county up to ward levels,” he said. The CEC commended most of the farmers for taking good care of the animals. The dairy goat project is part of a programme to make Kisumu self-sufficient in milk production and across the dairy value chain. Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o said the goats will help dairy farmers improve household food and nutrition security. The county targets to reduce stunting among children under the age of five and increase the participation of women and the youth in the dairy subsector. Nyong’o said the county has bought and given out 129 dairy goats and 93 Galla goats at Sh5 million in the 2019-20 financial year. “This strategy intends to make the county self-reliant in milk production in addition to increasing farm income and creating job opportunities,” Okuom said. The Galla goats are specifically meant to improve the genetic merit of the local goat population. Other measures in the programme include the provision of dairy cows and the construction of milk storage facilities.
