Deputy President William Ruto on Wednesday distributed food to Kenyans as the coronavirus effects continue to bite. The DP donated food to families in Nachu as a way to ensure vulnerable Kenyans are supported during this tough period of the Covid-19 crisis. "Today, 600 families in Nachu Ward were part of the wider 3,600 households that benefitted from our food distribution; to shield Kenyans from adverse effects of the outbreak," Ruto said in a Twitter post. Ruto also inspected the construction of the Marengeta Dam in Kikuyu, Kiambu County. "We are also investing in various infrastructural projects such as the construction of the Marengeta Dam, which is part of dams that will benefit more than 120,000 households countrywide," he said. Ruto said this is one of 100,000 small modern dams the government intends to build to ensure support for many people who initially depended on food relief, "Agriculture is the backbone of our economy and the support to farmers is critical to ensure that we not only have food security but also supply us with raw materials for our industrialisation agenda." He said this project will engage both large-scale and small-scale farmers. "The numbers of coronavirus cases are going up and therefore we have to be vigilant and adhere to government regulations to ensure that we minimize the effects of coronavirus and begin to focus heavily on the post-coronavirus period where we will open up the economy, ensure that we have the necessary incentives for our farmers and that is the plan we have as a government," he said.
