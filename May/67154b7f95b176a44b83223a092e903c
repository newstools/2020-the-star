National Super League sponsors Betika has introduced a midweek Sh15 million Jackpot following the resumption of the German Bundesliga and the imminent return of other European leagues. Bettors, who had also been hit hard by the suspension of sporting activities, will now only have to part with a paltry Sh15 to play and win the jackpot. Besides the midweek jackpot, the firm also has the much easier daily jackpot dubbed Supa Sababisha, which features 10 games. The jackpot gives customers the choice to go for the Sh1 million grand prize for as little as Sh20 stake or bet on the same games with Sh10 and win Sh500,000. Gamblers can also bet with Sh200 or half of their Betika points for the same cash wins. Apart from reaping a million from Supa Sababisha, they stand to make Sh1.5m from Betika on the same Jackpot through analysing the games to get a winning combination. Should the combination of the predictions come to pass, bettors will have made Sh1.5 million from just Sh30 and 10 games.
