Former Kenya Football Coaches Association (KEFOCA) deputy secretary-general Hamisi Shivachi has thrown his hat into the ring for the Football Kenya Federation (FKF) top seat during the elections slated for later this year. Shivachi has vehemently dismissed as rumours claim that he has bowed out of the race for the FKF presidential position saying this is one of the tactics his opponents are using to distract his supporters. “I’m very much in the race. Let nobody be deceived that I will bow out of this race. In fact, I’m strategising and restructuring before I roll out my intensive campaigns. I also want to reach out to all the delegates countrywide and seek votes," he added. He said his long term plan was to resurrect local soccer, which he said was on the sick bed owing to poor leadership. “Kenyan football requires an inter-disciplinary and multi-disciplinary approach to increase and establish the right structures in order to spur the growth and development of the game in the country,” Shivachi said. “Having served in the Kefoca for years as the deputy secretary-general, I believe I have what it takes to lead the country's football national body,"he added. The multi-lingual speaker asserted that he was the right person for the job since he has no integrity issues and so he would be clear with chapter 6 of the Kenya constitution.
