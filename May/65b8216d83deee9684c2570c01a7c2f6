Flood victims camping at various rescue centres in Budalang'i, Busia county, have been urged to wear masks, wash their hands with soap and maintain social distance to contain the spread of the coronavirus. Bunyala deputy county commissioner Jacob Ruto said the only way to keep the virus at bay is by adhering to government directives. "I want to appeal to you to strictly adhere to the guidelines issued by the government to stop the spread of Covid-19 that has claimed the lives of thousands of people globally," he said. Ruto spoke on Thursday at St Kizito Sirimba Mission Primary School, where over 300 flood victims are camping. More than 40,000 residents of Budalang'i have been displaced by floods. There are worries their crowding in camps can hasten the spread of the virus. The deputy county commissioner assured flood victims that the national government is committed to ensuring that they are provided with mosquito nets, masks, sanitiser and medicine. Edited by A.N
