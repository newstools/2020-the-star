The Covid-19 Emergency Response Fund has raised over Sh2.7 billion to fight the disease outbreak in the country. Fund chairperson Jane Karuku said they have raised Sh2,149,218,950 cash and  Sh505,836,250 in food and other items. Karuku said a statement that corporates, foundations, religious institutions and individuals have donated to the fund. "The fund has also coordinated in-kind food donations amounting to Kshs. 272,024,734 ," she said. The fund has prioritised the purchase of personal protective equipment worth Sh600 million for the safety of front line health workers. "These include the dedicated Covid-19 hospitals in the 47 counties, health facilities in Dadaab and Kakuma Refugee Camps, and the Moi, Kenyatta, and Kenyatta University Teaching and Referral Hospitals." She said the PPEs will be sourced from local manufacturers to stimulate the local economy. The chairperson said funds and other donations received will be updated in due course. She said a detailed list of all contributions is available on the fund’s website www.kenyacovidfund.co.ke. The board has set up clear frameworks to ensure that every shilling contributed is accounted for, she said. Karuku thanked Kenyans for the support and goodwill that the fund has received. "We would like to encourage more Kenyans to donate to the fund as we all work together to overcome this pandemic. Let us work together to save lives," she said. The fund was created to mobilise resources for an emergency response towards containing the spread, effects and impact of the Covid-19. It was established on April 1 by President Uhuru Kenyatta.
