The organising principle of the House of Gema is Simple: Kula Ruto, Kura Uhuru. (Eat DP William Ruto Elect president Uhuru Kenyatta) These were the words of political analyst Mutahi Ngunyi on Monday barely minutes after Kipchumba Murkomen was axed as the Senate Majority Leader. "As I have said before: You cannot buy a Kikuyu. You can only rent one," he tweeted. "To my friend Murkomen, Pole Sana. I will pray for you. Now you have enough time to dry your greenhorns." But with this, many Kenyans on Twitter had mixed feelings with the Senator himself laughing at Mutahi's sentiments. Murkomen had earlier tweeted that he is stronger than ever before. He is expected to address the media later on Monday afternoon about the developments that have taken place. In a communique from State House on Monday,Â West Pokot Senator Samuel Poghisio was appointed the new Senate Majority leader. The changes were effected following a Jubilee Coalition Senate Parliamentary Group Meeting on Monday chaired by President Uhuru Kenyatta. Poghisio will now be deputised by Isiolo senator Fatuma Dullo Adan. In the new changes, Murang'a Senator Irungu Kang'ata has replaced Nakuru Senator Susan Kihika as the Majority Chief Whip. Kang'ata will be deputised by Wajir nominated senator Farhiya Ali Haji.
