A petitioner has asked the court to stop Bomet Governor Hillary Barchok from filling the position of the county secretary. Leonard Bett wants the court to stop the governor and the Bomet county assembly from vetting or appointing any candidate to the position. Last week, Barchok nominated Stella Langat for the position which has been held by Evalyn Rono since 2017. Bett argues that the respondents broke the law by not adhering to the process of competitive recruitment for the position. He says the position ought to have been advertised but Barchok and the assembly acted unilaterally. “The import and spirit of the County Governments' Act is that the recruitment of the county secretary would entail advertising for the position, filtering applications, interviewing the qualified applicants then presenting the name of the most qualified and suitable candidate to the county assembly,” he says. The application was filed before Judge Nderi Nduma of the Employment and Labour Relations Court in Kisumu on April 27. The respondents have 14 days to file submissions. The county assembly committee on appointments has, however, concluded the vetting process of the nominee alongside two other individuals for the vacant county executive committee positions.
