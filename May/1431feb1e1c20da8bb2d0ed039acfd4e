Sixteen members of one family have been quarantined in Bomet County after tests from a man who died of diabetes turned positive for the Coronavirus. Medical workers who also came into contact with the patient have also been put under quarantine. The 55-year-old was admitted to Longisa Referral Hospital on May 4 after arriving from Nairobi but passed on the following day. Bomet Governor Hillary Barchok said the samples from the deceased were taken to Kenya Medical Research Institute (Kemri) in Kisumu which turned positive for the disease. The governor was however disappointed by the manner in which the deceased sneaked into the county despite the cessation order in Nairobi as announced by the government. The deceased is said to have travelled to his Kagawet home at Itembe in Chepalungu through a police vehicle. A relative who is a police officer, Barchok stated, helped the patient escape from Nairobi to his home. Expressing his disappointment over the action by the officer, Barchok he was working closely with the county commissioner to ensure stern action was taken against him.
