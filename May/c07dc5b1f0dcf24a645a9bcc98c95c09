County governments have been urged to lift restrictions hindering the trade of miraa. Agriculture CS Peter Munya said on Friday the coronavirus outbreak has greatly affected miraa trade - locally and internationally. “The miraa industry is facing key challenges, including the closure of airspace for main export markets and trade ban by some county governments,” he said. The ministry has requested the county governments to review the high charges imposed in their jurisdictions and issue the necessary certification to miraa industry players. The counties are also to ensure screening of miraa transporters for Covid-19 from their point of departure, or in designated screening points along the transit routes. Where miraa markets have been temporarily closed, the county governments are to provide alternative space for operations. As part of the guidelines, county governments should ensure all miraa vendors operate from licensed premises. “Since miraa is not consumed in public places, county governments should facilitate operations by vendors and designate spaces for trading operations, which should be cleaned and sanitised prior, and after operations,” Munya said. The guidelines were addressed to the Council of Governors chief executive officer Jacqueline Mogeni. “This is to request your office to disseminated the same to County Governments for domestication and implementation,” Munya said. Last month, President Uhuru Kenyatta listed miraa trade as one of the activities permitted during the 21-day containment period. Uhuru said the movement of cargo trucks and transportation of food supplies, including miraa, will continue despite measures to stop the spread of the coronavirus. In addition, all county government extension staff will be required to sensitise players in the miraa industry on recommended hygienic measures and other measures in the war on Covid-19.
