Eldoret Club pro Andrew Chelogoi is taking advantage of coronavirus break to hone his golfing skills and getting into shape awaiting the re-opening of courses. Chelogoi, who became the second professional golfer at Eldoret Golf Club last May — after Boniface Simwa — wants to make the most of his new status following a lengthy period in the amateur ranks. He said he played in six Safari Tour series in the run-up to Kenya Open golf championships that were postponed due to the pandemic. “As an individual, I have put a lot in training during this break. I don’t go to the gym now but I still train at home. I run at least 10km a day. I lift some irons and am now scaling my fitness up," said Chelogoi, who has previously served as club chairman and captain. "I have lost 10kg since the pandemic was announced in the country as I look forward to doing better in professional golf.” “By turning professional, I have given hope to many young golfers at the club that by putting efforts in whatever they do, they can scale up the ladder despite their age,” he advised. Chelogoi, who started his golf at handicap 24, added: “I am actually helping young people and through the government and Kenya Junior Golf Union (KJGU), we have set aside Sh1 million every month which means one can actually earn something at the end of the day." "Golf is going to pay well locally since Kenya has come up rapidly and have a tour that is sustainable.” “I have played in big events in Kenya, especially the Kenya Amateur Golf Championships (KAGC) series. I also played at Tannahill for the western Kenya team,” he said. However, he insists playing at the professional level is tasking, requiring a lot of dedication. He said the pandemic has been a big blow for Kenyan golf especially the cancellation of the Magical Kenya Open.
