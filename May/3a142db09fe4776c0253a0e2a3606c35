Agribusinesses will help Kwale residents ward off hunger caused by Covid-19 control measures, Deputy Governor Fatuma Achani has said. She urged residents in Matuga to take advantage of the rains to maximise food production. The deputy governor said people must make use of the county lockdown to engage in farming to make money through their surplus food. “In every crisis, there is an opportunity. This is the time for all of us to start thinking differently and turn our farms into something useful,” Achani said. She said the administration had provided seedlings, manure, free tractors for ploughing and dug dams for irrigation. Achani said farming is the only way out for the county to rescue itself from frequent hunger and dependence on relief food. She also challenged farmers to try hybrid varieties of crops for a faster and steady harvest. “Adopt the use of modern seedlings that do well within a short time and in plenty,” she said. The politician advised the youth to engage in farming instead of squandering their time chewing khat while anticipating white-collar jobs. Agriculture Principal Secretary Hamadi Boga also challenged residents from the six coastal counties to turn to farming. He said crop production will help in food security since the Covid-19 directives have affected the flow of produce into and out of the counties. (edited by o. owino)
