A section of Gilgil residents were treated to a rare 'gift' after a lorry ferrying wheat flour lost control and crashed on the roadside near Kikopey along the Nairobi-Nakuru highway. They went into a looting spree as son as the accident happened, carting away the flour in bundles and packets before police arrived. Some motorists took advantage of the traffic jam to also loot, terming the accident as "God-sent". The truck, which was heading to Nakuru from Nairobi lost control and hit two cars before crashing. The accident occurred at mid-day. Alan Mwangi, who witnessed the accident, said the occupants of the three vehicles escaped with minor injuries. “The accident is a blessing in disguise as many of us have struggled to a get a meal for our families.  We are now sorted,” he said. A senior police officer who declined to be named said the injured had been treated and discharged and the wrecks towed to Gilgil police station. Meanwhile, a fishing expedition by a former flower farm worker in Lake Naivasha ended tragically after he drowned near Kihoto estate in Naivasha. The father of two fell into a flooded latrine in the estate that borders the lake as his colleagues watched in horror. In the last two months, water levels in the lake have risen sharply, flooding nearby estates. The number of illegal fishermen has increased as sacked flower farm workers are now turning to fishing for a livelihood. The incident came barely a week after a 13-year-old boy fell and drowned in a flooded well in the same estate, which is home to tens of flower farm workers. Village elder James Waithaka, the deceased was among a group of men fishing on the flooded section of the lake when the incident occurred. “Many of the youths in Naivasha have entered the lake in search of food for their families and as a result, we have seen increased cases of drowning and hippo attacks,” he said.
