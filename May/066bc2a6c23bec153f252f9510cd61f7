Actor Pascal Tokodi has celebrated fellow actor Kone Nouhoum in a song called 'Fly', featuring rapper King Kaka. Kone succumbed to the neck and spinal injuries he sustained in an accident, which left him paralysed in February last year. The two feature in Maisha Magic East telenovela 'Selina'. After the release, Pascal shared a photo of himself with the late Kone and captioned it, "I wrote this one for you brother! I miss you. Fly my friend. A farewell message to our dear ones, may you find peace and comfort in knowing you're not alone." King Kaka added, "We have lost people in the past, we have lost friends recently. This song is so therapeutic to me. May it comfort you and your inner thoughts and may you find peace. Fly Julius Ombima, Fly Moran Ombima, Fly Agnetta Agwel, Fly Raz, Fly Sniper, Fly My Friends."
