Equity bank has restructured Sh92 billion loans to help customers weather Covid-19 shocks. Clients who can demonstrate the impact of Covid-19 on their businesses and soundness of their business model will have their loans rescheduled and get an additional three years to repay them. “We believe that by supporting our existing clients, we shall help them keep their supply chains open and functional while maintaining their employees on their jobs,” said James Mwangi, the group managing director and CEO. The accommodation includes principal and/or interest repayment breaks or reduction of repayment instalments. “We know this crisis is not going away anytime soon since the health crisis has not been resolved. For this reason, we opted to support our customers,” Mwangi said. The group will work with its customers to expand their opportunities in the health sector by financing them to manufacture items such as face masks and personal protective equipment locally while helping to create regional supply chains. To protect its customers and clients, Equity Group has invested massively to support contactless environment and working from home.
