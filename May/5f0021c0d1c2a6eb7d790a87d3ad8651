Maasai Mara University vice chancellor Mary Walingo has been interdicted to allow investigations into management. University council chairman Kennedy ole Kerei on Thursday told the Star on the phone he signed her interdiction letter on May 12 after council members made the decision a day earlier. “That meeting considered the Auditor General’s report dated February 27 that allegedly noted unspecified payments made by Prof Walingo,” Kerei said. He said the council noted that funds withdrawn were allegedly not supported by any appropriate authority, documentation or pre-numbered payment vouchers. Kerei said Walingo also failed to bill school fees according to the amount stipulated in the nominal roll, leading to incomplete and inaccurate records. The letter addressed to Walingo reads, “In the circumstances, it was not possible to ascertain whether the expenditure of Sh1.395 million lawful, authorised, effective, efficient or economical and transparent.” Kerei told the Star that the university council resolved to undertake further investigations as articulated in the audit report. “In this regard, the council resolved to interdict you with immediate effect according to the provisions of the Public Service Commission Act, 2017,” a copy of Walingo’s interdiction letter reads. Kerei said while on interdiction, the VC will be entitled to half of her basic salary, full house allowance and medical benefits in line with the Public Service Commission Act. All other benefits will be withheld, the letter said. Efforts to reach Walingo on the phone were unsuccessful. Edited by R.Wamochie
