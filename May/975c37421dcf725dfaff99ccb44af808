Legend Edward Rombo has been appointed Kenya Rugby League national team coach. Rombo will lead the national team’s programme in collaboration with ‘Giving Rugby Foundation’ to provide technical support in the federation’s development in the area of skills and defence. The decorated former international has 30 years of playing and coaching both Rugby Union and league and was the first Kenya professional rugby league player to play for Leeds Rugby League Football Club, Dewsbury and Featherstone Rovers in the early 90s. The wing wizard had a stellar career in Rugby Union, having guided Mean Machine to winning the Kenya Cup in 1989 and 1990 as well playing for Watembezi Pacesetters as well Barclays RFC. He has also coached Mwamba RFC and runs a successful law firm, Rombo and Co Advocates. Following the appointment, Rombo said: “As a pioneer Rugby League player from Kenya, I’m happy to play my part in ensuring the sport grows root in the country and have a strong national team which can compete with the world’s best in the years to come,” added Rombo. Kenya Rugby League chairman, Nyakwaka Adhere, said due to the coronavirus pandemic, training and selection of the national team players has been put on hold. He added that once the pandemic is contained, the selectors will meet and pick a team in readiness for the maiden Kenya vs South Africa test match at a venue to be disclosed later. Rugby League unlike union is played by 13 players and has no scrums, no line-outs and rucks. The sport has its roots in England but it is also played in Australia,New Zealand and England. The sport is newly introduced in the country with matches being played at the Railway club.
