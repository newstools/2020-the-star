Five passengers died on Saturday at 10.30am in a road accident in Londiani on the Kericho-Nakuru road. Kericho police commander Silas Gichure said the five died after a truck transporting crates of beer to Kericho rammed into two stationary matatus. Three passengers died on the spot, while two succumbed to the injuries at Kericho Level 4 Hospital. Six others were taken to Kericho Level 4 Hospital in critical condition. An eye witness said the brakes of the truck might have failed, forcing the driver to ram into the two matatus. The matatu crew, who were heading to Nakuru from Kericho town, had made a stopover at the junction to pick passengers.
