All the nine positive cases in Kajiado are truck drivers from Tanzania, CAS Rashid Aman has said. In a daily briefing on Monday, Aman said the government had tested 841 samples, out of which 28 tested positive for coronavirus. 10 are from Mombasa, nine from Kajiado, seven from Nairobi and two from Wajir. This brings to 700 the total number of virus cases recorded in the country. "The nine are truck drivers returning from Tanzania. At the same time, we also tested Tanzania drivers who are intending to enter Namanga through that border," he said. Aman said five of those Tanzanian drivers were found to be positive within their country. "We shared the information with the Tanzanian authorities since they had not stepped into our country," he added. Aman further said Kenya has aggressively contained the virus by using stricter measures. "We have expanded our testing capacities. We have mentioned that we have the testing capacity but limited by reagents which are a global problem," he said. Aman requested every individual to be their brother's keeper. "If we move together we shall overcome. Report to a nearby facility should one exhibit corona symptoms," he said. The CAS asked Kenyans not to fear visiting hospitals if they have an infection which is not coronavirus related. "We have put measures in these hospitals. Even if you do not have symptoms of corona, visit these facilities to know your status and know what actions to take," he said.
