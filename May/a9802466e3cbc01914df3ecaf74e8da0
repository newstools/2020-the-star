Non-food items traders in Kisumu have started mushrooming in the city's CBD after they were banned from conducting their business in markets following the Covid-19 outbreak. They say life has become unbearable. “Honestly, most of us were caught off guard with our stocks. We have no food and have loans to service. We are left with no choice,” Jackline Akinyi, a trader, said. Most of the markets were shut down across the country to curb the spread of coronavirus. "Business has gone down as prices are skyrocketing because factories at the moment not operating fully. We thus can’t import and are not sure if we shall sustain ourselves in the business," Akinyi added. The traders have now vowed not to move to Kiwanja ya Ndege, saying most of their clients are within the CBD. Kisumu Traders Chairman Isreal Agina, however, dismissed claims that they would be relocated from town to Kiwanja ya Ndege. "There is no such circular in place to relocate traders," he told the Star on the phone at the weekend. "That is just gossip. There is no such plan by the county at all," he added. Kiwanja ya Ndege is famously known for hosting huge political rallies. Agina said since it is not roofed, it would be difficult for the traders to operate from the field. “Business is all about customers. Tell me, who will go buy from down there? Nobody. Relocating traders to that place is killing their business," he added. Governor Anyang' Nyong'o had directed the Planning Department to ensure the traders have space in Kowino, Kosawo, Nyawita and Manyatta Peace markets. Edited by EKibii
