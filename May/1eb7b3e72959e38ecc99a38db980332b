Musician Mutoriah has released 'Tosheka', a classic love song featuring Sol Generation's Bensoul. 'Tosheka' is a single off Mutoriah’s acclaimed and self-produced debut album Dive In, released in 2019. The song begins with a few spoken word lines, giving both the song and video an enigmatic feel. Mutoriah and Bensoul ask their lovers to stay and be satisfied with them, despite the dissatisfactions that life may bring with it. The song was written by Bensoul, but both artistes’ vocals are captivating and have a refreshing balance between mellow and powerful. "I honestly wouldn’t have it any other way,” Mutoriah said. “The theme of love is timeless. Tosheka is a reminder that it’s important not to lose it all because of small things,” he said. This is not the first time the two musicians are working together. Mutoriah has lent his ingenuity on most of Bensoul’s songs, including 'Lucy'. Mutoriah has also produced music for musicians like Sauti Sol, Fena Gitu and Gilad. He promises more visual releases this year.
