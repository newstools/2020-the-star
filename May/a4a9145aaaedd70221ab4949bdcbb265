A 30-year forgery case between two brothers will not proceed after the complainant lost at the Court of Appeal. Prafulchandra Bharmal had appealed a ruling by High Court Judge George Odunga that overturned a magistrate's decision for the case to proceed. A Kibera court had okayed the prosecution of Prafulchandra's brother Shurishchandra Bharmal for forging a signature in a land agreement document. Prafulchandra sought private prosecution after the DPP closed the criminal file that had been opened for his brother. The DPP advised them to continue pursuing the civil case that is still pending in court. Appeal Court judges agreed with Judge Odunga that the courts should not be used to settle civil disputes. “To us, this order was appropriate as the Judge had to navigate carefully so as not to make far-reaching pronouncements that would embarrass the pending civil trial,” the court ruled. Justices Martha Koome, Daniel Musinga and Gatembu Kairu further ruled that if both the civil and the private criminal prosecution case were to proceed for hearing simultaneously, there was a likelihood of it giving rise to two outcomes. Praful has sued Shurish seeking orders that the co-ownership of the property be dissolved, sold and the proceeds shared. Shurish had told the court that the dispute is a commercial one and there is no strong public interest in the institution of the private criminal proceedings against him by his brother.
