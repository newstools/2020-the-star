 A police officer who went missing from work since March, 2019 is will be charged with desertion of duty. Traffic police constable Simon Kagai Waweru went missing on March 21 last year. He had been nominated to attend a capacity building course at the National Police Service College in Kiganjo. The training was scheduled to start on March 21. But the policeman failed to report and he went missing. He was then booked in the occurrence book OB 2/04/042019 as an officer who absented himself from duty without leave. In an affidavit filed before Makadara law courts, Chief Inspector Alois Muthoka asked chief magistrate Emily Ominde to summon the officer to surrender himself to the police. Muthoka is based at the Traffic Police Headquarters. He said Waweru should surrender himself to OCS Muthaiga police station for arraignment. “Your honour, I am investigating a case of desertion from the NPS, the respondent here is one of us who was formerly attached to Traffic Headquarters, Government Vehicle Check Unit. He absented himself from duty without official leave and his whereabouts is not yet known,” Muthoka said. Ominde granted the orders.
