Homa Bay will not hire 120 health workers after a court suspended the appointment of the new County Public Service Board chairman. On Tuesday, the Labour Court in Kisumu suspended the appointment of new CPSB chairman Elijah Kodo after the previous office holder Daniel Ogada appealed. Kodo was appointed by Governor Cyprian Awiti last week to serve on an interim basis. In his appeal, Ogada cited a court order he secured in December last year that allowed him to continue serving as the board chairman. Justice Mathews Nderi directed that Kodo cannot serve as the board chairman until the application is determined. “The court hereby orders that appointment of Kodo as the chairman of Homa Bay County Public Service Board is stopped, pending hearing and determination of this application,” Justice Nderi ruled. He also directed that the application be served and responded to electronically within 14 days. The board has been marred by controversy since MCAs passed a motion last year recommending that Governor Cyprian Awiti sacks Ogada and CPSB officers Collins Odhiambo (secretary) and Tobias Odundo (member). The trio went to court and secured injunctions. The case has not been concluded. Last week, the county swore in Kodo, Sarah Nekesa and Lawrence K’Oteng’ to serve in the board. The three board members were to lead the recruitment of 120 health workers to boost the fight against Covid-19. The deadline for the process was April 30. (edited by o. owino)
