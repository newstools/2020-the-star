A magistrate's court has found that former electoral agency CEO James Oswago and deputy commissioner Wilson Shollei have a case to answer in relation to abuse of office charges. Anti-corruption magistrate Felix Kombo put the two on their defence after the prosecution proved that they failed to comply with procurement law when they bought electronic voter identification devices for the March 4, 2013 General Elections. Thirty-six witnesses testified in the case. The court, however, acquitted two others who had been charged alongside Oswago. The magistrate said no case has been made against Edward Karisa and Willy Kamanga. In 2013, Oswago and Shollei were arraigned and charged with failing to comply with the procurement law. Court documents show they failed to ensure the changes made to the contract awarded to Face Technologies Limited by the IEBC for the supply of Electronic Voter Identification in Tender No. IEBC14/2011-2012 were approved by IEBC tender committee. On a different count, they were accused of using their offices to improperly confer a benefit on Face Technologies Limited by approving payment of Sh1,397,724,925.51 for the supply of EVIDs without ascertaining that devices supplied were inspected, accepted and met the technical specifications in the contract.
