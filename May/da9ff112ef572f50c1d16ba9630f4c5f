Kenyans stranded in India with a valid visa and who are willing to pay at least Sh45,635 for a plane ticket will be evacuated to Kenya on May 7, the Foreign Affairs ministry has said. High Commissioner Willy Bett in a notice dated May 4 said the ministry has chartered two Indian flights to airlift all stranded Kenyans scattered across various cities in India to Mumbai for an onward flight to Kenya. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed an arrangement to fly 223 Kenyans. The chartered flights will facilitate internal movement of Kenyans from New Delhi, Ahmedabad, Chennai, Bangalore and Hyderabad to Mumbai at indicated times. The first flight will depart Delhi terminal three at 8:45am to Ahmedabad. The flight will depart from Ahmedabad at 11:15 am to Mumbai and arrive at 12:35pm. Flight two will depart New Delhi terminal three at 6am to Bangalore, depart Bangalore at 7:55am to Hyderabad. It will then depart Hyderabad at 10:05 a.m for Mumbai and arrive at 11:35pm "Those travelers in Maharashtra (Mumbai) should ensure that they arrive at the airport in Mumbai (terminal 2) not later that 1200hrs," Bett said. He noted that all travelers should ensure that they reach their nearest airports three hours before departure for prerequisite departure procedures . "The mission is working towards obtaining ground movement clearance from the relevant authorities," he said. But Bett said that the travelers must be in possession of a Kenyan passport with a valid Indian visa. "Be in possession of coronavirus free certificate which must have been issued within seven days of departure time," he said. "Be in possession of a Kenyan Airways ticket for Mumbai-Nairobi flight. The domestic airline shall not provide any food, beverage or other refreshments to passengers other than drinking water." A flight from Mumbai takes at least six hours. Last week, the tickets for that flight were being sold from Sh85, 894 for business class and Sh45,635 for economy.
