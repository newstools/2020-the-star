The Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) has won a case to collect taxes worth Sh1.3 billion from Van Den Berg limited, a Dutch flower firm operating in Kenya. The firm had filed a case in April 2016 seeking the dismissal of a tax assessment issued by the Commissioner of Domestic Taxes but the High Court in Nairobi has quashed the case. In his ruling delivered virtually, Justice J.M. Bwonwong’a found that the company had not exhausted the dispute resolution mechanism provided under Section 12 of the Tax Appeal Tribunal Act. Bwonwong’a stated that a party may only be excused from complying with the stipulations of the said section if it demonstrates that the Tax Appeal Tribunal, was ineffective or that there were exceptional or unusual circumstances in its application to warrant the filing of the Judicial Review Application. KRA had selected the firm for a tax audit for the period 2008-2013. After the audit, KRA issued a Notice of Assessment of Sh1,340,142,438 in respect of Van Den’s Corporation tax (including Transfer Pricing), Withholding Income Tax, Value Added Tax, Pay As You Earn (PAYE) and Kebs levy. Van Den then filed the case challenging the assessment and the objection decision by the Commissioner of Domestic Taxes. KRA opposed the case and raised a preliminary objection that Van Den had not exhausted the dispute resolution mechanism available under The Tax Appeals Tribunal Act and that the High Court could not handle the case when there were other alternative methods of dealing with the dispute. The High Court in its ruling agreed with KRA’s position and ruled that the issues before it were not of a judicial review nature and ought to have been litigated before the Tax Appeals Tribunal. The court further found that the onus was on Van Den to demonstrate that it had exhausted the available dispute resolution mechanisms in the Tax Appeals Tribunal.
