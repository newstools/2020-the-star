The Mombasa county government has waived quarantine fees for some residents admitted at their facilities. In a statement on Saturday, the Department of Health in the county struck an agreement with the Kenya Medical Training College at Portreiz and Mombasa Campus to release 38 people who were quarantined at the institutions. This comes days after some patients complained they can not afford Sh28,000 they were to pay, after their quarantine period was over. According to Health CEC Hazel Koitaba, this is in line with the countyâ€™s resolve to come to the rescue of those who are unable to pay the quarantine fees of Sh2,000 per day to the institutions. "Twenty were due for discharge today at Portreiz and 18 at Mombasa Campus," she said. Last week, Muslims for Human Rights moved to court seeking orders to compel the government pay quarantine funds for patients admitted at their quarantine centres. Mombasa county has 129 confirmed coronavirus cases. Governor Hassan Joho has been on the front line urging residents to go for testing. Joho, while reading the Riot Act to Old Town residents on Saturday, revealed that out of the 11 deaths reported from the region, six came from Old Town. Mass testing began this week, with Old Town being one of the targeted areas after 15 cases were reported from the area. But residents kept off the exercise. Joho said culture, and also religious factors are contributing to their attitude. The mass testing rolled out on Thursday, will go on for some days.
