Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang’ula has urged MCAs to hold the executive accountable to deter corruption. Speaking during the burial of Patrick Waka in Sibanga village, Malakisi/South Kulisiru ward, Wetang’ula said Covid-19 funds should be spent prudently. He told MCAs that it is their mandate to ensure that funds are properly utilised and that there should be an audit to investigate recent corruption cases. “You have heard it from the media that there is misuse of public funds. MCAs should play their role without fear or favour," the Ford Kenya party leader said. “When we are busy fighting Covid-19, some people are busy looting from the kitty. We cannot allow some individuals to make the kitty their cash cow; let’s put our priorities right.” The Bungoma government was on the spot for buying 600, 20-litre jerrycans at Sh10,000 each. MCAs, led by Health committee chairman George Makari, have accused the executive of misusing Sh11 million meant for the Covid-19 fight. Wetang’ula also asked county government employees to stop insulting leaders who demand accountability. “We have some county employees named in corruption cases but have resorted to insulting leaders through social media. Their days are numbered and the governor should tame his ‘dogs’,” Wetang’ula said. Edited by Josephine M. Mayuya
