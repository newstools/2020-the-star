Four suspected gang members were on Wednesday morning shot dead by DCI detectives on Kangundo Road. Two Pistols -a Tokarev, a mini Ceska plus 13 bullets were recovered after the incident. In a Twitter post, the directorate said the four suspects were narrowed down by a team of SSU detectives tasked with the "No Guns for Gangs" endeavour. "Acting on intelligence, the team which has been pursuing an armed criminal gang operating in Nairobi and its environs intercepted a Toyota Sienta Reg. No KCH 366F along Kangundo Road occupied by four members of the gang," the DCI said. The suspects are said to have defied orders to surrender opening fire on the sleuths. One detective -a section commander - was unfortunately hit in the crossfire and another bullet hitting a civilian's vehicle. According to the DCI, that prompted the officers to respond, fatally injuring the suspects.
