Former Football Kenya Federation president Sam Nyamweya wants Fifa to bar the current regime from using the development funds to pay former Harambee Stars coaches. This comes hardly a day after former trainer Sebastien Migne threatened to take FKF to Fifa for their delay in paying him almost a year after parting ways. Nyamweya, who is eyeing a return at Kandanda House, also wants Zurich to force FKF to clear with the Frenchman and the duo of Bob Williamson and Adel Amrouche. “As it stands now, Kenya may be struck out of the qualifiers for the 2022 World Cup because of the federation's failure to pay former coach Amrouche. Williamson too is demanding his dues from the federation’s after his dismissal four years ago. Add that to the latest case of Migne. We, the stakeholders of Kenyan football, now want Fifa to force the federation to pay the three coaches soonest. We further implore on Fifa not to allow Mwendwa and his team to use the development funds to pay the coaches,” read part of the statement The former federation chief called on the government to swing into action and prosecute the current regime for what he alleged as misappropriation of funds meant for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations. Stars' captain Victor Wanyama confirmed on Monday that the playing unit had not received the winning allowance following their 3-2 triumph over Tanzania. “One year since the team played in the tournament, even the players are yet to get the bonuses of Ksh 250, 000 each promised to them. The office of FKF led by Nick Mwendwa has become notorious for not paying coaches their dues. We also ask the government to institute a legal process against the outgoing federation officials for misappropriation of funds meant for football development and failing to account for the Sh250 million accorded to them for the 2019 AFCON,” he added
