Clergymen in Githurai 45 have urged the government to reopen churches to help strained families. The clerics, under the auspice of City Rebuilders Prayer Movement, said the Church can help end wrangles in homes, stop marriages breaking up and heal emotional turmoil.   Chairman Rev Edward Muchoki of Kingdom Seekers Fellowship Church said they will adhere to the laid down guidelines, including social distancing, washing hands, sanitising and fumigating their churches. “Most families are going through hard times due to the coronavirus pandemic. People have lost their jobs, there’s no food or money to sustain their families," Muchoki said. "They have lost hope. The church plays a big role in providing hope and spiritual support in times of crises such as the current pandemic. Therefore we humbly urge the government to open our places of worship.” He said other social ills such as robberies are on the rise as people resort to crime to make ends meet. Muchoki said the Church has played a significant role during past disasters. “The Church has always risen to the occasion and been on the forefront in helping the government combat crises that have bedevilled the country in the past. For instance, during the post-election violence of 2007-8, churches became the places of refuge and swiftly responded even in places where the government was unable to reach immediately,” he said. Rev Elijah Makisa of Stable Anchor Church said government guidelines will be strictly adhered to if churches reopen. Churches have been calling on the government to reconsider the closure order, which has forced many clergymen to look for other sources of income after church coffers ran dry. Edited by Josephine M.
