Kenyan nurses, midwives and other front line workers based at Mbagathi Hospital's Infectious Disease Unit participated in a zumba exercise session on Thursday. The session was organised by the Nursing Council of Kenya to mark the end of Nurse's Week in Nairobi. Healthcare workers suspended their strike notice two weeks ago to give dialogue a chance. The workers are decrying failure by the government to harmonise risk allowances meant for frontline health workers. “The government reached out on Friday and the next meeting will be today (Monday). We will have a meeting with the Labour CS, Health CS and the Council of Governors chairman,” Kenya Union of Clinical Officer's chairman Peterson Wachira said.
