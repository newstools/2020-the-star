According to the World Health Organisation, a parent can prevent measles by ensuring those around the baby are vaccinated. Babies are best protected by “cocooning,” which means ensuring everyone they come in contact with (parents, grandparents, siblings, caregivers) is up to date on their vaccination schedule. Imran Khares, a paediatrician at Gertrude's Children's Hospital, says you can't really prevent measles but reduce the risk. “A child can get it from places of play or even when another child has it and they have come in contact,” he said. To prevent measles in children, doctors usually give infants the first dose of the vaccine between 12 and 15 months, with the second dose typically given between ages 4 and 6 years. From 2015, the second measles dosage coverage stood at 32 per cent, but it increased to 42 per cent in 2018. Second dose coverage stands at 67 per cent globally, whereas in Kenya, it is at 42 per cent, way below the required percentage needed to prevent outbreaks. In 2018, more than one in 10 missed out on lifesaving vaccines, such as measles, diphtheria and tetanus. Globally, since 2010, vaccination coverage with three doses of diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis and one dose of the measles vaccine has stalled at around 86 per cent, and yet 95 per cent coverage is needed globally to protect against outbreaks. In Kenya, for the last 10 years, there was no case of diphtheria reported. In 2001, the country reported six cases and these were the last cases reported. According to the latest WHO data published in 2017, measles deaths in Kenya reached 1,033 or 0.37 per cent of total deaths.
