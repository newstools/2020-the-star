Police are investigating the death of a suspected robber who was killed by a mob on Friday evening in Matuu, Yatta subcounty. The body was moved to Matuu Level 4 Hospital mortuary, awaiting identification and a postmortem. The suspect, in the company of another man who escaped, allegedly tried to rob 19-year-old boda boda rider Richard Mutuku. According to a police report, the unidentified suspects approached Mutuku pretending to be customers but soon tried to rob him. "Upon reaching Matuu modern slaughterhouse, the two suspects attempted to strangle him with a rope. They intended to rob him of his motorcycle," the report says. The rider raised the alarm as he struggled with the suspects and a crowd came to his rescue. He sustained minor injuries on the left hand and the lower lip. One suspect fled into a maize plantation and the police are still looking for him. "Members of the public responded and managed to rescue him and fatally injured one of the suspects who is a male adult aged around 30 years," the police say in the report. Elsewhere, two men caught violating the cessation of movement directive were arrested on Friday and held at the Yatta police station in Machakos county. They were from Thika, which is part of the Nairobi metropolis. Yatta police said Noor Abdi, 48, and Mohammed Yusuf, 27, were arrested in Matuu town after the rider was intercepted. Preliminary investigations revealed that the two had travelled from Kariobangi in Nairobi via Thika. The rider escaped. Abdi and Yusuf were screened for Covid-19 by the subcounty public health officer but the results had yet to be released. "The subcounty public health officer Emmanuel Kisilu visited the station for initial screening and their condition is suspicious," the report said. They will be arraigned in Kithimani on Monday and will be charged with failing to comply with the directive meant to combat the spread of Covid-19.  (Edited by F'Orieny)
