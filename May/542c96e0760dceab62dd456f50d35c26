@eosere Six people who allegedly held a party in Malaba town the night a clearing agent was murdered have been arrested. The party allegedly took place about 200 metres from the scene Paul Etori’s body was discovered on Saturday morning. The man, 38, was murdered on Friday night. But senior police officers in Teso North have remained tight-lipped about the arrests. An officer privy to the ongoing investigations, however, told the Star that the arrests were made in relation to the murder incident. Two of those arrested are said to have been close work friends of Etori who was stabbed 12 times. He left two widows and six children. The party is said to have been held at a house alleged to belong to a female friend near a popular bar located along a backstreet in Malaba town. The officer who spoke to the Star cannot be named as he is not authorised to comment about the issue to the press. On Sunday, Teso North police chief Wilson Muraya told residents of Malaba town to allow police to carry out investigations, arrest and prosecute those suspected to be part of the group that carried out the act. He said officers from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations are handling the case and asked Etori’s family to remain calm and allow law enforcers complete investigations. Muraya said DCI officers are following up crucial leads which may lead to the arrest and subsequent prosecution of the killers. “The motive of the murder is still unknown,” he said while assuring members of the public that the perpetrators will be arrested and arraigned. He dispelled rumours of burglary since the killers did not take any of the valuables belonging to Etori. Two mobile phones, a wallet, a bike and a bag that contained Sh70,000 were found intact at the murder scene. Edited by R.Wamochie
