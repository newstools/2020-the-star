The government has warned Kenyans who fled from Eastleigh and Old Town, after a lockdown was announced. "We are appealing to these families. For those welcoming those members, you are placing yourself in danger. Those within these areas, please remain in there," Health CAS Rashid Aman said. "If you are infected unknowingly, then you have spread the disease. By moving out there, there is a chance that you are a carrier. You must assume that you are a carrier." Aman said this should remain in the conscience of people sneaking out. On Wednesday, the government locked down Eastleigh and Old Town as coronavirus cases surge. There will be no movement into and out of the areas effective Wednesday at 7pm for 15 days, Health CS Mutahi Kagwe said. "You cannot leave the area to go to another area. This will take place for 15 days," he said. But immediately he announced this, there were reports that some people sneaked to go to neighboring estates. Kenya has recorded 25 new cases bringing total number to 607. Aman said from this number, 22 are Kenyans, one Ugandan, one Tanzanian and one Chinese. A total of 21 are male and four are female. Aman said Eastleigh is leading with nine cases. Kenya has recorded seven new discharges, bringing the total to 197. Three more patients have died, bringing the total to 29. Early Thursday, the business district in Eastleigh was a ghost town following an the lock down order. The move was necessitated after residents kept on with activities despite the government's call for Kenyans to limit movement and stay home. Few people were seen on the streets on Thursday and there are roadblocks.
