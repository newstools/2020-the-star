Douglas Mayanja, aka Weasel Manizo, has welcomed another child into the family. This time, it's with Miss University Rwanda 2014, TV host and events organiser Teta Sandra. It is a baby girl by the name Star Ria Mayanja. Weasel's elder brother Chameleon announced the birth of the child on Instagram. "Congratulations upon your newly born baby Star Maria Mayanja. Welcome to Mother Earth," he wrote. This is Weasel's fifth child. His mother Proscovia Mayanja was quoted by Ugandan media pundits last year defending his family size after he welcomed his fourth child in August last year with baby mama Samirah Khasim. “It’s not true that my son has very many kids. Actually he has only four,” she said. Weasel is the remaining half of Radio and Weasel after Mowzey Radio died on February 1, 2018, following a bar fight.
