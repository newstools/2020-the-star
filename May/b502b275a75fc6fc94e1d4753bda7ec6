Kisumu MCA Seth Ochieng has demanded the immediate closure of the Garissa Lodge market within the Central Business District. Ochieng said the market has been operating normally despite the closure of others, putting locals at the risk of the coronavirus. “It is business as usual in that market. That must stop immediately to protect our people from the pandemic,” Ochieng said on Sunday. The Market Milimani ward rep wondered why the market has been allowed to operate yet open-air markets have been closed. “We must stop selective implementation of the directives issued by the Ministry of Health in combating the Covid-19 pandemic,” Ochieng said. He said most of the goods being sold in the market come from Eastleigh malls which the state has locked down due to rising numbers of Covid-19 cases. The Garissa Lodge market has malls, shops, and stalls which host hundreds of traders. Meanwhile, Kibuye market has been closed with traders temporarily relocated to alternative spaces. Ochieng said regulations such as wearing of masks in public spaces, handwashing and staying at home are not a punishment but are aimed at preventing the spread of the virus. He urged Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o and County Commissioner Susan Waweru to ensure measures towards fighting coronavirus are fully adhered to. His calls come amid uproar by some traders that they were being treated unfairly. They claimed the markets are selectively closed. In Kibuye, a section of shop owners engaged police on Wednesday, protesting alleged selective operations of shops. Nyong’o, however, maintained that all markets should be closed. He also directed that no eateries or restaurant should open until owners meet the strict guidelines by the national government. Nyong’o noted that most eateries and restaurants were yet to meet the laid strict measures by the national government. (edited by o. owino)
