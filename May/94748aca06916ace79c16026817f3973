With a myriad sports personalities working out from behind the scenes in the midst of COVID-19 pandemic, top Kenyan golfer Eric Ooko is leaving nothing to chance. Ooko, who finished fourth on the 2019/2020 Safari Tour rankings, has gone back to his daily grind at Nairobi’s Golf Park, where he’s keeping shape on the driving range and course. The Golf Park man is working to perfect various facets of his game—ranging from his tee and wedge shots to chipping and putting on the practice green— just to ensure he doesn’t get rusty in the current situation, where sporting activities are adversely affected. “By the way, I have been practising at Golf Park because you never know when this COVID-19 situation will end. The essence is to keep fit as we await for things will get better. So I am okay in terms of fitness,” said Ooko, who started playing golf at Golf Park, Nairobi way back in 2009 as a caddie. Last season saw Ooko lead one of the rounds of Safari Tour jointly with Simon Ngige. His consistency has seen him stick to the fourth overall position behind champion Dismas Indiza, second-placed Simon Ngige and Greg Snow. “I was on form and my objective was to make the cut at the Kenya Open. Sadly, I couldn’t fulfil my dream after the Magical Kenya Open was postponed.” Ooko, who has played in the Kenya Open since 2015, has missed the cut by a solitary shot on two occasions. “I was in very good form and was looking forward to the Kenya Open,” Ooko, who realised his golfing potential at Golf Park, said. Before joining the playing ranks, he used to caddie for Jacob Okello in the Kenya Open and at various pro events. Ooko has had a dream to play a lot more in the main European Tour so that he could join players like Rory McIlroy. “I know we can do it,” he said. His Tour aspirations came to fruition when the Magical Kenya Open was upgraded to European Tour status. “Though I know I’m not that young, we just need to focus and practice very hard.”
