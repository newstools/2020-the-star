The body of a Kiambu tea picker who was swept away by a landslide last week on Wednesday at Kamahindu village was recovered on Saturday. Efforts to dig up the soil that had covered the body of James Kamau were thwarted by rains. Lari deputy county commissioner Aaron Koros on Sunday thanked joint operations between national government, the Red Cross Society, St John Ambulance and the Kiambu county government. He said the officers risked their lives in the rain to dig the muddy section which was approximately a quarter of an acre. Kamau was picking tea after Tuesday's night rain when the landslide happened. Farm proprietor Peter Ngigi described Kamau as a hardworking man who was self-driven. Ngigi said they were three pickers when the landslide happened but the other two were on the upper side. "They started screaming when they saw what happened and we responded," he said. Koros warned residents not to cultivate on the sloppy sides, saying many farmers have uprooted trees that used to hold soils. He revealed that together with county government, they will hold public barazas to enlighten people on the trees that they should grow to reduce the risk of landslides. "When these rains subside, we shall be holding public meetings to educate people on which trees to grow and the reasons why we should not cut down trees and uproot their stumps," Koros said. He suspended any cutting of trees in people's farms. Water and Environment executive David Kuria urged residents not to cultivate the riparian areas since they block water paths. Koros said more than 50 residents in the subcounty have been displaced by landslides and floods. He urged chiefs, assistant chiefs and Nyumba Kumi officials to be vigilant and report to his office any case that poses a threat of flooding or landslide for action. Edited by R.Wamochie
