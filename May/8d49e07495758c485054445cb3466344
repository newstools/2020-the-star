The African Union Mission in Somalia has distanced itself from a document that has been circulating on social media against its leadership and the Federal Government of Somalia. In a statement released on Friday, AMISOM stated that the document makes numerous unfounded allegations against its leadership and the Federal Government of Somalia. It added that it is full of inconsistencies, generalizations, innuendos and biased toxic personal opinion. "The AMISOM that is described in the document does not fit the reality of the AMISOM currently operating in Somalia under the leadership of Ambassador Francisco Madeira," the statement read in part. AMISOM has however rejected the allegations adding that they distort and misrepresent the mission, its work, its leadership and its achievements. "There is no lack of leadership in AMISOM. AMISOM is managed by a senior Mission Leadership Team which sees to it that AMISOM's operations are guided by the highest ethical principles and standards derived from African Union values in order to enhance the protection of staff and the integrity of the AU." AMISOM further added that these principles demand mutual respect and cooperation with all the partners that we work with.
