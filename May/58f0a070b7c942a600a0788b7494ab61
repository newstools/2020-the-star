Hillpark Hotel on Friday provided lunch to medical practitioners who are in the front line of the fight against the coronavirus at Mbagathi Hospital. Hillpark general manager Joseph Ndunda said, "The medical doctors are working so hard to save the nation, and we as Hillpark hotel felt it was a good idea to appreciate them by providing lunch." Nurse Monica Bore said they sometimes work so hard that they forget to have any meal. Mbagathi Hospital chairman George Sawe said the doctors and nurses who have been working tirelessly felt nice since there are people out there recognising their work.
