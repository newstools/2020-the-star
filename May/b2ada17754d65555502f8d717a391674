Unaitas Sacco paid out Sh500 million to its members during the first of its kind virtual Annual General Meeting (AGM) held over the weekend. The sacco, with over 320,000 members countrywide, issued 7 per cent dividend, plus 3 per cent additional loyalty dividend for each share held by its members. “The growth in performance is attributed to the confidence of its members in its governance and management structures and aggressive business development strategies we have put forth,” Unaitas CEO Martin Muhoho said. The Sacco, which held its national elections in March, said it aimed at ensuring all were represented in the governance and running of the sacco’s operations. Before the first case of coronavirus was reported in the country on March 13, Unaitas had scheduled the AGM in Nairobi aimed at breaking past chain of hosting the annual meetings in Muranga. The meeting held over the weekend was the first in the sacco’s history to include delegates from all its 26 branches countrywide. “The plan is to have the various delegates following the proceeding online but they will have an opportunity to fully participate despite them being apart from each other,” Muhoho said.
