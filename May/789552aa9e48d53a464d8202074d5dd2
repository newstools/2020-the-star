The government has come to the rescue of over 2,000 youth in Naivasha by offering them manual jobs under the Kazi Mtaani Initiative. The move targets mainly flower farm workers who lost their jobs and those affected by floods in the lakeside town. Naivasha subcounty commissioner Mbogo Mathioya said the youth would be involved in cleaning the town, unclogging drainage systems and clearing bushes along the highway. “We have embarked on the process of hiring 2,000 youths from informal settlements under the Kazi Mtaani Initiative to empower them during these hard times,” he said. The initiative will benefit youth aged between 18 and 35 years. Some of the estates set to benefit are Kihoto, KCC, Karagita, Kabati and Kayole, where levels of unemployment and poverty are very high. The intervention came after Kihoto residents called for urgent measures to unclog the drainage systems. Residents blamed the current flooding on blocked drainages. In the last month, more than 4,000 people have been displaced by floods in Naivasha. Area leader Joyce Ndegwa said life had become harder by the day due to the ongoing rains. “Part of the problem in this estate is the poor drainage system and whenever it rains, water finds its way into our houses,” she said. Resident Robert Ndirangu noted that flooded latrines posed the biggest challenge to residents. “Children are playing in the floodwater which is mixed with human waste, and we fear this could lead to a major disease outbreak,” he said.
