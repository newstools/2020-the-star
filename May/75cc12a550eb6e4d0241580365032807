Musingu High School Scorpions have received a major boost following the addition of coach Teddy Asudzi as head coach Brendan Mwinamo. The youthful Asudzi had a successful outing with Lugari Blue Saints at the 2019 Chapa Dimba na Safaricom tournament and has been instrumental for Mautuma and Lugari secondary schools consistent performances. He said he is ready to work with a bench full of experienced coaches including former Kenyan international goalkeeper Washington Muhanji. Asudzi, brother to former AFC Leopards and Kakamega Homeboyz striker Gideon Asudzi, said: “It has been my dream to work for this great team and I am happy that the board has agreed that I join the team. As far as secondary schools’ football is concerned, Musingu is a big team and we want to see the team back to its rightful position." “Musingu is a brand that should be protected. We know it’s work in process, but as a team, we are ready to sacrifice and put good structures in place so that we can achieve our goal and make the school a football powerhouse again," he added. “I am yet to meet the playing unit due to coronavirus pandemic break but I trust that the technical bench has done a good job in identifying players who can compete at the national level. "Let our fans remain patient as we work out on structures that will see us reclaim our lost glory,” urged Asudzi. Mwinamo warmly welcomed the move, terming it the best for the school as they plot a swift comeback in top-level football. With the entry of former St. Luke Bwake Secondary Principal Bernard Lukuya, Musingu has become very active again with trials to scout the best stars and also registering the team in FKF-organised branch league.
