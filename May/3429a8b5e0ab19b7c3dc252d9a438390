A man from Mastoo village in Ndaragwa, Nyandarua county, was on Sunday evening hacked to death by his uncle for attempting to kill his grandmother. Simon Mbaria, 25, allegedly wanted to kill Beatrice Wamaitha, 78, and his uncle Josphat Ndungo, 54. Nyandarua North subcounty police boss Timon Odingo on Monday confirmed the incident. He said Ndungo found Wamaitha under attack and when he intervened, the assailant turned against him, forcing him (Ndungo) to strike back. Odingo said after the incident the uncle fled and security officers are still looking for him. A resident, who spoke to the Star on the phone on condition of anonymity, said it was raining when Mbaria went to his grandmother’s house and told her that the time for her and her son to die had come. He looked for a panga in her house but when he failed to find one, he locked the door from outside, so he could get the weapon from his house. Wamaitha opened the window and screamed for help. Her son, who was attending to his cows, rushed to her house to find out what was happening. On arrival, he found Mbaria armed with a panga, and he [Mbaria] cut Ndungo on the hand. He attempted to run to his house but the younger man pursued him and cut him again on the back. The uncle wrestled the younger man to the ground and the panga slipped from Mbaria's hand. Ndungo, who the resident said had already sustained five panga cuts, picked the weapon and slashed his nephew to death. The resident said Mbaria has been terrorising his grandmother and uncle and has even been jailed twice, and on many other occasions, police officers arrested and released him. “Even yesterday [Sunday], when they were informed there was chaos, they did not want to intervene. They only came to the scene after death was reported," the resident said. Mbaria's body was moved to Nyahururu County Referral Hospital mortuary. Edited by A.N
