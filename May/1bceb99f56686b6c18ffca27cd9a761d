Kakamega Homeboyz chairman Cleophas Shimanyula has claimed Gor Mahia players want the Kenyan Premier League (KPL) season played to the end. The Kenyan top-flight, which was suspended in March owing to the coronavirus pandemic, was ended by the Football Kenya Federation (FKF) who went ahead to declare Gor Mahia champions as they were leading the 17-team table with 54 points. Homeboyz, who were second, seven points behind and with a game in hand, protested bitterly on the decision to award K’Ogalo the title, with KPL also saying the move was not final and that the fate of the league will be decided on May 18 when the curfew imposed by the Kenyan government elapses. Shimanyula has now told Goal several Gor Mahia players have called him and said they would rather play and win the league on the field of play. “You can see even until now Gor Mahia have not celebrated despite being crowned by FKF as champions,” Shimanyula said. “Some of the players at the club are not happy with FKF, some of them have even called me stating they are ready to play the season to the end. They don’t want to be crowned by boardroom acts. They want to play the remaining matches and win the league on the field of play," Shimanyula observed. “It is very clear Gor Mahia have remained silent since they were declared winners. They have not even welcomed the move, they have not even said if they are ready for the Caf competition next season and that clearly shows you there is something wrong.” Shimanyula said he is supportive of KPL’s decision to go to court to have FKF’s decision invalidated.
