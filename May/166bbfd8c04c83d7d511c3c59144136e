More than 40 Kenyans have been arrested while crossing back into the country from Tanzania at the border town of Taveta. They were arrested at different areas along the Kenya-Tanzania border during police patrols. "Our team is closely working with Nyumba Kumi to nab those crossing through undesignated areas in Madarasani, Chala and other areas along the border," Taveta subcounty police commander Lawrence Marwa said on the phone. He said the majority of those returning from Tanzania are locals who work in Moshi and Arusha. Marwa said some notorious business people were crossing the porous border illegally. This comes days after a suspected coronavirus victim escaped from isolation in Tanzania. He was howeverÂ tested in Kenya and confirmed negative. The 31-year old man, a resident of Taveta, had crossed over to Tanzania and was put in a quarantine facility in Rombo district. Visiting the Taveta-Holili One-Stop Border Point on Thursday, Taita Taveta Governor Granton Samboja said plans are in top gear to test truck drivers at the border. "This is a key entry point and all measures are being put in place. Testing will commence to avert any possible transmission of Covid-19," he said. As of Monday, May 4, Taita Taveta Health department had taken 22 samples to the regional Covid-19 testing laboratories. Samboja also visited the new isolation unit in Taveta Subcounty Hospital. He applauded the surveillance team in its handling of suspected cases. The County Disease Surveillance Team has so far responded to 281 cases out of which 235 have been put on quarantine while 46 have been managed for other conditions. About 154 people have been released from quarantine. The team is also monitoring another 63 people under mandatory quarantine and 18 under self- quarantine. The county has not reported a coronavirus case. Edited by Josephine M. Mayuya
