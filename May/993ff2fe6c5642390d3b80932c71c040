The Kisumu county assembly has approved Governor Anyang' Nyong'o's Roads executive nominee Joyce Osogo. The assembly on Tuesday afternoon unanimously approved the report by the Appointment committee following vetting two weeks ago. The report was tabled by Majority leader Kenneth Onayngo and seconded by nominated MCA Aslam Khan. Onyango said the nominee scored 58.5, which was above the average mark. He said the docket needs a leader who is straightforward, strict and not easily compromised by cartels. "This docket needs a no-nonsense person. We have witnessed cases where contractors have been paid but abandoned their work. The Roads department generally has issues and I believe she will bring a change," Railways MCA David Arao said. Philemon Ojuok said the department needed a project manager and he was happy that the nominee is knowledgeable in that. He said there was lack of coordination of projects. "The department needs someone who will take the challenges head on and clean the environment," Ojuok said, adding that they will oversight her accordingly. Osogo is a specialist in project planning and implementation, and has wide experience in innovative work in diverse social sectors. Two months ago, the county assembly stepped up monitoring of all ward-funded projects by moving committee meetings to the different sites. Preliminary site visits showed that some contractors had already been paid for doing shoddy or incomplete work. The MCAs threatened to block payments to contractors who failed to redo projects identified as sub-standard. Project Monitoring Committee chairman Jacktone Guya said some roads projects that did not meet the set designs and specifications. Guya said they were preparing reports on sub-standard projects. Last October, Governor Anyang' Nyong’o sacked Roads CEC Thomas Ondijo and two others as he reorganised his cabinet. Lands executive Dickson Obungu has been holding the position in an acting capacity.
