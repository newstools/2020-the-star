Kenya Basketball Federation (KBF) will go to the polls a month after action resumes, according to assistant secretary Ambrose Kisoi revealed. According to the calendar of events released by Kisoi, KBF elections will be the first item on the agenda once the government gives the go-ahead. “The elections will be 30 days upon normalisation of operations,” said Kisoi, adding that the exercise will be followed by pre-season tournament 15 days later. KBF polls were slated for April 25 but were cancelled off due to coronavirus pandemic. KBF secretary-general, Vitalis Gode said he will not seek re-election after doing four terms. Kisoi said the opening games of the season will start a week after the pre-season, which will be used to assess the players' readiness. “In order to kick off the 2020 season smoothly, we intend to activate all the preparation of players cards during the break,” Kisoi said. The decision as to when KBF calendar will conform to the international one, he said, will be discussed at length during a stakeholders meeting. He reiterated the federation’s stand to have all issue of players’ cards and transfer sorted out once and for all before the action starts. “The response is positive. Some teams have responded by asking for registration forms while some expressed difficulties,” he said.
