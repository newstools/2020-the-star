The debate on cancellation of the 2019/2020 season by the Football Kenya Federation continues with FKF Division One side Bungoma Super Stars coach Andrew Kanuli supporting the move. However, Kanuli said the football governing body should have consulted with Kenyan Premier League, National Super League and Division One clubs before making the decision. “The decision made by the federation was wise but they failed to engage the main stakeholders. The hue and cry over the cancellation you are hearing would not be there if they consulted,” said the tactician. “I know there are many aggrieved parties and I hope the federation will give them a hearing for the sake of the beautiful game.” “We are not yet at the peak of the coronavirus. I’m sure the earliest the league can resume is in August. It is better we start preparing for next season.” Kanuli remained confident that he will guide Bungoma Super Stars to the National Super League next season. “Our target was to qualify to the second tier league this season but that is now impossible. We have no option but turn our focus to next season,” said the youthful coach. The federation through the general secretary announced the cancelation of the league a week ago. Following the decision, Silibwet and Mwatate United were declared winners of FKF Division One Zone 'B' and 'A' respectively and consequently promoted to the NSL. Runners up in the two zones Soy FC and MCF will meet in a playoff to determine the third team to qualify for the NSL. Masinde Murilo University of Science and Technology (MMUST), Raiply, St Joseph’s Youth Academy, Makueni Nunguni, Strathmore University and Green Berets were relegated from the Third Tier.
