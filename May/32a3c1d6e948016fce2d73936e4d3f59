A suspected al Shabaab militant and two minors were killed on Friday night, while four of his family members were seriously injured during a police shoot out at Kibundani in Ukunda. County police commander Joesph Nthenge said a multi-agency team of officers had launched a firearms recovery operation after a tip-off that the suspect was planning to attack a police station. It said the police had traced on one of the main Shabaab recruiters, who led them to the house of Mohammed Mapenzi, alias Spanya, where they went to search for the hidden firearms. According to Nthenge, Mapenzi attacked the officers using a grenade after defying orders to surrender. “Police had ordered the suspect to open the door but he refused and threw a grenade slightly injuring an officer,” said Nthenge. He said the police retaliated by opening fire, killing him and two minors whom the deceased had used as a shield. The suspect’s wife and three other children were also among the injured and are recuperating in Msambweni Referral Hospital. Police recovered a grenade and assorted jungle uniform. Msambweni sub-county police commander Nehemiah Bitok confirmed that two suspects are already in police custody and will help in the investigation. Bitok said Mapenzi had a record of criminal activities and has been on the police radar. He, however, said it is not yet clear if the two minors who died are the suspect's family members. The bodies were taken to Kwale mortuary. The police have launched investigations.
