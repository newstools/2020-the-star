APA Insurance has launched a mobile app to enable motorists make fast and safe insurance purchases, renewals and report claims. “The launch of the app is strategic as many of our clients and agents switch to remote working, in line with the Government advice for people to work from home,” CEO APA Insurance, Vinod Bharatan said. The agent’s app will enable them to access a premium calculator, agent account management, pre-insurance inspection and renewal on the go, making them more effective and efficient when interacting with clients and potential clients. APA Insurance has also seen a surge in demand for online services and the app aims to serve as a solution that provides customers with freedom and security online anytime, anywhere. “As the number of mobile apps and messaging platforms users grows, we will leverage our in-house digital capabilities to further elevate customers' experience by taking our digital service to the platforms of their choice,” said Bharatan. Once customers and agents download the APA Insurance app and register for the service, their virtual account will be issued instantly. Motorists will receive a digital insurance certificate instantly upon purchase or renewal. The app provides a tailored dashboard in a single overview and provides access to payment history, benefits and claims details. Users can upload accident photos and instantly file a claim report. The new mobile app provides coverage against fraud, safeguards and supports customers in case of defective or damaged online claims. The app also provides locations of APA's country wide partner garages in case of an accident.
