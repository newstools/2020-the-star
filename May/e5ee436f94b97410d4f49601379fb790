National Police Service Commission chairman Eliud Kinuthia has said he is ready for any probe by the EACC into claims of nepotism and unfair dismissal of police officers. On May 28, the Ethics and Anti-corruption Commission received a letter calling for investigations into conduct of Kinuthia. “The reasons that led to the establishment of the NPSC [the National Police Service Commission] was to enable a civilian body to watch over police matters. However, Mr Kinuthia has reversed all gains the police officers have been enjoying by taking the HR [human resource] responsibilities back to the service,” the letter said. The author claimed that six staffers have been fired and replaced with others from his community. “They have been replaced by a number of new staff members from his ethnic group who comprise of his son, his brother0-in-law and his sister-in-law, among many others. All individuals he has recruited since his arrival in the commission come from Lamu,” the letter read in part. The author further claimed the commission boss was involved in “worst form of abuse of office not fit for a state officer.” However, Kinuthia said he was being accused because of doing what is right by undertaking reforms at the commission. “Remember I have been there consistently over 12 years since inception of reforms and authored five different  reform strategy books…EACC is welcome with or without notice to establish facts for themselves,” Kinuthia said. NPSC oversees the human resource functions of the National Police Service. It also receives and investigates complaints by members of the service, monitoring and investigating policing operations affecting members of the public. “These anonymous accusers are all over…if you are doing what is right you expect such,” Kinuthia said.
