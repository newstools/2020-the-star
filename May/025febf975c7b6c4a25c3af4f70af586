Kikuyu MP Kimani Ichung’wa has a way of leaving MPs in stitches, especially in his customary wordplay with Majority leader Aden Duale. So emphatic he can move an agenda but not on this day when he moved the motion on the Supplementary Appropriations Bill, 2020. Instead of delving on the details of the legislation, the lawmaker went into a conversation of how he warded off a scammer who had threatened to leak a video recording of him. Duale, when he rose on his feet to second the motion, drew the attention of his colleagues to listen to the hilarious experience the Budget chair just said.  Hours later in the afternoon sitting, the Kikuyu lawmaker staged a ‘battle of seats’ prompting Kitui South MP Rachel Nyamai to report him to Speaker Justin Muturi. The Kitui South MP lamented that she couldn’t withstand the bullish approach she got from Ichung’wa, who was adamant that she had to move. But even in the midst of her woes, Nyamai still had room for a light touch with her reference to a ‘good looking’ sergeant-at-arms whom she complained of beckoning her to leave the seat. This was in the face of Ichung’wa warning that she’d have to leave the spot for him to move his business of the day.  Away from the seat debacle, National Assembly sittings are never a boring affair regardless of the weight of business the members are engaging in. Any small matter or incident can spark a round of endless teases among members. This time round, it was Kesses MP Swarup Mishra who was to take the punches. Deputy Speaker Moses Cheboi kept taunting him that his face mask was soundproof hence could not hear what the legislator was saying. Well, this went on for some time before Majority leader Aden Duale came with a spoiler that probably it was the lawmaker’s heavy accent that the deputy speaker couldn’t fathom his point of order.
