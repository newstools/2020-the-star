Some Nairobi estates will not get water after heavy downpour in Aberdare Ranges caused the shutting down of Ng’ethu treatment works. Areas affected include the of whole City Centre, University of Nairobi main campus, Coca Cola Factory, Jomo Kenyatta International Airport and EPZ- Athi River. In a press release on Friday, Nairobi City Water and Sewerage Company said that the increased river flow has caused high turbidity in the raw water.  The company suspected a landslide upstream. “This has necessitated the shutting of the Ng’ethu water treatment plant to avoid transmission of water which does not meet the World Health Organization standards which we ascribe to,” the statement reads. Ng’ethu treatment plant serves 85 per cent of water to Nairobi and is designed to treat water with less turbidity efficiently.  Nairobi Water said the raw water flowing into the treatment plant has failed to respond to the chemicals. Solutions are underway to ensure the treatment process is operational and normalised and water supply is expected to resume by 6pm. Other areas affected are as follows: Along Mombasa road; South B, South C and the neighbourhoods including the whole of Industrial area. Along Juja Road: Mlango Kubwa, Mathare, Eastleigh, Airforce base, Huruma , Kariobangi and Pangani estates. Areas along Jogoo road: Maringo, Buruburu and the surrounding estates including Bahati.
