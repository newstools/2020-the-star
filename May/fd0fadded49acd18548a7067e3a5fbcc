Kenya has reported three more Covid-19 deaths, raising the number to 55. Health CS Mutahi Kagwe on Wednesday said the three had underlying ailments including diabetes and breast cancer. The CS said currently seven other patients are in critical condition, out of which four are on ventilators while three on supplementary support. "As you can see our numbers are staggering, out of the 3,077 samples tested in the last 24 hours, 123 people tested positive," he said. Kagwe said the Covid-19 treatment is being administered in 30 health facilities across the country. He added that out of the positive cases, Nairobi was leading with 85 cases followed by Mombasa with 24 cases and Kiambu county with four cases. Nairobi's Mathare slum registered the highest number at 33 cases, raising concerns over the rate of infections in informal settlements. "For instance, the public vehicles are the primary means of transportation in these areas but it is shocking at how matatus are disregarding the social distancing rules and overloading," Kagwe said.
