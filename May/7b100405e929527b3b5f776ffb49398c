The East African Legislative Assembly has been urged to push Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni to complete the construction of a dam in River Nile that has caused water backflow in Lake Victoria. Speaking to the Star on Wednesday, Budalang'i MP Raphael Wanjala said that although Museveni wants to produce adequate power supply for his country’s economic gain, he should also take into account the devastating effects the power generation project has caused in Kenya. He said the blockage of River Nile, which is the outlet of Lake Victoria, has increased the volume of water to an alarming level to an extent that the lake water is now spilling into homesteads, learning institutions and business centres in the southern part of the constituency. “I urge the East African Legislative assembly to urge President Museveni to speed up the ongoing power generation project in River Nile to stop the backflow of water in Lake Victoria that has displaced thousands of residents to camps,” Wanjala said. The MP also urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to hold talks with his Ugandan counterpart over the matter. “Budalang'i residents have seriously been affected,” the legislator said. Edited by R.Wamochie
