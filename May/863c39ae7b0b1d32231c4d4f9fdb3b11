Up to 95 per cent of Mombasa Covid-19 patients are asymptomatic, Governor Hassan Joho said on Tuesday. The county has embarked on mass testing after a spike in the number of cases. As of Tuesday evening, 169 cases and 12 deaths had been recorded in Mombasa. Mombasa's fatality rate is 8.4 per cent, while the infection rate is at 4.4 per cent, according to data from the Ministry of Health. Mombasa has tested more than 3,279 people. Old Town was leading with 48 positive cases and seven deaths as of Tuesday evening. KPA had 42 cases from the 1,150 that were tested, Aga Khan Hospital recorded seven cases and 66 were from various areas within the county. “We have recorded a total of 12 mortalities of Covid-19. Of the dead, seven are from Old Town, two were from the Kenya Ports Authority, while Ganjoni, Bamburi and Majengo have one case each,” Joho said. The governor, who on Saturday threatened to force Old Town residents to undergo testing, has changed tack and is now pleading with them to test for the virus. “Old Town are our people, family, relatives and friends. They are not victims, but beneficiaries of enhanced government measures to curb Covid-19. I urge and implore our people to participate in this exercise,” Joho said. He said he understands Mombasa has various cultural practices that make the region vulnerable to Covid-19, which include unique weddings, worshipping and eating together. “I wish to urge my fellow citizens to put on hold these practices so that we may combat Covid-19,” Joho said. On Monday, Joho, Mvita MP Abdulswamad Nassir and Mombasa county commissioner Gilbert Kitiyo underwent public testing in Likoni.  Edited by Josephine M. Mayuya
