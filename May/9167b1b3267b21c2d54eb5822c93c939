Health CS Mutahi Kagwe has urged Kenyans using public transport to strictly follow the directives given when using this form of transport. Speaking during a press briefing on Wednesday, Kagwe stated that drivers and conductors are not adhering to instructions on the number of people who should be in a matatu or bus. "We have noticed that public transportation has reverted back to old ways. As you can see the numbers are high in areas where many use public transport. We appeal to them to follow the guidelines," Kagwe said. He added that Kenyans need to understand that the coronavirus disease does not choose who to infect and it does not know the rich or poor. "Once you assume the people around you are positive for Covid-19, then you will not remove your mask. I urge Kenyans to take their health seriously," the CS said. Kagwe also reminded the public that the informal settlements are most affected in Nairobi. This means that the disease is within the communities and that no one is safe. He also appealed to Kenyans to volunteer for testing in estates, adding that "knowing your status is important to you and those close to you". Kenya on Wednesday recorded 123 new cases of Covid-19, raising the country's total number to 1,471. This is the largest number recorded since the first case on March 13. The new cases were out of the 3,077 samples that were tested in the last 24 hours. This is also the largest number of tests that have been done so far. Of the new cases, Nairobi had 85 cases, Mombasa, 24 and Kiambu four. In Nairobi, 33 Mathare residents were recorded as positive. Three more people have died of Covid-19, raising the number to 55. All of the patients had pre-existing conditions; two had diabetes and one had hypertension.
