All coronavirus-related cases will now be heard at Kasarani Stadium. The decision was reached by the National Council on Administration of Justice (NCAJ) to avoid congestion in the courts. Ninety people were on Thursday charged with different counts of Covid-19 related offences at the Kasarani Stadium. The charges include driving and loitering during curfew hours. Chief magistrate Martha Mutuku and senior resident magistrate Zainab Abdul handled all the cases. The accused were fined Sh5,000 each for the offences, but those who were unable to pay have been committed to community service. Those undertaking community service will be supervised by probation officers. State counsels Joseph Riungu and Jacinta Nyamosi represented the DPP during the hearing of the cases. Riungu and Nyamosi alongside other court officials, were coordinating the setting up of the court in the stadium. According to the officials, the stadium was fumigated early this morning in preparation for the sessions.  Edited by A.N
