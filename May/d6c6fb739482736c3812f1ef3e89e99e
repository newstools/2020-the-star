Police should intensify the search for three human right campaigners who disappeared a week ago, a lobby has urged. Michael Njau, Samwel Mungai and Adan Saibu were reported missing on April 24 and OB opened at Thika police station. Some 20 organisations under the Police Reform Working Group said  Friday that the three were last seen in Thika town while driving back to Nairobi. The rented vehicle they were driving, a silver Toyota Ractis KCX 843M was found in Githurai. “The owner of the car reported the matter at Githurai Kimbo police station on April 26 and Githurai Mwiki police station,” the group said. The vehicle has been moved to Thika police station where the missing person’s report was made. Njau is an active community leader and a member of the Kiamaiko Social Justice group. The lobby said that though the families of the three activists had reported to the police, no official feedback on the extent of the investigation has been made to them, leaving them anxious and in panic. An extensive search for the trio by their colleagues has also yielded nothing. “They have visited 26 police stations and 20 hospitals and morgues around Nairobi, Kiambu, Kajiado and Machakos in the last five days [to no avail],” they said. The lobby wants the probe intensified to help return the three to their families alive. (edited by o. owino)
