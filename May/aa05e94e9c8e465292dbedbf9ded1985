Police on Friday arraigned 38 joggers, among them children for violating social distancing directives issued by Health CS Muhahi Kagwe. They were arrested within Milimani Estate and presented before senior principal magistrate Robinson Ondieki. The court heard that they were found to have not kept a physical distance of one and a half metres apart while doing physical exercise. The suspects pleaded guilty to the charges. The magistrate released the children and fined 27 adults Sh1,000 fine each. “Sh 1,000 fine is the minimum and should they breach this directive again, the court will issue a tougher fine and sentence,” he ruled. The children were also warned against repeating the offence or they risk being fined next time. (edited by o. owino)
