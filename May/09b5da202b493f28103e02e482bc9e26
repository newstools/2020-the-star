The rise in online studying caused by the Covid-19 disruptions could lead to the cyberbullying and abuse of children in Mombasa, an official has warned. The Mombasa county children's department estimates some 220,000 young ones are at home and caution should be taken when they study online. Mombasa county children's services director Philip Nzenge told the Star paedophiles are taking advantage to harass children online. “Children are vulnerable to paedophiles who are waiting for them to be online and lure them by lying and impersonating their peers,” Nzenge said. Nyali subcounty has been reported as a hotspot in online child abuse cases. “I urge parents to be on the lookout on what their children are watching online. Also let’s install child-friendly applications on our gadgets to protect our children,” Nzenge said. The county’s children department and the Directorate of Criminal Investigation's Child Protection Unit are keeping watch to ensure abuse cases do not spread. Nzenge also raised concerns of children being exposed to pornography. “Child trafficking and smuggling can easily be planned online and Mombasa being an origin, transition and destination point, we have all the reasons to worry about their internet engagements,” Nzenge said. Faith Mkawughanga, a mother to a Standard 4 child said the pupil has a one hour class study. Mkawughanga said she makes sure her child is well monitored when she goes online for studies either by herself or with her father. "When I give her my phone I make sure I monitor her thoroughly," she said. (edited by o. owino)
