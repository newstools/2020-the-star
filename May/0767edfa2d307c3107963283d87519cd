Governor Wilber Ottichillo has urged Vihiga politicians to remain united as the county strategises to combat the spread of Covid-19. Ottichillo spoke at the county headquarters when he received donations from the  Kenya Chamber of Commerce and Industry Vihiga branch, Sabatia MP Alfred Agoi, Hamisi MP Charles Gimose and Senator George Khaniri who sent his representatives. “Political differences cannot help us nor can we develop. We need to work as a team as it has been shown in this Covid-19 pandemic, and I am sure we shall go further than where we are,” Ottichillo said. The county chief said Vihiga's development cannot be achieved in the face of political differences where politicians aligned supporters to different political affiliations that do not benefit them. He said resources to combat the virus were inadequate and the national government was concentrating on hard-hit areas. "If we have community infection, we will be overwhelmed because of the poor state of our health facilities in the county," Ottichillo said. "We will not be able to test locally due to lack of testing kits or accommodate people in ICU because we have none." Already health executive Amos Kutwa has appealed for Sh100 million to complete the plaza hospital at the county headquarters. Ottichillo said over 60,000 households in the county require food aid during the Covid-19 pandemic. Edited by Henry Makori
