 Police have launched an investigation after a woman was found murdered and the body dumped in an open field in Umoja, Nairobi, on Sunday. Members of the public discovered the body near Amani Court, next to Tumaini Primary School, after a stench attracted their attention. They were met by a gory sight of the remains of a woman whose body had been chopped into three parts and stuffed into a sack. Buruburu police commander Adamsom Bungei said police were had launched a probe. “We are still finding out more information. We got the information and we are doing a follow up to ascertain how the body ended up there,” Bungei told the Star. He ruled out claims the woman might have fallen into the hands of criminals saying that it might have been a case of domestic misunderstanding. The body had started decomposing. No arrests have so far been made. The identity of the woman remains unknown. Because of the conditions of the remains, police are likely to conduct a postmortem and question members who might have seen suspicious movements or seen a strange vehicle in the area in the past four days. In August 2016, a similar case occurred in the area after a woman was murdered and her dismembered body parts dumped in a thicket. The woman's hands, head and legs were found near Fadhili Primary School stuffed in a plastic bag. The torso was missing. In early May, a woman stabbed and killed her boyfriend in Umoja after a furious domestic row. In another case, a woman killed her two children and attempted suicide after a disagreement with her mother-in-law in Kayole.  Edited by P.O
