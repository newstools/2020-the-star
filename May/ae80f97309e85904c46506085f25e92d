Teso North MP Oku Kaunya wants President Uhuru Kenyatta to declare a total nationwide lockdown to stop the spread of the coronavirus. The MP said with the rising number of confirmed coronavirus cases, a lockdown would be the most applicable option to contain the spread of the virus. Kenya on Wednesday surpassed the 1,000 mark of confirmed Covid-19 cases. “A total lockdown for a month will do us good as a country just like what Uganda did as a way of combating the virus,” Kaunya said in an interview with a local TV station said. “The lockdown can be imposed while ensuring the less privileged and vulnerable in society are cushioned by the government in the programme that was launched last month. It will be better if we suffer for a short period of time but save millions of Kenyans’ lives.” The only counties the government imposed cessation of movement are Nairobi, Kwale, Kilifi, Mombasa and Mandera. In Mombasa, Old Town has been locked and Eastleigh in Nairobi. “Our capability as a country to handle the virus spread lies within ourselves as a government through extensive testing of residents, especially those in urban populated areas and those living at the border such as Malaba, Namanga and Isebania," Kaunya said. He said the government should carry out mass sensitisation about Covid-19’s effects, signs and symptoms since most Kenyans have no access to print and electronic media, where such campaigns are being carried.
