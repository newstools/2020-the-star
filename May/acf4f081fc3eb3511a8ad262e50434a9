Rwandan genocide suspect Félicien Kabuga was arrested on Saturday in the Paris region, the French Justice Ministry said. Kabuga, 84, who was living under a false identity in a flat in Asnieres-Sur-Seine, near Paris, had been pursued by international justice for 25 years, the ministry said in a statement. French gendarmes arrested him at 0530 GMT on Saturday, the ministry said. Kabuga is Rwanda’s most-wanted man and the United States has put a $5 million bounty on his head. A Hutu businessman, he is accused of funding the militias that massacred some 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus over a span of 100 days in 1994. The arrest paves the way for bringing the fugitive in front of the Paris Appeal Court and later to the International Court in The Hague. Two other Rwandan genocide suspects, Augustin Bizimana and Protais Mpiranya, are still being pursued by international justice. “The arrest of Félicien Kabuga today is a reminder that those responsible for genocide can be brought to account, even twenty-six years after their crimes,” IRMCT’s Chief Prosecutor Serge Brammertz said in a statement immediately after the arrest. He added the arrest was the result of cooperation between law enforcement agencies in France and other countries including the US, Rwanda, Belgium, the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands and others. Kabuga was responsible for making purchases of large quantities of machetes, hoes, and other agricultural implements in the knowledge that they would be used as weapons of murder during the genocide, according to a UN news website. The UN added he was also part owner of the infamous Radio Television Milles Collines in Rwanda accused of ordering Hutus to kill Tutsis.
