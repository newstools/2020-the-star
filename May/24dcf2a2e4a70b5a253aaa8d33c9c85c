Grandpa Records founder and CEO Refigah has an initiative called 'Simama na Kibra'. The music mogul is aiming to feed over 4,000 vulnerable families. "Even as the world and everyone is focused on the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic, let's not forget to keep an eye on the most vulnerable persons suffering from solitude and other challenges,"  he said in a statement. "This week for Simama na Kibra, our funds drive is dedicated to supporting families with persons under special category — mental health persons, PWDs and cancer patients. "Join us today and donate charities of your choice to hit this target of 200 from the remaining 4,000 families. Together, we shall overcome the Covid-19 pandemic." Refigah and his friends have started the door-to-door distribution and reached out to 141 vulnerable families with food and basic necessities. "Kindly help us by sending whatever you can to PayBill no.891300 Account name: Simama," he said.
