Three electronic fraud suspects were on Thursday evening arrested by DCI detectives at Highpoint residential area in Juja town. The trio include two university students Ian Kinanga and Jefferson Bosire who worked together with Kevin Oroko, a software developer at a local bank. According to a Twitter post by the DCI, the suspects were nabbed by a team of Serious Crime Detectives after receiving a tip from civilians. "During the operation over 400 sim cards, eight national ID cards, two laptops, and four mobile phones were recovered from them," the DCI wrote on the post. "The trio will be charged accordingly once further Investigations are completed." Edited by Henry Makori
