The Somali authorities say a plane carrying coronavirus aid supplies has crashed, killing the six people on board. The aircraft was owned by African Airways. It left the capital Mogadishu and briefly stopped in the city of Baidoa before continuing to the town of Bardale, in the southern Bay region, where it crashed a short distance from the airport. The cause of the Monday evening incident is not known. The South-West State Minister of Transport Hassan Hussein Mohamed told the BBC that those who died included Somali and Kenyan nationals.
