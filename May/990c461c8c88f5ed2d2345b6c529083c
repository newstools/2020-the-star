The Ministry of Health is expanding testing capacity to all counties to enable truck drivers to be tested for Covid-19 from the point of origin of their journey. The truck drivers in the latest agreement arrived at by EAC member states requires that they produce a Covid-19 free certificate at border points. At least 18 truck drivers have tested positive for the disease. In addition, the ministry is expecting a shipment of 8,064 test kits for the automatic machine and another 16,000 are expected by Wednesday next week. “The ministry did not carry out the targeted mass testing in Eastleigh on Thursday.  We have two sets of machines, an automatic machine and a manual extractor. On Thursday we were using the manual extractor because our kits for the automatic machines were low,” Health DG Patrick Amoth said on Friday. “If these ones come into the country then we will be able to scale up our targeted testing.” Eastleigh is in lockdown having recorded the highest number of Covid-19 cases in Nairobi county. According to the DG, 21,000 out of the 29,430 tests conducted in the country so far are primary/index tests while the others are repeat tests conducted to find out whether the patients had recovered. “Nobody is immune to getting Covid-19. We have even had a child who was two months old so there is need for all of us to take the infection control measures seriously.” Health CAS Rashid Aman appealed to Kenyans to welcome those who had recovered from the disease, adding that stigma against those who have recovered  is an impediment to the fight against the virus in the country. “We should not stigmatise anybody who has contracted the virus. It is s disease that claims some lives but most people recover from it,” Aman said. Kenya so far has 621 positive cases with 14 new cases confirmed on Friday.
