Hundreds of Kibra Sub County residents have benefited from food donations by a local footballer, Maqbul Daudi of MASA Academy. The distribution, which was done door to door to avoid incidents of commotion covered Kibra Karanja, Makina, Makongeni and Lindi. The 17-year footballer has been distributing food to the residents since last month in partnership with the academy’s director Kenring Kiprono, who is based in Sweden. The donation benefited over four hundred residents who received maize flour, sugar, rice and cooking oil. Maqbul emphasised on the need for the residents to observe the instructions from the Ministry of Health including washing hands and sanitising, wearing face masks and social distancing. “I call upon my brothers, sister and parents to stick to the directives by the Ministry of Health of social distancing, wearing masks and washing hands . The virus can only spread if we do not observe the basic hygiene messages from the government,” said Maqbul. He thanked Kiprono, a musician and football scouting agent, for the support and urged other Kenyans in the diaspora to emulate him especially the provision of masks and clean water. Last week, Maqbul distributed 15,000 litres of clean water to the residents at various water points. The teenager, who was scheduled to travel to Sweden for trials this year, urged the government to provide clean water and unclog the drainage system, which is exposing the residents to water-borne diseases.
