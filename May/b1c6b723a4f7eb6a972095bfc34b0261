 The Nairobi Water and Sewerage Company will start a plot by plot inspection to weed out illegal water connections in the city, MD Nahashon Muguna has said. “We want to eliminate all the illegal connections that are diverting water without paying for it,” Muguna told the Star on Sunday. The NCWSC boss who assumed the position May 27 said those without water meters will be dealt with accordingly. Prior to his confirmation, Muguna served the company's acting managing director from August 2017. He also served as the director of technical services from August 2010. Nairobi's current water demand is 790,000 cubic metres per day against a capacity of 526,000 cubic metres. This leaves a shortage of 264,000 cubic metres per day. However, the city is losing a lot of water that is not accounted for, otherwise known as non-revenue water. Non-revenue water is water that is produced but ‘lost’ through leakage or theft before it reaches the customer. An audit report released in November 2017 showed that NCWSC missed Sh3.1 billion as a result of billing inefficiencies. Former Auditor General Edward Ouko had indicated the company’s liabilities stood at Sh4.2 billion as at the end of June 30, 2016 against assets of Sh3 billion, constituting a negative working capital of Sh1.1 billion. The report, which was tabled in the county assembly, stated that the amount of non-revenue water increased by two per cent between 2015 and 2016 compared to 2014-15. The company produced 200,352,109 cubic metres of water but earned Sh4.7 billion only. It is said that the loss of water is due to leaking and broken water pipes, vandalism, cartels and illegal connections. It is estimated that the city is losing Sh3.7 billion per year as a result of non-revenue water, an equivalent of 40 per cent of the total water supply. Muguna said because there is no pressure, technology cannot be adequately used to address illegal connections. He said the technology works well with enough pressure.  Edited by P.O
