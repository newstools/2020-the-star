The court has extended orders that stopped Senate Speaker Ken Lusaka from removing Narok Senator Ledama Olekina as Chairman of the County Public Account and Investments Committee The case will be mentioned on June 9 for inter parties hearing. The high court earlier this week temporarily barred Lusaka from ejecting the Narok Senator from the key post in the Senate. Justice Weldon Korir certified as urgent the case filed by Olekina challenging the decision to remove him from the position. Judge Korir on Monday ruled that unless he issues the orders, then the petition may be overtaken by events. The judge also directed Olekina's lawyers to serve the petition to the respondents. In the case, Ledama through lawyer Nelson Havi, argues that he was validly elected as a member of the Minority Party in the Senate and without notice to him as required by standing orders. Speaker Ken Lusaka and Minority Leader James Orengo had threatened to remove him from the position.
