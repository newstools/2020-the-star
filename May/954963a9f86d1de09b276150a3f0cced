Baby Uhuru is said to have arrived on May 27, 2020 and was born at Nairobi Hospital. This is not Uhuru's first grand child as Jomo and Fiona were blessed with a baby girl in November 2017. Uhuruâ€™s son Jomo and his wife Fiona Achola welcomed their first child at Aga Khan Hospital. Baby Wanjiru was named after the First Lady Margaret Kenyatta. The family has kept their life private.
