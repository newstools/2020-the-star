A suspect in the Sh4 billion Lake Basin Development Authority Mall case has lost a bid to have his charges quashed. William Omoding is among 16 charged over the tender for the construction of the Kisumu mall. He is charged alongside former Kisumu Speaker Onyango Oloo. Omoding was arraigned last year and denied the charges. Later, he filed a case at the High Court challenging his prosecution. He said that he did not participate in any scheme in the alleged failure to comply with procurement laws. Omoding also said that as a board member he had no role in awarding any contract hence cannot be accused of conferring a benefit. He blamed the procurement entity and the tender committee, saying they should have been held responsible in case of any irregularity. But Judge John Onyiego said the investigative agency and the trial court would determine whether the board should be exonerated and the management held responsible for the actions. Onyiego said it will be premature to determine the sufficiency in the content of the charges. During the hearing, Omoding had said he should have been informed of the investigation and given a chance to be heard. But the judge said it is not clear from the court how Omoding came to know of the charges if he was not informed of the investigation. The DPP properly acted on evidence submitted by the anti-graft agency, the judge said. “Both parties did not elaborate information as to the process leading to the appearance in court. I will only assume that Bill [Omoding] must have been informed of the allegations facing him before the appearance in court,” he said. (edited by o. owino)
