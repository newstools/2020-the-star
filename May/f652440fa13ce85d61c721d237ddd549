Nadia Mukami and Sauti Sol have been selected among the Best African International Acts in the Black Entertainment Television awards. Media personality Shaffie Weru says others from East Africa include Harmonize and another act from Uganda. Speaking to Word Is, Shaffie said unlike African elections, BET numbers don’t lie and the best African act wins on merit. "This is about there being an academy of the top minds in entertainment and choosing the best artistes for each category," he said. He said the first round of nominations has happened and the list is on the BET website. The dates of the event have not been confirmed yet. How the nominations were done was from by the academy submitting five nominees each from the over 30 acts. Later, there will be another round of voting that’s final. Shaffie Weru was enrolled into the BET awards academy as a member representing East Africa.
