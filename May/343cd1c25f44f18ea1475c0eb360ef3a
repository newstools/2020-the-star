Players need this kind of facilities in order to minimize on injuries," he added. “We have many talented youngsters who will now have the opportunity to exhibit and exploit their skills to full potential hence open the doors for their new careers as far as football is concerned." Amukowa also appealed to the county government to consider upgrading other playfields at the grassroots and come up with youth centres in each sub-county to strengthen the structures being established. Amukowa, who is eying the NEC member position in the next FKF elections,  further called on all the candidates eyeing various seats to play mature and peaceful campaigns devoid of insults to avoid creating a major rift in the soccer fraternity.
