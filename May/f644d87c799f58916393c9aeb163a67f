Technology seems to be giving some MPs real troubles nearly three months after they started holding virtual meetings. A good number is literally unable to master basic features of the Zoom conference application. Muting audios to eradicate background disturbances has proved to be the biggest problem. Last week, a youthful legislator forced a committee meeting to delay for more than 30 minutes for lack of quorum. When he finally logged in, his first comment was that the Parliamentary Service Commission should arrange for them to be trained on how to use the app. He implored the committee chairman to escalate the matter to the Speaker or he raises the concern on the floor. Still on matters virtual meetings, just why have some Cabinet secretaries been keeping MPs waiting on the Zoom app for hours? Members of a Senate committee this week complained bitterly after a CS forced them to ‘idle online’ for about an hour. Interestingly, the CS had logged into the app leaving the members viewing her office. The CS, who had until last minute confirmed her availability, did not answer the committee chairman’s phone calls forcing him to adjourn the meeting. The angry senators censured the CS in her absence promising to put her to task when she appears before the panel next time. It seems tables have suddenly turned on a vocal legislator from Deputy President William Ruto’s Rift Valley backyard. The once-close ally of the DP is said to have been trying to reach him for nearly a week now in vain. The man is said to be seeking an appointment with Ruto to apologise over his recent ‘betrayal.’ Confidants of the DP have openly told him that he is serving his final term as an MP after he betrayed the person who handpicked him for the seat. He is now pleading with the DP’s men to persuade the country’s second in command to give him a chance to explain himself.
