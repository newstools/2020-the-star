Professionals in Busia county have protested the deplorable state of quarantine centres in the region. This comes after the county was forced to release Carolyne Akumu, 37, and her two-month-old baby who were quarantined at Kisoko Girls' Secondary School in Nambale. The room where they were kept only had a metallic bed with no mattress nor a blanket. The two were discharged on Thursday following numerous complaints from Kenyans on social media. Akumu was arrested by enforcement officers on Wednesday in Nambale while preparing to close her business. The Busia Professional Association said some quarantine centres do not meet the set standards. Chairman Prof Chris Ngacho urged the county and national governments to fit quarantine centres with the necessary equipment. “We are calling for an immediate review of all quarantine facilities; some look like punishment centres for innocent people. There are basic things that a quarantine centre should have but we are shocked that in some cases, it is just a room with nothing inside,” he said. The association is also advocating quarantining at home instead of forcing people into facilities without bedding and other basic requirements. Busia has identified quarantine facilities, with Alupe Subcounty Hospital serving as the isolation centre for coronavirus patients. The national government directed counties to identify schools that can be used as centres for people who may have interacted with Covid-19 patients. The counties have not disclosed to the media the state of these centres.  Edited by Frank Obonyo
