Political leaders should stop unnecessary wars and instead focus on the fight against coronavirus, a Jubilee governor has said. Bomet's Hillary Barchok said the infighting in Jubilee at a time when all energies should be directed towards combating the pandemic was perilous for the country. Barchok said it was wrong for President Kenyatta to engage in 2022 political battles yet Kenyans were suffering because of the failing economy. “What we are witnessing, at a time we are supposed to be concentrating on fighting the disease and thinking of how we can ensure our economy gets back, is absolutely wrong,” he said. Citing the removal of senators Kipchumba Murkomen and Susan Kihika from the Senate leadership, the governor accused Uhuru and some leaders in the Jubilee opposed to Deputy President William Ruto of taking advantage of the current situation to advance their agenda by making illegal changes. “Let us not take advantage of the disease currently ravaging the country to settle scores but instead do what is right because there will be time for politicking,” he said. Barchok warned that the current squabbles might plunge the country into unnecessary political tensions among communities. He spoke when he received a donation of 25 water cans and stands from George Williamson tea company in his office on Friday. His statement came in the wake of growing tension among leaders from the Rift Valley who feel Uhuru has betrayed Ruto in his promise to support him for President in 2022. “We are watching the unfolding events in the Jubilee and we do not want to go with the thought that Kenyatta has reneged on his promise. We still believe he will support us in 2022 as we supported him back in 2013 and 2017,” Barchok said. Edited by Henry Makori
