A carpenter accused of assaulting his wife with a hammer after she cheated on him has been charged at a Makadara law court. Kenneth Leboon, 24, was accused of hammering his wife Naomi Cherop, 21, in their rented house on April, 24 at Kiambiu slums within Kamukunji in Nairobi. Leboon claimed his wife brought another man to their house and cheated on him. He said that he had aimed to attack the man but his wife held him and that’s when the hammer got her on the head. Cherop sustained serious head injuries and was rushed to Kenyatta National Hospital where she was treated and discharged. She is however still held at the hospital as the bills incurred have not been cleared. Investigating officer Constable Michael Muindu of Shauri Moyo police station was unable to record a statement from Cherop as the hospital stated that she was not fit to record one. “Currently, the patient is discharged through neurosurgical outpatient clinic for follow ups. As regards statement recording, the patient still remains confused and disoriented and hence may not be able to give an accurate account of the events following the injury,” a statement from the hospital reads. They asked the officers to postpone statement recording until a time when the unit will advise after follow-ups in the neurosurgical out patients’ clinic. The accused pleaded not guilty before Makadara senior principal magistrate Angelo Kithinji. “I am a man of no means, my wife is detained at the hospital and I need to be free so that I can look for money to clear her bills. We have no relative around who can help,” Leboon said. Kithinji granted him a Sh100,000 bond and ordered the matter be heard on August 3.  Edited by P.O
