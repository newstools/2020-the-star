North Rift governors have rejected pressure from bishops and pastors to have churches reopened for worship despite the spread of the Covid-19 in the country. The North Rift Economic Bloc county chiefs said they had received intense pressure from the church leaders. “It's agreed that measures issued by the government on the control of Covid-19 will continue to be strictly enforced,” they said in a statement. The governors held their eighth virtual meeting chaired by Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago and attended by CEO of the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital Dr Wilson Aruasa. The clerics had asked President Uhuru Kenyatta to review the order on closure of churches. They wanted to be declared essential service providers so that they resume operations but with conditions to fully adhere to all Covid-19 control measures. Led by Bishop Peter Simwa, chairman of Eldoret Gospel Ministers Association, they said it was necessary to continue worshipping but with tighter regulations. Simwa said the government had allowed other sectors like restaurants and matatus to operate and should not continue to keep worship houses closed. Similar calls were also made by Catholic Bishop of Eldoret Dominic Kimengich and chairman of clergy in the region Bishop Wilson Kurui. “If he matatus, hotels and other businesses have been allowed to operate, then it’s unfair to continue blocking worship yet it’s the same people in the matatus and restaurants whom we also serve in the churches,” Simwa said. Mandago said they agreed that the government should also treat carefully calls to reopen sectors of the economy. (edited by o. owino)
