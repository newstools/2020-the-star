Old Town is the epicentre of the pandemic in Mombasa. Already seven people have died of coronavirus in Old Town but the 28,000-strong community has rejected the call from Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho to undergo mass testing. Only 140 people have been tested in Old Town so far. This short-sighted attitude can lead to more deaths in the community. It is unfortunate that the Covid-19 lockdown has fallen during Ramadhan but there is nothing discriminatory about the need for mass testing. Taking a swab for the test does not break the fast â€“ nothing is being consumed. Muslims are not being particularly targeted, other hotspots like Kawangare and Eastleigh are also being targeted for mass testing and contact tracing. Islamic countries like the UAE and Iran have undertaken some of the most stringent measures against Covid-19. Taking the test may actually save your life if you are found to be positive and start receiving medical treatment. Governor Joho and the authorities should not back down on testing all Old Town residents. And for their part, the residents should accept the tests that are for their own good.
