Former Starehe legislator Bishop Margaret Wanjiru has refuted claims that she contracted Corona virus after hosting a large prayer gathering at her Runda home. “I had no visitors. It is not true that I had a large group of intercessors praying there (at home). I was only with my family members and staff,” Bishop Wanjiru said. Speaking after her discharge from Aga Khan University Hospital, Nairobi, the lead pastor at Jesus is Alive Ministries added that she was diagnosed with the virus after she sought treatment for food poisoning. “I experienced a running stomach on Sunday night and I knew I had eaten bad food. The first day I was treated for amoeba and bacteria in the blood. On the second day, we reasoned with the doctor on the need for the test,” she said. She was immediately put on oxygen while awaiting her test results. Apart from Bishop Wanjiru, also affected were two grandchildren – who have since recovered – and six staff members. Drawing from her experience, she warned Kenyans to be wary of spreading the virus among themselves within their households. “I want to encourage Kenyans to wear facemasks at home to avoid spreading the virus to other family members. You do not know where or who your family members have interacted with,” Bishop Wanjiru said. Wanjiru – who represented Starehe for five years (2007-2013) – was hospitalized a week ago after testing positive for Covid-19. Initial reports were that she had hosted a prayer gathering of 18 people out of which 8 people were diagnosed with the virus. The bishop revealed that her staff members are still undergoing treatment.
