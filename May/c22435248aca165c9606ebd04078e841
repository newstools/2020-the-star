Fifty-three truck drivers have turned positive at the border in the last 24 hours, the government has said. Speaking during his daily briefs on Monday, CAS Rashid Aman said 51 of them are from Tanzania and two from Burundi. "...they were denied entry after testing positive at the border entry points," Aman said. The CAS said every country chooses how they will respond to Covid-19. "Kenya has put in place to contain importation of the disease and now it's from the land. That is why we have tightened measures at the borders. We have a threat from the Tanzania side," he said. The CAS maintained positive truckers will not be allowed into the country. "There are high-level discussions within EAC member states on how to contain the virus," he said. "Every country chooses how they will respond to this pandemic. A country has a choice to break a cycle by putting in place measures that will break this cycle." Aman said that importation of the disease is largely coming from the land. "...that is why we have to tighten our surveillance so that we can keep away the infected people," he said. "The results we are seeing is that there is a level of threat from Tanzania and it is our duty to continue testing and isolating them." Aman said that Kenya has capacity at its border points especially in Busia to test quickly and turn around the results for COVID-19 in good time. "We are engaging EAC to avail a lab at Namanga to improve the turn around time as well," he said. He said that the government has identified a school in Namanga to isolate truckers awaiting their results to stop them from interacting with residents. Aman said Kenya recorded 25 new cases of Covid-19 after testing 1,139 bringing the total positives to 912. They have been 22 discharges bringing to 336 the number of recoveries.
