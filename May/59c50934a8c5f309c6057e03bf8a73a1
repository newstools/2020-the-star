Bishop John Omangi of Southern Nyanza Diocese has urged the government to consider the gradual reopening of churches. He said churches, especially in the villages, should be allowed to operate. Members should, however, conduct services in the open spaces and practise social distancing. "Now that the government has mapped out Covid-19 hotspots, there is absolutely no reason to continue closing churches indefinitely," Omangi said. He said churches in towns should conduct services with just a few congregants. The bishop praised the government for controlling the spread of the coronavirus and called for mass screening in low-income estates, especially in Nairobi and Mombasa. Omangi said slum residents need to be taught about dangers and prevention of the virus because they flout social distancing rules. The prelate, who was speaking at his office in St Philips ACK in Kisii, faulted county government for leaving religious leaders out when forming Covid-19 emergency response teams. Omangi said reports have emerged of corruption in the use of funds entrusted to the committees. "Church leaders should have been part of the teams because we stand for truth and integrity,” he said. Omangi decried the theft of funds meant to alleviate suffering. He said despite cutting salaries, churches are still grappling with paying their workers.  "We have resorted to using volunteers but they also need food,” Omangi said. Edited by Frank Obonyo
