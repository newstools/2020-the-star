More than 100,000 people have been affected by floods in various parts of the country. Devolution PS Charles Sunkuli said the government has distributed 54,000 bags of relief food to the displaced people. “The humanitarian assistance to flood victims has cost the government Sh245 million,” he said. Sunkuli spoke at Olmeoshi Primary School in Transmara West subcounty, where 114 flood victims have pitched camp.   He said the government has formed a national committee to ensure all flood victims are assisted. “I will be chairing the committee, and we will ensure that everybody restarts their lives,” Sunkuli said. Counties worst-hit by the heavy rains include Elgeyo Marakwet, Baringo, Marsabit, Tana River, Kisumu and Murang'a. Sunkuli urged Kenyans living in areas prone to floods and mudslides to move to safe grounds. “Everyone must take necessary precautions until the rains subside because the rains are still around up to June,” he said.
