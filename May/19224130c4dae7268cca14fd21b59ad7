The African Union on Friday condemned the killing of George Floyd, a 46-year-old African American who was killed on Monday by a white police officer. In a press statement, AU chairperson Moussa Faki said the union “rejects the continuing discriminatory practices against black citizens of the United States of America.” “The chairperson of AU strongly condemns the murder that occurred in the United States of America at the hands of law enforcement officers, and wishes to extend his deepest condolences to his family and loved ones.” Faki called on the US authorities to immediately intensify their efforts to ensure that there is total elimination of all forms of discrimination based on race or ethnic origin. The killing of the Floyd has sparked protests across several states after a video emerged showing his encounter with the police officers. The states which have witnessed violent street protests include Illinois, California, Memphis, Tennessee, Chicago and Los Angeles. President Donald Trump has threatened to dispatch armed forces to restore order warning on Twitter that “when the looting starts, the shootings starts”. The tweet was flagged for glorifying violence.
