Technical colleges have requested Treasury, through Parliament, an additional Sh429 million for Covid-19 items. TVETs seek the cash to test trainees, trainers and all staff in the institutions when the schools open. The Education ministry presented the request to MPs on Thursday during deliberations on budgets for the financial year 2020-21. Among the intended purchases are face masks, soaps and sanitiser. The ministry says they intend to fix facilities with running water at the institutes. This was part of the request for an additional Sh16.8 billion above the Sh7.05 billion allocated in the printed estimates for 2020-21. TVETs need Sh3.8 billion more to cater for students, saying the Sh5.2 billion can only cater for 173,000 students against a projected enrollment of 300,000. The institutions further requested MPs for Sh2.8 billion for recruitment of trainers, citing a deficit of 3,674 to meet the required staff establishment. PS Julius Jwan asked the lawmakers to provide them with additional Sh343 million for induction of new trainers who were transferred from TSC. The department says it also needs Sh320 million for promotional courses and another Sh1.06 billion for rehabilitation of 65 polytechnics. TVET department suffered a Sh3 billion budget cut in the supplementary estimates II of 2019-20, affecting several construction works. Jwan also wants Treasury to consider providing TVETs with Sh6.5 billion for equipping 30 colleges that are under construction. Treasury CS Ukur Yatani, in printed estimates for the next financial year, has provided Sh1.7 billion for equipping the schools. The department says it needs more cash as there are 29 technical training institutes that did not get equipment under the Kenya-China project. PS Jwan decried the sorry situation of ablution blocks in some of the colleges and requested for Sh912 million to improve the sanitation facilities. MPs were also asked to recommend to Treasury to provide Sh223 million for connecting three-phase mains electricity and powerhouses at 162 institutes. The department, restating that the additional requests were a priority, also asked for Sh390 million for drilling boreholes in 130 newly completed TVETs. The PS lamented slow disbursement of funds from the National Treasury, saying the sorry situation was affecting budget implementation. With only a month left to end of the current financial year, the department has only received 43 per cent of recurrent budget allocations. The exchequer has also released 17 per cent of what was allocated in the 2019-20 budget. “We have not received capitation for the second and third quarter amounting to Sh2.6 billion,” Jwan told MPs. He said the capitation funds were used to pay salaries for staff recruited by governing councils in polytechnics and BOGs in technical institutions. “We have a staff compliment of 7,177 with a monthly payroll expenditure of Sh167 million in our TVET institutions that have been going for several months without salary due to this problem,” the PS said, adding that the Covid-19 pandemic will worsen the problem. He presented the case of 30 TVCs that have a pending bill of Sh1.02 billion. PS Jwan told MPs that the request was made before the Covid-19 pandemic went global. Edited by Henry Makori
