Kimani Sunz, a Kenyan-Norway based artiste is in the country and has released 'Vibrate', a collaboration with Kristoff. He had come early February for the long Easter holiday holidays and to check his projects in Kenya, too. "Then corona happened and boom everything came to a standstill and the airport closed, so I could not go back to Norway," he told Word Is. "I'm working on my EP. I love Dancehall vibe and wanted to mash it up with a Kenyan vibe. And Kristoff was the perfect blend. So we teamed up to release the single 'Vibrate', which will take over the airwaves locally and internationally" Sunz is also a cousin to femcee Stella Mwangi, alias STL. "Big up my cousin STL, who has always encouraged me to pursue the Kenyan market and move out of my comfort zone," he said. Sunz is also the director of Jua Toto Foundation, an organisation that champions youth empowerment through sports and art.
