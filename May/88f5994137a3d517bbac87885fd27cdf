Kenya has recorded 47 new coronavirus cases, bringing the number to 582 people. The cases are from 1,564 samples tested in the last 24 hours. A total of 32 are from Mombasa while 11 are from Nairobi, two in Busia and one each in Kiambu and Kwale. In Nairobi, five cases were from Eastleigh. Health CS Mutahi Kagwe on Wednesday said the cases in Mombasa are mainly in Old Town, with 18 cases. Kagwe said 31 are male and 16 female. Another eight people have been discharged, bringing the total discharged to 190. On a sad note, another two people have died. They are from Mombasa. This brings the number to 26. "Both of them aged 68 and 72 passed away from home. " Meanwhile, the government has locked down Eastleigh and Old Town as coronavirus cases surge. There will be no movement in and out of the areas effective Wednesday at 7pm for 15 days, Kagwe said. "You cannot leave the area to go to another area. This will take place for 15 days," he said. Kagwe said public transportation will also not be allowed to go to those areas. "This is to protect those within those areas," Kagwe said. The government also said it will cater for the costs of quarantining patients in state facilities. "The cost of targeted testing and quarantine in government facilities shall be met by the government," Kagwe said on Wednesday. This is a relief to Kenyans who had complained about being asked to pay quarantine costs. The CS said it is not fair to expect police to focus their energy going after patrons of eateries instead of doing other important duties because they are flouting rules.
