Secondary school heads in Kisii have said reopening of schools before full control of Covid-19 is dangerous. Kenya Secondary Schools Heads Association Kisii branch chairman Jairus Onchoke said on Wednesday the lives of Kenyan children are important and should not be exposed to risk. He said learning would continue after the disease has been combated. He said when the Covid-19 pandemic broke out only one student was reported to be positive but currently a number of them have the disease. The chairman said KCPE and KCSE examinations would be administered when the situation was under control. "The reopening of schools will endanger the lives of not only learners but also teachers and their parents,” Onchoke told the Star on the phone. “Let everybody understand that KCPE and KCSE examinations are not a pandemic like Covid-19. The same can be administered when the situation has been brought under control,” he added. He said this year’s Form One class was in school for just one month before the schools were closed due to the outbreak and wondered whether next year will have double admission. Onchoke said if reopening was allowed, social distancing would not be realistic since some schools have between 500 and 1,000 learners. “There is a need for more consultations between the Ministry of Education and other stakeholders on this serious matter,” Onchoke said. Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka said education stakeholders should be consulted before school reopening dates and other modalities are announced. He said Education CS George Magoha should reach out to teachers’ unions and lectures, the human rights commission and the Covid-19 Education Response Committee he appointed. Epidemiologist Mark Nanyingi said Covid-19 cases were likely to rise if schools and social places reopened. Edited by Henry Makori
