Stop this nonsense! These were the words of president Uhuru Kenyatta who lectured Kenyans online in regards to flowers sent to the United Kingdom. Last week, the flower consignment was flown by Kenya Airways and distributed to those in the frontline of combating the pandemic including doctors, nurses and recovering patients and care homes in a campaign dubbed Flowers For Hope. With Kenyan flag wrapped on the flowers, health workers took pictures with the flowers. But Kenyans were quick to accuse the government of failing to attend to the needs of Kenyan workers, especially those on the frontline in the fight against the pandemic. ""Think before yo start talking nonsense in this social media of yours. This is not the time.. this is not the time for us to be petty," a visibly angry Uhuru said. "..this is the time to come together.. this is the time to think of the future of this economy." Uhueu said this is a good marketing strategy as more of them will order flowers from Kenya once COVID-19 is defeated. "Lazima tuangalie mbele. Coronavirus will not be here with us forever. Hayo maua yaandika wafanyikazi ma elfu na elfu hapa Kenya," he said. Earlier,Uhuru also warned against politicising the fight against coronavirus. "Lets stop politicising this coronavirus.. all the money that have been spent during this time shall be audited in broad day light so that Kenyans will be able to know how the money worked," he said. This was after an uproar on social media on how the money was used. A document tabled before the Health Committee of the National Assembly chaired by Murang’a Woman Representative Sabina Chege indicates the ministry used Sh42 million to lease 15 ambulances. They used Sh14.4 million to maintain and fuel 30 vehicles used by officers across the country, translating to Sh40,000 per vehicle every week. The ministry spent Sh2 million out of the Sh6 million approved for airtime for some of its 500 staff for a period of three months.
