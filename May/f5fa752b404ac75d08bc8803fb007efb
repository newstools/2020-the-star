The government has deployed security officers to diffuse the tension witnessed on Wednesday night causing fears among the Kipsigis and Maasai communities in Narok South subcounty. The tension was high soon after Rift Valley regional commissioner George Natembeya visited clash-hit areas in Ololbangi. Deputy county commissioner Felix Kisalu said the tension was experienced after some residents screamed in Olmegenyu, Sogoo, Segamian, Torokiat, Triangle and Nkoben. “We are happy that normalcy has returned after security officers moved with speed to diffuse the simmering tension,” Kisalu told journalists in his office on Thursday. He added two people have been arrested for allegedly raising a false alarm. “If there is an emergency, report to your chief or police instead of screaming and sending wrong signals to the communities living peacefully by instilling fear to them,” he said. The violence broke out at Olooruasi and Olpusimoru in Narok South and North subcounties, respectively. Eight people have been killed and 13 others seriously injured since the clashes started last Friday. The row started when a young man from the Kipsigis community allegedly stole his father’s cow and sold it to a man from the Maasai community. When the father pursued his cow and found it in the hands of the Maasai man. On Wednesday, Natembeya ordered the two communities to surrender all illegal guns and weapons noting that one person died by being shot. He said forcible disarmament will be done if they fail to comply. “Surrender it to the local chief or just place it beside the road where we can easily find it,” Natembeya said. “The security agencies will move door-to-door searching for any weapons in your possession. Any homestead that will miss spears and arrows will be forced to show us where they have hidden them.” Edited by R.Wamochie
