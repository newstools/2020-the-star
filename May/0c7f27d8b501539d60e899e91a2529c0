Two residents of Mandera county have accused Governor Ali Roba of conspiring with his cabinet to misuse Sh700 million approved in supplementary budgets. Mohamed Okashi Mohamed and Hassan Ahmed Nur claim the second and third supplementary budgets are not backed by any documents. Judge Weldon Korir on Friday certified the matter as urgent and directed that it be mentioned on May 18 for further directions. The case by the residents has been lodged against the Mandera finance executive, the county assembly, the governor, the county government and the Attorney General. They want the court to issue an order suspending the implementation of the second and third supplementary budgets for the financial year 2019-2020. Also sought is an order stopping the Controller of Budget from approving the withdrawal of public funds by the county government of Mandera On February 27 and April 29, the finance CEC prepared the second supplementary budget for Sh423 million and the third for Sh296.1 million. The residents claim this was done without involving the public. “The approved budgets do not in any way prioritise the county's expenditure, which ensures allocation of scarce resources to those programmes which have the greatest impact on the residents in terms of reducing poverty and maintaining employment opportunities,” the petition reads. They claim the approved supplementary budgets are an avenue for stealing, corruption and a conduit to siphon public funds for personal gain since they are not based on basic principles that necessitate supplementary budgets. They say the second supplementary budget dated February 27 purports that Sh350 million was established to be payable as pending bills.  But no audit report was made public or provided for scrutiny. “Both budgets have been characterised by lack of transparency and have been prepared and approved by the county without any form of public participation," the petitioners say.
