The Taita Taveta County Disease Surveillance Team has started tracing at least 13 people who might have come into contact with a truck driver who tested positive for Covid-19 on Sunday. The driver presented himself at Maungu checkpoint along Mombasa-Nairobi highway and was later isolated at Moi County Referral Hospital in Voi. Health Services executive John Mwakima said the driver was tested while leaving Uganda on May 7 and was allowed to proceed to Mombasa. The samples tested positive in Uganda and he was ordered to surrender to the nearest health facility. "He was called by officials from Uganda and was informed that he had tested positive for Covid-19. He later visited the Maungu checkpoint where the county rapid response team picked him," Mwakima told journalists in Voi. The department has further taken his sample to the Kenya Medical Research Institute (Kemri) in Kilifi for confirmation. “Our rapid response team did not get his medical report from the Ugandan officials. We have therefore taken fresh samples that shall be released in the next 24 hours,” he added. Mwakima said the truck he was driving is awaiting disinfection at Maungu. Moi County Referal Hospital medical superintendent Jeremiah Shem said the asymptomatic driver is in stable condition and he is being monitored by health officials. He said the isolation area has 12 beds and has been equipped to handle suspected cases of the coronavirus. The county disease surveillance team has so far placed 60 people in quarantine in the border town of Taveta, among them three Tanzanians. They were arrested while crossing back into the county at the porous Kenya-Tanzania border. As of Sunday, May 10, the county's Department of Health Services had taken more than 32 samples to the regional Covid-19 testing laboratories. Edited by A.N
