Bar owners in Kwale county have been warned against running illegal alcohol businesses. County police commander Joseph Nthenge said there were reports that some bars were secretly operating while others shifted business to homes. He said clients were served indoors and some liquor transported to customers at home. Nthenge said police would comb the areas and perpetrators won’t be spared. He said violating the coronavirus directives was a breach of safety and culprits would  be charged. He spoke during the launch of a sanitising tent at Ukunda showground in Msambweni subcounty. The county police boss advised residents to observe the rules to overcome the virus so that life could return to normal. “It is easy. Let’s follow the guidelines provided by the government and the health department if we really want to go back to our normal lives,” he said. Nthenge told the residents to help police curb insecurity and indiscipline. His sentiments came after locals decried the rise of insecurity during curfew hours. He said the number of police officers on patrol had been increased to enhance security. County commissioner Karuku Ngumo asked citizens to make good use of the Nyumba Kumi initiative to report any cases. “We have our community elders who have so far done great. Please work with them to have a safe Kwale county,” Ngumo said. Governor Salim Mvurya cautioned residents against using porous routes to cross to Mombasa. He warned that stringent measures shall be taken to control the border points if people remained indisciplined. Kwale has recorded two cases of Covid-19. Edited by Henry Makori
