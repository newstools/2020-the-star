The Office of the President is an executive position provided for and domiciled in the Constitution. The President’s executive authority is derived from the people, which means that in principle, the holder of the office should be driven by the interests of the general public. To discharge that duty, it is incumbent upon the president to have advisers –whether legal, policy or political – at his discretion. And still, it is his discretion to take and execute advise given to him. He can choose to disregard or defer it. If President Uhuru Kenyatta was flouting the law, we have hawk-eyed citizens, lawyers, activists, including members of the political class, who would have raised the red flag and sparked discussions or even motions to do with impeachment. One of the grounds for removal of a President is outright disregard for the Constitution. We have not seen an outright violation of the Constitution by Uhuru. It is really difficult for anyone to ascertain whether the President is receiving any advice from his advisers or whether he is disregarding it. What we know is that he is surrounded by advisers, including the Attorney General who is government's chief legal adviser. What we can agree on, as of now, is that the President is engaged in high-gear politics. It is pure politics at play. Raw politics. Hard tackle politics driven and sustained by his political interests and self-preservation. He is being driven by his succession plan and ensuring that people who are directly opposed to his politics, or ideology, are cleared off the path. Those who might threaten his political interests, now and in the future, must leave. With the benefit of retrospect, the March 9, 2018, handshake completely changed the ballgame. Some of Uhuru's close friends have to be removed from prominent roles in government. The governance expert spoke to the Star on phone
