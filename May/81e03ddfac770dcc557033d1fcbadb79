The Directorate of Criminal Investigations has been allowed to investigate the bank and M-Pesa accounts of Terrace Korir, who burnt to death in his car on April 29. Detective Godwins Ogola of DCI Buruburu said in an affidavit before Makadara senior resident magistrate Lewis Gatheru that he is investigating a murder in Buruburu Phase 5 last month. Ogola said Korir’s wife, Ruth Wanjiru, had alleged that the deceased transferred Sh10,000 from her account through mobile banking on April 28   against her wishes. Wanjiru also told detectives that she had learnt that her husband had visited his brother in Kinoo after withdrawing the cash. Korir, 39, worked for Bank of Africa's security department. The detective said a car fire report had been made at Buruburu police station by one Chege, the chairman of Mai Mahiu Court in Buruburu Phase V, on the morning of April 29. The car had the registration mark KBY 779M. Police officers, among them the DCIO, went to the scene and found the fire had been contained by the Nairobi disaster team and neighbours. “After the fire was contained it was realised that there was a body of a male adult burnt beyond recognition believed to be that of Terrence Korir, the owner of the motor vehicle,” Ogola said. He said from the postmortem report by Chief Government Pathologist Johansen Oduor, the deceased was starved as his intestines were empty. The detective said they needed M-Pesa and bank accounts of both the deceased and his widow. Gatheru granted the orders sought to be served to Bank of Africa operations manager, Stanbic Bank and Safaricom liaison officer. – mwaniki fm
