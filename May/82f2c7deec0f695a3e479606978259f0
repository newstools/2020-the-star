Kenya Basketball Federation (KBF) will only use qualified and competent referees when league action resumes as they seek to improve the standards of the game. According to assistant secretary, Ambrose Kisoi only qualified refs will be given the responsibilities of handling matches. He disclosed that they will work with the refs and coaches commissions to create a vibrant officiating team that will also go out to help clubs understand the rules better. “We will create a database for referees to pick the officiating teams when the action finally starts,” said Kisoi, adding: “The referees will also visit teams during their training sessions to help them out.” He said the move will create a friendly atmosphere between the players and referees and subsequently make sure players are well informed. “This can only happen if everyone involved knows the rules,” he noted. “We have realised that part of the problems we encounter daily in the league are due to poor articulation of the rules. Now our plans are to engage the teams by enlightening them so that we are reading from the same page,” he said. Kisoi said they want to use experienced refs as national trainers who will be given the responsibility of mentoring up and coming whistlers.
