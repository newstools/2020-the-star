The Narok government has increased screening and security checks on the border with Tanzania to stop the spread of Covid-19. Governor Samuel Tunai said on Sunday the county has stationed medics at border points to screen everyone entering the country. Angata Barikoi and Olposimoru in Transmara West, and Loita and Olposimoru in Narok South are the critical entry points. Speaking in Chemorut, Narok West, when he donated food to needy families, Tunai said his government is vigilant to ensure the disease does not spread into the county. The governor said there are fears that livestock and food trade among communities living along the border might lead to the rapid spread of the virus. “As we do our part as a county, we have since asked the national government to increase security along the border to restrict movement in and out of the country,” Tunai said. The governor said the county will hire more workers to be deployed in health facilities along the border. He said the County Public Service Board will on Monday start receiving applications. It is not clear how many medical workers will be hired.
