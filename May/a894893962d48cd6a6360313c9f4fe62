Former Starehe Constituency aspirants Francis Mwangi on Saturday donated 1,000 tanks to Nairobi residents within CBD. The main aim of the donation was to help people in Nairobi CBD to sanitise their hands in order to slow down the spread of coronavirus. The water tanks can hold a capacity of 20 litres each. Francis intends to create a form of employment to Youths in Nairobi CBD by giving the responsibility of filling the tanks every time the water runs out. During the donation, Francis said that it was everyone's responsibility to help slow down the spread of coronavirus and hence everyone should work towards achieving that goal. "It is our collective responsibility to kick coronavirus out of our country and we should all aim towards achieving the same goal every where we go," he said. Francis intends to donate more tanks to Nairobi areas especially market areas and bus stops. "My team intends to do more distributions at market areas and bus stops since there are more people in those areas and that will help to slow downÂ  the spread of coronavirus," Francis said.
