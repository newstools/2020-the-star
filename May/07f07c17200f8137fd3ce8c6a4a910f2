 There was fear and panic in Maua town, Meru county, on Tuesday after a man collapsed and died as his shoes were being polished. Witnesses said the man appeared healthy but when he collapsed, no one wanted to go close to him. Some people fled. Meru recorded its first Covid-19 case on Tuesday. “I was passing by the shoe shiner and saw the body lying there. Upon inquiry, I was informed he collapsed and died," a witness said. Nyambene Level 4 Hospital officer in charge, Githu Wachira, told the Star they will conduct a postmortem to determine the cause of the man’s death. “He collapsed and died on the spot. The community was afraid thinking this was a coronavirus case. His family has said he has no travel history. If it was Covid-19 case, he could have shown symptoms,” Wachira said. He urged people not to panic and wait for the government's report. Edited by A.N
