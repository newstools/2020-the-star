A lawyer and businesswoman accused of murdering a Belgian woman have been released on bail. Hari Gakinya and Lucy Waithera, who deny the charges, have been released on Sh2 million bond or Sh200,000 bail each by High Court judge Daniel Ogembo. The two are accused of killing Dysseleer Mireille Lesoipa between December 11, 2018, and July 5 last year at an unknown place within the country. They were further ordered to deposit their passports in court and not to interfere with witnesses as one of the conditions for bail. The two are further supposed to attend court as required. This follows a successful bail application by their lawyer Cliff Ombeta who urged the judge to admit their clients to bail or bond as continued detention is unconstitutional. "The applicants have a qualified constitutional right to be released on bond or bail on reasonable conditions," Ombeta said. Justice Ogembo rejected the objection to release the two on bail by senior state prosecutor Wangui Gichuhi saying no compelling reason has been given by the prosecution to warrant denial of bail. Lesoipa, who was married to a Samburu dancer before they separated in 2003, went missing from her home in Milimani, Nakuru county, around June last year. Police investigations led to the arrest of her close friend Waithera, whom detectives say hired the services of Gakiya, to file a succession case before the High Court in Nakuru. In the case, Gakinya claimed Lesoipa had died from HIV-Aids complications, leaving behind a will in which she had named him the executor of her property worth over Sh100 million. He sought to be issued with grants of probate to execute Merielle’s will. But detectives from the Homicide Investigations Unit of the DCI established that the documents used to file the court case were unauthentic. Edited by R.Wamochie
