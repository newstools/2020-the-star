Residents of Muliluni village in Mwingi have expressed joy after authorities began grading a road last rehabilitated in 1980. The 10-kilometre road connects Kanginga, Muliluli to Kairungu in Kiomo-Kyethani ward. Residents had given up requesting leaders to open up the route and were surprised when works began. Taxi operator Mutua Ndunga said the road works would open up the area. “We are happy today that we are witnessing road opening for the first and it will make movements easy,” Mutua said. Mwingi West MP Charles Nguna said the road will be rehabilitated at Sh3 million. “We are also opening three other roads within the constituency to ease movement as several places have been faced by poor road connectivity,” Nguna said. The MP said the roads will be graded and culverts erected where necessary. Mwendwa Katumani, a boda boda rider said the road had been impassable and find ways to navigate it to get their clients home. “There was a time I carried a pregnant woman who was almost due to the hospital. When we got to the impassable points, I had to carry her on my back as she could not walk due to labour pains,” Katumani said. The youthful boda rider also disclosed that whenever there was a burial ceremony in the area, they always carried the body home due to the bad road. “A week ago, we had to carry remains of Francis Kitondu who was found murdered by unknown people to his home for the burial due to the bad road,” he said. The rider added that they also carried building materials to their homes, a very tiresome task. Everylene Kyalo said a poor road network hindered transport, especially during rainy seasons. “We could not move during rainy seasons but we are happy the road is being opened,” Everylene said. Catherine Kathini said that it had been difficult to take their farm produce to the market due to bad roads. (edited by o. owino)
