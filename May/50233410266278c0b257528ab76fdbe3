Kenya Hockey Union’s move to restart the league a month after the coronavirus pandemic is dealt with is a welcome idea, according to Butali Wariors'striker Calvins Kanu. Kanu said the time-frame will be enough for the teams to be ready since players are currently working out on their own and readjustment to outdoor training won’t be a problem. Kanu, who scored six goals in his debut season with the sugar millers, expects the performance levels to go down in the initial stages of the league, owing to the long break but he is confident they will peak along the way. “Since we are working out at home and we have a routine to follow, one month is enough to do some ball work and resume matches. We have wasted a lot of time for obvious reasons but once we start, things will be fine. I expect players to struggle in the initial stages before peaking,” said the former Kenya Police player. The striker is angling a regular spot in the team. Butali signed Festus Onyango from Strathmore to boost the already star-studded department which also consists of Amos Barkibir and George Mutira. “My target is to give my best to the club and score more goals. Competition is good as it makes one work harder since no player wants to sit on the bench. I will, therefore, have to punch above my weight and play a crucial role in the team. Six goals weren’t good for me. Putting more effort to round it off to  double figures is all I am working for.” The men’s Premier League had not started by the time the league was halted but the women’s top tier league and Super League in both categories were ongoing. KHU secretary-general Wycliffe Ongori hinted on Sunday that teams will be given a month-long period to recharge themselves in readiness for the gruelling period.
