Narok County Senator Ledama Ole Kina has called upon ODM party leader Raila Odinga to chip into the ongoing war over the Senate County Public Accounts and Investments Committee (CPAIC). This comes after the Senate Minority Leader James Orengo on Thursday wrote to Speaker Kenneth Lusaka, notifying him to remove Ole Kina from two influential committees - the County Public Accounts and Investments Committee (CPAIC) and the Business Committee. The supremacy war started on Monday when Ole Kina was elected to chair CPAIC but Orengo disputed the outcome saying his side was not satisfied. Ole Kina emerged the winner with 5 votes against his Kisii counterpart Sam Ongeri who had 4 votes. In an interview with KTN NEWS on Thursday night, Ole Kina said that the issue can be settled by the party leader. “I want to call upon my party leader and tell him that my election is being stolen, support me,” Ole Kina said. He said that things will turn ‘nasty’ if the marginalized communities in the country are used as rubber stamps by others. “It is going to be nasty because we are not going to sit aside and become fence seaters,” ole Kina said. The senator has also added that he was shocked by Orengo’s move to dispute the results yet he was not part of the team that took part in the election. He also ruled out the allegation that he was supported by the Jubilee side for the position. Ole Kina said he believed that his nomination was based on the merit. The senator said that the ODM party had not agreed on the preferred candidate for the post.
