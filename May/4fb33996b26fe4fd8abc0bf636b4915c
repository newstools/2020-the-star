Youths crowding rural shopping centres and neglecting coronavirus control guidelines are at high risk of infection, a lawmaker has said. Bomachoge Chache MP Alfa Miruka urged for constant sensitisation efforts at the grassroots to help stem coronavirus infections. Miruka said most Kenyans appear to have slowed down on sanitising and social distancing required to keep Covid-19 at bay. The lawmaker spoke in Ogembo while distributing face masks to various groups in the town. “They are taking life so casually you may think that there is no pandemic. These are the people that we need to constantly reach out to so we that we don’t end up opening doors to a catastrophe,” he said. More than 50,000 people will get the masks while various towns will get water buckets for handwashing. Miruka said the elderly were especially at risk of contracting the disease if they are not given masks. “They should be protected at all costs and this especially requires collective responsibility by all of us,” he said. He worried that the elderly queue at banks for their government stipend, making them vulnerable to infection. Separately in Kisii, Gusii Council of Elders has urged the residents to suspend cultural funeral rites. Council chairman James Matundura said no cultural practice should be regarded as superior during emergencies. “We urge our people to accept that the country and the world is going through hard times which require that we ensure that this disease does not decimate us” Matundura said. Kisii University Vice Chancellor Prof John Akama said youths were hampering efforts to prevent the spread of the disease. Akama spoke when he presided over the issuance of masks to members of the council in Kisii. University lecturer Jackline Nyaanga advised the elderly to eat balanced diets to build immunity.
