 Taita Taveta MPs have asked the national government to consider the county among regions adversely affected by coronavirus crisis and send relief food to hungry residents. Speaking in Voi while donating food to the County Resource Mobilization committee, the legislators said hundreds of residents were at risk of starvation. "The food donated to the County Resource Mobilization team is not enough to cushion those affected. We are calling upon the national government to intervene and send more relief food," Voi MP Jones Mlolwa said. Mlolwa who donated 70 bales of maize flour and 40 cartons of cooking oil noted that most vulnerable members of the community were yet to receive any relief food. "We appreciate the noble work that the County Resource Mobilization team is doing. However,the national committee has not donated anything to our people despite receiving donations from across the country," he added. Emphasizing the need for Kenyans to follow key measures put in place to fight Covid-19, Wundanyi MP Danson Mwashako urged citizens of goodwill to give a helping hand to the needy. Mwashako asked the national government to ensure that the county benefits from the Sh2.7 billion allocated by Parliament to cushion against Covid-19. The County Covid-19 Resource Mobilization Team on Monday began distributing relief food to residents. They target more than 2,000 households within Voi town. Bigvai Mwailemi, a member of the committee, expressed concern that the food may run out and appealed for more donations from other leaders and well wishers. "Whatever we have in store is too little to feed thousands of people who need help at the moment. We are still appealing to well-wishers to send more donations," Mwailemi said. Voi town, Mbololo and Kasighau are among the worst affected areas. Others are Kishushe and Zungulukani.  Edited by Henry Makori
