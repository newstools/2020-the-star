Some Meru MCAs have asked the national government to open churches and mosques. Kimathi Ithaibua of Kiegoi Antubetwe said tough measures should be put in place to enable churches to open. “The government allowed restaurants and hotels to open and the same should apply in churches,” Ithibua said. Kimathi urged residents to adhere to the Covid-19 measures. “People should wear masks, observe social distancing, wash their hands and observe the curfew,” he said. Charles Mugambi of Kanuni said prayers will help keep Covid-19 at bay. Nominated MCA Betty Kinya said she will sponsor a motion to compel the national government through Meru county commissioner to open churches. Mithika Mucheke of Akachiu, however, opposed calls for the government to open the churches. “People can pray at home with their families,” he said. Victor Karithi of Athwana said people should not be careless if churches are allowed to operate. Edited by A.N
