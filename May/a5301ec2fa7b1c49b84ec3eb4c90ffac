Reigning Chicago marathon champion Lawrence Cherono put smiles on faces of 50 kids from Neema Children’s Home in Eldoret after donating foodstuffs to cushion them in the wake of coronavirus pandemic. Cherono, who is part of Olympics marathon team alongside reigning Olympic marathon champion Eliud Kipchoge, Tokyo marathon bronze medalist Bedan Karoki and world marathon bronze medalist Amos Kipruto, said the donations were part of his plan to give back to the society. “Life has become tough these days but we are trying to help those in need. Some of these young children are orphans and it is better to offer a helping hand rather sit back and watch them suffer,” said the two-time Amsterdam marathon champion. Neema Children’s Home director, Joshua Mbithi, said the foodstuffs are a blessing to the children and society at large. “We are happy that a champion has blessed us with food at this trying moment. This will go a long way in helping these children and we would also like to invite other well-wishers to support us,” said Mbithi Besides giving the donations, the Boston Marathon winner said the pandemic had blocked him from training with teammates as well as traversing Kaptagat Forest in Elgeyo Marakwet county. He now trains in Eldoret, Uasin Gishu County. He said he was ready to defend the Boston Marathon which was postponed to September 14 from April 20th. The Honolulu Marathon champion added that the whole season has been wasted and has affected stakeholders in the sports industry especially athletes who depend on the competitions to earn a living. “We are just at home hoping that the virus will be contained sooner than later because the majority of runners are suffering at home,” he added.
