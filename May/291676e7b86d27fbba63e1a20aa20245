According to information provided, 50 per cent of those with Covid-19 have no travel history or contact with infected persons. You can be locked in at home but the virus still meets you there. One means by which that can happen is money, cash. During one of my safety training, I learnt that cash is the most exposed item in the universe. That money in your hand, depending on how long it has been in circulation, most likely has travelled more than you. So even before Covid-19, I had learnt to wash my hands after every contact with cash. This is difficult, but I have done it for years now and it has become part of me. This is important because people can sanitise their hands and afterwards get into contact with cash. Our idea of washing hands is mostly after meeting people or touching frequently touched surfaces out there and not after touching money, especially at home. So we may buy a snack, pay for it and start eating it right away. It's normal, but these are not normal times. Scientists have not really proven how long the virus can last on things like money. You may not be able to sanitise every cash with you, but you sure can sanitise your hands after every cash transaction. So add that to your routine this season, to wash your hands after every contact with cash. People dealing with money should also wash their hands constantly and wear gloves to protect them from infection. Covid-19 comes silently and is a killer. Let us keep ourselves safe.  Mombasa
