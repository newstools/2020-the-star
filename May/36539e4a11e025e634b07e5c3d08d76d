Hip-hop artiste Hubert Nakitare, alias Nonini, is distributing sanitary towels to women in Mathare during this pandemic season. Nonini held a live Facebook show, where he raised Sh174,000. "We used the funds to buy the sanitary pads, which we will donate through Shining Hope for Communities (Shofco), an organisation in Mathare," he said. "We gonna reach out to a couple of women." When asked why he did not go for reusable sanitary towels, Nonini said conditions in the slum could hamper their hygienic use. "Water and soap are a major problem in Mathare and we are also avoiding having people from sharing them," he said. Nonini urged well-wishers to donate foodstuff to accompany the sanitary towels. "I appreciate all those who have shown their support as we also bought food for them because most of Mathare people worked at Eastleigh, which is currently on lockdown," he said.
