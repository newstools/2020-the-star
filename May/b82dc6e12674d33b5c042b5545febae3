Eldoret Catholic Bishop Dominic Kimengich and civil society groups in Rift Valley have urged the government not to allow misuse of public funds in the fight against Covid-19. Kimengich said all the money spent, including donations from the World Bank and other well-wishers, must be accounted for by those in charge. “At the moment, Kenyans are really suffering and the usual stories of corruption and misuse of public funds and resources should not be entertained at a time when the country is fighting Covid-19,” Kimengich said. The bishop also faulted the government for asking Kenyans in quarantine or isolation facilities to pay their own costs when it is obvious that the situation in the country has disrupted the economy and sources of income. “We are being told of a lot of resources being collected locally and internationally and it’s not proper that some Kenyans are forced to carry a heavy burden at such a time. The government should be able to offset some of these costs,” he said. Kimengich spoke outside his office in Eldoret. Civil society groups have also called for accountability and transparency in the use of Covid-19 resources. Representatives of the groups in Rift Valley led by Kipkorir Ngetich from the Center for Human Rights and Democracy (CHRD) said the Office of the Auditor General, the EACC and the DCI should closely follow up on the use of public funds. “No one should be allowed to take advantage of the Covid-19 situation to loot public resources. We are dealing with a critical situation and corruption should not be entertained,” Ngetich said. Bishop Kimengich has also asked Kenyans to stop stigmatising Covid-19 patients. Kimengich said cases of recovered patients being rejected within their communities are disheartening and should not be allowed to happen. Edited by A.N
