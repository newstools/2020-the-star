Kwale hotel workers who were forced to leave without pay because of the Covid-19 crisis have been assured of their dues. County Tourism executive Nasib Nyahi said they will follow up the matter to ensure they are all paid to their last penny. His statement comes just a few weeks after some Diani Reef Hotel employees, who had been sent on unpaid leave, matched to Kwale Governor’s office asking for his intervention. Nyahi said they are following up the matter to ensure the hotel management honours its pledge to pay the workers. He said they plan to meet with the Ministry of Labour, the hotel workers union and the employer to iron out the pending issues. “The county as the intermediary is trying to coordinate various stakeholders to address the salary issue and we are making good progress,” the executive said. So far,  the county has talked to the management of several hotels in the region, including Kazikazi, Diani and Amani Tiwi. However, Nyahi expressed his displeasure with how some employees have handled their issues. He said some employees rushed to courts, hence the county government cannot intervene on their behalf because their complaints are already before the courts. “In some instances, the hotel employees were very impatient and rushed to court. They have since complicated everything and we cannot do anything for now,” he said. He further said that some hotel workers are not sincere in their demands, and it is not clear what they are asking for.
