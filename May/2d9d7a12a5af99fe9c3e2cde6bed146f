The High Court has declined to set aside Sh20,000 awarded to former Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero and each of five former Mumias Sugar Company employees as cost in a suit filed by activist Okiya Omtatah and Nyakina Gisebe. However, Justice Wilfrida Okwany on Tuesday set aside the order for cost awarded to Peter Kebati (then MSC managing director) as he was not entitled to any costs and had not entered appearance. For Kidero, Peter Hongo, Chris Chepkoit, Paul Murgor,  Christine Cheprotich and Emily Otieno, the judge said, “I am not satisfied that the prayer of setting aside of the impugned order is merited.” Omtatah and Gisebe had appealed and sought to have  Justice Mumbi Ngugi's award of the suit cost set aside on the ground that it was made after the withdrawal of a petition against Kidero and the ex-MSC workers. Their petition sought to have Kidero, Hongo, Chepkoit, Murgor, Cheprotich and Otieno held liable for the economic crisis and collapse of Mumias Sugar. But Kidero and the ex-MSC employees applied to have the petition dismissed for, among other reasons, it did not disclose any reasonable cause of action against them. Justice Ngugi advised Omtatah to amend the petition to remove unnecessary parties. The petition was amended and the court allowed the withdrawal of the petition with a rider that Omtatah pay each of the seven Sh20,000 as cost of the suit. The activist did not agree with the ruling and applied to have the award set aside. But Justice Okwany ruled that it was not up to her court to determine whether  Justice Ngugi was justified to assess and award costs. That, she added, is a matter that can only be a good ground for appeal.  - mwaniki fm
