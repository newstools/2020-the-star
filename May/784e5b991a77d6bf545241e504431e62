Kenyan Premier League outfit Nzoia Sugar have embarked on a restructuring program with an eye on the future even as uncertainty looms over the fate of the current season. Chairman Evance Kadenge said this will involve a recruitment drive targeting students from the sugar belt while working on current players' contracts as they seek to keep their key stars by tying down them with long-term deals. At the same, he warned that any club interested in any of his players must follow the right procedures even though they are yet to receive any transfer bid or leave request from any club or player respectively. “It has been the norm for other clubs from this region to poach players from Nzoia FC but this time around things will be different. With new structures and new management, we aim at making this team one of the top competitors in the league," said Kadenge. He added that they are working hand-in-hand with Bungoma County government to ensure that the team collects good revenue for their home matches and also be in a position to host 'high-risk matches' involving AFC Leopards and Gor Mahia. “This will be realised once the ongoing refurbishments at Kanduyi Stadium are over. We believe this will enable us to collect enough revenue to sustain our players,” Kadenge said. The chairman also hinted that he is in discussion with sponsors who have shown interest in partnering with the club. Kadenge could not help wading into the ongoing debate over FKF's decision to invalidate the season blaming federation boss Nick Mwendwa of rushing into a decision without consulting key stakeholders.
