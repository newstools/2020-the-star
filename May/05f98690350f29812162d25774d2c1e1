A Garissa assembly committee has warned the executive against the misuse of Covid-19 funds, saying it will follow up on every expense incurred. Speaking during a visit to the county’s isolation centre on Tuesday, chairperson Mohamed Ali said they have oversight responsibility regarding the use of Covid-19 funds and implementation of control measures. “I assure Garissa residents that we will keep the executive in check and ensure that there is transparency and accountability,” he said. Ali said most of the necessary equipment had been bought and the level of preparedness is commendable. “We have inspected the testing equipment, ventilators, isolation centres and ICU facilities, and they are all up to date," he said. Committee member Mohamed Gabow warned individuals against spreading rumours that the county is unprepared to handle Covid-19 cases. He said such lies cause fear among residents. “What do you gain by using social media to spread lies that there is misuse of Covid-19 funds? We welcome criticism but it should be done in a civilised manner,” he added. The county's director of health, Mohamed Salat, said even though Garissa has not recorded any case, they are prepared to handle the pandemic. “Our isolation unit has 35 beds, an ICU and protective equipment. We have trained personnel to handle any case that will come up,” he said. Salat said in addition to preparing the subcounties, they have procured 50 more thermometers gun, bringing the total to 63. The ad hoc committee on Covid-19 is expected to table a report within 14 days, and thereafter table monthly progress reports. The final one will be presented after six months. Last week, health workers protested against delayed salaries. They also lamented the inadequacy of personal protective equipment. Edited by Frank Obonyo
