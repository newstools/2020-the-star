A man narrowly escaped death on Wednesday after his vehicle caught fire as he was driving along the Thika Superhighway. Yunus Abdul, who was driving a Mercedes, said he suspected the fire was caused by the petrol he had purchased at a station in Kasarani. "I had noticed my car engine was randomly stopping then restarting but did not take it seriously because I was heading to Homeland to conduct some business," he told the Star. However, on his way back to Kasarani, the vehicle kept acting up before eventually catching fire. "Another driver said that my exhaust pipe was emitting flames and I stepped out to take a look," he said. "I took out my fire extinguisher to try and put it out but it burst into flames." Abdul unsuccessfully tried calling the police hotline 999 before the fire brigade came. By the time the team from the fire brigade got to the scene of the accident, his car had already been consumed by the flames. Emmanuel Khalasinga, a rider from Kiganjo area said he was headed to Nairobi when he noticed a cloud of smoke that caught his attention. "I rushed to the scene and saw this vehicle burning so I stopped to control and direct vehicles to avoid congestion and traffic," he said. Tow trucks from Kasarani police station removed the vehicle from the highway.
