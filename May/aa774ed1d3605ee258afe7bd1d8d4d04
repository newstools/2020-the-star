 Bungoma Woman Representative Catherine Wambilianga has fired her long-serving personal assistant Allan Wocha, accusing him of corruption and gross misconduct. She accused Wocha of committing fraud and failing to remit statutory deductions from her office. “I am forced to terminate his contract following his failure to explain the whereabouts of missing cash in my office, for which he was the signatory,” Wambilianga said. Wocha, however, denied the claims and said the MP should blame her office manager. “I was only a signatory to the account but not an AI holder. The MP should be honest and tell the truth,” Wocha said. He said the problem with statutory deductions arose because of the delay by the Parliamentary Service Commission to release money, which is done every three months. “Kenya Revenue Authority had a problem because of penalties and it was not my mistake,” he said. Wocha said there was more to his exit, blaming personal issues. But Wambilianga said Wocha was the only signatory left after he fraudulently removed other signatories. “He has been pocketing all statutory deductions including other staffs’ PAYE, NHIF, NSSF. This is corruption of the highest order which I can’t entertain in my office,” she said. The lawmaker also accused her PA of forging her office letterheads and writing to many organisations for favours. “What do you expect me to do when I am called that I wrote a letter to a certain organisation which I am not aware of? Isn’t this fraud?” Wambilianga said. She said Wocha asked for job vacancies at Nzoia Sugar Company claiming he had been sent by her and sold the slots. “I have also received numerous messages about him asking for sexual favours before allowing clients to see me," Wambilianga said. The legislator warned other staff members against misconduct, saying they risk being jailed.  Edited by Frank Obonyo
