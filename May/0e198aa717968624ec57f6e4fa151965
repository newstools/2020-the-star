At least 10 officers from City Hall’s procurement department have been urged to test for the coronavirus after their colleague tested positive. The Star established that last week on Thursday the woman went for the ongoing Covid-19 mass testing carried out by the Nairobi Metropolitan Service. Nairobi county has been the epicentre of Covid-19, leading with 650 confirmed cases as of Tuesday. A City Hall employee who sought anonymity said the officer's results came and the county government was notified on Tuesday. “ She was in the office last week and when the news reached to us, all those who had been in close contact with her were ordered to go for self-quarantine for 14 days," the officer said. Confirming the case, Nairobi Health executive Hitan Majevdia said the woman had already been isolated and all the four staff who had been working with her had gone for Covid-19 testing. “Yes, indeed, it is true and we have already isolated her and her close contacts. What I know is she was not an outgoing person but we have to take necessary precautions especially on the colleagues she has been working with,” he said. Majevdia said they had commenced contact tracing of all who might have come into contact with her since she worked in a public office. “Being a public office, we might not be able to know the number of people she interacted with but the contact tracing will give clear guidance," he said The Health executive said tests would be carried out on the 10 officers who were asked to self-quarantine before they are allowed back to work. The procurement office was fumigated by the county government’s public health officials after the case was reported. The Nairobi Metropolitan Service and the Ministry of Health are currently carrying out free mass testing in the city expected to last until May 31. Edited by Henry Makori
