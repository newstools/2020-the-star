Kenya Rugby Union (KRU)  Independent Judicial Committee has banned Kenya Cup side Blak Blad and Kisii RFC from using their home ground next season. The two clubs were handed banned after they were found guilty of misconduct during their abandoned games. Kenyatta University’s Blak Blad were handed the severest ban of seven games and will have to play their matches away from home while Kisii's initial six-game ban was reduced to five after admitting the charges. Blak Blad and Kisii RFC were charged with failing to provide security, leading to pitch invasion. This was a breach of Regulation 20.4 (a), which touches on acts of violence or intimidation within the venue in which the match is being played. According to the charges, the clubs failed to ensure the game was played and conducted in a disciplined manner The IJC hinted that it is not sufficient to rely solely upon the match 0fficials to maintain those principles as required by the World Rugby Code of Conduct 1.1. Blak Blad’s charges were related to their game against Kabras, which was abandoned in the 44th minute after the referee David Ngetich cancelled out the hosts' try. Kisii, on the other hand, were charged in relation to their game against Eldoret RFC at Gusii Stadium. Both games were played on February 29. The Kenya Cup side were initially banned for six games during the 2020/2021 season but were added one game after providing inaccurate and misleading information about the previous disciplinary record of the club. The club was further accused of failing to comply with requirements of an early suspended sentence of four games. During the hearing by George Mbaye and Willy Ombisi, Kisii team manager, George Sagini acknowledged guilt and proposed action plan to mitigate such incidents in future. The hearing was done via video link.
