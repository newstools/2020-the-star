Three women from Machakos have been feeding police officers manning the Koma roadblock along Kangundo Road for the last three weeks. This has drawn the attention of the security top brass led by Interior CS Fred Matiang'i and Inspector General of Police Henry Mutyambai. During their supervision mission on Friday, the duo met and thanked Priscilla Kioko, a lawyer and hotel operator based in Tala town, Matungulu subconty, who with two other women, has been feeding  offices manning the roadblock. Mutyambai said it was a good gesture and sign of community policing, where residents work closely with the police in the fight against crime. The women said they decided to feed the officers after they noticed the officers were hungry and thirsty as there were no shops or kiosks nearby. This is even as Matiang’i told the officers to remain firm in enforcing the 7pm-5am curfew. Matiang’i told the multi-agency officers manning the roadblocks erected in Machakos and Kajiado counties not to allow unauthorised movement in and out of Nairobi Metropolitan. They also visited officers at Athi River along Mombasa Road and those in Isinya, Kiserian and Kibiko in Kajiado county.. The two were received by the respective county security teams. President Uhuru Kenyatta on March 27 imposed a three-week ban on movement in and out of four main coronavirus infected areas counties namely Nairobi, Mombasa, Kilifi, and Kwale. Uhuru extended the movement cessation by 21 more days on April 25. Edited by E.Kibii
