 The University of Nairobi will get the largest share of the Sh113 billion for operations of higher learning institutions for the next financial year. Treasury CS Ukur Yatani has proposed Sh5.9 billion to UoN, which needs to generate Sh11.4 billion own revenue to meet its Sh17.3 billion spending needs. The estimates show that a plum portion of the universities’ income is spent on recurrent costs. Of the Sh113 billion, Sh107 billion has been allocated for salaries and operations and a paltry Sh4.4 billion left for development. Universities are expected to raise Sh50 billion in own revenue, leaving a balance of Sh57.5 billion to be provided by the government should MPs approve Treasury's proposals. The amounts include allocations for Helb at Sh16.8 billion of which Sh5.5 billion will be from the student loan agency’s sources. Universities’ income sources include research grants, farming – dairy and crop; health services; tuition fees and capitation funding by the state. Treasury’s recurrent spending plan shows that Moi University has been allocated Sh4.8 billion while Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture (Jkuat) will receive Sh4.3 billion. Kenyatta University has been apportioned Sh4.1 billion, Masinde Muliro University (Sh2.9 billion), Egerton (Sh2.1 billion), and Maseno University (Sh2 billion). The University of Eldoret will get Sh1.9 billion; Chuka (Sh1.3 billion); Kisii (Sh1.1 billion); and Maasai Mara (Sh1 billion). Students in private universities have been allocated state sponsorship worth Sh2.4 billion in the proposed budget. Jaramogi Oginga Odinga University will get Sh984 million; The Technical University of Mombasa (Sh922 million); South Eastern Kenya (Sh909 million); Dedan Kimathi (Sh891 million); Laikipia (Sh863 million); Kabianga (Sh780 million); Karatina (Sh722 million); Tharaka University College (Sh278 million); Pwani (Sh748 million) and Meru (Sh692 million). Apart from Nairobi, Jkuat seeks to net Sh6.9 billion whereas Kenyatta University is working with Sh6.1 billion. Moi University is also in the pool of high-income earners at Sh4.6 billion; Maseno University (Sh1.80 billion); Masinde Muliro (Sh1.85 billion) and Egerton (Sh1.5 billion). Mombasa’s TUM is expected to raise Sh969 million from its sources to fund its Sh1.8 billion budget. Chuka University has been projected to raise Sh873 million in own-source revenue while Pwani and South-Eastern are looking at Sh453 million and Sh403 million respectively. Laikipia needs to raise Sh504 million; Dedan Kimathi (Sh622 million); Jaramogi (Sh698 million); Meru (Sh454 million); Multimedia University (Sh705 million); Maasai Mara (Sh300 million); Kabianga (Sh420 million); Eldoret (Sh643 million); Karatina (Sh336 million). In terms of development, Yatani appears to have focused on critical infrastructure at ‘young colleges’ with Meru topping the list at Sh307 million. Jaramogi follows at Sh290 million; Tharaka (Sh243 million); Cooperative University (Sh156 million); Embu (Sh150 million); Machakos University College (Sh148 million); Kabianga (Sh143 million); Kibabii (Sh130 million); Gatundu University College (Sh126 million); Rongo (Sh125 million); and  Chuka (Sh101 million).
