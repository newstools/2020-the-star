Menengai Oilers are seeking to sign a centre and scrum-half ahead of the 2020-2021 season. Head coach Gibson Weru said the two positions were problematic for them this season and they urgently need cover for the positions. “This season we struggled in those positions and going forward, we will need a very experienced scrum-half and a versatile centre who can cover both positions,” added Weru. He said despite qualifying for the playoffs for the first time in the club’s young history, they would have finished higher on the table if the two areas were well covered. “As a club, we were delighted to get into the top six playoffs but there are games we should have won which would have taken us higher on the table. I am talking about matches against Quins and Impala which we lost by narrow margins. With a little bit of experience, who knows we may have a home playoff fixture rather than travelling away,” added Weru. Weru’s charges finished sixth with 41 points—33 behind league leaders Kabras. The former Sevens international said their goal in the Kenya Cup next season, will be to narrow the gap between them, the sugar millers and champions KCB. “We are looking at bridging the gap between us and the top two. We need to be closer to them in terms of points and it’s an area we are going to work on during the offseason and get the players in the right frame of mind both physically and mentally,” noted Weru. He said the club will continue signing players from school as part of their policy. “The team has been built on talent fresh from schools,” he added. Weru was, however, non-committal on when they intend to start their pre-season, owing to the  coronavirus pandemic.
