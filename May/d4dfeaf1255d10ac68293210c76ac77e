Despite the uncertainty that surrounds the 2019/2020 Kenyan Premier League Season, Kakamega Homeboyz coach Nicholas Muyoti says players will need  reasonable amount of time to recover before taking onto the pitch. Muyoti said everybody was caught off guard by the government restrictions aimed at combating the spread of coronavirus thus had no time to make any kind of arrangements when the  break was effected. “Most of us were not prepared at al. The break got us off guard and we had no choice but to close camps without proper plans,” said Muyoti. “Following the slow rate at which the virus was spreading across the country, no one could have thought of tailor-making any home-training programmes for players.” “We expected the situation to be controlled as fast as possible and allow us resume action but it’s worrying that there seems to be no solution in site,” added Muyoti, whose team was second when the league was halted. “We aren’t sure whether the league will resume but if it does, then clubs will have to be given some time for players to regain fitness.” In the meantime, Muyoti revealed he is keeping his players engaged with some light training to ensure they maintain a minimum level of fitness. “I am scheduling a light-training program divided into morning, mid-morning, afternoon and evening sessions aimed at ensuring players remain fit,” he said. “Training in sessions will help us maintain the social distancing that is required by the Ministry of Health. We must be ready for whatever decision the league body takes.” Football Kenya Federation had annulled the league but the decision did not go down well with some sections of the fraternity. This saw KPL head to the Sports Disputes Tribunal to have the decision reversed while Chemelil Sugar sought legal redress in court.
