Businessman and music producer Tedd Josiah has called out male celebrities who use their status to take advantage of vulnerable girls and women. Tedd said being a celeb does not give one the right to disrespect and use other people. "You’re a celebrity, meaning you are celebrated. For what? For drinking yourself stupid? For all the drugs you can consume?" he said. "Now, brothers, when you become predators attacking vulnerable women with your little money just because you know they need it and you can use your cash to hurt, misuse and abuse them know this." He went on to remind them to stop testing God as He could take away their celebrity status and the money they are using to hurt women. "He can and will bring you to your 'road to Damascus', and trust me like Saul, you will become Paul. Don't test God just because you are a 'celeb', don't! Let’s raise our daughters to know better men and know men can be better than this," he said.
