Education CS George Magoha has dismissed possible reduction of fees after schools resume saying the government already carters for all learners. Magoha was responding to a question by an MP who asked whether the government would consider waiving fees for the needy to ease parents of the burden, following the current hard economic times. He responded, "The good government pays fees for tuition and examination for all pupils and students in primary and secondary schools, so there is nothing to waive". He spoke when he appeared before the Education committee on Thursday at Parliament Buildings. On the issue of private schools, the CS said it was up to the school and parents to agree on fees. "It is in order for private schools to negotiate with parents the percentage of fees to be paid so that learning continues and the schools are still functional," he said. "It is very difficult that the government still has to extend the money from the exchequer for tuition to private schools too, despite the parents' choice to leave the free government schools for the private schools. We may need to reconsider this". Last week parents of Brookhouse School learners were allowed to pay 50 per cent of Term Three fees pending the hearing and determination of the case between them and the institution. The order was made by the Deputy Registrar of High Court who also suspended all online classes for kindergarten to Year 4. This followed a petition to the High Court on April 29 to suspend the payment of full fees as the country grapples with the effects of Covid-19.
