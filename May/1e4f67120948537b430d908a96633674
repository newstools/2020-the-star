Former IEBC commissioner Roselyn Akombe has promised Kenyans that she will one day reveal what happened before she fled Kenya. Akombe resigned and fled to the US ahead of the repeat presidential polls on October 26, 2017. Upon her exit, she claimed that there was massive corruption at the commission that led to her fleeing the country. Since then, it is not clear why she left apart from her claims without presenting enough evidence to Kenyans who deserve answers. One Kenyan on Twitter told her that she had the chance to take Kenyans to Canaan but she wasted the opportunity. The then Opposition leader Raila Odinga invoked the Canaan analogy frequently during the 2017 elections saying that he will take Kenyans to a better life in Canaan. "... you had the chance to deliver us to Canaan but you chose to tell former CEO Ezra Chiloba how handsome he was instead of delivering credible elections," @Yanoh_KE said. But in a quick rejoinder, Akombe said he never had the opportunity or the chance to take Kenyans to Canaan. "No, I did not have a chance. I will release my story in detail one day when I am legally unbound, and you will understand what I mean," she said. "As long as we pretend that we have independent institutions, we will continue the charade." In 2018, Akombe exposed the rot at the electoral agency, providing the first insider evidence that August 8, 2017, polls could have been compromised. Her damning “end of assignment” report detailed how Chiloba put the brakes on multi-billion-shilling procurement on the pretext of time constraint, thereby ensuring they were directly sourced. Later on, Akombe told BBC that she and her brother had received death threats making them to flee the country. The brother also fled Kenya.
