Kenyan health chiefs monitoring coronavirus positive children for a bizarre disease afflicting young survivors. Multi-system inflammatory syndrome crops up, scientists in Europe and the United States say, as soon as children recover from Covid-19. Rashid Aman, the Chief Administrative Secretary for Health, said on Friday they are monitoring patients, but that they were yet to come across a case. “If we break those numbers down we do have quite a number of children as we have reported but we have no report of seeing any unusual manifestation such as the one that was described in the USA and other places,” the CAS said. He added: “We remain vigilant to be able to see if we do pick up this type of the disease in our population.” Doctors in England were the first to report the syndrome last month. The Royal College of Paediatrics estimated that between 75 and 100 children in Britain had been affected. Italian doctors have also reported the syndrome. “That is an evolving area involving the pathogenicity (manner of the development of a disease) of the virus particularly in young children that I think in due time we will learn more and see,” Aman said. Symptoms include persistent fever, inflammation and malfunction of kidneys or heart. Children may also show evidence of blood vessel inflammation, such as red eyes, a bright red tongue and cracked lips “It also depends on the frequency of this occurrence. Perhaps because of the large numbers that have been seen that are infected in the US they might be able to pick up. If the frequency is very low we may not see that because our numbers are low. But we are on the lookout,” Aman said. Doctors in the United States are investigating at least 150 children, a majority in New York.
