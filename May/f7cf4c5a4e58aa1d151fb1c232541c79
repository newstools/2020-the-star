The government has asked a patient who escaped quarantine at Mbagathi Hospital to present himself. Health CS Mutahi Kagwe on Thursday said the said patient can run but can't hide from the government. Earlier on, it was reported that a male patient escaped from Mbagathi Hospital after threatening security personnel with a screw driver and a knife. Kagwe, however, said his ministry had not been informed of the incident. "I want to appeal to this person: Please come back. Where are you running to? Your home, your wife or mother... Why are you risking the lives of others," Kagwe said. He added, "Even of you run, I want to assure you that we shall find you. The long arm of the law will catch up with you". The CS said some people who have previously escaped ended up presenting themselves after becoming ill. This comes as Kenya reported 147 new Covid-19 cases, raising the number to 1,618 positive cases. Another three patients succumbed, raising the number of deaths to 58. Also, another 13 people were discharged, raising the number of recoveries to 421. A total of 70,172 people have been tested to date. So far, 32 counties have reported cases with Nyeri and Uasin Gishu counties being the latest to have positive patients. Nairobi leads with the highest number of cases at 835. Mombasa follows with 490, followed by Kajiado and Kiambu with 65 and 39 infections. "The containment measures we have put in place might seem so simple to be ignored but globally they are the most effective. We continue to urge everyone to abide by them, " Kagwe said.
