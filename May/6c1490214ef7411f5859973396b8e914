In his message during Labour Day celebrations, Deputy President William Ruto has honoured all non-essential and self-employed workers as well as other frontline workers as the country grapples with Covid-19. Ruto commended them as people who have weathered the coronavirus disruptions to display their audacity and commitment to get work done. He reiterated the nobble commitment health workers have taken to put their own safety at risk to care for others as the country confronts the Covid-19 pandemic. "On this Labour Day, we salute and offer our unfettered support to the dedicated healthcare, policemen, and other frontline workers," he said on Friday. "Although times are tough, the measures put in place by the Government to mitigate the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic will in due course pay off". Further, Ruto condoled with families of victims of the continuing rains which have resulted in landslides and floods across the country. "We are saddened by the havoc and destruction caused by the raging floods and condole with families that have lost loved ones, among them police officers in Baringo County," he said. Meanwhile, in his speech on Friday, President Uhuru Kenyatta warned against politicising the fight against coronavirus. "Let's stop politicising this coronavirus.. all the money that has been spent during this time shall be audited in broad daylight so that Kenyans will be able to know how the money worked," he said. This was after an uproar on social media on how the money was used. A document tabled before the Health Committee of the National Assembly chaired by Murangâ€™a Woman Representative Sabina Chege indicates the ministry used Sh42 million to lease 15 ambulances. They used Sh14.4 million to maintain and fuel 30 vehicles used by officers across the country, translating to Sh40,000 per vehicle every week.
