Armed groups fighting in Siria and Uasin Gishu clans in Transamara West subcounty, Narok, have surrendered more guns to the government. Subcounty commissioner Hassan Noor said three guns and 14 bullets were recovered on Wednesday. The rifles were part of arms that have been used in the sporadic skirmishes between the two Maasai clans. The communities have fought for more than 40 years. Morans from both sides have been fighting along the Enorateet-Nkararo border contesting the demarcation done by the government. Scores of people have died over the years in the battles. At least six people were killed in the recent flareups. Sixty houses were torched in the Uasin Gishu clan. On Thursday, Noor said 14 guns had been recovered from the militia in the last three months. Nine guns were surrendered last week to security agencies undertaking operations to restore peace in the area. The response has been overwhelmingly positive, Noor said. "We have decided to extend the amnesty for one more week so that the rest of the guns can be returned," the administrator added. The government has imposed a night curfew and sent lorryloads of GSU, the Rapid Deployment Unit and the Anti-Stock Theft police to stem the violence. Noor told the militias who were yet to surrender their guns to do so by Wednesday or face a brutal operation by the security agencies. "We will have no option but to use force after the lapse of the deadline. For now, we urge any youth with an illegal gun in his possession to give it out,"Â  said the subcounty commissioner. He ruled out any further extension of the amnesty when it elapses next week. Edited by Henry Makori
