Nandi residents have been warned against seeking medication from quack medics, with reports emerging that many are keeping off public hospitals for fear of Covid-19. Deputy Governor Yulita Mitei said it was unfair to keep patients at home when hospitals in the county are deserted. Mitei said residents have unfounded fears that if one goes to the hospital and is found coronavirus positive, they will be isolated from their families. “I want to assure the Nandi community that nobody would be detained and taken to isolation centres for no reason. Patients should continue going to hospitals as was the cases before the occurrence of the coronavirus,” Mitei said. She said it was a crime to keep patients at home when the government had improved and transformed all the 194 health facilities in Nandi. The deputy governor urged the public to maintain high standards of hygiene and obey the Health ministry directive of keeping distance and wearing face masks. Mitei spoke during the burial of Christine Sang who was eulogised by Deputy President Dr William Ruto as a pioneer health worker in Nandi county. Sang is the mother of Fred Kiptanui a former YK92 official and sister to former Kenya Army Commander Augustine Cheruiyot. (edited by o. owino)
