Vihiga United players can finally afford a smile after the county government settled their five months salary arrears. The Acting chief officer for gender, culture and sports, Dominic Luvavo,   confirmed they had settled the arrears of five months—between November last year and March this year. "We do understand that our players have gone through hell during that unpaid period but I guess they understand how difficult the situation is on our side too,” Luvavo said on phone. The club chairman, Kahi Indimuli, also confirmed that the players have been paid from November to March this year. “Yes players have been paid and now they can at least smile after that long dry period,” Indimuli said. He said they are coming up with light training program that will help the team to start gaining their fitness as they prepare to face off the Kisumu All-Stars in the coming playoffs. Vihiga United are expected to face Kisumu All-Stars in the playoffs where the winner will be promoted to the Kenya Premier League. Already City Stars and Bidco United have been promoted to KPL next season. “Since the camps were closed, we can’t exactly tell what the boys are doing out there. So we are working on a simple and light program to enable them to regain their fitness," added Kahi. He said despite gearing up for All-Stars match, they are not sure whether the games will resume because the situation at hand seems to be worsening. He said the training will be done in sessions to ensure social distancing as required by the government. On the other hand, Vihiga Queens' Coach Alex Alumira said he has provided a program and he is monitoring the players' progress.
