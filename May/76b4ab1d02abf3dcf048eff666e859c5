Kenya is facing a myriad of problems including but not limited to the coronavirus pandemic, locust invasion and floods. Parents are stuck at home struggling to feed children who should be in school, joblessness is on the rise, displaced families have only the sky for their roof, while despair is driving up domestic violence. It is therefore disheartening that our leaders who should be thinking of ways and means to get us out of the current situation are busy backstabbing each other, forming coalitions and scheming on who should go for what seat come the 2022 election. Granted, politics is a way of life for politicians but divisive politics of us versus them when the country needs to pull together to surmount the challenges facing her is worrying. Kenyans immediate concerns are food, shelter, education, and their health and not who will succeed Uhuru or who should be the deputy speaker of the Senate. MPs and senators should be busy auditing the government's stimulus package and whether the interventions are working or some people are taking advantage of this to line their pockets with taxpayers' money. Members of county assemblies should be putting governors on their toes to ensure county governments account for every cent being used to hurriedly put up the Covid-19 hospitals and isolation centres. Each leader will be judged individually come election time. For now, live up to your mandate and deliver to the people.
