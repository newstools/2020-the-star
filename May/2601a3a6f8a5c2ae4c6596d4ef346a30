The Ugandan government has confirmed eight more coronavirus cases, bringing the total number to 97. Out of the new cases, three are Kenyans. The cases were out of 2,061 samples collected. The three truck drivers arrived in Uganda through the Malaba border point. They are aged between 31-47 years. This brings the total number of Kenyan drivers who turned positive in Uganda to 17. Up to date, a total of 37 truck drivers have tested positive, with 14 from Tanzania, four from Uganda, one from Burundi and the other one from Rwanda. While issuing the daily updates on the virus in Kenya on Tuesday, Health CS Mutahi Kagwe said that all the truck drivers had been asked to be tested before the journey. The CS said that the truck drivers are supposed to be tested and issued with clearance to indicate that they are free from the virus. According to the CS, the long queues of trucks being witnessed at the Malaba border point is due to some drivers who ignored being tested. The CS said that those who have been screened before the journey will be allowed to enter into the neighbouring country without any delay. “We have told our truck drivers that you should take a test from where you are departing from so that moving forward, you will not have challenges at the border point,” Kagwe said. Meanwhile, Kenya recorded the highest number of Covid-19 cases since the first outbreak on March 13. The CS said that 45 people tested positive from the samples collected in the last 24 hours. This brings the total number of cases confirmed to 535. Also, to date, 182 people have recovered from the virus while 24 have succumbed to. Up to date, the government has tested 24,869 people.
