A police officer has been detained at the Industrial Area Police Station for violently robbing a colleague of his gun. Constable Merttenich Onduso Kombo is said to have beaten Constable Newton Njangi before robbing him of a gun on the night of May 12 at Mukuru kwa Reuben slum. Njangi was injured and treated at a Lang'ata hospital, according to an affidavit before Makadara chief magistrate Emily Ominde. Inspector Maurice Cornell, who is based at the Industrial Area Police Station, sought to detain the suspect for two working days pending investigations. “Your honour, I am investigating a case of robbery with violence contrary to section 296(2) of the Penal Code. The respondent robbed his fellow police officer of a firearm after assaulting him. I am yet to record a statement from the complainant,” he said. Onduso pleaded for a free bond, claiming he is unwell and needs to see a doctor. The magistrate declined and told him he had not advanced any compelling reason why he should be freed on bond. The case will be mentioned on May 19. – mwaniki fm
