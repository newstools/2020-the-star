A Kisumu boda boda rider accused of stabbing his client to death denied manslaughter charges and was remanded in custody awaiting a pre-bail report. Stephen Onyango, who was based in Ahero, is alleged to have stabbed his cousin Peter Owate on April 17 after dropping him home in Lela location, Nyando. The two were involved in a scuffle after failing to agree on the fare. Onyango had earlier appeared before Nyando resident magistrate Reuben Sang, who ordered the suspect to appear in court after three weeks of investigations . This was prompted by a request by DCI officer Philip Otieno who needed more time to conclude investigations. Nyando OCPD Lawrence Matete told the Star that the accused ferried Owate, who paid Sh50 upon arrival at his home but Onyango demanded another Sh50, prompting a fight. Onyango grabbed a kitchen knife and stabbed him on the chest . Onyango also suffered stab wounds on the forehead. HeÂ denied manslaughter charges before principal magistrate Samson Temu Owate died on arrival at Ahero subcounty hospital. Onyango was rushed by villagers to a private clinic within Ahero as an irate mob bayed for his blood . Felix Orwa, a medic, said he was unconscious having bled from the stab wounds . The suspect was denied bond awaiting a pre-bail report to be presented in court by probation officers. He was remanded at Ahero police station. Hearing of the case has been set for July 6.
