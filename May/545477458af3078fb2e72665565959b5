Jubilee deputy secretary general Caleb Kositany and ousted Senate Majority Chief Whip Susan Kihika have lost their bid to revoke the party's move to pick five new members of the National Management Committee. Kositany had argued that the appointed NMC officials are not members of  Jubilee's National Executive committee hence disqualified for the appointment. The complaint had been filed against Jubilee secretary general Raphael Tuju and chairman Nelson Dzuya. However, the Political Parties Dispute Tribunal on Thursday declared the complaint premature, thereby striking it out. National Assembly Majority Chief Whip Benjamin Washiali and party treasurer Albert Mutai had filed the complaint alongside Kositany and Kihika. Tuju published the contested list of NMC members on May 2,  a move that party members allied to Deputy President William Ruto contested. Kositany  had accused Tuju of disregarding their wishes and breaking the law. He claimed the Registrar of Political Parties wrote to Tuju asking him to activate the party’s dispute resolution mechanisms when the list was disputed, but he did not do so. The list of published NMC members includes Lucy Nyaguthii Macharia, Marete Marangu, Walter Nyambati, Jane Nampaso, and James Waweru. The tribunal directed that all parties cover their own costs.
