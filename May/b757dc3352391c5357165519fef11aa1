Police have recovered three smoke grenades, t-shirts written 'Al Shabaab Kenya, We are ready to fight' in Githurai area in Kiambu county. This was after a landlord Josephat Kimeu made the complaint to the police. According to the police, Kimeu reported that one of his tenants Paul Mwangangi had defaulted rental payments since July 2019 and that he had locked the house since then. The landlord said he tried reaching the tenant on phone and had not yielded much result since Mwangangi refused to pick his calls. "This prompted him to break into the tenants house in order to clear it for new occupancy," the report read.. Upon breaking into the house, Kimeu came across a green bag and upon opening it, he noticed what appeared to be grenades and immediately called the police. Officers who rushed to the scene recovered one cartridge, two white t-shirts with the writings "Alshabaab Kenya, we are ready to fight," four military jungle hats and assorted identification documents. The house has been declared a crime scene.
