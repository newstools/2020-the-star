Sauti Sol is set to drop their new single, 'Insecure', today. Speaking about the song, Bien and Savara acknowledged that every person has or had some insecurities in lives that made it hard to survive. Bien says while growing up, he was worried about having a small body. "In high school, I was the weakest in the whole wing. I could wear my sweater all day, especially when we visited girls schools. "Even when it was too hot. And this came from everyone calling me 'skele'," he said. At some point in life, Bien adds that he found himself not handsome in photos. "I always looked at myself as not a handsome guy, and that made me shy away from the camera. I became insecure even while taking photos," he said. "I would stay away from all the visuals even while doing music and even today, how I look on video and photos makes me feel insecure. "In the relationship, I feel insecure that maybe I am not doing enough, maybe I'm not bringing enough on the table as a man or maybe I am not making my wife happy in the relationship." Savara says he is insecure about how he conducts himself in the group. "I exist in a group and that means that whatever I bring on the table and how I behave has to be in line with everyone else in the group," he said. This is the third single off the upcoming album 'Midnight Train', which will be launched on June 5. 'Suzanna' was the first single, followed by 'Brighter Days.' The release of 'Insecure' is in line with their commitment to "to brighten up these times of gloom and doom with music." Fans can catch the release of the new song exclusively on all Radio Africa Group radio stations this morning, which includes Classic 105, Smooth FM, Kiss 100, Radio Jambo and Homeboyz Radio.
