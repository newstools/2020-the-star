World 1,500m champion Timothy Cheruiyot believes that competing against Commonwealth champion Elijah Manang’oi strengthens their individual aspects of running. The Rongai Athletics Club duo has ruled the three and half-lap race in the recent past and according to Cheruiyot, their success as a result of the fierce competition between them. Cheruiyot’s sentiments comes barely a day after Manang’oi, the Commonwealth champion, hailed him for claiming the world title at the 2019 World Athletics Championships in Doha, Qatar. Manangoi, who was the then defending champion, missed the global showpiece due to an ankle injury. The Diamond League Trophy holder, who is also aiming to start his season in Monaco in August described Manang’oi as his close friend but with healthy rivalry on the track. The two, who are set to face off with the Ingebrigtsen brothers in the Maurie Plant Memorial race on June 11, have have set their sights on the rescheduled 2020  Tokyo Olympics. “Apart from being teammates, he is my close friend and training together makes us stronger. The competition between us helps improve our various aspects hence the good results we have post in different competitions. We are always grateful when one of us wins. It brings joy to the camp too,” said Cheruiyot, a Kenya Prisons Inspector. Meanwhile, Cheruiyot predicted a relatively tough season owing to the number of events which were pushed back due to the coronavirus pandemic. “It will be a difficult season considering that the program was disrupted but I will continue to work hard with my eyes fixed on my targets. It feels good to have resumed training after a two-month break,” observed Cheruiyot. “We began well in December but hell broke loose in March and we were forced to break camp but we pray that things will now flow smoothly. I am hoping to begin the season in Monaco in August. My ultimate goal is to go the Olympics and hopefully, clinch the title.”
