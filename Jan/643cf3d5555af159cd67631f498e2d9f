Kenya Volleyball Federation president and the Team Kenya Chef De Mission Waithaka Kioni who had asked Malkia Strikers to garner the Olympic berth as a goodbye gift to him a as a volleyball administrator said: "Thank you God. Thank you Team Kenya, we are proud of you." Malkia Strikers took commanded the opening set, taking an 8-6 at the first Technical Timeout (TTO) and went on to lead 10-6, 14-7 and 16-7 at the second TTO. The hosts kept chasing from behind but Kenya continued to stretch the gap to 21-10 and eventually won the set 25-16. The second set was a neck-to-neck showdown as Paul Bitok's charges grabbed a 5-4 and 7-5 advantage and thereafter the Cameroon Lionesses turned tables. They stopped Kenya at seven points to take the driver's seat (7-8) at the TTO. A give-and-take exchange ensued with the sides tying at 9-9, 10-10 and 14-14 before the African champions, the hosts opened a point's gap (15-16). The East Africans were refused to playing a catch-up game after the Lionesses recorded a 15-18 advantage then 18-21, 22-22 and 22-24. Kenya's chase ended in a 23-25 loss to level affairs to 1-1. With a set each in their bags, temperatures went notches higher both in the pitch and the spectating crowd in the third set. Cameroon displayed a slow start but staged a spirited comeback towards the end. Kenya romped to a 6-3 lead but soon the score difference was reduced to two points- 8-6 and 10-8. The hosts accrued a deficit of four points (16-12) and then six (19-13) and gradually reduced it to 21-16, 22-19 and 22-21. Bitok had to summon his charges to the sidelines to re-strategise and the counsel paid off the girls broke away 23-21 and went on to win 25-21 for a 2-1 set advantage.

Captained by Mercy Moim, Kenya rallied to reduce the gap to 7-10 and 10-12 but the home-girls ran away to an 11-14 and 12-16 leads. The non-relenting Malkia Strikers narrowed the gap to 17-19 then 20-22 before getting stuck at 21-24. Trying to avoid the rally set of 15, Kenya's efforts to catch up were not enough as Cameroon ran away with the set 23-25 and equalised set scores to 2-2. In the decider set, Kenya cruised to a 6-2 and 8-2 advantage and Cameroon's efforts to charge at Malkia Strikers were contained. The hosts resurgence saw them reduce the gap to 9-4, 9-6, but Kenya remained steadfast, leading 12-8, then 13-10 and eventually sealed the victory with a 15-11 set win.
