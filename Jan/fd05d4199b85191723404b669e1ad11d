Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka will lead his party members in attending the BBI forum in Mombasa on Saturday. In a statement Kalonzo's spokesperson Onesmus Kilonzo on Thursday, he said, "Musyoka will be accompanied by several MPs and MCAs, mainly from his Wiper party, who have also been drumming up support for the initiative in various parts of the country." He said Kalonzo did not attend the previous BBI meetings in Kisii and Kakamega due to commitments as Kenya’s Special Envoy to South Sudan. Wiper's move comes after a change of tune by politicians allied to Deputy President William Ruto who said they would attend the meeting in Mombasa. Senate Majority Leader Kipchumba Murkomen said the decision to join the Raila Odinga-led BBI rallies aims to ensure they are part of the process and control its narrative. “After consultation as leaders, we have decided [that] in order to pursue the original spirit of the BBI irrespective of our concerns against the use of public resources in a process that has been blessed with full nationwide consensus, we will participate and where necessary take charge of these public rallies,” Murkomen announced. Suna East MP Junet Mohamed and Nairobi Senator Johnson Sakaja told Ruto's team to attend the meeting in peace. Junet questioned the sudden change of tune from the leaders allied to Ruto to attend the BBI meeting. "You cannot keep saying one thing today and you say a different thing tomorrow. Its really confusing Kenyans," Junet said.
