Kenya Women Premier League (KWPL) side Eldoret Falcons are keen to replace their two dependable players who landed professional deals in Cyprus. The Eldoret-based team lost goalkeeper Annette Kundu and defender Ruth Ingosi to Cyprus side, Lakatamia FC. Both Kundu and Ingosi were in the Harambee Starlets team that won the 2019 Cecafa title in Tanzania with the latter emerging from the tournament with a clean sheet after failing to concede a goal. Falcons, led by Joshua Ariko, will begin their title chase against Wadadia on February 22 at Mumias Sports Complex. Ariko welcomed the move to Cyprus and wished  the duo well in their new endeavours. "They have left a big hole in the club and we have to fill it," he said. He said they organised  very successful trials on January 11t and selected 16 players ahead of next season. “Due to lack of funds, we are going to sign most players from schools. While we are yet to find replacement for Kundu, Ann Njoki of Mwiruti Secondary will replace Ingosi,” explained Ariko. According to other fixtures, defending and three time champions Vihiga Queens will start their title defence against Trans Falcons at Manour Sports ground in Kitale. Other fixtures on the opening day on February 22 will be as follows: Oserian Ladies vs Kahawa Queens (Oserian ground), Gaspo vs Thika Queens (Ruiru), Kayole Starlets vs Zetech Spartans (Stima), Sep Oyugis vs Kibera Girls Soccer Academy (K'Otieno), Mathare United vs Nakuru West Queens(Toyoyo), Wadadia vs Eldoret Falcons (Mumias), Trans Nzoia Falcons vs Vihiga Queens ( Manour Stadium), Kisumu All Starlets vs Makolanders (Moi Stadium).
