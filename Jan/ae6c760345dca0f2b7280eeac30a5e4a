Education officials led by Chief Administrative Secretary Mumina Bonaya on Friday led a door-to-door drive in Kilifi to ensure all Form 1 students are admitted. The team took the records of any last year's KCPE exam candidates who were yet to join Form 1 and offered transport to the various schools. Bonaya said the Form 1 reporting date was pushed to January 24 to allow as many of them to join their schools of choice. The President announced nationwide mop-up exercise thereafter, she said. “That exactly what we have been doing for the last three weeks. Today we are in Kilifi North. Yesterday we were in Kawangware and Mathare and tomorrow we will be in Tana River,” he said. She spoke to journalists at Gongoni in Magarini where some students were being assisted to report to school. Others in the team were the deputy director of education Hassan Duale and Coast education director, Hussein Osman. Bonaya said the move was a follow up to ensure no one is left behind in the policy to ensure 100 per cent transition from primary to secondary school. The CAS said a large number of students had already reported but were still at home due to various challenges. “You will find a situation where a child is an orphan or the parents may have moved to other areas and left them with their grandparents,” she said. Ismail Mumbo from Magarini said his sister was selected to join St Stephen In Voi whose fees are over Sh60,000 per year. He said with support from the government, they were to take her to Mapimo girls' boarding school whose fees they can afford. Records from the Ministry of Education show that the national transition rate had reached 94 per cent. However, the statistics showed that the Coast was at 88 per cent with Kiifi having 86 per cent.
