I'm going to be iron, like a lion, in Zion. These lyrics by legendary reggae musician Bob Marley were what ODM leader Raila Odinga used to warn his detractors. "The BBI train has left the station but to reach the destination, we must be iron, like a lion in Zion," he said. Raila spoke on Saturday at the third BBI rally at Mama Ngina Waterfront Park in Mombasa. He said it is useless to keep on opposing the BBI initiative that is meant to unite Kenyans and ensure the prosperity of the country. "Nobody can stop reggae," he said. The ODM leader hit out at Deputy President William Ruto, saying they are not on the same level. Ruto had insinuated that Raila approached him first before going to President Uhuru for talks that led to the Handshake. "I heard someone say that I followed him. I followed you as who?" posed Raila. "You were not a candidate. I would have looked for Uhuru only," he said. Raila sent out greetings from Uhuru, who did not attend the rally. The BBI Mombasa rally was well attended, with politicians from the political divide present. Raila said the Coast is an important region both in the history and economic prosperity of the country. He said the views sought from across the regions are meant to enrich the BBI to come up with a strong final document that will change the course of the country. "It is important that Coast also feels part of the country by having their issues addressed for the long-term," Raila said. He said the land question is not only a problem for the Coast, but for the whole country. "Land is a factor of production. We must find solutions for the land that lies idle," Raila said.
