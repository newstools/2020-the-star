Sacked Homa Bay Public Service Board members have sued the county assembly and Governor Cyprian Awiti for contempt of court. The board members say the county government led by Awiti has violated a court order that allowed them to continue operating. They also accuse the county government of closing their offices and taking away their staff and vehicles. On December 2 last year, the board members secured a court order that blocked the county government from removing them from office. The Employment and Labour and Relations Court in Kisumu had directed that the board remains in office until a case challenging the termination of their contracts is determined. The contempt case was filed in the court on Tuesday by the board chairman Daniel Ogada, secretary Collins Agutu and Tobias Odundo, a member. The controversy between the board and the county began in November last year when MCAs passed a motion recommending sacking the members over an alleged irregularity in the recruitment of staff. The board allegedly hired excess workers during recruitment of employees in the health department. The MCAs told Governor Awiti to terminate their contracts, forcing the board to go to court. In the new case filed through Bruce Odeny and Company Advocates, Awiti and county secretary Isaiah Ogwe have been accused of being responsible for the board's woes. Hearing of the case is slated for February 4, 2020.
