By Eliud Waithaka   @Waithaka06 In an apparent ritual murder and maiming, a 60-year-old woman was murdered on Friday last week and her two children critically injured. The killers — estimated by the children to be seven — slaughtered a lamb and placed its body at the door of the main house before committing the crimes. The family has fled heir home inNyariginu village in Laikipia East subcounty and relocated to Nyeri county. No one was arrested. On Wednesday, Umande location chief Wang’ombe Wanjau told the Star on the phone that the murder victim was Lucy Wanjiru. He identified her children as Ivy Gathoni and Ian Mathenge. They have been hospitalised, the son transferred to Nyeri provincial hospital for security reasons. “The case has taken a new twist with initial investigations indicating that the incident could emanate from family issues. Investigations are ongoing," Wanjau said. A postmortem will be performed on Monday; the burial will be on Tuesday. “Nothing has been happening at the home of the murdered woman. We even decided no night vigil will be conducted at the home," the chief said. Neighbours who found the body said the woman was slaughtered in a bathroom. One 38-year-old child living with disabilities was the only one spared. “The woman heard a commotion outside and thought it was her livestock being stolen. When she opened the main door, the assailants forced their way in and attacked the three people. They left without stealing anything," a neighbour said. The two injured children managed to flee and alerted their neighbours. The three were taken to Nanyuki Teaching and Referral hospital. The woman was dead on arrival. The woman and her family settled in the area a few years ago after their residence was set ablaze by an unknown people at Muthaiga estate on the outskirts of Nanyuki town, the Star has learnt.
