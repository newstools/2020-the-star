Dutch businessman Tob Cohen's widow Sarah Wairimu finally picked her personal effects from her matrimonial home in Kitisuru, Nairobi, on Monday. She said, "Thank you so much. Some of you (journalists) have not even had lunch. I came here in the morning and you've waited for us whole day. Thank you so much." Last week, Sarah was given access to her bedroom to pick her personal effects including clothes, shoes, handbags and grooming tools. Judge Daniel Ogembo denied her access to foods and alcohol, her car, her daughterâ€™s belongings, two dogs Major and Snow, electronics, files from her office and paintings. Sarah who was accused of murdering Tob Cohen has denied the charges before the court.
