Narok Governor Samuel Tunai has announced that the Building Bridges Initiative rally will be held in Narok on February 17. The county boss on Tuesday said political leaders from Narok county have thrown their weight behind the BBI drive. Tunai spoke when he held a consultative forum with MPs and MCAs from the county to strategise for the meeting. The rally will bring together Kajiado and Samburu counties. Tunai said all the leaders from the county had resolved that all residents of the county shall be free to participate and attend the rally whose venue will be determined later. "The Narok county leadership shall commend President Uhuru Kenyatta and former prime minister Raila Odinga for their leadership in this important national conversation and pledged their full support and participation,” Tunai said after the meeting. The county boss said his administration will liaise with the leadership of Samburu and Kajiado counties to build synergies ahead of the public sensitisation rally. “Narok county leadership shall continue to consult with the leadership of Kajiado and Samburu counties with a view to establishing an effective BBI steering committee to assist in the planning and logistical participation for the intended rally,” Tunai said. The Narok rally is among a series of rallies planned across the country to deepen public participation on the BBI report. Kisii, Kakamega and Mombasa have played host to the rallies while more regional meetings are planned in Kitui, Meru and Nakuru. The decision by Tunai to back the BBI rallies could be a blow to the Tangatanga team which is planning parallel rallies across the country.
