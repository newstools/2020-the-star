Festive bread is fit for human consumption, City Hall has declared. This was after a chemical analysis by the national laboratory. There had been media reports that the bread is prepared with formalin, a chemical used to preserve dead bodies. On January 7, 2019, a sample of the Brown Premix bread was taken for analysis and no formalin was detected, a report reads. “I Silala Ngala, a Public Analyst appointed under the provision of the Food, Drugs and and Chemical Substance Act, hereby certify that the seal on the sample of Brown Premix for BP received by me on January 7 was unbroken,” the report reads. “I am of the opinion that the sample does not contain formalin." Nairobi county deputy director for public health Wilson Langat confirmed receipt of the report. DPL Festive is one of the leading bakeries in Kenya and has been operating for the last 20 years. When complaints were raised about the bread, the company issued a statement denying use of preservatives. A consumer had taken to Twitter, alleging the bread he had bought was still fresh despite being past the expiry date. The bakery said that its products are safe for consumption up to seven days. It further said its products are vetted and approved by the Kenya Bureau of Standards. “We would like to state that first, DPL Festive Ltd source ingredients for baking our bread that are vetted and approved by Kebs (the country’s standards regulator),” the company said in a statement. Langat urged the public not to hesitate to report any complaint on food they feel is unfit for human consumption. "If they have any issue or complaint they should report so that we verify if it's fit for human consumption or not," HE said.
