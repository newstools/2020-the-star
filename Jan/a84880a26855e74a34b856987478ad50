KRU Championship leaders Strathmore Leos expects  routine win against debutants Eldoret RFC when they face off tomorrow at the University of Eldoret grounds. Leos coach Louis Kisia  said: “We are going there for a win. We don't underrate Eldoret but our aim is to win." However, his Eldoret counterpart David Wachie warned Leos, saying they should not expect an easy game. “We are underdogs going into the game but we have prepared well for them. I hope my young team will pick some lessons from the experienced Leos side,” he said. Wachie said they signed Eric Nyangoya from Kenya Cup side Nakuru RFC in the mid-season transfer. Leos lead the log with 48 points— eight  ahead of second-placed Masinde Murilo University of Science and Technology. MMUST will be at home in Kakamega County against Catholic Monks while third placed Mean Machine will battle USIU Martials. Egerton Wasps welcome Northern Suburbs at Egerton University in Njoro while University of Eldoret's Trojans host Howard Okwemba's South Coast Pirates. Gusii Stadium will host a bottom of the table clash between hosts Kisii RFC and Mombasa. Kisii are bottom without a point. The eight points they won in wins against Northern Suburbs and Egerton Wasps were docked after the club failed to honour four away matches due to financial challenges.
