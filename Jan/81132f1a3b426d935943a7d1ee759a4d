Ushuru head coach James Omondi has maintained that automatic promotion to the Kenyan Premier League will be theirs to lose despite trailing league leaders Nairobi City Stars by 16 points. Ushuru have this season blown hot and cold, thanks to the changes effected in the technical bench and playing unit at the start of the season. They sit fourth with 36 points from 21 matches. However, Omondi who is commonly referred as Odijo, insists that the team will not settle for anything less than the two top spots and bulldoze their way back to the top flight. The taxmen were axed to the second tier in 2016 and have come close to gaining promotion in the past, only to falter in the final rounds. Omondi, who was elevated to the rank of head coach after the axing of his boss Ken Kenyatta, said he was keen to close the gap between his side and the top teams and later seek to grab one of the promotion slots when the league heads to homestretch “Our objective remains to finish in the top two. We are not scared of the gap between us and the other teams as we will be pursuing to beat them and maintain a winning streak to catch up and dislodge them. We are taking one match at a time and I believe the players at my disposal know that our time in the second tier is up,” he said. Omondi attributed their lukewarm run in the first leg to a change of philosophy and the transition from the post Kenyatta era. He also noted that the youthful new player,  who were signed at the start of the season had  struggled to adapt in the league. “The team’s performance in the first leg was largely underwhelming as we introduced new players who took time to adapt to my philosophy. "I spend most of the time trying to instil confidence in the players and teaching them to play modern football which contrasts to my predecessor’s style of play. "I have allowed them to freely express themselves on the pitch and the fruits are evident from the time the second leg began,” he added.
