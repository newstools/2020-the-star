Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya has been re-elected unopposed as the chairman of the Council of Governors. By consensus, governors granted Oparanya, governors Mwangi Wa Iria (Murang'a) and Kivutha Kibwana (Makueni) another term as CoG chairman, vice chairman and chief whip, respectively. "The council of governors is an organised organisation. The elections were by consensus and without any acrimony as was being portrayed by the media," Wa Iria said. CoG chairman Wycliffe Oparanya, who enjoys close ties with Raila, retained his position for a final second term after serving for the past year. Oparanya was elected by his colleagues last year in January to take over from Turkana's Josphat Nanok who led the council for two years. The position of chairman of the Council of Governors is an influential post that has elevated the political profile of officeholders. Seen as the link between 47 governors and the national government, the post has given its occupants a lot of national leverage and often unfettered access to the top leadership of the national Executive. Enjoying an array of privileges including a standby chopper for official functions, the officeholders have been able to build formidable national influence. The CoG chair is also the vice-chair of the Summit, the apex body for intergovernmental relations between counties and the national government that is chaired by the President.
