University of Nairobi VC Stephen Kiama has warned stakeholders from entering into a contract with any other person apart from him. "This is to inform all stakeholders and collaborators that any person or institution entering into a contract with any other person other than the legally appointed Vice Chancellor purporting to represent the university does so at their own peril ..." he said. In a notice published in one of the local dailies on Sunday, Kiama said the university will not honor or be held liable for such commitments. "...any resolution originating from any other university organ which by statute are chaired by the VC or any other person expressly authorised by him in writing similarly will not be binding," he said. On Saturday, Kiama said he will not back out as Vice Chancellor despite Education CS George Magoha revoking his appointment. Through a memo to the University staff and students, the recently appointed VC  asked the University's council members to ignore Magoha's move to get it dissolved. Magoha  revoked the appointment of Kiama as the new vice chancellor of UoN. Instead, the CS appointed Deputy Isaac Mbeche to act as the new VC pending consultation. He said the appointment of a substantive vice chancellor will be done after the completion consultative meetings. But he noted that Kiama will continue dispensing his duties as the Deputy Vice Chancellor, Human Resource and Administration at the university.
