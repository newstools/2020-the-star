Kitui Flour Millers have refuted reports that their flour Unga wa Dola is among the Kenya Bureau of Standards list of toxic maize meals. In a press statement on Friday, the firm's Public Relations Director Kevin Otiende said they have not been ordered by Kebs to withdraw their product from the market. "We continue to deliver the highest quality of flour through meticulous international standards that form the basis of our production and Kitui Flour Mills wishes to assure all our customers and partners that Unga wa Dola maize meal is not affected by the directive.," he said. Otiende added, "Kitui Flour Mills produces the “Unga wa DOLA’’ brand, which is totally different as per Kebs' certifications and barcoding. Yesterday, Kebs asked supermarkets to pull out 17 maize brands for having high aflatoxin levels. From the list, the bureau indicated that the banned Dola flour was a product of Eldoret Grain millers and not Kitui Flour millers. The brands include; Jomba, Adardere Mupa, Afya, Uzima, Sungura, Dola, Tetema, African King, Unique, Mlo, City Corn, Sarafina, Tosha, Shiba, Hakika Best, Budget and Wema. "While conducting its mandate of market surveillance, KEBS tested maize meal brands and has found some of them to contain levels of aflatoxins higher than the requirement," director market surveillance Peter Kaigwara said. In a statement on Thursday, Kaigwara said the maize brands are unsafe for human consumption.
