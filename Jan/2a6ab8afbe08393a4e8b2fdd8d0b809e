National Super League side Migori Youth coach Robert Ojienda yesterday said his agenda to guide the club to the Kenya Premier League will not be derailed by the imminent departure of two key players. Current NSL top scorer Clinton Okoth and attacking midfielder Antionio Abwao are being coveted by a host of Kenya Premier League clubs. KPL champions Gor Mahia, Kenya Commercial Bank, Tusker and Bandari have all shown interest in the duo, according to Ojienda. However, he said the players are yet to sign for any club. Abwao and Okoth were in Kisumu on Sunday for the friendly against KPL side Western Stima but did not feature. “They are still our players. However, we are in talks with some clubs but we have not reached any agreement. The players will feature for us this weekend,” said Ojienda. He said even if they leave, they still have players capable of plugging the gap. “We have many youthful players who will take up the places. We are not worried by their departure,” he noted. The tactician added: “My target remains Kenya Premier League. At the moment, we don't have a team from Migori following the expulsion of Sony Sugar for failing to honour three matches. We want to fill that void.” On the 1-0 loss to Western Stima, Ojienda said he is impressed with his boys. “We have eight players on trials. I gave them an opportunity in the first and second half and they played well. The technical bench will sit down to decide their fate,” he noted. On Sunday, Migori Youth start their second leg with an encounter against former Kenya Premier League side Vihiga United at Awendo Green Stadium in Migori county. “Even though we have only trained for four days, we are ready to battle Vihiga. I know it will not be an easy match but the boys are set,” Ojienda added.
