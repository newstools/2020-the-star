Security detail will be withdrawn from government officials involved in crime, Inspector-General of Police Hillary Mutyambai has said. Mutyambai on Monday that they will not be accorded security until they are cleared by the courts. "The NPS shall not provide security detail to VIPs who are involved or suspected to be involved in crime until they are cleared by the courts," the statement read. Mutyambai further directed that those VIPs who are civilian firearm holders shall have their certificates cancelled and weapons withdrawn. "The VIPs who are accorded this privilege shall reciprocate by being law-abiding at all times to avoid compromising and demeaning the very essence of which the police is mandated," he added. This comes after Embakasi East MP Babu Owino wasÂ charged with the attempted murder of Felix Odhiambo commonly known as DJ Evolve at B-club on Friday last week. He has also been charged with behaving disorderly while carrying a firearm. The MP is said to have become disorderly while carrying a pistol and firing one round of ammunition while intending to shoot at the DJ.
