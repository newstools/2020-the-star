Singer Vivian will headline the Dominate Mentorship Programme that will be going down on March 21 at the Landmark Hotel, Isiolo Speaking about the upcoming event, NibC Entertainment event manager Wisdom Kizito said, â€œThis is our first Dominate Mentorship programme in Isiolo as we get celebrities to come and mentor youths on how they can explore their purpose." Adding, "Isiolo has a lot of talented youths but they lack exposure and support, so they end up choosing to follow the wrong path of using drugs and some of them join terrorist groups. "We are coming up with projects that can help keep youths busy as we nurture their talents and teach them how they can turn them into business or income-generating activities. We are planning to host more editions this year as we teach youths how to create opportunities using their talents."
