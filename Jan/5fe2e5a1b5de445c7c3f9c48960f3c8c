Starehe MP Charles Njagua, popularly known as Jaguar, has taken a swipe at Embakasi East MP Babu Owino who is in remand at Industrial Area. Jaguar on Tuesday said he was donating mattresses to Industrial Area prison and Babu could benefit from them. "Today I will donate over 200 mattresses to Industrial Area Prison, Starehe. I believe that remandees should be as comfortable as possible as they await the outcome of their cases. My colleague, Hon. Babu Owino, will benefit from one of the heavy-duty mattresses," he wrote on Facebook. Babu was on Monday charged with the attempted murder of Felix Odhiambo, popularly known as DJ Evolve, at B-club. CCTV footage from the club showed Babu drawing his gun and shooting a man. He was also charged with behaving in a disorderly manner while carrying a firearm. Babu appeared before chief magistrate Francis Andayi and denied all charges preferred against him. He urged Kenyans to wait for his side of the story over the shooting incident at B-Club last Friday. "I urge Kenyans to wait for my side of the story of what happened when I come from my new home at Industrial Area prison," Babu tweeted. The MP said that he needs justice and it must be served to him, adding "meanwhile these are occupational hazards." A CCTV footage from the club showed Babu Owino drawing his gun and shooting a man. According to the CCTVÂ  footage shared by K24 on Twitter, the gun shot made those around Babu to run helter skelter as others looked by.
