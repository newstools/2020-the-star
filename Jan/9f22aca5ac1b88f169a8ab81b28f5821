Embakasi East MP Babu Owino will remain in remand for the next seven days. The court on Monday has ordered that a probation bail report be filed by the probation department within seven days. According to Chief Magistrate Francis Andayi, the views of the victim, Felix Odhiambo has not been mentioned on whether bail should be granted or not. The report will, therefore, include the views of the DJ on Babu's release. The court will rule on whether he will be granted bail on January 27. The Embakasi East legislature was arrested on Friday and booked at Kilimani police station over the shooting of Felix Orinda, popularly known as Dj Evolve, at B- Club in Kilimani. Nine bullets, a spent cartridge, and a CZ P-10 C gun were confiscated. On Saturday the legislator was 'secretly' moved to Gigiri Police Station. Lawyer Cliff Ombeta said his client was transferred to avoid interference with investigations because people were crowding at Kilimani station insisting they want to talk to Babu Owino. "He was transferred to Gigiri to avoid slowing down investigations because people were insisting on speaking to him. At Gigiri is where other formalities and his fingerprints were taken," he said.
