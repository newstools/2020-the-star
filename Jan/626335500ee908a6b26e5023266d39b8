Njoro Sub County Police Commandant, Mohammed Huka has disputed claims of student arrests during riots in Egerton University main campus in Njoro since Sunday evening. Huka said that the reports by the media were false and no student has been arrested adding that businesses across the gate remained closed for security reasons. For the better part of Monday morning, students engaged the police in running battles as they hurled stones at the officers. There are instances of normalcy as part of the students had decided to comply with the campus' demands. Trouble started on Friday when the first and fourth-year students were supposed to report back. They were however required to pay Sh17,000 each for damages during a strike in the institution on December 4, last year. Students had protested against the administration's move seeking to block students with fee areas from sitting exams. They were supposed to produce receipts at the gate to access the campus or sign a commitment form to comply with the terms. Signing the agreement would require the students to pay the fee before the end of February failure to which, they would be deregistered. Majority of students ave remain adamant about paying the stated fee saying it is unreasonably too high. The student protested the decision and wanted to gain entrance without complying to the demand. This compelled the officers who included the General Service Unit to shoot live bullets in the air to disperse them. The students were scheduled to start their examinations Monday. There was no comment from the University because journalists were not allowed in. Last evening, a Royal Media Services journalist was injured and his phone confiscated and equipment destroyed by police when he was covering the riots.
