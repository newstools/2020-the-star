Lawyer Miguna Miguna has written a moving tribute to his father in law after missing the burial. Benson Awange died on January 2, 2020 in Migori county. Miguna's effort to return to Kenya and attend the burial has faced oppositions after the court postponed his case to March 23 in absence of his lawyers. Evident that he will not be present, Miguna sent his emotional tribute to the father in law. "I apologise to Jaduong' na Omolo Awange for me not having the raw power to attend the funeral by force. But I am here with you in spirit. My soul is right here with you," Miguna said. He described his father-in-law as a man who loved reading books and was able to read all his books including newspapers. "Mzee Molo Awange read all my published books, newspaper commentaries and closely followed my media engagements. He was a political, social and economic connoisseur. An organic intellectual". He also thanked the late for allowing him to be the husband to his daughter for the last 20 years. "As I take my flight to Toronto, Canada where I leave in forced exile, allow me to pay you my last respect in-absentia," Miguna said. The lawyer has vowed to keep fighting for his rights, saying that he will not give up. "I had planned to attend the funeral and pay my last respects. I had booked the flight from Toronto to Nairobi via Germany. My flight was to land in Nairobi no January 7...it was because of those illegal "red alerts" that both the German airline Lufthansa and  French counterpart, Air France, could not fly me to Kenya," he explained. His lawyer John Khaminwa will table application today opposing the date. Khanimwa said on Tuesday that his client Miguna is facing a rough time while  abroad.
