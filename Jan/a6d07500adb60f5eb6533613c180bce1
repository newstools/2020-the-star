Limuru legislator Peter Mwathi has asked the government to consider extending the commuter train restoration to Limuru town. Mwathi said restoring the old railway was good, since it would boost the economy of the country by easing movement. The rehabilitation extends from Railway Station in Nairobi through Kawangware to Kikuyu town. However, Mwathi wants it to be extended up to Limuru town. He said it would ease movement for traders who take their goods to Nairobi. He spoke on Monday at Gatimu village in his constituency accompanied by NG-CDF chairman Stephen Thiiru. The legislator said farmers would benefit from reduced transport costs. Mwathi said Limuru has become one of Nairobi's dormitory towns since many city workers live there. Other towns where city workers rent houses include Machakos, Ngong, Kikuyu, Kiambu, Ruiru and Wangige. "We have noticed people from different regions in this country who are working in Nairobi city are renting houses here in Limuru" the MP said. "This is because we only spend about 40 minutes to get to Nairobi." The government has embarked on restoration of the old railway line to ease movement from Nairobi to neighbouring towns. Mwathi also applauded the government for upgrading the highway from James Gichuru road to Rironi. "We are so happy that we know in the near future, movement will be easy to Nairobi," he said. However, the project which is funded by the World Bank for Sh16.4 billion has faced challenges from residents demanding land compensation. People Affected by Project chairman Kimani Njuki said about 1,500 people have been affected from Westlands, Kabete, Kikuyu and Limuru where the project passes. "We have not been compensated since the project started about four years ago," he said.
