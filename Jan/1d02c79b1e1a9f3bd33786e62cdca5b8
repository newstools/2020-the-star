At least 247 needy students in Turkana are set to benefit from the Elimu scholarship programme. Elimu scholarship programme partners with the World Bank, the national government and Equity Bank to select bright but needy students who sat their KCPE exams in public schools and scored 280 marks and above. Collins Mukangu, the general manager in charge of Elimu scholarship in North Rift, said the community scholarship selection committee includes religious leaders, government leaders and community leaders. “The Elimu scholarship programme only targets students who sat KCPE exams in public schools. With the help of Equity Bank's 11 years of selection experience in the Wings to Fly programme, we have absorbed 247 students in seven subcounties in Turkana,” Mukangu said. Emmanuel Ngasike is one of the beneficiaries of Elimu scholarship programme. He sat his KCPE exam at Maggies Primary School in Kangatotha, Turkana Central, and scored 306 marks out of the possible 500 mark and will join St Joseph Lapur Boys in Turkana for his studies. “My target was score 350 marks so that I could get sponsorship from Wings to Fly or KCB Foundation scholarship to join a national school but I only managed to get 306 marks. My parents do menials jobs to provide for us and could not afford my school fees,” he said. He said when he applied for the Elimu scholarship, he was shortlisted and managed to pass the interview. Ngasike wants to become a doctor to help Turkanas.
