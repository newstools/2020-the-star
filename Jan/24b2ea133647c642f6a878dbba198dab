Nyeri Governor Mutahi Kahiga, the new chairman of the CoG Education Committee, says competitive sports should be part of Vocational Traning at polytechnic institutes. Speaking to the Star on the phone after his election on Monday, Kahiga said he would lobby the government for more funds for both vocational training and Early Child Development Centres. He said the government's contribution of Sh15,000 per VTC learner "is not enough". Counties will plan for more funds, Kahiga said. Governors plan for sports activities in polytechnics so students’ other talents can be tapped and nurtured, he said, making vocational training more attractive. The CoG will prepare a calendar of sporting events and how they will be funded, he said. “Just as in primary and secondary schools, we plan to start and support sporting activities in polytechnics so that learners can discover and grow their other talents," he said. Kahiga said some counties have hired Early Childhood Development Education teachers while others have never done so. ”I will ensure there is a unified scheme of employment and services for ECDE teachers. This will ensure all counties hire teachers for the benefit of all children," he said. Their pay also should be standardised, he said. The Nyeri county chief added that they had prepared a draft on how to run ECDEs and that he will push for its implementation. Kahiga was a school teacher and the Nyeri Knut treasurer before he entered politics. Edited by R.Wamochie
