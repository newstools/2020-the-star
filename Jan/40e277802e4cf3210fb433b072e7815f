President Uhuru Kenyatta has ordered Salaries and Remuneration Commission to start paying security officers' field allowance starting this month. "Watu wa salaries commission mko wapi? Field allowance ya hawa watu iko wapi?" Uhuru posed. (Where are these SRC officials? Where are these people's field allowance?) Speaking in Mombasa on Friday, Uhuru scolded the SRC on why they were delaying to pay the officers. "So watalipwa lini?(When will they be paid)  work with them and they should be paid by end month. They are doing their job," he said. Uhuru directed the Salaries and Remuneration Commission (SRC) to ensure security officers working in terror hot-spots in the North-Eastern region and parts of the Coast receive a field allowance.
