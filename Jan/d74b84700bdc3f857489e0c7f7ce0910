 Substitute Harry Arter scored moments after coming on to send Fulham into the fourth round of the FA Cup with victory over Premier League side Aston Villa. Anthony Knockaert had put the Championship club ahead with a stunning strike before Anwar El Ghazi equalised less than 10 minutes later. But Arter restored the hosts’ lead with a blistering effort of his own from 30 yards — his first Fulham goal. The Cottagers are into the fourth round for the first time in three seasons. But Villa — who are 17th in the Premier League - have now gone four years without winning an FA Cup match. They have been eliminated by sides from lower leagues in their past two ties in the competition.
