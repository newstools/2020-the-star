Kocholia subcounty hospital in Teso North has received a facelift. Busia county government launched the tarmacking of the 550 metres access road linking the health facility to the Malaba-Bungoma highway on Monday. Deputy Governor Moses Mulomi launched the upgrading of the road accompanied by roads chief executive Okwara Ekirapa and contractor Hassan Shabram of Hanal Investments Ltd. The road which starts at the junction of Malaba-Bungoma highway will have an extension of 20 metres past the hospital's main entrance. Speaking before launching construction works, the deputy governor said the road is part of the 210 projects the county government has started implementing across the county. He said the contractor should ensure quality work completed in time, noting that the weather was favourable for the work. Mulomi said the county government was undertaking the construction of male wards and rehabilitation of the laboratory at the Kocholia subcounty hospital. He said the theatre and X-ray machines recently launched were already functional. “Future plans for the hospital include fencing, construction of outpatient and emergency facilities and houses for staff,” he said. The Malaba sewerage project will include an ablution block at Kocholia market. Mulomi said the county government has set aside Sh16 million to arreas of community health volunteers. The payments will be done before close of January. A further Sh57 million will be shared among all hospitals across the county as facility improvement fund. Roads executive Ekirapa thanked MCAs for supporting his department, promising to deliver on his mandate. He said Kocholia was among urban centres listed to receive street lights, with the Kocholia hospital access road set to benefit from the rural electrification program. Malaba South MCA David Kokonya lauded Governor Sospeter Ojaamong for being considerate to the plight of rural folk.
