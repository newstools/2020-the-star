The Director of Public Prosecution Noordin Haji has said another prosecutor has been deployed to Kilungu Law Courts following a drama that transpired on Friday. There was drama in Kilungu law courts in Makueni when Mark Wangi, who is the prosecutor appeared in court and grabbed files and charge sheets before leaving. The alleged drunk prosecutor paralysed court proceeding before Senior Resident Magistrate Elizabeth Muiru, leaving litigants stranded and members of the public in panic. Haji has also directed  ODPP's Internal Compliance Unit and Nairobi Regional Head to investigate the conduct of the prosecutor in question. The team has been given seven days to probe the conduct of the prosecutor and submit the report. Haji has maintained that he is the only person allowed by the Constitution to appoint another prosecutor, questioning the move of Makueni magistrate who appointed and allowed a police officer to prosecute the case. The Magistrate was prompted to seek assistance from a senior police officer in Kilungu who is trained in the prosecution of cases to help process cases after Wangia, the gazetted prosecutor failed to turn up to work on 23rd and 24th last month. On learning of the development, Wangia is said to have appeared on the last day of the month and caused commotion in the court accusing Muiru of interfering with his duties. According to the court officer, Wangia left the courtroom shouting that the magistrate had no powers to call the police for assistance during his absence. “He stormed out shouting while the court was in progress,” he said. A police officer handling cases in the station who spoke on condition of anonymity said cases have been piling up following the officer's disappearance.
