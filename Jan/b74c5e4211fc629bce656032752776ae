Tanzanian artist Aslay Isihaka Nassoro alias Aslay says his management and Bahati's disagreed after they had a collabo, 'Nasubiri nini'. The collabo did not go well after the two artists failed to promote the song. Earlier on, Bahati claimed Aslay become arrogant and that his management was not acting professionally, the result of it all, no one posted the song on their social media handles. “When two artistes work together, they should be humble to push the song but when one of us decides to act like a star it stops many things. It was a song I loved and wanted to take it to another level. But Aslay’s management was uncooperative in terms of revenue shares, how the song would be sold online etc," Bahati said. Aslay says he is OKay with Bahati although he has not seen him since the collabo."I do not want to talk about it since it's in the past," he said. Aslay is in Kenya to promote his new EP dubbed 'Kipenda Roho.' It has 9 tracks and my favorite is track number 9 called 'Usife Moyo."
