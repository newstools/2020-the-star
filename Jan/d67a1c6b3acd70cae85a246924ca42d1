Chaos erupted in a Nairobi court on Wednesday morning after a man swore that he would rather die than pay Sh30,000 cash bail. Daniel Njonjo Mwangi was facing a felony charge whereby he was found in possession of a knife along Kimathi Street. He denied the charges preferred against him and was released on bail, a move he strongly opposed. Mwangi resisted his return to the cells by an officer forcing the court to call in five more policemen to contain the situation. As the six officers tried forcing Mwangi out of the dock, he became uncontrollable and even head-butted one of the police officers injuring him. "Afadhali nikufe, sikufanya chochote na sina pesa...hata niko na dawa za Mathare na afadhali mniue (I would rather die, I did not do a thing and I do not have money...I even have medicine from Mathare so you would rather kill me)," Mwangi said. The police had to force him out of the dock to the cells. While Mwangi expressed himself, the court further heard that the alleged beggar in Nairobi town had a sick elderly mother and children who depended on him. "Niko na matanga na watoto wananitegemea (I have a funeral and my children depend on me)," Mwangi said. The accused person who was handcuffed was also granted a Sh50,000 bond by Milimani magistrate Nzibe Muthoni. The matter will be mentioned in court on January 22.
