Tens of traders at Kongowea market in Mombasa county have lost property worth millions of shillings following a fire incident on Saturday night. The fire which started at around 11 on Saturday night began in the area that hosts tailors and mitumba sellers. It was only put off at around 4am. Mzee Hassan, a trader at the market said he was unable to salvage any of his merchandise. Hassan said the fire could not be contained due to wind which made it spread it so fast. He said it went on for hours without being put off as the fire engines could not access the area. "The fire engines came early but they could not gain entry due to the structures and also the gate," he said. Hassan said the gate was too small to allow the engine to pass throw but later accessed the area. Mama Wambui, a mitumba seller lost merchandise worth thousands of shillings. She had just taken a loan to boost her women's clothing business but it has all gone to waste. "I don't know how I am going to repay my sacco. They will carry everything in my house and auction them," she said. Wambui said she was woken up by a call from a fellow seller who informed her of the fire. "I rushed here but I could not save anything. Everything is gone. My blood pressure has risen due to the distress," she added. The cause of the fire is still unknown even though the sellers say it was as a result of a power problem. Kimani Mwangi said the fire could have been caused by electricity lines fixed on some of the structures. Nyali police division boss Daniel Masaba said investigations into the cause of the fire have begun and they expect to release a report once done. Masaba said the police visited the area and were collecting samples and exhibits in order to compile the final report. "The area which burnt down is very big and for now we cannot tell how many traders were affected and how much was lost. We will wait until everyone has reported before we conclude on the loss of properties," he said.
