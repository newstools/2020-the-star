The sugar sector report should form part of the Bridging Bridges Initiative's recommendations, former Bumula MP Boniface Otsiula has said. "As a sugar-growing zone with our ailing Mumias and Nzoia sugar factories that over eight million people depend on, we should support the report so that it helps our farmers," the former legislator said in Bungoma town. Otsiula said sugarcane farmers have been suffering and asked local leaders to stop their sideshows and address the sector problems through BBI. "Fighting with police and airing each other's dirty linen in public won’t put a smile on the face of sugarcane farmers," he added. The former legislator said that BBI should not be politicised in any way but should be used to solve the community's problems. He said that the Luhya community has been facing tough economic times caused by the disunity of leaders. "As a region, we should fully support the BBI report that has good plans for our region's deteriorating economy and not bad politics of progressiveness." He said the minority sub-tribes of the Luhya community have been neglected politically for a while and the exclusivity factor will enable them have a say in the government structure since their interests will be well-taken care of in the report. "I urge western leaders to work as one team and unite by forging for the community’s interests through the BBI," he said.
