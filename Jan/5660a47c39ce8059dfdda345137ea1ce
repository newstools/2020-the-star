All stray dogs in Uasin Gishu county will be killed to prevent rabies. Uasin Gishu County Commissioner Abdirisack Jaldesa on Wednesday assured residents fearing a rabies outbreak that all stray animals will be put down immediately. He gave dog owners a one-week ultimatum to ensure their dogs are kept inside compounds and are always on leads when they are outside. Over the weekend, a 70-year-old woman was found mauled to death by stray dogs.  The face was beyond recognition. The hungry stray dogs are a problem in the outskirts of Eldoret, especially in Lokten Estate. Residents said stray dogs roam around the estate due to lack of food. They said their owners abandoned them several months ago. On Monday in Block 10 Estate in Eldoret town residents protested against the increased number of stray dogs. They said they would kill the dogs themselves if the county does not eliminate the canines. Commissioner Jaldesa told the press, “I am giving a one-week ultimatum to anyone owning a dog to ensure you don’t allow it to roam outside, since it will be killed — don't blame us. “We will collaborate with the county government to ensure  all stray dogs are killed, he said."We will not allow stray dogs to take away innocent lives." He said officials were awaiting receipt of drugs that will kill the dogs. No one will be mauled by dogs under his watch, he said. Jaldesa assured Block Ten residents that their lives will be protected and stray dogs will be killed. (Edited by V. Graham)
