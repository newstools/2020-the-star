Police in Naivasha on Monday morning recovered a gun from a suspect. Nakuru county police boss Stephen Matu said the Jericho pistol was loaded with two bullets. The gun was recovered from the suspect's house in Mai Mahiu. “This is a known criminal who had been arrested after breaking into a house and stealing household items in Mai Mahiu hours after midnight,” he told the Star. Matu said the man was initially arrested for robbery with violence but while in custody, a police informer reported that the suspect is usually armed with a pistol. “Our officers having had the information led the suspect to his house. The pistol was recovered inside the house in Mai Mahiu by cops,” Matu said. The suspect was locked up at Mai Mahiu police station. He will be arraigned on Tuesday. Matu said that the recovered rifle would be taken for ballistics tests to find out whether it had been used to commit other crimes – either in Nakuru county or any part of the country. He praised the public for volunteering information to the police. “I congratulate members of the public for giving information that led to the man’s arrest and gun’s recovery. One firearm in the hands of the wrong people can cause a lot of harm,” Matu said. He warned that the days of criminals in Nakuru were numbered. “We will follow them to their hideouts.”
