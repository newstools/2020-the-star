Singer Queen Darleen says she doesn't mind her husband marrying two more wives. However, she warns women against sending him nude photos. "When I started posting my husband on social media, people started DMing him. So my advice is, if you have to inbox him, please stop sending nude photos," she told the press. "I go through his DM and I reply them. They are so stubborn but if he wants he can marry even four wives." She tied the knot in December 2019 with her one-year loverÂ Isihaka Mtoro as the second wife.
