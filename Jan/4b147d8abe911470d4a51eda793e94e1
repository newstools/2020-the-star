Residents of Athi River are up in arms over delayed implementation of a National Assembly report that was meant to resolve the industrial pollution in the area. National Assembly's committee onÂ  environment and natural resources had ordered London Distillers to invest in modern technologies in six months to contain air pollution. The company had been accused of emitting polluting fumes as well as industrial effluence into the Athi River, risking the health of the residents. The Kareke Mbiuki-led committee instituted the inquiry and released their report in September 2018 but up to date, no action has been taken to have it implemented or deter the pollution in the area. The residents, who mainly consist of families living in the over 2,500 unit Great wall Gardens estates as well are the neighborhoods now suspect a cover-up to shield the companies accused of pollution. "We cannot continue to be silent as our health risks deterioration in the long-term due to the bad odour coming from the distillers," Mary Wanyoike said. Onyaini Mangi, a resident of Great wall gardens, said that the larger estate has had to put up with the foul smell from the waste and molasses tanks of London distillers which are put near the wall of their estate. Efforts to get a response by London Distillers on the allegations made against them were futile as their phones went unanswered. Prior to the report by the National Assembly committee report, NEMA had written to London Distillers Kenya Limited on February 6, 2017, ordering a closure of the company. This was after the company had failed to comply with improvement orders issued to them on May, July and September 2016. The residents now want Parliament to take action against players that have abdicated their responsibilities when it reconvenes next week. They have also appealed to Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua, under whose jurisdiction the company operates to step in and ensure the welfare of the residents.
