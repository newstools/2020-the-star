He added his seat was almost taken away because he did not stand when Raila arrived. The MP said that some people are using the BBI report to drum support for Raila before 2022 general elections, saying that he is not part of the team. "If supporting Raila is the ticket to heaven let me go to hell," Kuria said. He added that he is supporting the BBI report but he is not supporting ODM party leader Raila. "Yes to BBI, no to Raila," Kuria added. Kuria was among a section of leaders allied to Deputy President William Ruto who attended the BBI meeting in Mombasa. In Mombasa, Kuria was roughed up as orderlies tried to take his seat away but resisted all attempts as he 'defended his seat'.

The President urged all leaders to ask themselves why they have been called to the positions they have. "There are some who ask: How did so and so get to that position? It's only by God's grace. We can say all we want to, but it's God alone who decides. We are put in leadership to serve others," Uhuru said.
