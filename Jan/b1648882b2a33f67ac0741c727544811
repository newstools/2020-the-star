Africa junior cross country champion Nicholas Kimeli and world under 18 800m silver medalist  Lydia Jeruto clinched the titles at the 29th edition of Discovery Cross Country Championships held at Eldoret Sports Club yesterday. Kimeli, who was part of the 5,000m at the world championships in Doha, won the men’s 10km race in 29:46.7 after taking the lead with 2km to go. “This is part of my preparations for the Olympic Games although I will have to compete at the various Diamond Leagues,” said Kimeli. Jeruto upstaged some of the country's greatest marathoners led by Frankfurt marathon winner Valary Aiyabei, former world half marathon record holder Peres Jepchirchir, Sally Kipyego and Burundian international Francine Niyosaba to win the title. Jeruto, who has plans to change from her 800m to 5,000m said her focus is to make the team for Olympics. “The race was not easy looking at the top marathoners at the starting line-up but I was lucky to emerge top,” said Jeruto, who clocked 27:16.70. Africa cross country runner Agnes Jebet and Cornelius Kemboi were the junior winners in 6km and 8km races in women and men races respectively. Jebet running for Baringo County won the title defeating Winnie Kimutai and Mercy Jepkoech. “My focus is to compete at the Africa Cross Country before thinking of Olympics Games,” said Jebet.
