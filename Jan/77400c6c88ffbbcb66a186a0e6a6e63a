A criminal case in which two businessmen have been charged with trafficking young foreign girls will continue today at Milimani law courts. Shaikh Hussain and Abdul Khan, the proprietors of Balle Balle Bar and Club in Parklands, Nairobi county, are accused of trafficking by recruiting a Pakistan citizen and eight Nepalese nationals for exploitation by means of deception. They will appear before chief magistrate Francis Andayi. The businessmen are alleged to have committed the offence on diverse dates between February 19 and July 19, 2018, at the said bar. The two are also accused of trafficking persons by harbouring them for exploitation by abuse of their vulnerability. The prosecution further accuses the two of interfering with travel documents of the victims aged between 18 and 20. The two Kenyan businessmen are alleged to have confiscated the said documents in furtherance of trafficking of persons. According to the prosecution, the suspects are also accused of facilitating and aiding the nine to enter Kenya. The foreigners were reportedly smuggled in to be strippers at the said club. Police officers stormed the bar and their houses in Parklands and Westlands in Nairobi where they arrested the two suspects. During the arrest, the victims were rescued and were kept in a safe house in Nairobi pending their statement and interview recording after which they were deported following a court order. The club represented by lawyer Evans Ondieki told the court that the dancers had been issued with special permits by then Sports CS Rashid Echesa to perform at the club during the festive season.
