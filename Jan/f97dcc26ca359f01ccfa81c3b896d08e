Two former Members of the Kisii county assembly have asked the Deputy Governor Joash Maangi to resign on grounds he's not tough on graft in the county. George Bibao (Bokimonge) and Elkana Nyandoro (Boikang’a) said that Maangi cannot purport to say that he does not know about the levels of graft in the county. Speaking in Kisii town, Bibao and Nyandoro said that it will be prudent for the deputy governor to relinquish his position if he really wants to fight corruption. Nyandoro said that they presented documents to Maangi showing how public funds were being misused but he never took any action. “Maangi wants to be seen as somebody who is keen on the fight against graft but he is not,” Nyandoro said. They said that if Maangi is serious, then he should follow the example of former Nairobi Depty Governor Polycarp Igathe who resigned on grounds that he did not have the trust of his boss Mike Sonko. Maangi who is office for the second term, said that he would not sit and watch people embezzle public funds. “Everyone has a constitutional right to seek an elective seat but let us not dwell on allegations. One must prove the same and not just mere claims,” Bibao said.
