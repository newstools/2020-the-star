Bomet Deputy Governor Shadrack Rotich has admitted the county does not have a dumpsite. Rotich, however, stated that the county had designated collection sites to manage the waste collected from various towns across the county. “We want to state clearly that the county does not have a dumpsite at the moment but this does not mean we stopped collecting waste. We manage it from those sites,” he said. He noted that several attempts by the county to secure a proper dumping site in Sotik and Chepalungu have been met with harsh rejection by residents. The county, Rotich noted, has been managing its waste on land belonging to Bomet University College and county assembly in Bomet town, in Sotik and Mulot. During his time, former Governor Isaac Rutto had opposed the relocation of the dumping site from the land that was set aside for the construction of the university but lost to legislators who were rooting for the establishment of the institution. Speaking to the press, Rotich maintained that a solution to the menace will soon be arrived at, adding public participation will be done in those areas earmarked as dumping sites. “The county bought some land in Chepalungu which was to be used as a dumping site but the locals opposed it. That is why we have had to manage the waste from those two sites in town." A spot check at Silibwet, Mulot, Sotik and Bomet towns which are the worst affected showed spillover waste from dustbins placed at strategic points. The wastes have gone uncollected for more than a month hurting businesses in the towns with traders accusing the county of turning a blind eye. Reached for comment, public health chief officer Zaddy Chumo said her officers were closely monitoring situation and that there was no cause for alarm since it was under control. Edited by R.Wamochie
