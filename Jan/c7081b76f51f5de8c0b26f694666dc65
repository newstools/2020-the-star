As one travels through Migori and Kisii to Bomet, their attention would be caught by hardworking young men eking a living washing cars by the roadside. Inasmuch as I laud their ventures, I am equally disturbed at the manner at which they have been allowed to discharged effluent into the roads, some finding its way into local rivers. The raw chemicals they discharge on the roads have contributed to the speedy deterioration of the state of our roads. The earnings accrued from those businesses cannot equal the extensive damage on the roads and the environment. County governments could save the environment and our roads by regulating the business. They should ensure any person who sets up a car wash has the required papers a clear policy on waste management.  Migori
