Almost every year after the announcement of the KCPE results and the subsequent admission to Form One, touching tales of bright brains with no money to proceed with education to secondary level are in almost every news outlet. While some organisations and individuals have in the recent past been compassionate and have decided to sponsor these children, the situation has not really improved. This has been the case even after the announcement of KCPE results last year, and some students are still at home without any idea how they will join secondary schools. So, given this has been the trend for so many years, the government should by now have come up with a way of addressing this situation once and for all. Probably a budget should be set aside every financial year to cater for scholarship for the needy children. This is possible. No bright child should fail or struggle to join Form One for lack of school fees when our leaders are embezzling billions from public coffers. Joseph Macharia,Nairobi.
