The war on corruption will not end until greedy leaders accept to work for the people who voted for them and stop looting, a senator has warned. Kiambu's Kimani Wamatangi on Monday said those charged with corruption and barred from accessing their offices must carry their own cross. He spoke in Limuru town during a meet-the-people tour. The lawmaker called for support to the investigating agencies and the Judiciary to ensure justice is served. Kiambu Governor Ferdinand Waititu is one of those enjoined from accessing their offices or performing county functions. Others are Nairobi's Mike Sonko and Samburu's Moses Lenolkulal. Wamatangi, who is a member of the County Public Accounts and Investment Committee at the Senate, dismissed claims by some governors that they are being investigated because of their political stand. "The war on corruption will not stop. In fact, it is gaining momentum. We want our leaders to accept working for the electorate," he said. "Our governors are quick to allege that it a political war lodged against them. It is not. This war against graft." The senator applauded MCAs for playing their oversight role properly without fear and questioning how funds are spent. This is one of the ways in which county assemblies can help President Uhuru Kenyatta in the war against corruption.
