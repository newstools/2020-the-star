DT Dobie recorded a 21 percent increase in sales of Mercedes-Benz Actros trucks to 148 in 2019 from 121 in the previous year. This is against a background of an overall eight per cent reduction in new vehicle sales for the car dealer. “The recent launch of the latest Mercedes-Benz truck has generated great interest among transporters,” said Alexander Helfritz the DT Dobie Sales and Marketing Director. In September 2019, Kenya approved a proposed ban on the importation of used trucks with load capacities of 3.5 tonnes and above into the country. The move boosted sales for the Mercedes distributor to lead the prime mover segment. “A truck only earns money when it is up an running and buyers are impressed that the new Mercedes-Benz Actros has been subjected to more than 60 million test kilometres,” Alexander said. Buyers now have a choice of a 12.8 litre and 15.8 litre engines with more advanced automated gear shift. The new clutches incorporate overload protection and the drive axles boost low friction and smooth running.
