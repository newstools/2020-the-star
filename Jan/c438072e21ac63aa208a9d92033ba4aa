Two ODM legislators have praised the extension of the Building Bridges Initiative task force term, saying it will help the party lay down a strategy on how their leader Raila Odinga will ascend to power. Uriri MP Mark Nyamita and his Rongo counterpart Paul Abuor said through a president or a powerful prime minister, the ODM party will ensure that Raila “will be at the centre of where the national cake will be cut in 2022.” “The initial BBI report was only a precursor of what was to come, the extension was a means of a lull before a political tsunami,” Nyamita said. He said the initial report was to end rumours that devolution was to be curtailed by reducing funds to counties while scrapping off some posts. Abuor said leaders allied to Deputy President William Ruto and the Tangatanga outfit who embraced the initial report should also adopt the new one if it comes with more changes. “The extension will now collect views from regions across the country and ODM is keen on pushing through a powerful prime minister,” Abuor said. Abuor said the upcoming party primaries will be used to strengthen the party and ensure they are strong enough to be in power in 2022. “We don’t care about the posts the BBI will create. Our main agenda is to be in power in the next general elections,” Abuor said. The two leaders spoke on Tuesday in Rongo constituency during the end of annual football tournament organised by the constituency NG-CDF kitty.
