Sauti Sol has been signed by Universal Music Africa on Wednesday announced the signing of an exclusive recording agreement with Sauti Sol. UMA is a division of Universal Music Group. The agreement will give the boy band access to UMG’s global network, while satisfying and exciting their dedicated fanbase with bold, creative campaigns around Africa. In a celebratory post on Instagram, Sauti Sol shared their joy at signing up with a world leader in the music industry. "It's official! Our first major label deal. Thank you guys for being patient. We hope y'all are ready for the new album," they said. This makes them the first Kenyan artistes to be taken up by the universal music giants. The international recording company has its African offices in South Africa as well as Nigeria. This comes a month before Sauti Sol releases a new album after a one-year break. "We also took time and recorded our album in South Africa, and now we are good to go. It is going to be a big thing for Sol Generation," Bien said. The album has 20 songs, mostly Rhumba music, with local and international artistes. Last year, the band opened their record label, Sol Generation Records, with the sole mission of developing and introducing new iconic live African acts. In a past inteview, Bien said, "Our motivation to start Sol Generation was born out of the need to build a legacy bigger than Sauti Sol’s. We want to provide a platform and a proper foundation for younger artistes to prosper and experience our level of success in a shorter period.”
