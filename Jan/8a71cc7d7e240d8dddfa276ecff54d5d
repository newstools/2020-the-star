Police in Juja subcounty, Kiambu county, have gunned down three thugs believed to be behind a spate of robberies and house break-ins in the area. The cops who were patrolling Nyacaba on Wednesday morning accosted the three criminals who were riding a Toyota pick-up KAE 806M that was loaded with items believed to have been stolen. Among the items include four crates of beer, three barrels of keg, a television set, bunches of keys and assorted alcoholic beverages. Police also recovered crude weapons including two crowbars, pliers, sharpened metal bars, a homemade gun and two rounds of 9mm ammunition. Juja subcounty police commander Dorothy Migarusha told the press that the trio sped off when they were flagged down by the police prompting the cops to chase them in the 5am incident. “When the police caught up with them, they stopped and one of them drew the homemade gun. This made the officers fire back at the three male adults,” she said. The police boss said that bodies were taken to General Kago mortuary in Thika awaiting postmortem and identification. “We haven’t identified the three men though we retrieved identification cards from them. We will take their fingerprints and submit them to the Registrar of Persons for proper ID,” she said. The pick-up was towed to Juja police station, she said, and that police are conducting investigations to ascertain the owner. Migarusha called on members of the public who have lost such items after their premises were broken into to go and identify them at the station. “We are also pleading with the public to assist us with crucial information that will lead to the arrest of criminal elements in the subcounty. Police are working round the clock to ensure that all criminals are smoked out of their hiding dens and to ensure that the members of the public and their properties are protected,” the police boss said.
