At least 15,747 people were involved in road accidents last year, with 3,586 dying while the rest were left mostly with life-changing injuries, the National Transport and Safety Authority says. The number of accident victims increased by 2,870, compared to the 12,877 victims in 2018. In 2018, 3,158 people were killed. In 2017 the total number of deaths countrywide was 2,919 while in 2016 those who died were 2,965. In 2019, the seriously injured were 6,952 while the slightly injured stood at 5,209. Pedestrians remain the most vulnerable road users with 1,390 of them having died in 2019 compared to 1,205 in 2018. Bodaboda operators had 1073 deaths, compared to 838 in 2018. The number of passengers who died in 2019 was 704, which was a decrease from 746 in 2018. Drivers who died in 2019 are 345 compared to 306 in 2018, while pedal cyclists are 74 compared to 63 in 2018. In 2017, the summary of road fatalities in road crashes is as follows: pedestrians 999 , drivers 290, passengers 650, pillion passengers 210, pedal cyclists 55 and motorcyclists 46. In 2016 the summary was as follows: pedestrians 1,029, drivers 329, passengers 673, pillion passengers 206, pedal cyclists 71 and motorcyclists at 471. Through out in 2019, NTSA records revealed, Nairobi County was leading with the highest number of fatalities. Privately-owned vehicles were the most involved in road crashes followed by commercial vehicles and motorcycles. Earlier in the year, the authority highlighted 273 black spots across the country with 199 of them being in the Northern Corridor and 74 in Nairobi. In October 2019, NTSA said human error was the biggest contributor to road accidents. Former Director general Francis Meja said drivers can either save or end lives depending on their decisions. "The number of people we are losing on our roads is unacceptable. Our biggest challenge still remains the drivers, whom we are now going to zero in on. We will now be focusing on the drivers and their behaviour," he said. Due to the increase the number of crashes, the National Police Service reached out and urged all road users to be extra careful, observe the highway code and avoid exceeding speed limits, more so at night. NTSA also expressed concerns over the increasing number of accidents caused by boda boda operators. On November 22, 2018 , Interior CS Fred Matiang'i and his Transport counterpart James Macharia gazetted a task force to introduce reforms in the boda-boda sector. However, little has been heard from the taskforce.
