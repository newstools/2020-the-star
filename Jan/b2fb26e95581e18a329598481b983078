Super League side Bidco United are bracing themselves for a tough second leg in their quest for promotion. Bidco are second with 36 points, seven adrift of leaders and former Premier League side Nairobi City Stars. As the team returns to action on January 11 against Mt. Kenya United at the Camp Toyoyo grounds, coach Anthony Viera wants his charges to pick from where they left after winning twice and drawn as many games in their last four first-leg matches. He warned the team against complacency saying that second place is not good enough. He also hinted at signing new players in the January transfer window to help the team realise their promotion ambitions. "We will try to have better performances in the second leg. In order to stay competitive, two or three quality attacking players will not only bring competition to the department but enable us to have different options going forward. We haven't released any player because everybody was exceptional and we can't afford to lose any," remarked the youthful tactician. "Mt. Kenya is a good side with experienced players but we are a strong side as well. We only need to work harder and smarter to get something positive from the match." "Every season, we start the league yearning for promotion. I can't say its time. All I can say is we try to win our matches and see what happens in May. In football, we are never comfortable. If you become comfortable you will find yourself in the relegation zone." Vihiga United and Nairobi Stima are a point behind Bidco and Viera urged the Thika-based club to minimise their mistakes after suffering four defeats in the first leg, more than any other team in the top four. "We have to remain grounded all through and give our best for maximum points," he remarked.
