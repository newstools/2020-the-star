Africa Concours d’Elegance will celebrate its Golden Jubilee on September 27, according to Kenya Motor Sports Federation (KMSF) calendar for 2020 calendar. Rated as the classiest event of the motor sport year, the Concours will be the 50th in the annual series held by the Alfa Romeo Owners Club. Following established tradition the event will be held at the usual grounds at Nairobi Racecourse. The regulations have been approved for both cars and motorcycles and only minor changes have been made since last year’s event. Cars made in 1995, or earlier are eligible to compete and motorcycles must be five years old, or more. The prospect of competing in the landmark Golden Jubilee Concours has already generated queries from car and motorcycle enthusiasts within Kenya and beyond. Roger Pearce, the former head of Motor Sport South Africa (MSA) hopes to gather a convoy of classic car enthusiasts to drive to Nairobi for the event. Several years ago he was responsible for a group of 15 Concours fans, who drove from Johannesburg to Nairobi under the ‘The African Odessy’ brand.
