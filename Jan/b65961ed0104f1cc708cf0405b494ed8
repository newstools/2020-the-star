Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang'ula has fallen short of accepting that President Uhuru Kenyatta made a call to him and requested him to attend the BBI meeting which took place at Bukhungu Stadium. "The end justifies the means... I did not receive a call from the President and even if I did, that cannot form part of public discourse," he said. Wetang'ula spoke on Tuesday during an interview with Citizen TV's Newsnight. Wetang'ula and ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi had vowed not to attend the rally, saying that they were not consulted. But on day of the forum on January 18, the two were spotted going to the stadium where other leaders were seated. Mudavadi and Wetang'ula had said the BBI rallies were being used by some people to position themselves for 2022, instead of uniting the country. They were scheduled to hold a parallel meeting, but the police cancelled their permits. However, Wetang'ula said, "I attended the (BBI rally in) Bukhungu because it is my region and I believe in BBI. I believe there must be change in the country. I was one of the speakers during the launch of the report at Bomas, which means I accepted BBI," he said. He said that he had the responsibility to listen to the requests of his supports, who advised them to attend the rally. "Our supporters told us that this is our home turf and since we had talked about BBI, it was only right that we go and explain more about it," Wetang'ula said.
