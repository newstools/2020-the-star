The group of politicians into those are for BBI and those against it is a great threat to the unity of the nation. Going by history, most Kenyans tend to lean on the side of the politicians they support regardless of whether they are right, an implication that with the division of politicians by BBI, chances are that Kenyans are as well divided. By now, some communities have already been categorised into opposes or proposers of the BBI. BBI has already bred hatred among politicians a scenario that may mount tension in the country as communities spit fire at each other because of the stance taken by their leaders. With this in place, the question that arises is if we will have peaceful coexistence among ourselves especially with the elections just three years away.   Nairobi
