Narok liquor operators have been told that their businesses should be at least 300 metres from learning institutions. County director Liquor and Alcoholic drinks Esther Naisiaye yesterday said the rate at which the school-going youths was alarming and called on parents to resist the temptation of consuming alcohol near learning institutions. Naisiaye warned against illegal licensing of bars. She said licensing can only be done by sub-county officers after applicants are vetted by administrators. “We are issuing stern measures against any business owner found selling counterfeit alcohol. Traditional drinks shall be considered for sale after authorisation,” she said. The director told traders to sell standardised drinks only noting that some traders were stocking contraband alcohol sneaked in from Tanzania. The county office of liquor and alcoholic drinks is now fully in charge after the devolvement of alcohol licensing from the national government.
