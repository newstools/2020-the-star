A Nairobi resident wants the county assembly barred from vetting Deputy Governor nominee Anne Mwenda. In an application presented in court, Peter Agoro says Mwenda's nomination amounts to a direct affront to the orders issued against Governor Mike Sonko. Also sought in the case is an order stopping Sonko from nominating any other person for the position of the deputy governor until the conclusion of the criminal case against him. Sonko, in a letter dated January 6, nominated Mwenda. This came after he was enjoined from accessing his City Hall office and performing official county functions. The letter has been forwarded to the office of the county assembly speaker for onward transmission to the assembly for purposes of vetting Mwenda. In December, Sonko was charged with money laundering and unlawful acquisition of Sh357 million public property. He denied wrongdoing. Anti-Corruption Court magistrate Douglas Ogoti allowed him access to county offices only in the company of an investigating officer or any other authorised person. The court, while laying out his bail terms, also barred Sonko from approaching any witnesses. Agoro says the nomination poses a likelihood of interfering with prosecution witnesses as Mwenda would act under the direct control of the county chief. “Sonko, after being charged, was ordered not to go to his office or interfere with witnesses which order was given to ensure the integrity of the prosecution process is insulated from any interference,” he says. Agoro says the timing of the nomination is an act of self-preservation by Sonko and goes against the public interest in the fight against corruption. It seeks to defeat the cause of justice in the governor's corruption case, he adds.
