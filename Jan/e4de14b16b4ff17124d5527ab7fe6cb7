Olympics T11 bronze medallist Wilson Bii clocked 16:23.32 to make the cut for the Team Kenya to the World Para-athletics set for February 25 to March 2 in Marrakech, Morocco. The event will also serve as Tokyo 2020 Paralympics qualifier. Bii beat Rodgers Kiprop, who placed second in 16:42.98. Eric Sang too, hit the qualifying mark by clocking 16:44.70 in the T11 (for the totally blind) event. However, in the T11 1,500m, Bii finished second to reigning world champion Samuel Mushai but still attained the qualifying standard. Mushai cut the tape in 4:30.6 while Bii was timed at 4:31.0 with Eric Sang third in 4:36.4 to also book a place in the team. Others who met the qualifying mark are Rodgers Kiprop (4:46.9), Philemon Kirong (4:52.8) and Proteus Mutuma (5:13.5). In an interview, Bii said: “The races were good and competition was stiff despite most of us being familiar with each other. It was not matter of winning but meeting the set qualifying times. It was quite tough given that we all knew the qualifying times to beat.” Henry Nzungi ruled the T12 100m, leading five other athletes to hit the qualifying time. The Nairobi-based partially blind athlete clocked 11.2 seconds to win the race. Daniel Kiprop came second after timing 11.7 seconds as Alex Kivuti crossed the line in 12.2 for the third place. Vitalis Kibiwott (12.5) and John Hassan (12.8) closed the top five positions. Rio 2016 T11 1,500m silver medallist Nancy Chelangat clocked 5:06.5 to lead Mary Waithera (5:11.5), Hannah Ng’endo (5:21.7) and Nelly Nasimiyu (5:27.4) in the T11 and T12 1,500m race. Stella Chepkosgei clocked 4:51.7 to qualify for the T20 World Paralympics Games. The men’s T20 1,500m race was a close contest between Dickson Mwongela and Kevin Wafula but the latter took the pole position with split seconds advantage. Mwongela timed 4:11.4 while Wafula trailed him in 4:11.7. Kelvin Tanui was third in 4:15.5 while Alex Komen closed the chapter of qualifiers in 4:51.3. In shot put, Augustine Kilonzo is the sole qualifier for the Marakesh outing after covering 7.50m in his only attempt. Others, who met the minimum qualifying times are T46 1,500m runners Wesley Sang (4:93.5) and Felix Kipruto (4:05.1) and T46 200m duo of Irene Tanui (28.8) and Ng’endo (29.1).
