Wajir MCAs have written to the DPP, Anti-corruption agency and DCI to investigate the state of pending bills in the county following what they describe as false presentation of facts to the Controller of Budget (CoB). In a letter to the DPP, the MCAs said an ad hoc committee had been formed to investigate authenticity of pending bills and they were shocked to find out a report had been forwarded to the Controller of Budget (CoB) claiming bills had been cleared. "As the committee concludes the exercise in the coming days, members have shockingly received the report by the national Treasury that Wajir is one of the few counties that have either cleared or provided clear payment plan on the pending bills," the letter said. The MCAs said executives presented pending bills worth Sh3.06 billion, only to declare Sh344 million as pending to the CoB. The ad hoc committee alleged county Treasury officials have colluded to present false statements on the amount in pending bills. The MCAs want the EACC, DPP and DCI to conduct an audit on pending bills for the financial years 2017-18 and 2018-19. They said EACC officers have raided the county offices on several occasions, but no action has been taken. The ward reps on Wednesday said they will launch a motion for the impeachment of the Finance CEC and the chief officer. They also demanded that Governor Mohamed Abdi take responsibility for the mismanagement of public funds. The MCAs said Abdi appeared to be clueless about the running of the county, and demanded that the Executive stop new projects until all pending bills are paid.
