A man was on Thursday evening stabbed to death by a butcher after they disagreed over Sh200 change in Sirata, Samburu Central sub-county. The duo quarreled after the customer bought Sh300 meat but the butcher, 55, delayed giving him change. He had given the butcher Sh500.  The butcher stabbed the man in the chest. Samburu central sub-county police commander Alex Rotich said on Friday the suspect has been arrested and is being detained at Maralal police station. He will be arraigned on Monday. “Our investigations have revealed that a 55-year-old man stabbed the young man in the chest, killing him over Sh200 change that had not been returned to him,” he said. He cautioned residents against taking the law into their own hands whenever there is a dispute, but instead, they should report it to the police. “People should not taint the image of the Samburu culture where men walk with knives. People walked with knives in the past but never killed each other. If there is a problem, it should be reported to the police, and we will act immediately,” he said. A relative of the deceased, said, “It is painful to see a young man lose his life. We want justice.”
