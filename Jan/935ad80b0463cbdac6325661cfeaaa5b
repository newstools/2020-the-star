Nakuru Governor Lee Kinyanjui has raised concerns on the public unavailability of the BBI document two months after its official release. He said this bordered on 'political deceit' and contradicts President Uhuru Kenyatta's advise for Kenyans to read and make wise decisions on their collective future. "We call for the speedy release and distribution of copies of the BBI report. This will encourage an informed debate devoid of hearsay and unnecessary propaganda," the governor said in a statement. He insisted that the BBI must serve to heal the nation and create a debate bigger than the current political actors. "It is not about individuals but our collective future as Kenyans," Kinyanjui said. The governor said if well implemented, the BBI will allow the country to address the recurrent problems of political marginalisation, corruption and tribalism. Hours after the governor issued the statement, Deputy President William Ruto has poked holes at the BBI claiming it has been hijacked to serve political interests. Ruto said that the BBI and handshake are being used to craft ODM's 2022 political line-up. "Unity, inclusivity pretence and associated squander of public resources should stop. Unity? the opposition (NASA) is already dismembered/dead; now dividing Jubilee. Big 4 roll out the only way to go," Ruto tweeted on Sunday morning. The DP's strong sentiments come just days after heÂ told President Uhuru Kenyatta that the BBI public rallies are a waste of public cash and time. Ruto - while on a tour of Vihiga and Bungoma counties - claimed no one was against the report Uhuru and opposition chief Raila Odinga unveiled in September at the Bomas of Kenya.
