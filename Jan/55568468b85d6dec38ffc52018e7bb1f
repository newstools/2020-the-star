Embattled UoN Vice Chancellor Stephen Kiama will operate from the old Vice Chancellor’s Office in Gandhi Wing. This is after the current acting VC Isaac Mbeche refused to hand him keys to the ultra-modern University’s main office baptised "the University of Nairobi towers." “As an interim measure, and to respect and safeguard university property from wanton destruction, the Vice-Chancellor will operate from the old Vice Chancellor’s Office in Gandhi Wing as a solution that upholds the image of the University as an upstanding and law-abiding citizen of this republic is pursued,” Kiama said in a memo on Wednesday. “As some of you may be aware, the administration has severally requested Prof. Mbeche to provide the keys to the Vice Chancellor’s Office but he is yet to do so.” Kiama reminded the staff to observe the University regulations as well as Kenya's constitutional laws as they pursue their inalienable rights to assembly. “I take this opportunity to reaffirm my earlier communicated commitment to be available to you all for guidance and direction,” he said.
