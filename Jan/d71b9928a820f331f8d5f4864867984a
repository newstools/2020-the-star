 @magatinews  A court in Ogembo, Kisii, has dismissed the defilement case against Moticho MCA Evans Mokoro. Senior principal magistrate Denis Mikoyan on Friday cited failure by the complainant and witnesses to turn up to testify as the reason for terminating the case. He further cited the unwillingness of the complainant to file her defence every time the case came up for mentioning at the Ogembo law courts. The magistrate further said there was an apparent lack of tangible circumstantial evidence from the prosecution to aid the court. “In all practical purposes, there were glaring inconsistencies in the evidence adduced by the prosecution and the lack of willingness by the complainant complicated the matter the more,” Mikoyan said The magistrate said even after several adjournments to allow the complainant to testify, she failed to turn up with her witnesses. There were celebrations outside the court by the MCA following the ruling. Mokoro blamed his political detractors saying they were pushing the "fake defilement claims”  to achieve their selfish political ends. “It was hot air, there was been nothing like defilement here, someone was out to malign me so as to achieve cheap political gains but I have triumphed,” Mokoro told journalists outside Ogembo court last Friday. The case has been dragging on  April 2019  with the MCAbeing accused of defiling a Form 3 student between June 2016 and June 2017 in Nyamarambe, Gucha South subcounty. The alleged offence was reported at Nyamarambe police station leading to Mokoro’s arrest. (Edited by V. Graham)
