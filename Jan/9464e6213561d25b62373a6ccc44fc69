 The expansion of a section of the busy Busia-Kisumu highway starts this week, Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong has said. The British government is funding the Sh300 million rehabilitation of the section between the One-Stop Border Post in Busia town and Korinda in Matayos, Ojaamong said on Friday. “The British government has availed Sh300 million for expanding the Busia-Kisumu highway from the One-Stop Border Post to Korinda," the governor told Mulembe FM. The potholed condition of the regional road has ignited many complaints. It is also too narrow. "The contractor will be on sight within a week to start the rehabilitation,” Ojaamong said. The road will be a dual carriageway for an easier flow of traffic to Uganda. “This is a regional road from Busia to Kisumu and it is not the responsibility of the county to maintain,” the governor said in response to complaints that his administration had failed to maintain it. Four years ago, British High Commissioner to Kenya Christian Turner assured the county administration of his government's preparedness to rehabilitate infrastructure in the county.
