Naivasha Water, Sewerage and Sanitation Company has moved in to fix the acute water shortage currently facing hundreds of Naivasha residents. The company has entered into an out-of-court agreement with a contractor that had damaged water pipes leading to the shortage in Site, Kabati and county council estates. Company CEO Nahashon Wahome said the contractor had made the first payment for the damage. Repair works have started and are expected to be completed within the next one week so supply is restored. With the road works still underway, any destruction caused by the contractor will be repaired immediately. “We shall be reporting back to the court on the progress made and we are working round the clock to make sure the affected customers have water,” Wahome said. Residents welcomed the move, saying they had suffered for weeks, digging deep into their pockets to buy from vendors. Agnes Njambi said she has been using at least Sh200 on water daily. “We are waiting patiently to see if the water company keeps its promise. We are keenly watching our bills,” she said. Meanwhile, motorists using the Moi South Lake Road in Naivasha continued to suffer as its condition deteriorated. Matatu operators have increased fares to minimise losses incurred from repairs. The situation has been worsened by the ongoing rains, which have washed sections of the road. Matatu operator Stephen Njau said their patience had run out as they waited for a contractor to start working on the road. “We have been forced to increase our fares by 30 per cent as the road has become impassable and promises to repair it have not been fulfilled,” he said.
