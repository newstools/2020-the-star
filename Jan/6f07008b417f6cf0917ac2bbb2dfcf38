Embu traders have threatened to stop paying levies in protest against the poor state of five toilets. They say men, women and children have to cue to use one that is also not in good condition. Five of the six Marikiti market toilets got blocked in April last year and their pleas to have them repaired have borne no fruit. They said they waste a lot of time waiting to relieve themselves. Trade and Industry executive Jamleck Muturi admitted that there has been a problem but denied that it had existed since last April. The traders are exposed to health risks. They expressed fear that waterborne and airborne diseases could break out. They said some patients were treated recently for cholera at the Embu Level 5 Hospital. The situation may get out of hand if nothing is done, they said. "We've decided that since the county government has failed in its mandate to repair the toilets despite the fact that we pay trading fees, we shall withhold the money until the toilets are repaired,” a trader said. The only language the county government will understand is refusing to pay taxes, they said. The traders said they have in the past demonstrated over the toilets but nothing was done. Executive Muturi said workers had been sent to repair the toilets. “I'm having a meeting with my directors to try and get to the bottom of the issue. I'm meeting with the director responsible for the services to get facts about the issue,” he said on the phone. Muturi added that the work is under the scope of Embu Water and Sanitation Company and the county government. He said they will do their best to ensure the traders work under the healthiest environment.
