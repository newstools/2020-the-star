Universities Academic Staff Union has supported the move by Education CS George Magoha to suspend the appointment of prof Stephen Kiama as the University of Nairobi Vice-Chancellor. UASU UoN chapter secretary George Omondi says this will allow for adequate consultation at all levels as prescribed in the legal process of appointment of the VC to be completed. "UASU reiterates its support for transparent process devoid of shortcuts, grandstanding and pursuit of individuals as opposed to the larger interests of the institution," Omondi said. Magoha last Saturday revoked Kiama's appointment as the new VC saying a processÂ will be done after the completion consultative meetings. The CS, however, noted that Kiama will continue dispensing his duties as the Deputy Vice-Chancellor, Human Resource and Administration at the university. The announcement came even after Kiama had invited the public to his installation as the University's VC on January 21, 2020. Instead, the CS appointed Deputy VC Isaac Mbeche to act as the new VC pending consultation. Kiama was to take over from Mbeche who had been acting after Peter Mbithi was sent on terminal leave in June last year. Magoha also dissolved the Julia Ojiambo-led UoN Senate Council with immediate effect.
