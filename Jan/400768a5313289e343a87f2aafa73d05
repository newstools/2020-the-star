Athletics Kenya Central Rift have appealed to the government to complete the renovation works at Kipchoge Keino Stadium in Eldoret. The iconic stadium is scheduled to host the First AK Track and Field Build up Competition/Anti-Doping Awareness next month as well as the national trials to the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games between May 19 and 21. However, stakeholders from the athletics-mad region are worried that the stadium is still far from ready to host such high-calibre events. Led by Athletics Kenya Central Rift Abraham Mutai, stakeholders from  Nandi, Uasin Gishu and Baringo counties alleged that nothing is going on at the stadium, which has left them worried. “We are asking the government to make sure that the stadium is ready before the trials,” said Mutai. "The trials to the 2016 Rio Olympics were held here and the crowds were huge, creating history in the country. We expect to have more than that this year but the stadium, at its current status, cannot hold." “The biggest problem we have had in other venues is attracting significant spectators but up here, the problem is managing the crowd entering the stadium. Eldoret as a venue attracts a lot of sponsors, who cannot come if we don't have a good stadium and spectators. They want people to see their products,” added Mutai. “We are supposed to open the season and we want athletes to use a standard track. If we take them elsewhere, we risk discouraging them since it is not easy to clock respectable times in substandard tracks,” said Mutai.
