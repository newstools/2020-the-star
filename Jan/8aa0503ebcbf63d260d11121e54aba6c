The National Government Administrative Officers will be be held personally liable for the absence of the children from school by March. This comes as the Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i announced on Friday that the NGAOs have until February 15, 2020, to complete the 100 per cent transition from primary to secondary school education this year. “We already have the compulsory free basic education policy in place. All the learners who have not reported to Form One must be found and taken to school without fail,” he said Speaking while attending a security meeting at Mbale in Vihiga County on Friday, Matiang’i has announced that the government, through the Ministry of Education, will thereafter conduct the final countrywide survey and headcount of last year’s KCPE candidates. He further directed chiefs and assistant chiefs to be ready to account for the learners within their respective areas of jurisdiction. Vihiga County was mentioned to be among the counties with impressive transition rates, now at 96 per cent. The CS said the government is holding out for the entire learners’ population in this regard. “The Governor [Vihiga] has a Scholarship Fund; legislators issue bursaries from the National Government Constituency Development Fund NG-CDF; the government has fully subsidised day secondary school education. This time around, there will be no more excuses regarding school fees,” he said. Last year in December, The World Vision has blamed congestion and poor educational standards in schools on the huge number of admissions to the institution. According to the organization, schools now have to share Sh1.2 billion to develop facilities compared to Sh1.5 billion they got in the last financial year. The reduction follows cuts made by Parliament on allocation for infrastructure. As of December 2019 , The transition rate to secondary schools currently stands 93 per cent.
