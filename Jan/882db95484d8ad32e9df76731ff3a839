When the 2010 Constitution was promulgated, the pomp and pageantry that greeted the unveiling was unparalleled in the past decade or two. It was like a second Independence celebration. But unknown to the crowd that thronged Uhuru Park, the leaderships that the Constitution was going to herald would look elsewhere on how to govern, selectively implementing the law, starting parallel processes to the well spelt out provisions of the grand law, while attempting to mutilate the law to suit whimsical, sectarian and selfish agenda. The Hallmark of the 2010 Constitution was the creation of devolution. Yet, it has never worked for the common person whom it was meant to serve. Apart from the county leaderships wanting in many respects, the national government has constantly undermined devolution by treating the devolved units as its subservients, starving them of cash at will while trying to micromanage their activities. Corruption in the counties is used as a tool for blackmail and only governors perceived as not toying certain political line or persuasion are pursued. Some known to have stolen huge sums of money are walking like peacocks knowing that their godfathers are interceding for them thus no cause for alarm. Individual rights and freedoms are upheld or trampled depending on which side of the political divide one belongs. Known political brokers whose only credential is their closeness to State House are lecturing people on who should lead Kenya and who should not. But here we are being told every day to expect the miracles of ‘inclusivity, peace and tranquillity’ in a chaliced environment where political scheming takes the prominent space; we should not let ourselves be fooled.
