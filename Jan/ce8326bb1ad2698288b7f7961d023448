Pioneer International University, led by VC David Maina, officially opened the Holocaust exhibition at the university on Thursday. This special day marks 75 Years since the liberation of the infamous Nazi death camp of Auschwitz Birkenau by the Red Army troops (January 27, 1945). Auschwitz was the largest of the German Nazi concentration camps and extermination centres. Over 1.2 million men, women and children lost their lives. Speaking during the ceremony, Deputy Ambassador States of Israel Eyal David said, "Our duty is to tell the story of the six million Jews who were killed in Europe and beyond â€” only because of the fact that they were Jews, and of the survivors who are still with us (every year we have less and less)."
