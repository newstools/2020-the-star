A man whose body was brought by police to Kakamega Referral Hospital last month died of severe head injuries from a blunt instrument, according to a medical report. This contradicts the police report that Raymond Mulanda died of injuries incurred when he jumped from a police vehicle on December 17. Police had booked Mulanda, 40,Â  as an identified person who died after he jumped from a moving police vehicle after his arrest. Dr Dickson Mchana said in his autopsy report that the head injuries were secondary to blunt force trauma following a fall from height. In his opinion, the injuries were not consistent with the motion. Kakamega County Criminal Investigation Officer Peter Kimulwa yesterday said the case file had been forwarded to the DPP Noordin Haji for a legal opinion. "We have recorded statements from all the officers who were mentioned and independent witnesses who were in the vicinity. We'll wait for the way forward from the DPP and act accordingly," he said. Mulanda is said to have had gone to a local club to collect a mobile phone he had left there charging. Police officers at the club allegedly ordered him out, accusing him of being drunk and causing a disturbance. A confrontation ensued and an officer called for reinforcement. The deceased was taken away in a police vehicle. The officers are said to have dropped the deceased from the vehicle but passers-by raised the alarm, forcing the officers to pick the unconscious man and drive off. Mulanda's cousin Martin Ochieng' said the family expects justice. "The events that followed the death of my cousin suggests there was foul play. If the officers booked an unconscious person in hospital by 9 pm on December 16, why is the matter booked in the OB more than 24 hours later?" Ochieng' asked.
