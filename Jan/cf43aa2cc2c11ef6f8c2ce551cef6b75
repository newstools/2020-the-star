On-loan Mathare United defender Salim Swaleh Chacha reveling at the opportunity to represent his new club after joining the Slum Boys from Kenyan Premier League rivals Bandari. Swaleh revealed he is already feeling at home among Salim Ali’s charges after becoming their first deal of the ongoing January transfer window. The right-back agreed to a year-long loan deal from the dockers and revealed that playing for Mathare was a chance that he could not let slip. “Mathare is a historic club in Kenya. Some of the best players in the country, past and present, have passed through here. So when the opportunity to come here arose, I could not say no,” the defender said on Mathare’s portal. “I already feel at home here, partly because of the friendly nature of everyone and partly because there are several players in the team from the Coast region. It has made it really easy to settle down." Swaleh will fight for the right-back role with Marvin Ongori, who has been the regular pick on the right side of defence for the 2008 KPL champions. The new signing acknowledged that he is relishing the opportunity to convince the coaching staff that he is ready to hit the ground running should an opportunity arise. “I spoke with coach Salim before I signed and he told me that I was not coming here to go straight to the first team. I know I have to fight for my place and that is what I am willing and going to do. I know I can help this team. If I couldn't then I wouldn’t be here,” he said. Swaleh could make his debut in United’s next league game against Zoo FC on January 29 in Kericho. Mathare are currently 10th in the KPL standings with 24 points from 16 matches.
