Chicago Marathon champion Lawrence Cherono is looking forward to make his maiden international appearance in Kenyan colours after making the marathon team to the 2020 Tokyo Olympics set for July 24- August 9. The 31-year-old, who won the Boston and Chicago marathons last year expressed gratitude to be selected by Athletics Kenya and revealed that it does not radically affect his plans for the year. Instead, he is looking forward to defending his title in Boston on April 20 and then focus on his Olympics preparations. He, however, admitted that repeating that feat will not be an easy task. “Everyone is chasing the title there (Boston) and will be looking at me, therefore it will not be an easy race,” he said. When asked about the mentality he uses to approach a race, Cherono said: “No secrets. When it comes to races, everything boils down to training." “You have to be disciplined when it comes to training and be flexible to what the coach asks you to do,” he said. The marathoner, who clocked 2:05:45 at the Chicago Marathon grew up in Kaptagat watching his brother, Benson Cherono running and was inspired by his work ethic. His brother, would eventually turn out to become his biggest supporter as Cherono grows to become a household name in the marathon speciality. 5,000m Olympic champion Vivian Cheruiyot is also gunning to make her maiden appearance in the Summer Games as a marathoner. Cheruiyot, arguably the most consistent Kenyan runner, will be making her fifth appearance at the Olympics, having first represented the country in the 5,000m at the 2000 Sydney Olympics. In Rio, Cheruiyot won the 5,000m title but fell short to clinching a remarkable distance double after falling to Ethiopian Almaz Ayana in the 10,000m final. Before Tokyo, the 'Pocket-Rocket' will try to defend her London Marathon title.
