Financial constraints will not hold back 22-time women Premier League champions Blazers in the coming season, coach Jos Openda has said. As the 10-time African champions continue with their quest to have a new sponsor on board before the season starts, Openda intimated that his charges will honour all their matches even if the situation persists. Their 30-year sponsorship deal with Telecommunication firm, Telkom was cut short in June last year and the unveiling of a new sponsor will be a major boost. Despite the tough financial inadequacies bedevilling Blazers, Openda quipped that the playing unit is prepared both physically and mentally to overcome the situation as they look to start their title defence on a high. "We are holding the cards close to our chest as we work towards having new financiers. We have done a lot of things and we are positive as we could soon have a new revelation. I can assure our fans that as tough as the situation looks, we will definitely play all our fixtures be it at Kisumu or anywhere else. Retaining the title is the bare minimum for the team." The team is working on logistics and will return to training later this month prior to the opening fixtures on February 29. As the player transfer window shuts down on January 1,Â  the team is not in a hurry to overhaul the squad.
