Tiaty MP William Kamket now wants the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) to be transformed into a political party after the constitutional changes. Speaking in Mombasa during the BBI rally presided over by ODM leader Raila Odinga, Kamket said BBI should not be abandoned after constitutional amendments, but should evolve into a political outfit to bring Kenyans together. The Kanu legislator described BBI as the 'third and the last liberation' which will address all the ills bedeviling the country. “After that (constitutional changes), I would want BBI to be a political party,” Kamket said. The call comes barely weeks after acting Registrar of Political parties Ann Nderitu revealed several attempts by politicians using their proxies to reserve the name. This would not be the first time, a movement pushing for constitutional changes morphs into a political party. In 2005 during a constitutional referendum, ODM was formed from a movement which supported the referendum whose symbol was an orange.
