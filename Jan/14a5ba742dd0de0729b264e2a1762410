Kenya secondary schools hockey powerhouses Sinyolo and Tigoi Girls are seeking to make a comeback to the national limelight this year. Speaking at Jomo Kenyatta Sports ground in Kisumu during Biro Lich schools' edition tournament, Tigoi and Sinyolo coaches expressed confidence that they will be back to the nationals and East Africa limelight. Sinyolo beat Tigoi 2-1 in the opening game of the tournament with Consolata Awino and Mitchelle Akoth on target for  the winners. Molvine Maloba scored Tigoi's consolation. The two sides played to a barren draw in the second game. Millicent Adhaimbo, the goalkeeper of Kenya Hockey League side, Kisumu Lakers,  played as a defender for her school Sinyolo. Tigoi coach Moses Erima said: “It was a good game. Playing former East Africa champions gave my girls the much needed exposure. Last year, we lost at the regional level but this time, we are going for the national title.” His Sinyolo counterpart Aloise Owino said: “We have not been to the nationals for two consecutive years. This time we want to make a comeback and qualify for the East Africa secondary school games. We want to reclaim our regional title which we last won in 2017.” “This tournament has helped me identify the weaknesses in defence and striking which I will rectify before inter schools competition starts next month,” added Owino.
