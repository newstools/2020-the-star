It is a shame we could not prosecute and convict the Akashas, President Uhuru Kenyatta has said. "I have no power to convict the accused because we have done our part and I will continue to do so... the judiciary should give us convictions," he said. Speaking in Mombasa on Tuesday, Uhuru said he will continue the war on corruption to ensure Kenya wins. "The judiciary should rise to the occasion. It is a shame we could not prosecute and convict the Akashas and the US has done it in one year," he said. It was end of an era for the Akasha Organisation after the US sentenced Ibrahim Akasha to 23 years in prison on Friday. US District Judge Victor Marrero handed the sentence in Manhattan federal court after postponing the sentencing twice last year. Initially, the sentencing was scheduled for early November last year, before being moved to December 6 and pushed again to January 10. Ibrahim had stayed in New York holding cells for three years awaiting the verdict after his headline-grabbing extradition to the US from Mombasa on January 2017.
