Forward Robert Nyakundi jets into the country to link up with the national men’s basketball team this Friday ahead of the Afro-basket pre-qualifiers in Nairobi. Coach Cliff Owuor confirmed Kenya Basketball Federation (KBF) have already sent a ticket to the USA-based player. “We will have Nyakundi here before this weekend. The federation has already sent him a ticket and we will be happy to welcome him to the team,” beamed Owuor. He ruled out Ronny Gundo and Brian Namake from the team. Gundo is out of the country and Namake, who is based in Uganda has not arrived. The camp also got a huge boost when it was confirmed that Premier League’s Most Valuable Player (MVP) Victor Bosire will be available for the show. The Ulinzi Warriors fiery guard, who missed the Mali show due to work commitment has an unequalled work ethic. “The boys are good to go. The only player we are expecting now is Bush who is still engaged in the Tunisian league,” he said. Owuor said he expects a good showing in the tournament slated for next week at Nyayo Stadium gymnasium. “We are playing at home and will go all out for a win and a ticket to the next phase. The training has picked up well,” he noted. He said he has identified a player who will fill the void left by the injured Denmark-based sharp shooter Tyler Ongwae. “Tyler was key to our outstanding outing in Bamako. His exploits will be missed but I am working with a player who in my mind will fill that gap,” said Owuor. The team, he said, has now got the green light from the federation and will move into residential camp at a Nairobi West-based hotel today. The squad: Griffin Ligare (captain), Faheem Juma, Valentine Nyakinda, Ariel Okal, Eric Mutoro, Joseph Khaemba, Fidel Okoth, Victor Ochieng and Desmond Owili, Victor Odendo, Ariel Ortega and Asamoah Njote.
