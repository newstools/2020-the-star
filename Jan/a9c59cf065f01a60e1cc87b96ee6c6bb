If you use Twitter for Android, don't update the application, Twitter has warned. In a post on social media, Twitter said they are investigating a problem with the latest version of the app. The company rolled out an update to its first party app bringing it to version S8.28  but the update is causing the app to immediately crash upon launch. "....this latest version causes Twitter to crash immediately once it’s opened. If you use Twitter for Android, we suggest not updating it until we let you know it's fixed. Sorry for the inconvenience," Twitter said on Wednesday. Recently, many users have been complaining about the Twitter app that reportedly started crashing or closing on its own. If you've already installed the update and are not able to use Twitter, you can go to the app's info page and clear data and storage to get it working again. Some Twitter users gave out solutions on how to deal with the problems. @derrenweekes said "I found going into Android settings->apps, then find Twitter app and "clear storage” worked for me - just by had to reset my dark theme afterward." "Yeah, well. Too late. Had to deinstall and fully reinstall the entire app to get it working. By the way, on a crashed app, I can't read your tweets. Just saying,"@PlanetaryGoGo said. @MadharNabil said "You can install the old version 8.25 or 8.26 or 8.27,if you make the update for the last version for #Twitter."
