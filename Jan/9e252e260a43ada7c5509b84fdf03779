Microsoft has appointed Kendi Ntwiga Nderitu as the manager for its operations in Kenya. Kendi had previously served as the General Manager of the East, West and Central Africa Cluster for Check Point Software before joining Microsoft. She appreciated Microsoft for her appointment. “I am excited to join Microsoft at a time when digitisation is seen as a key driver of progress and transformation in Africa. Microsoft’s mission is to empower every person and organisation on the planet to achieve more and I feel privileged to be the custodian of that mission in Kenya,” Kendi said. Her extensive resume includes roles at Oracle, HP and Intel, where she was tasked with leading and implementing business strategies across sub-Saharan Africa. She has been instrumental in helping various organisations develop strategic digital road maps, ultimately enabling them to improve efficiencies and reduce costs. Kendi is also the founder of She-Goes-Tech, an initiative created with the purpose of mentoring young girls and women who are pursuing STEM careers. The new manager will be responsible for developing and maintaining effective relationships across the company’s subsidiaries, and regional sales and marketing departments. The role also calls for the creation of strategies, the building of plans, allocation of resources and the establishment of priorities and supervising engagements – all with the ultimate goal of increasing Microsoft’s share of voice. The Regional General Manager Middle East and Africa Multi-Country Region at Microsoft Ibrahim Youssry welcomed Kendi’s appointment. “We are extremely excited to have Kendi join our dynamic team and are confident that her extensive experience will go a long way in contributing to our overall mission of helping the continent on its digital transformation journey, while also driving greater diversity and inclusion across STEM fields," Youssry said.
