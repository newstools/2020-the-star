Shabana FC stepped up preparations for the Betika National Super League with a 4-3 post-match penalty win over South Mugirango National Government  Constituency Development Fund champions Tabaka FC. The teams played to a 1-1 draw with on-form Fred Nyakundi scoring for Shabana while Samuel Nyabuto replied for Tabaka at Nyamarambe playground. The match was organised by Tabaka patron, South Mugirango MP Sylvanus Osoro, who hailed his team for giving Shabana a run for their money. “Shabana played well but my boys were well prepared,” added Osoro. Shabana coach Vincent Nyaberi said he was putting his trialists to test and might sign some of them after giving a good account of themselves. “They played under pressure but I’m happy with the way they reacted. I have until Monday to make up my mind on the new signings. Some players from Tabaka were also impressive and we will have to look at them,” said Nyaberi who took over from Andrew Kanuli. The club has been doing trials at Mosocho Academy and Nyaberi has settled on a working number of 10 out of the 200 who heeded the call at first. “There was an overwhelming turn out. More players are still coming but we want to keep a manageable number,” said Nyaberi, a former defender, adding that his target remains a top-five finish. “We shall play 12 matches at home and our aim is to pick maximum points from those games.” Shabana start their second-round action against runaway leaders Nairobi City Stars at Gusii Stadium on January 11. Club chairman Jared Nivaton said they intend to have a lean squad of 25 senior players and five schoolboys. He asked the County Government of Kisii to allow Shabana use the stadium, closed for two months, while renovations are still ongoing.
