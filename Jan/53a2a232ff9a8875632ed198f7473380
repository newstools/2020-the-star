The drought authority has urged communities not to fight over water reservoirs constructed by the government. Raphael Nzomo, chairman of the National Drought Management Authority, said everybody is free to get water from dams or earth dams without discrimination since they are funded by taxes he said on Thursday last week. Speaking on Thursday last week, he asked communities to stop fighting blocking others from using the resources. He was reacting to remarks by Embu leaders that some people had blocked access to water sources. Nzomo spoke when he launched the Kithiru Kiruire earth dam, two ablution blocks, a community water kiosk, a watering trough and a demonstration plot — valued at Sh16.8 million. They were constructed by NDMA, the county and community in Mbeere North subcounty. Nzomo was accompanied by Deputy Governor David Kariuki. The 50,000 cubic metre dam is providing water to2,500 people,7,000 cattle and 13,000 goats. Girls in semi-arid regions perform poorly in exams because they spend much of their time fetching water for their families, Nzomo said. The NDMA boss said it was unfortunate that the responsibility of fetching water falls only on women and girls. “I point out the benefit of this project to schoolgirls, who, according to your testimonies, now spend less time fetching water and have more time to attend school." NDMA is constructing earth dams in dry areas to help ease the water shortage. Over the long term, Nzomo said, the dam will prepare residents to deal with drought by supporting their livelihoods through farming, livestock production and forestry. Kariuki said the county government is carrying out drought-alleviating water projects in the semi-arid areas of Mbeere North and South to enable residents to be self-reliant in food production and improve their standard of living.
