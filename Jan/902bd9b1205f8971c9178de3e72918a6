A single mother in Kisumu is planning to sell her kidney to send her daughter to Moi Nyabohanse Girls High School. Rhoda Abaja, whose daughter Lencer Anyumba scored 384 marks in last year’s KCPE exam, said she does not have money to enrol her daughter in Form 1. The girl sat her KCPE exam at Bridge International Academy in Kisumu. Abaja, a casual labourer, said she has been unable to secure sponsorship for her daughter and the option is to sell her kidney to raise the Sh53,000 fees needed for Form 1. The mother of two earns Sh400 a day. She uses the money to sustain her family. Abaja said they unsuccessfully applied for Equity's Wings To Fly and KCB Foundation scholarships. “I don't want to sit back and watch my daughter miss the opportunity to fulfil her education dreams. I'm ready to sell one of my kidneys to pay her secondary education fees,” she said. Anyumba wants to be a neurosurgeon. Abaja said she separated with her husband and has been raising the children alone. She said her daughter has been troubled as reporting day – January 13 – nears. Abaja and her daughter are now appealing to well-wishers to come to their aid and save the mother from selling her kidney. “I would like to become somebody in life so that I can change society. I'm appealing to Kenyans to help pay my secondary school fees,” Anyumba said. The mother can be reached on 0741 807 538.
