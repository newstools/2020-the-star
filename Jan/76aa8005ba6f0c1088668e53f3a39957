Deputy president William Ruto has broken his silence over his alleged absence in Mombasa during the presidents meet with governors. A local daily had reported that Ruto was at the Coast but missed the meeting between President Uhuru Kenyatta and 24 governors. But Ruto on Saturday asked Kenyans to ignore the propaganda being peddled around. "Kenyans should ignore this choreographed, paid-for propaganda nonsense," Ruto said in a tweet. He added "I was in the office the whole day never in Mombasa." The local daily noted that Ruto reportedly flew from Wilson Airport and was in Mombasa by 10am. But noted that Ruto was back in Nairobi in the afternoon where he met a group of leaders. During the meeting with Uhuru, governors allied to the DP were not at the Mombasa meeting. Stephen Sang (Nandi) and Jackson Mandago(Uasin Gishu) were nowhere to be seen. On Thursday, Uhuru while in company of several government dignitaries arrived at the Barka restaurantÂ and caught the hotel staffs and other guests without notice.
