The election for the chairperson of one of the committees of  the Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry  slated for today has been stopped. This is after the current chairperson of the  chamber's Women in Business Committee, Mary Nyachae successfully petitioned the business lobby group's decision to conduct fresh elections while she is still in office. Senior Resident Magistrate M. Mugure issued the conservatory orders against KNCCI and its president Richard Ngatia directing that no election be held until the case is heard and determined. Nyachae says she is the current chairperson of the Committee by virtue of her appointment on March 8 2019 by then chamber President Kiprono Kitony. Through lawyer Danstan Omari she argues that prior to her formal appointment as the chair she had been endorsed by the chamber at its AGM held on February 8 2019. She received an endorsement after her name, fitness and reputation as a champion of women empowerment was thoroughly discussed in the Board of Directors meeting held on January 16. Nyachae says she remains committed to her duties as a chairperson to the WIB and a faithful chamber member guided by the objectives, mission and vision of KNCCI. She has accused Ngatia who is the current President of convening meetings designed to whip up support for a different person to take up the mantle of WIB leadership. “Through a newspaper advertisement with national circulation, unilaterally, whimsically and arbitrarily called for an election of the WIB Committee Chairperson to be held on the 24th January, 2020 in Sarova Panafric Hotel, Nairobi at 8:30 am,” reads court papers. Nyachae argues that there is no proper, legal, sound or reasonable justification other than malice and ill will why the only election being held at this time of the year is that of the applicant’s seat of the chairperson WIB Committee.
