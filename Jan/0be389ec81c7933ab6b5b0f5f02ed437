Uncertainty hangs over the men's national handball team residential training with the Africa 2020 Olympic qualifiers set for January 15-26 in Tunis, Tunisia drawing closer. Head coach Peter Mwathi said they were promised a seven-day residential training by the Kenya Handball Federation but so far there is no communication. "Mark-you, the side has less than 10 days before they jet out for the showpiece," he added. The team has been training at the Kaloleni Sports Grounds for the past month and moved to Nyayo National Stadium yesterday. The Olympic qualifiers also doubles up as 2020 Africa men’s Championships (24th edition), where Kenya will be making their third appearance after 2004 and 2016. “The communication I have is that the federation is pushing for a seven-day residential training at the Kasarani gymnasium but no dates were given,” said Mwathi. The coach is set to name his traveling squad on Thursday and he is happy that since they started training they have not encountered any mishaps. The Kenyan outfit will commence their campaign in Pool ‘A’ against Democratic Republic of Congo on 16th. Mwathi’s charges will come face-to-face with Egypt on 17th before the competition goes to a rest the next day. Kenya will meet Guinea in their last group tie. Other participating countries are Angola, Gabon, Nigeria and Libya in Pool ‘B’ as Tunisia, Cameroon, Ivory Coast and Cape Verde make up Group ‘B.’ Morocco, Algeria, Congo (Brazzaville) and Zambia are pitted in Pool D. Egypt won the 2016 edition was won by Egypt who went on to represent Kenya at the Rio Olympics. The Africa Championships title has forever been a preserve for North Africa as the gong has been patronised by Tunisia who have won a record 10 trophies, Algeria (seven) and Egypt (six). Kenya’s best performance was ninth place finish in 2004.
