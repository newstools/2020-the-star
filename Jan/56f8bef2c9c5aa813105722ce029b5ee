President Uhuru Kenyatta has accepted an invitation to be the chief guest at the inauguration of  Guinea Bissau President-Elect Umaro Cissoko Embalo. Uhuru on Tuesday said he would honour the invite extended to him by Cissoko, who visited him at State House, Mombasa. While wishing Cissoko good luck, Uhuru said he should strive towards uniting his people. Cissoko will be inaugurated on February 15 after he defeated his closet rival in a general election last week. The electoral body said the 47-year-old beat rival Domingos Simoes Pereira by about 54% to 46%. While congratulating him for his win, Uhuru said unity is critical for Guinea Bissau's national development and thus Cissoko should prioritise bringing that stability. Speaking during a meeting at State House, Mombasa, the two leaders said their respective countries will enhance their cooperation. They further singled out an exchange of students and teachers, collaboration in technical training, trade and security as some of the key areas of focus in bolstering cooperation between Kenya and Guinea Bissau. The two leaders also resolved to work together and play an active role in bridging the gap between East and West Africa through enhanced people-to-people interactions so as to boost continental integration efforts. Cissoko thanked President Uhuru for his leading role in the integration of Africa as well as in efforts to ensure sustainable peace and stability on the continent. He recalled the strong historical ties between  Kenya and Guinea Bissau that date back to pre-colonial times saying there was room for the two countries to consolidate and expand their areas of cooperation.
