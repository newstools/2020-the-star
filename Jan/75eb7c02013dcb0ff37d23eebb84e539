Quins head coach Dominque Habaimana has urged his side to show fight as the second half of the Kenya Cup campaign resumes in a fortnight. The former league champions are placed 10th with eight points, 12 points off a playoff slot (sixth) and a far cry of yesteryears where the Ngong Road outfit were perennial title challengers. Habimana was unequivocal that his side would not get relegated, having won two fixtures out of nine, against Menengai Oilers and Blak Blad. "I believe we will survive. We will take one match at a time. The talent of players we have is good enough to see us move up the table,” said Habimana. The former Kenya Simbas tactician said lack of a proper pre-season and a cash crunch at the start of the season delayed the team's ambitions. "When I came, there was a cash crisis at the club and we did not have a proper pre-season but the management have done a great job to ensure all pending allowances have been paid,” added Habimana. Quins play Kisumu on January 11 at the RFUEA grounds followed by three tough tests against league leaders Kabras, Homeboyz and champions KCB. Elsewhere, Migori Select have been crowned as the Rugby Mashinani winners after a 29-0 victory over Rongo in the final played at the Sony Complex. The winners landed five tries, converting two. Sebastian Makalek and Kelvin Abuga bagged a brace each while Tyson Juma sealed their victory with the final try. Two tries in the final saw Makalek stretch his scoring tally to finish the tournament as the top try scorer while Elvin Otieno of Rongo RFC was the Most Valuable Player. The two were awarded by Wilfit Sports Venture.  Migori took the bronze medal.
