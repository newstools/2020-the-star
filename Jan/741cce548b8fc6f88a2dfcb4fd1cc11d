Sofapaka head coach John Baraza has called on his charges to exercise caution ahead of tomorrow's Kenyan Premier League clash against beleaguered Kariobangi Sharks. In his pre-match comments on the club's portal ahead of Batoto Ba Mungu's first match of 2020, Baraza has rallied his team to go for a win whilst praising the players' positive attitude in training. The team resumed preparations on December 27 ahead of a  busy January schedule. “I want to first appreciate and thank my players for the great attitude they have been showing in training since we resumed after the short festive break,” said Baraza. “We have a very busy January and it's going to be very crucial for us in our title push. We shall be playing five important matches thus I am calling on the players to treat each game with the right mindset because we are on a mission and we need to win to achieve our target," remarked Baraza. After taking Sharks tomorrow,  they will continue the busy new month by hosting fellow title contenders KCB four days later. The 2009 champions will then take on millers Nzoia Sugar (January 12) and Chemelil Sugar (January 25) home and away respectively before wrapping up the month of January with a top-billing duel with champions Gor Mahia on January 29. What will be good news for the coach is that he has a healthy squad to choose from ahead of  the punishing assignments. “We are glad we have no major concerns because everyone is fit and available for selection. We want to build on and continue with the winning momentum we had before the break,” he concluded. Baraza remains unbeaten at the helm, having won  five of his six matches in charge. They are currently eighth on the table with 21 points from 13 matches. Crucially, as they seek to end their decade long wait for another top-flight crown, they are only eight points adrift of top spot. That now has made their fixture against Gor at the end of the month all the more meaningful to their title aspirations.
