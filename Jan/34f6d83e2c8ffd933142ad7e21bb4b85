The beer bottle conflict between Keroche and the EABL on Wednesday took a new twist after a group of traders called for a boycott of their products should either of them claim the sole monopoly of the Euro bottle. The Council of County Bar Owners threatened to sue the brewers within the next 14 days if they continue letting their conflict interfere with their businesses. The lobby said drinkers do not buy the bottles but the content. They said the tiff has hit them hard as their staff are frequently arrested. Keroche and EABL brewers are in court over the ownership and usage of brown 500ml Euro bottles engraved with the label 'EABL'.  The bar owners said the conflict has created confusion in the market and "distorted the flow and return use of the bottles by companies who use the same 500ml  brown Euro bottle mould for their product". Led by chairmen from different counties, they said their business vehicles are sporadically stopped and frisked by the police and the bottles confiscated. Richard Kagiri, the chairperson from Kiambu, said in some their employees and agents are arrested and charged with dealing in non-customised or even counterfeit products. "The charge range from dealing with counterfeits and unaccustomed goods. The effect of this confusion is huge," he said. Boniface Gachoki from Nakuru said, "The situation that has obtained is no longer tenable. Our businesses are taking a hit that undermines us." "The marking of the Euro bottles bring back the dark memories of the uncivilised beer wars of the 1990s where a dominant player 'collects' a competitor's bottles from the market and destroys them or withholds them, occasioning high business costs for the other party... creat(ing) an artificial shortage of reusable bottles," they said in a statement.
