Tanzanian video vixen Lynn says she was engaged to Diamond Platnumz. This was after they met in 2016 at a video shoot. "We became lovers and I introduced him to my parents when he became my fiance. He wanted to marry me. He then rented a house for me. We were together for two years," she said in an interview with YouTuber Sam Misago. "Everyone knew Diamond was with Zari and it wasn't bad because he is a Muslim who can marry four wives." She went to another relationship after breaking up with the star.
