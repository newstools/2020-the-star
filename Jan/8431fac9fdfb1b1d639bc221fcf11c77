A police officer sustained bullet injuries after he was attacked by armed gangsters at 5.30 am on Monday in Dandora, Nairobi. Nairobi police boss Philip Ndolo said that the victim was hospitalised but in stable condition. The officer was on his way to work. Ndolo said that they had launched a manhunt on the suspects who escaped on foot after injuring the cop on the head. The incident makes the number of officers harmed by gangsters in the past one month to three after two others were shot at by thugs at Kayole junction in Ruiru subcounty a month ago. Both the officers are recuperating at a Nairobi hospital. The gangsters were, however, shot dead by one of the officers who also sustained bullet wounds. The incident happens at a time police have stepped up operations to crack down on gangsters in Nairobi and its environs. Swoops have borne fruits with several items suspected to have been stolen from members of the public recovered. Five motor vehicle engines were recovered by detectives from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) at Ruiru market in Juja, Kiambu on January 18. Over the weekend, a team of DCI and police officers based at Kamukunji intercepted a gang along Ladhies Road. They were challenged to surrender but shot at the officers. Three suspects were gunned down by cops in the shootout while a fourth escaped on foot towards Muthurwa estate. Police recovered eight pistols, a penknife, and four bullets. Ndolo has maintained that they will not relent in the war against criminals. He urged the public to continue cooperating with the police by volunteering information.
