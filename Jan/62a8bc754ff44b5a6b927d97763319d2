 Embu's low population has been blamed on alcohol addiction as married men no longer engage in sex. The claim came from among others Mavuria ward representative John Mbaka and his Ruguru/Ngandori counterpart Muturi Mwombo. The two claimed that most families had only two children, not out of choice, but because men took alcohol excessively to the detriment of bed responsibilities. Mwombo, who is also the Assembly’s Health Committee chairman, spoke at the  Chamber during a special sitting called to consider the Embu County Alcoholic Drinks Control Bill. The county government was asked not to be blinded by the amount of revenue collected from liquor sellers. Nominated MCA Edna Muisyo said alcohol should only be consumed on weekends. Deputy speaker Steve Munene said the enactment of stringent laws was the only way to ensure that men returned home to their wives and children when sober and responsible.
