The government has released Sh300 million for the reconstruction of impassable Mwiki-Kasarani Road. This comes following a lengthy engagement between Nairobi Senator Johnson Sakaja and the Kenya Urban Roads Authority acting MD Silas Kinoti on Thursday. The amount released is part of Sh1.7 billion that the government has set aside to repair 13 kilometres of roads. During the meeting, Sakaja said a team and machinery have already been sent to the area to make the road accessible as more action follows. "We have already sent a team and the machinery to Mwiki to make the road passage for now as we prepare for full work," Sakaja said. The intervention comes as strike enters its fourth day in Kasarani as matatu operators applying along Mwiki route protested the poor state of the road. Since Monday, matatu operators tired of regular breakdowns from the pathetic road blocked all the routes leading to Thika Superhighway. Residents have been forced to brace the morning rain as they walked long distances to Roysambu where they boarded matatus from other areas. The Kasarani-Mwiki road's condition has been the cause of many protests since the days of the defunct city council administration. The road serves hundreds of thousands of residents living in Kasarani constituency. The Nairobi county government under Evans Kidero used Sh500 million to repair the road but after only a few months, the residents were back planting bananas in the big potholes in protest. Governor Mike Sonkoâ€™s administration also repaired the road after a protest, but not much changed.
