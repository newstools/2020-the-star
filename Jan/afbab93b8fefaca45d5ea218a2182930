A fisherman was on Friday attacked and killed by a hippo on Lake Naivasha. The man was laying nets near the landing beach with a colleague when the lone hippo attacked, crushing his hand and stomach with its jaws. The other victim is still missing. A witness said he had injuries on his hands. Joel Kimani, a witness, said a group of the illegal fishermen were setting their nets when the hippo appeared, sending them scrambling in all directions. “There was little that his colleagues could do and had to wait before retrieving the body from the lake while the fate of the other one remains unknown,” he said. The latest incident brings to four the number of fishermen who have been killed around the lake. Lake Naivasha Boat Owners Association chairman David Kilo said the attacks were on the rise. “We have seen an increase in the number of fishermen around the lake and in the process many have lost their lives due to hippo attacks,” he said. Over the weekend a German national was attacked by a hippo around South Lake and seriously injured as his kin fled. The latest attack came four days after another fisherman was attacked by another hippo and died while undergoing treatment in Naivasha subcounty hospital. Early last week, a worker from a private ranch in Kongoni area was gored to death and his colleague seriously injured by a buffalo. According to Naivasha subcounty commissioner Mathioya Mbogo, the increase in the attacks were worrying. He said that his office was organising a meeting with KWS and other stakeholders around the lake to address the current issue. “We had an incident over the weekend where an international tourist was injured while other locals have been injured or killed in the past by the wild animals,” he said. Mbogo attributed some of the attacks to an increase in human activities around the lake mainly by illegal fishermen.
