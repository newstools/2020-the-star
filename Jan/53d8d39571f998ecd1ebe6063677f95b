A man was on Friday charged before a Makadara court with fraudulently obtaining Sh300,000 from Mary Wangui with a promise of getting her son employment in the Kenya Defense Forces. Kennedy Waitwika Mwangi was accused of obtaining the cash jointly with others who were not before court. The offence was committed between November 19 and 24 last year. Mwangi pleaded not guilty to the charges before chief magistrate Heston Nyagah. Through his lawyer, the accused asked for lenient bond terms. Nyagah granted him a bail of Sh100,000 and an alternative bond of Sh300,000. Mwangi asked the court to order that his car be released, saying there were police uniforms and official documents belonging to his wife in the vehicle. He said his wife was a police officer. “Your honour, my client here is a small-scale business owner and his family depends on him. He is also a spouse to a police officer and inside the car are some of the official documents and uniform for his wife," his lawyer said. "Besides, the value of my client's car and the motorcycle does not march the money said to have been obtained. We, therefore, pray for the car to be released.” Nyagah ordered the investigating officer to file an affidavit before Monday and  explain why he wanted to detain the accused person’s car and the motorcycle before the matter is determined.  edited by p.o
