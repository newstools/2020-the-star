A man in Nairobi on Thursday denied obtaining Sh20 million by false pretences. Fredrick Okoth allegedly obtained the money from Pastel Limited claiming there was a restricted tender from the Ministry of Transport, Infrastructure, Housing and Urban Development. According to court documents, he said the tender called for the supply of EQ-Angling Tail lines to the Kenya Ports Authority, a fact he knew was false. Okoth reputedly committed the offence between November 29, 2017, and November 30, 2017, in Nairobi. In a second count, he was charged with making a document without lawful authority. With an intent to defraud, he, jointly with others still at large, is said to have made a letter of offer for the alleged tender. Appearing before magistrate Nzibe Muthoni, Okoth denied the charges and sought lenient bond terms. The court granted him Sh5 million bail, with alternative Sh10 million bond.Â The case will be mentioned in a Milimani court on January 31.
