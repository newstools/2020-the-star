In a bid to tame the recurring financial challenges, AFC Leopards are set to convene a national meeting at the end of the month as they seek to relaunch their member registration drive. Leopards have been limping financially since the unceremonious exit of their shirt sponsor SportPesa in August and have now resorted to bridging the gap left by the gaming firm through fan registration. The financial constraints have seen Ingwe lose their valuable assets in players and Rwandese coach Andre Mbungo but according to their chairman Dan Shikanda,the insufficient funds will soon be a thing of the past. Shikanda argues that the registration drive will enable the executive raise a basketball full of resources enough to bankroll the club without necessarily relying on incentives from sponsors. The former Kenyan international further reckons that meeting will enable his office share his short and long term visions they have for the club as well as rally them to support the club. "If we know the number of members we have it will be easier to run the club and even to get sponsorship although it's my vision for the club to be self sustainable. The meeting should not be mistaken for attempts to amend the constitution," said Shikanda
