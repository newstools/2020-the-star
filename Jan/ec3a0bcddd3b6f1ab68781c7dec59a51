Nyali MP Mohammed Ali and his Suna East MP Junet Mohammed almost got into a fist fight over seating arrangements at the BBI rally in Mombasa on Saturday. Organisers of the rally had underestimated the number of delegates expected, with fewer seats at the dais than the number of guests. This forced several announcements by host Governor Hassan Joho and co-Master of Ceremony Mvita MP Abdulswamad Nassir that non-elected members, including their VIP bodyguards, had to move out of the dais. "You have refused to listen to my language. Now, you will hear another language," Nassir said. Junet asked Ali to move to the back of the dais, saying the front row seats were reserved for Governors. Ali had sat on one of the seats next to Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen. Ali refused to move, saying he is also an elected MP and had a right to be at the dais. He accused Junet of picking on him, before pushing back Junet's hands that had reached out for him. However, Nassir and Joho intervened and calm was restored. Ali continued sitting on the front row. Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria was roughed up as orderlies tried to take his seat away. He, however, resisted all attempts as he 'defended his seat'. Some VIPs, including Migori Governor Okoth Obado, who arrived late, had to stand for about 10 minutes as there was no empty seat. The VIPs had to share seats. Coast leaders were supposed to seat in the main dais. Other elected leaders from other regions were meant to sit on the right-hand side dais. The left-hand side dais was meant for other non-elected leaders. Nassir said it is not right that Joho had to give up his seat next to Raila's. Joho said, "I am the host. I can stand." ODM leader Raila Odinga arrived at about 1pm.
