Former deputy head of Garissa County Communications Yussuf Korow has sued the current administration for expunging his name from the payroll. Korow, who worked in former Governor Nathif Jamaâ€™s administration, claimed his name was erroneously removed from the payroll in September 2017 following an audit conducted the County Public Service Board. In a lawsuit, Korow claims that despite having worked since September 2017 and even with the CPSB writing to the payroll manager ordering his reinstatement into the payroll, the manager has disobeyed the directive. He continues to work without pay, he said. Korow alleged that he was never given a chance to defend himself before he was removed from the payroll. He is demanding an order for compensatory damages for unlawfully removing him from the payroll, breach of employment contracts and withholding his salary totalling to Sh1,673,124. The non-payment of his salary and refusal to reinstate him, he alleges, violated his rights to fair labour practice. He says the "action by the county administration had subjected him to economic and social humiliation at home and amongst his peers." The court documents were filed at the Employment and Relations Court in Nairobi last year on November 8.  Edited by R.Wamochie
