Nairobi Woman Representative Esther Passaris went through a spinal surgery at CIMS Hospital in India. Passaris said that she had spinal surgery on January 1, a day after flying to India. The City Woman Rep shared a video through her Twitter page walking using crutches as she regains her stability after surgery. She added that she had been struggling to find a comfortable sleeping position as she has to adjust her sleeping position. Passaris had gone through another surgery at Aga Khan hospital in Nairobi in September last year after having a problem with her back. Passaris had said that she had been having a problem with her back for almost two decades. She said that she had consulted more than ten medics in the country over her condition. "I consulted over 10 medics in Kenya. Our problem is our inability to work as an 'A Team' for the benefit of not just patients but the country as a whole. We think pulling each other down is the solution. Carry your mantle and do your part. Kenya is ours to propel," Passaris said.
