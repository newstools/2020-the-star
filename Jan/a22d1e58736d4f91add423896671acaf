All Yatta day schools will be fully equipped to ensure a conducive learning environment, area MP Charles Kilonzo told parents on Thursday. Kilonzo encouraged parents and guardians not to be reluctant to take their children to day secondary schools as the institutions also produce highly qualified university learners. The MP spoke at Kithimani town where he presented bursary cheques. “My office is focusing more on developing secondary schools, especially day schools,"  he said. “We will ensure that all day-schools across the sub-county are equal to all other (better) schools for parents to take their children there,” Kilonzo said. “Take your children to schools you can afford. Sponsors are not always reliable,” he advised.
