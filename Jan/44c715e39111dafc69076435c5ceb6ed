Interior CS Fred Matiang’i has sought to assure Coast residents that they are safe from gang attacks. Speaking at the Swahilipot  Hub in Mombasa to celebrate years of the sea cable, Matiang’i said crime in Kisauni subcounty has subsided. Police said the last gang attack report in Ksauni was reported in November last Matiang’i urged youths to make maximum use of the Swahilipot Hub to earn money instead of committing crimes that put their lives and those of others at risk. “The government recognises youth because you are the present and future leaders of the country. Use this hub to practise your talents and make some money,” he said. The CS said the internet should help young people transform their lives, he said. “Use the internet to get online jobs,” he said. The government is committed to ensuring youth at Swahilipot Hub use the internet to find opportunities and grow their talents, Matiang'i said. “I am going to support 20 youths to grow their talents from here and I will also talk to my colleagues to support to you young people,” he said. Those to be supported include 10 girls from Pwani Tecno Girls and 10 boys under performing artist OHMS Law Montana’s programme Acha Gun Shika Mic. ICT Cabinet Secretary Joe Mucheru, who joined Matiang’I, said the government will ensure that youths are paid for their talents. “For all music played even on Skiza tune, the owner will get some money and we will be following up,” he said. Mucheru also said the government will expand the Swahilipot Hub to accommodate the many youths who use the facility. (Edited by V. Graham)
