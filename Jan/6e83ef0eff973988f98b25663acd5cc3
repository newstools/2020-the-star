Former Chief Justice Willy Mutunga has urged the media to take sides in political decisions to help liberate Kenya from bad governance. He said in its early years the Daily Nation supported de-colonialism and pushed for good leadership from President Moi's regime. Mutunga cited the ballooning debt under the Jubille government and warned that debtors may one day claim ownership of Kenya's assets. The Jubilee government owes local banks and lenders Sh2.9 trillion, according to Central Bank of Kenya data. The total public debt is presently Sh6.048 trillion. Critics have accused the administration of runaway borrowing despite a big chunk of the loans being stolen. The government's budget for interest in the financial year ending June is Sh441.5 billion. Mutunga spoke at the Kenya Methodist University (KeMU) during an exhibition of Kenyan freedom fighters and a public lecture. “The Chinese, IMF, World Bank loans will reach a point when basically you are told to leave your country, but you will fight as Mau Mau did," he said. "You will be called to protect the motherland. This is why Team Courage is celebrating dead heroes and calling for alternative leaders." Mutunga accused MPs and the Executive of curtailing the independence of the Judiciary by cutting its budget. He said it is alarming for state officers to disobey court orders. “The Judiciary should have finances, independence and integrity to stand up not being enslaved by cartels, Executive or Parliament. As CJ, funds allocated to Judiciary rose from Sh3 billion to Sh23 billion. You have heard CJ David Maraga's outburst that there is no money,” Mutunga said. “The politics of division, ethnicism and unequal share of resources is the main cause of problems in this country. I am not surprised leaders talk of entrenching peace, then there is war. It is then not a struggle for peace but for power.” Vice chancellor Maurice Okoth urged students to broaden their minds.
