Producer Paulo apologised after a screenshot went viral, which showed that singer Bahati had got him arrested him over theft. "I am being accused of being a thief reason being I am supporting Peter Blessings," the text read. Well, Paulo told Word Is on Friday he had forgiven Bahati. "Yes, he got us arrested but I have considered forgiveness. He accused me of stealing his studio things. I had taken some things which he had given me and there was a misunderstanding that I had stolen them," he said. "I just want to tell Bahati that I'm sorry, he should just forgive me and go on as we were." Asked if he is affiliated with Bahati's label group, he said, "No, I'm not an EMB member." He then said Bahati was the one who plotted his arrest on Thursday evening using someone who pretended to be a journalist. "I was given a call by someone who said he was a journalist and that he needed an interview. That's when I found it was the police, who escorted me to the police station. At the police station, they accused me of stealing," Paulo said.
