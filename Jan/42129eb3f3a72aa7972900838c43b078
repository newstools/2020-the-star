A section of the Akamba community in Kwale wants the indigenous people to accommodate and add them as the tenth Mijikenda tribe. County Akamba chairperson Michael Mutuku said they have stayed for long at the South Coast "proving beyond doubt that they are part of the local group". Mutuku said the communities living around are faced by the same challenges giving them a common interest. “The roads you use, health facilities and disasters that come affect us evenly meaning we are one people,” he said. He spoke at Shimba Hills during the launch of the Akamba Cultural Day in Matuga subcounty. Mutuku said the Akamba community wants to maintain peace with the locals by living together in solidarity. He said unity is the core for development and success for the people and the nation at large. “When we live in harmony nothing is impossible, we can achieve a lot and move the country forward." Subcounty Akamba community leader Gladys Reuben said unity is meant to seal the future generations. She said intermarriages have occurred between the locals and Akambas giving rise to children who must only be showered by gospels of peace to tighten the relationship. County police commander Joseph Nthenge reminded the residents that peace is paramount and ethnic groups must learn to love one another to obtain prosperity. He cautioned Kwale communities to avoid chaos "only meant to satisfy a few selfish individuals". “We must not be misled by malicious beings who are here just to please their self-interest and desires,” Nthenge said. National Irrigation Board Director Zainab Chidzuga called upon the national government to merge the Kubo South and Mkongani wards a constituency. The NIB director said the two areas meet the constitutional requirements to become a constituency based on the 2019 census results. Chidzuga said the merge will heighten the unification of diverse people as they enjoy government services at their convenience. Edited by R.Wamochie
