Nurses at the Isiolo County Referral Hospital welcomed 2020 with gifts to two infants born on New Year's Eve. Parents received clothes the mothers and the babies, diapers, baby jelly, soaps and sanitary pads for the mothers. Florence Munoru, a specialist midwife at the facility, said the gesture by the nurses was to mark 2020 as the International Year for Nurses and Midwives in line with guidelines by the World Health Organization. She said nurses play a critical role in any health facility as they are always the first to receive patients and the last to see them out whether after being discharged or dying. “We expect 2020 to be a year that nurses are given better recognition that will consequently lead to better service delivery,” she said. The major challenge to service delivery in public health facilities is the shortage of nurses and midwives, Munoru said. She urged the government to recruit more nursesand ensure quality healthcare for all Kenyans. Edited by R.Wamochie
