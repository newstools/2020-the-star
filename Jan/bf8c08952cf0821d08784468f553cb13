A family in Homa Bay has blamed their neighbour for the death of their three-year-old son. Bernard Oyoo drowned in the neighbour's pit on Wednesday evening in Kakoth village, Karachuonyo. His family, led by father John Owino, has yet to come to terms with the tragedy. The boy had been playing with four other children when he accidentally fell in the rainwater-filled pit, which was to be developed into a latrine. "He accidentally slid, fell and drowned," an eyewitness said. Owino said he could not understand how his child drowned, yet they were playing some distance away from the pit. He questioned why the pit was left uncovered, despite the dangers it posed. The pit is situated outside the neighbour's home. After the alarm was raised, Owino rushed to the scene to save the child but found he had died. "My child cried for help and nobody managed to rescue him. It’s very sad indeed,” Owino said as he wept. "Some friends assisted me in removing the body from the pit." Area chief Jacob Abok said they had reported the matter to the police for investigations. He appealed to residents to cover all pits and any other holes that expose children to danger. "We should be cautious with everything which can cost people their lives. The matter is under investigations by Kendu Bay police," Abok said. He urged parents not to allow their children to play away from their homes, especially in the rainy season.
