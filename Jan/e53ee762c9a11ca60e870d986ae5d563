Former Machakos Senator Johnstone Muthama has called on President Uhuru Kenyatta to resist attempts that would make him hang onto power beyond the 2022 constitutional limit. Muthama criticised the Building Bridges Initiative, arguing that it was being pushed by parties interested in acquiring political powers to individuals against the will of the people. "It's highly suspicious that the prevailing clamour for review of the constitution through the BBI is aimed at dishing out political power to certain individuals against the will of the Kenyan people," he said. Muthama was addressing the media during a funeral ceremony in Kyaume Village in Matungulu subcounty on Friday. The former legislator urged Uhuru to be like his predecessors who vacated the top seat after their constitutional presidential terms expired. “If Uhuru wants to become a respected statesman, he must not attempt to succeed himself. He should do what his predecessors did. That way he will retire honourably,” Muthama said. “Uhuru must be the first person to come out and declare that Kenya will not go the route of other African countries where heads of states devised mechanisms to illegally extend their rule. He must resist the calls for self-succession no matter how much he is pushed." He cited the poorly performing economy, high cost of living and the runaway corruption situation in the country adding that it was unfortunate that majority of political class do not appear bothered by the tribulations of the Kenyan masses. “When you look at what is happening now, and the people who are supposed to be concerned about the sufferings Kenyans are going through, there is absolutely nothing to connect with,” he said.
