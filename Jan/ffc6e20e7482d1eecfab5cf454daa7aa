Bahati MP Kimani Ngunjiri has accused the government of using the police to intimidate politicians who are supporting the DP. Ngunjiri spoke on Monday after he hadÂ been summoned to appear before the Directorate of Criminal Investigation Headquarters in Nakuru. The summon was based on the statement he made over the BBI and Deputy President William Ruto's removal from his official residence in Mombasa. Ngunjiri took two hours at the headquarters where he recorded statements over the allegations. Addressing the media after the encounter with the sleuths on Monday, Ngunjiri wondered why the police were summoning him for saying what was already published in a section of the media. "News that the DP had been thrown out of his office in Mombasa were in the public domain yet the detectives are asking me where I got the information," he said. Ngunjiri said the police should have questioned the media house that published the story about where they got the information and whether it was true. The legislature said he was being harassed because of his stand on the BBI report and maintained that he was going to oppose any attempts to change the document. He disclosed that he was ordered to surrender his guns and the licenses which are to be handed over to the authorities on Tuesday. "I have had the gun since 1992 and I have never misused it, I have a feeling that the government is stripping off my security for a reason," he said. Ngunjiri added that his life was in danger after some unknown people trailed his car early last year. He said another group of armed men visited his home in November last year and asked his whereabouts. "I reported the two incidents at the Bahati Police Station and nothing has been done," said the MP.
