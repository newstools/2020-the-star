“The mediocre teacher tells. The good teacher explains. The superior teacher demonstrates. The great teacher inspires.” William Arthur explains that a great teacher is one who models enthusiasm and energy in the classroom. Parents place their children in the hands of teachers for three months. I call on all teachers to shun mediocrity which ruins the child’s future. Explanation is not enough. Neither is demonstration. The sole duty of a teacher is to inspire. Once inspired, learners open their minds to learning.  MA student in Project Planning & Management at UoN
