More women than men are registering for professional courses in human resource management. Of the 1,510 candidates who sat their sixth Certified Human Resource Professional exams last November, 1,141 were female, representing 75.6 per cent. This means the men who previously dominated the field are "losing interest". Institute of Human Resource Management (IHRM) national chairman Joseph Onyango said on Friday it was an indication that women who were previously excluded from meaningful careers have a wide range of opportunities to choose from and human resources is one such career. Other possible factors that could contribute to female dominance, according to Human Management Professionals Examinations Board (HRMPEB) acting boss Jane Wanyoike, could be that women are better at handling emotional intelligence compared to men, and are more friendly and good counsellors. This was said this at the sixth CHRP examination results ceremony in Nairobi. In June last year, 851 females representing 75.4 per cent and 277 males representing 24.6 per cent sat the exams. An increase in candidates was recorded from June to November. Of the 25,000 overall human resource professions, only 14,000 have registered. The aim of the registration advocated five years ago is to lock out fake practitioners. The Human Management Professionals Examinations Board was established under Section 16 of the Human Resources Management Professional Act, No. 52 of 2012. The law states that all human resource practitioners must sit and pass three levels of CHRP exams. The examination took place in 14 centres.
