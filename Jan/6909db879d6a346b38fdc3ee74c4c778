The Lake Region Economic Bloc has called off its fifth summit so that governors can attend the Building Bridges Initiative conference to be held in Kisii on Friday. This is the fourth time the summit is being cancelled. It was to be held in Siaya. The bloc apologised on Twitter for any inconvenience the cancellation must have caused. Nyanza leaders are expected to discuss the BBI report and other serious issues affecting the region, among them agriculture. The meeting will bring together governors, senators, MPs, MCAs, elders, clerics, opinion leaders, women, youth, business leaders, small traders and professionals from the region to discuss the report and agree on a common position for the region. Kisii Governor James Ongwae on Friday said the region shares the same aspirations, trading partners and it is on this basis that the elected and other leaders will champion the conversation on the BBI report. The LREB summit was scheduled to take place this month after it was postponed from the initial set dates of November 27 and 28 last year. This was the third change of date. It had initially been scheduled to take place at the Jaramogi Oginga Odinga University in Bondo between July 17 and 19 last year. However, it was postponed after the various organisers claimed this was to allow governors to attend an expo at the Kenyatta International Convention Centre. It was then rescheduled for August 1 and 2 but failed to kick-off following the death of LREB vice chairperson and Bomet Governor Joyce Laboso. Laboso was a critical player in the socio-economic development and transformation agenda of the lake region. The LREB comprises 14 counties: Migori, Nyamira, Siaya, Vihiga, Bomet, Bungoma, Busia, Homa Bay, Kakamega, Kisii, Kisumu, Nandi, Trans Nzoia and Kericho.
