Gor Mahia coach Steven Polack has insisted that the financial challenges at the club will not hinder their hopes of retaining the Kenya Premier League title. Polack, who was named the November Fidelity Insurance Coach of the Month yesterday at Camp Toyoyo, said the dry coffers at the club will not derail them from retaining their fourth consecutive league crown. Gor, who have three matches in hand, have dropped to third on the log. However, the Briton who was also decorated as the October's finest, is certain the 'one game at a time' approach will deliver at the end of the season. The record champions have endured a rough patch after SportPesa withdrew their financial support in August with players and the technical bench going for months without pay. The situation at the club has seen the trio of Maurice Ojwang’, Francis Afriyie and Gislein Yikpe leave as free agents with the rest skipping training sessions to protest the delayed pay. The players staged a no show during the presentation yesterday but Polack is banking on the players’ attitude and work rate to bag maximum points when they play Kakamega Homeboyz this weekend. “The attitude of the players and their hard work on match-days has been brilliant and I am proud of them. People think we are vulnerable this season by virtue of the financial constraints but the boys have been proving them wrong. We still have matches in hand and we are taking each at a time. This award is a reflection of the work  the players and technical bench have put in,” he said. With the transfer window open, Polack was tight-lipped on his plan to beef up the squad and  instead revealed that he was more concerned of the players' welfare. “We need to take care of the players we have at the moment. In case we have to bring in a few, they must make the team stronger.” Polack edged youthful Sofapaka coach John Baraza and league winning Ulinzi Stars tactician Benjamin Nyangweso to the gong which comes with a Sh75,000 cash incentive.
