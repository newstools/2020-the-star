A 23-year-old man was arrested by Mwingi police officers for allegedly possessing suspected explosives. Mwingi Central subcounty commander Peter Mutuma said members of public informed police John Muthengi was in possession of cannabis sativa. Upon arrest at his kiosk where he sells fish near Mwingi old market, police said they found a white substance suspected to be used for making explosives. “John was in possession of approximately 500 grams of a white substance, solid in nature suspected to be TNT, which is highly explosive,” Mutuma said. Police also found with him a cable with a copper head suspected to be a detonator. The police boss said the suspected TNT material will be taken to the Government Chemist for analysis. The fish vendor was found with 100 rolls of bhang, approximately 30 grams of plant materials, 40 tablets of an unknown substance, assorted match sticks, wax and boxes rolled in a paper and a pair of white gloves. The police boss lauded the community for working together with police to ensure security within Mwingi town. “I thank Mwingi residents for working closely with security officers in ensuring those breaking the law are brought to book, a relationship worth maintaining,” Mutuma said.
