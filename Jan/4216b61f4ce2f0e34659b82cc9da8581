KRU Championship log leaders Strathmore Leos face stiff challenge in their bid for a home semi final when they host third-placed Mean Machine tomorrow. A win for Leos will almost assure the unbeaten side a home semi-finals while Machine will be seeking to close the gap on second-placed Masinde Murilo University of Science and Technology (MMUST). Leos lead the table with 57 points—seven ahead of second placed MMUST. MMUST, coached by veteran Ochieng' Ahaya, face a tricky tie away against fourth placed United States International University's Martials.  Teams between number 4 and ten remain in contention for a play off place. The teams are separated by eight points while 11th placed Mombasa and bottom of the table Kisii RFC are battling relegation. Fifth-placed Northern Suburbs will be in Mombasa to tackle Mombasa RFC while Catholic Monks play South Coast Pirates at Ukunda Primary School. University of Eldoret's Trojans will be at home against Eldoret RFC. “A derby is always a tough game but  I hope we will return to winning ways after losing to Kisii last week,” said Kelvin Otieno, the Trojans coach. “We are still in the chase for a play off position because we shall play four games at home and one away. That gives us an advantage over our rivals,” added the soft spoken Otieno. Kisii RFC travel to Njoro in Nakuru county for a game against Egerton Wasps, seeking a third straight win. “For us to survive in the league, we have to win our four remaining games. All the four games are like finals to us,” said Kisii coach Eric Bosire. “I'm happy that of late the boys have improved. We are heading to Egerton for maximum points,” Bosire  said.  Last weekend, Kisii edged Trojans 11-3 in a closely contested match at Cardinal Otunga High School, Mosocho.
