Isiolo's Garre pastoralists have accused the police of not doing enough to recover their 600 goats stolen by Samburu raiders four days ago. The livestock owners, among them Burat Ward representative Hassan Yarrow, said the raid happened at a watering point in Gotu on January 2. A total of 800 goats and sheep belonging to 15 families were driven away but on reaching River Ewaso Nyiro, the 200 sheep could not cross the river and were left behind. The raiders crossed into Samburu County with 600 goats. The goat owners tracked the animals to Learata in Samburu with the assistance of   Northern Rangelands Trust rangers and personnel of a Lewa Wildlife Conservancy aircraft. “We are wondering why the government is taking so long to recover them yet their whereabouts are known,” Yarrow said. The pastoralists accused the police of double standards, claiming that more effort is applied to recover animals stolen from other communities. They cited a recent incident when police impounded over 100 camels from herders in Merti to compel them to produce camels stolen from Garissa.  The animals were tracked to a village in Merti, Isiolo County. The pastoralists said they want their animals back for sale to raise school fees and related expenses for their children. They called on Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i to intervene and ensure the recovery of the goats. The pastoralists said Samburu chiefs and elders can help in the recovery operation.
