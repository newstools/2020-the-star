Three top KCPE candidates from Nyalenda slum in Kisumu on Monday received full sponsorship for their secondary education. Gilani Foundation, Mayfair Holdings and James Were Foundation gave the students cheques for their fees. Stephen Amos Otieno, Rex Joseph Nyakundi and Ephy Meldon Amondi scored 401, 402 and 418 marks respectively. They will join Kakamega High School, Maranda High School and Asumbi Girls Secondary School. Ephy said it was a great opportunity for her to join secondary school, adding that she would not let down her sponsors. “Not many students from where I come get such an opportunity. This support is a guarantee that we will learn the entire four years without any hiccup. We will perform well to prove that the support was well deserved." Were said the students deserved support for their hard work. He appealed to other well wishers to help needy, bright students. He noted that it was unfortunate that it was only at Joel Omino Primary School where the pupils got 400 marks and above. “We normally sponsor pupils from Nyalenda B slums schools with 400 and above. Apparently this time a round they all came from one school.” The former area MCA said they started the scholarship programme five years ago to sponsor students from the slum each year. “We motivate them so that they can work hard and feel that there are people somewhere valuing their education," Were said. They could not hide their joy while receiving their first term fee cheques from Mayfair Holding general manager Pals Wagenaar. Wagenaar urged students to work hard and win a scholarship to enable them fulfill their dreams. “I want to urge the students also being given this cheque to take advantage of this opportunity and work hard in the schools that they join,”he said.
