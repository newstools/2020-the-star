At least 200 Mwauga residents at Kikoneni village in Kwale county have sought the government's help after their houses and property was destroyed on Monday. They termed the demolitions in Lunga Lunga subcounty illegal. According to locals, the eviction was conducted by a former land surveyor who claims ownership of the piece of land estimated to be over 30 acres. In a demonstration led by the Kenya Makonde Community chairperson Thomas Nguli, the residents condemned the 'inhumane' act. Nguli said immediate action must be taken to rescue the families from the harsh weather as they have nowhere to go. “Before anything, the government must look at the well being of these helpless people because they are stranded and all their food and belongings are gone,” Nguli said. Nguli wants the alleged landowner be investigated to establish ownership. The disputed parcels of land include the Kwale/Bumbuni C323, 324, 326 and 812. The residents say they have lived on the land for over 50 years. Rashid Omar, 70, called for respective authorities to help them get compensation for the loss incurred and recover their lands. “We are asking the land committee and other agencies to come and address this issue so that we can have back what has been forcefully taken from us,” Omar said. The locals faulted county leaders for remaining silent on the land injustice issues. The victims said the exercise has also affected children as they have not gone to school since the incident. Elena Matete said her children's school fees and uniforms were all buried in the demolitions. In 2018, Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiangi and Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya promised that the government would help resolve the land injustices in the county.
