ANC party leader, Musalia Mudavadi has cautioned leaders against using BBI to cause rifts with fellow leaders. "Kuna wengine hapa ambao juhudi yao ni kuleta porojo ambayo haina misingi,( There are some people here whose agenda is to bring worthless gossip)," he said. He spoke while in Bukhungu Stadium in Kakamega during the Raila Odinga BBI meeting. "Hii siasa ya mchezo ya kujaribu kuleta utengano kati ya viongozi tuepukane nayo, mimi napenda amani na kukaa na Wakenya wote tukafanye kazi pamoja (Let's shun games of division. I love working with all Kenyans)," he said. "Let us bring variety to the debate of BBI, discuss and welcome different views. Let us not shed blood because of BBI. It is just a political debate." Mudavadi refuted claims that he did not support BBI fully. "When Raila and Uhuru launched the BBI, I encouraged Kenyans to read and analyse it. I have never rejected BBI. Who are you to wake up and say Musalia amekataa (has rejected) BBI?," he said. Mudavadi added that he had to attend the meeting despite vowing not to because he wanted to be part of the discussion of issues affecting Kenyans. Mudavadi and his counterpart Moses Wetangula were scheduled to hold a parallel meeting in Mumias on the same day. They have vowed not to attend the meeting at Bukhungu Stadium saying they were not involved by the organisers. However Police in Mumias canceled permits for gathering in Mumias citing security fears.
