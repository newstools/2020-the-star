Celtic midfielder Ryan Christie faces a two-game ban after being charged with attempting to grab Rangers striker Alfredo Morelos by the genitals during Sunday’s Old Firm game. Christie has been issued with a notice of complaint for violent conduct after what is deemed an ‘act of brutality’. The midfielder reportedly needed groin surgery after being injured in a tussle with Morelos in Rangers’ 2-1 win. Celtic say they will defend him ‘vigorously’ at his 6 January hearing. “We are absolutely astonished at this decision,” a club statement added. Christie had been booked for an earlier offence, but escaped punishment at the time from referee Kevin Clancy. This time last year, Celtic claimed Christie was the victim of a similar offence — at the hands of Morelos — in Rangers’ 1-0 Old Firm win last Christmas, but the Colombian did not face any sanction. However, Hearts forward Steven MacLean accepted a two-match suspension last November for grabbing Eboue Kouassi between the legs in the League Cup semi-final loss to Celtic. It remains unclear whether any further charges will arise from the derby at Celtic Park. Morelos was pictured drawing a hand across his neck in an apparent throat-cutting gesture as he left the field following his dismissal. Celtic said they were ‘aware of the gestures made by the player towards Celtic supporters’. But Rangers had said in an earlier statement on their website it was ‘a gesture used commonly throughout South America to indicate quite simply that something — in this case, the match — is finished’.
