Kiambu is badly in need of good leadership, not one that favours only alcoholics, a group of Kiambu youth has told the Senate. Speaking in Kiambu town on Thursday, the youth said politics should not cloud Governor Ferdinand Waititu’s impeachment hearing. The Senate is investigating Waititu who was impeached by the county assembly in December. He is set to appear before a Senate plenary on Tuesday to answer to allegations of corruption and abuse of office. “We have suffered and have nothing to smile about since the installation of Governor Waititu to office," Peter Mwangi said. "The only bunch that benefitted was the alcoholics who were being paid not to drink. The rest of the youths who are not alcoholics are yet to benefit from the Waititu-led government.” The youth urged the Senate to critically look into the allegations as the fate of Kiambu lies in their hands. “We know that the Senate, especially the Jubilee outfit, is divided over the impeachment of Waititu. We urge the senators to put aside their differences and conduct the grilling with facts presented to them to determine the outcome, which should benefit Kiambu county as a whole and not an individual,” Mwangi said. Josephine Waithiru said residents have full confidence in the Senate plenary. “Kiambu has been in the limelight for all the wrong reasons,” she said. Patel Kirema praised the Senate for rejecting a committee of 11 senators set up to investigate, collect and collate the grounds under which Waititu was impeached. “Kiambu people have a chance to hear about the corruption allegations Waititu is facing through the Senate plenary rather than a committee that was rumoured to be biased,” he said. Makas Kamau, a member of a lobby group called Okoa Kiambu which petitioned the county assembly to impeach Waititu, said Kiambu should serve as a lesson to all counties. Edited by Josephine M. Mayuya
