@robertomollo3 Hundreds of learners and teachers of five schools in Ndhiwa, Homa Bay, on Tuesday failed to access their institutions after a connecting bridge was swept away by flash floods. The bridge collapsed and was swept away after River Riana burst its banks following heavy rains on Monday night. The Riana Bridge connects a number of villages in Kabuoch South and Kabuoch North wards in Ndhiwa constituency. The affected schools are Okota, Luanda, Ndira and Mariri primary and Luanda Mixed Secondary School. Some teachers said they lost two motorbikes while trying to cross the swollen river to Okota Primary School. “It’s unfortunate that the collapse of the bridge has disrupted learning in our schools and others. We hope the situation will come back to normal for learning to resume,” a teacher said. Residents of Luanda Kawuor and Luala villages, including boda boda riders, demanded that the bridge be repaired immediately. They said businesses were hurting. The riders led by Moses Owili said the rains also destroyed roads like Riat-Pala, Koguta-Luanda Kawuor and Luanda Kawuor-Magina. “We’re counting losses due to the collapsed of the bridge. The rains have also rendered our roads impassable,” Owili said. They asked the Homa Bay county government to reconstruct the bridge. Owili appealed to Ndhiwa MP Martin Owino to help. “Reconstructing the bridge would allow learning to resume and open up communication and transport in the area,” he said.  edited by p. obuya
