DCI detectives and police officers based at Kamukunji on Sunday raided a shop within Muoroto along Jogoo road and recovered a total of 515 assorted mobile phones. The sleuths were acting on information on notorious stolen mobile phone dealers in the city. Majority of the phones recovered were smartphones. Three suspects who could not give a proper account of all the phones in their possession were arrested in the swoop. "The trio will appear in court, will be charged with having in their possession suspected stolen property contrary to Sec 323 of the Penal Code and the recovered items presented as exhibits," DCI tweeted. Last October, police busted an electronic devises syndicate in Nairobi and recovered 262 mobile phones, computers and accessories. Seven suspects were arrested in swoops conducted by the Directorate of Criminal Investigations in Kayole and Central Business District on Saturday. The cops recovered 154 mobile phones, two laptops and one tablet from accessories shops on Mfangano and Ronald Ngala streets.
