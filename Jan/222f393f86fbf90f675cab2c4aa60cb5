Senior Anglican clerics have asked politicians not to hijack the Building Bridges Initiative process. They said the views of all Kenyans irrespective of their standing in society must be heard. Canterbury Archbishop Justin Welby and Anglican Church of Kenya Archbishop Jackson ole Sapit said the unity of the country is more important than scoring political goals. Welby said he had taken note of the BBI's objective of finding solutions to Kenyans problem. “Allow everyone to be heard in the process. It should not be mostly leaders bringing up an idea. This is a problem we face throughout the world. I find it easier to allow all shades of opinions," he said. The two spoke during a courtesy call on Deputy President William Ruto at his Harambee Annex office in Nairobi on Tuesday. Welby said he was fascinated by the report because it sets out to address social-economic problems. Addressing tribalism and creating a new culture and a new agenda for the country, he said, was good for the people. BBI is a good attempt to create a positive vision for Kenya, he added. Sapit said the document should not be used for political expediency. "If it becomes a political rallies' document we lose it. We should have a people-centred approach." He cautioned that there were signs of a deviation from the original course. “The church just wants to see the prosperity of the country and isn't taking sides on the matter,” he said. Ruto said all Kenyans should be allowed to participate and give their views to enrich the document. He asked politicians not to ignore views from Kenyans, adding that divergent views did not constitute opposition to the report. “There is a temptation to think that a different or contrary view is opposition. I believe accommodating alternative views allows an all-inclusive process that enriches the document,” the DP said. He advised against attempts to create political camps or 'us versus them' in the process. Edited by R.Wamochie
