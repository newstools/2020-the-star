Former world marathon record holder Wilson Kipsang has been provisionally suspended by the Athletes' Integrity Unit following an anti-doping rule violation. In a tweet, the AIU said, "The AIU confirms a provisional suspension against Wilson Kipsang Kiprotich of Kenya for whereabouts failures & tampering, both violations of the WorldAthletics Anti-Doping Rules". In their citation, AIU added that a Notice of Charge had been issued against the decorated 2:03:23 marathon for whereabouts failures in contravention of Article 2.4 and tampering or attempted tampering, a violation against Article 2.5. Article 2.4 says, "Any combination of three Missed Tests and/or Filing Failures, as defined in the International Standard for Testing and Investigations, within a twelve-month period by an Athlete in a Registered Testing Pool. Article 2.5 on Tampering or Attempted Tampering with any part of Doping Control cautions against Conduct which subverts the Doping Control process but which would not otherwise be included in the definition of Prohibited Methods. Tampering shall include, without limitation to intentionally interfering or attempting to interfere with a Doping Control official, providing fraudulent information to an Anti-Doping Organization, or intimidating or attempting to intimidate a potential witness. AIU adds that "Provisional Suspension imposed in a non-doping case does not in any way abrogate the presumption of innocence and it is not an early determination of guilt. Rather, it is an order made on a precautionary basis to safeguard the interests of the sport".
