Property worth millions of shillings was reduced to ashes following a fire tragedy on Naivasha's County Council Estate at the weekend. Residents watched helplessly as a storey building went up in flames, with the only fire engine for the town grounded after developing mechanical breakdown. The fire was caused by an electrical fault and it took over two hours to contain it. Nakuru has only two functioning engines. Following the crisis, leaders in the vast county have appealed to the county government to move with haste and fix the fire engine problem before more lives and property are lost. Naivasha MP Jane Kihara said the fire could have been contained if the engine was operational, adding that the county administration was fully to blame for the losses. She said her office had to seek assistance from Flamingo Farm, which sent in its engine to contain the inferno. “The county fire engine has been grounded for the last one month and in the period we have recorded several fire incidents,” she said. The county government, however, defended itself saying plans are underway to buy four more engines. Roads chief officer Daniel Muthinga said the Naivasha fire engine developed mechanical problems while fighting a previous fire incident in the town. “The Naivasha fire engine was responding to a fire incident in police line two weeks ago when its computerised system collapsed,” he said. He said the county had procured the malfunctioned spare parts from abroad adding that the engine will be up and running in the course of this week. "The county is seeking to partner with various organisations to address disasters like fires," he said. Muthinga defended the county response to the fire incident in Bahati PCEA School where one student died, adding that the crew arrived on time. “It’s sad that we lost one student to the fire but the county is committed to addressing any calamity as fast as possible and we have an able team and machinery,” he said.
