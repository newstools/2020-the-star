Bahati MP Kimani Ngunjiri has said the withdrawal of his security detail and police harassment will not intimidate him to silence. Speaking at the Nakuru Directorate of Criminal Investigations Headquarters on Monday after surrendering a hunting rifle and a pistol, the MP accused the government of witch-hunting leaders affiliated to the Deputy President William Ruto. "They can take their guns and their security men but we will not be cowed, we will say the truth about this country," he said. He claimed that the police fabricated an incitement case against him with the aim of stripping him off his guns. Ngunjiri wondered why he was being harassed for saying what was already in the media. On Monday, the outspoken legislator was summoned by the DCI and recorded a statement over his utterances on the evictions of the DP from his Mombasa Office. Ngunjiri is one of the government officials who was asked to surrender his weapons for his involvement in crime. Governors and MPs facing graft allegations will also lose their security detail following a directive by Inspector General of Police Hillary Mutyambai. The new directive means all Governors, MPs and any other leaders with state security who are facing criminal prosecution – graft related or otherwise – will have to seek alternative security and do without firearms.
