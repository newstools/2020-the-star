About 320 illegal guns and 1,011 rounds of ammunition have been surrendered by residents in Eastern region during a three-month amnesty. Most of the 318 arms have been returned in Isiolo and Marsabit since the government offered a three-month amnesty that began in early October. Regional Commissioner Isaiah Nakoru told the press on Thursday that residents have been repentant and cooperated with security agencies. He praised residents for surrendering the arms, saying they were being used to kill and steal livestock, fuelling conflict among communities. Nakoru said it was against the law for residents to continue possessing firearms without government permission. He said the government we will continue to engage residents in meetings together with the chiefs to educate them on the need to surrender the firearms. The administrator assured residents that the government will provide them with enough security and said there is no need to have firearms to protect themselves. The government started voluntary disarmament, especially in Marsabit and Isiolo counties. The commissioner called on residents to keep surrendering the weapons warning that the government will use force once the amnesty period elapses. Edited by R.Wamochie
