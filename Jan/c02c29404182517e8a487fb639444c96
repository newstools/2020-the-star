Kenya national men’s handball team have found the going tough at the ongoing Africa Championships-cum-Tokyo Olympics qualifiers in Tunis, Tunisia. The side will play their last fixture against a yet to be determined team on Saturday to establish who finishes 15th and 16th (last) in the competitions. This will go down as Kenya's worst feat at the continental arena. This is the team's third appearance at the championships and their best performance was a ninth place finish in 2004. In 2016, Kenya placed 12th. Despite Kenya being beaten through-and-through in all their four played matches, Kenya Handball Federation’s technical director Charles Omondi commends the lineup for good performance. Omondi said: “The team has played well except for the normal handball mistakes mostly caused by stage fright. I say well in terms technical performance.” “But also important the walk over messed our mission a great deal,” added Omondi. Under the tutelage of Peter Mwathi and his assistant Victor Siero, Kenya was outmuscled by Nigeria who led from start to end. The West Africans cruised to a 15-6 advantage at the breather and went on to clobber Kenya 14-30 on Wednesday to farther push them to the bottom of the table. The team’s outing to North Africa was marred by poor preparations and travel arrangements mishaps. These logistical hiccups saw the national outfit arriving late in Tunis, missing their first fixture against the Democratic Republic of Congo attracting a walkover. In their other preliminary duels, Mwathi’s charges surrendered 44-19 to Egypt and Guinea edged them 26-17 placing them at the bottom of Group ‘A.’ Having been relegated to the placement competitions, Kenya came very close to garnering their first win in the showpiece Libya condemned the East Africans to 27-26 defeat.
