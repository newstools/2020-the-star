Bungoma-based  Football Kenya Federation Division Two (Zone A) outfit Bungoma All-Stars have withdrawn from the league, citing financial constraints. Bungoma All-stars chief executive officer, Beckham Kombo, revealed this has hampered the day-to-day running of the club. “It has become difficult for us to provide transport, pay allowances and salary for players players and the technical team. We know it is very tough for the players and the fans but we had to take this painful action," he added. “As management, we have talked to the players and some have already started negotiating with other teams. We are also planning a meeting this weekend to chart the way forward." “The committee is also working on a proposal to be forwarded to the County government of Bungoma in a bid to find ways on how we can partner with them in promoting soccer in the region,” said Kombo. FKF Western branch secretary, Kelvin Mwangu regretted the move, saying the team was picking up well and called upon the stakeholders in the region to step up and support the club. Mwangu also revealed that the federation will try to assist clubs to put good structures in place that can make them sustainable and also easily attract sponsorship. Bungoma All-Stars, who were promoted to the fourth tier league two seasons ago, have remained impressive and currently hold position six with 28 points out of 16 matches.
