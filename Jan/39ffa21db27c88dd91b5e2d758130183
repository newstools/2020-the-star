Evergreen striker Ezekiel Odera is relishing a productive stay in the National Super League after he scoring his first goal on return to Nairobi City Stars. Odera, who was with the Kawangware outfit for two seasons — 2016 and 2017 — before leaving for AFC Leopards, scored his first goal in the NSL in City Stars 2-0 win over Vihiga Bullets last Saturday. “It's a move I always saw myself making at this point in time because City Stars have the quality of players just like those in the Premier League. It will be historic for me to be part of the team that helps them to gain promotion. It is a club that is being run professionally and I want to be part of the success this year and beyond,” said Odera. The striker will add firepower to the second tier highflyers as they seek a return to the topflight league. City Stars also brought in more experience into the side with Azizi  Okaka (Sony Sugar) and Jacob Osano (Nairobi Stima) also putting pen to paper. At the same time, the club confirmed the departure of defender Nahashon Thiongo and midfielder Cornelius Mwangi. City Stars face fellow promotion hopefuls Vihiga United in a mouthwatering clash at the Mumias Complex on Sunday. Sanjin Alagic's men will be seeking to extend their lead at the top of the NSL standings.
