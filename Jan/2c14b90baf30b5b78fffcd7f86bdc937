Three families survived after boulders crashed into their mud houses on Wednesday evening. No injuries were reported. Heavy rains have caused landslides and claimed lives in Nyandarua county Boulders rolled down a hill and struck houses in Kenton village, Kinangop. The village at the bottom of a hill has been in existence since the colonial period. It has 230 households. Resident Wangari Njoroge said on Thursday the government has been promising that residents would be moved to a safer place but it hasn't happened. Njoroge said she was in the kitchen with her children when they heard a sound rumbling sound getting louder and louder. “My daughter went to check and said a boulder was rolling towards our house. We ran out screaming. It hit our main house and crashed into the kitchen," she said. Gathu Gitonga was in the toilet when he heard the rumbling and screams. He hid behind a bush and tried to see what was happening. “The village had panicked before we could establish why our neighbours were screaming. When the screaming stopped I came out and saw a huge boulder just outside my house," he said. Boulders rolling downhill and hitting houses have been common and sometimes people have died, Gitonga said. Njeri Kimani had just arrived home and was lighting a fire to prepare tea when her house was hit. "The boulder missed my head by inches," she said. “Now I am shivering due to hunger as I did not eat or drink anything. The government should help. We elected leaders and they should not watch as we perish here." Nyandarua county commissioner Boaz Cherutich told the Star nobody was injured and the only one house was slightly damaged. He said a disaster management team has been dispatched to help residents. “We are also urging people to move to safer grounds where they will not be affected by landslides," he said on the phone.
