The al Shabaab attack on the KDF/USA military installation in Lamu was not an act of desperation. It opens a new page on the militant group's coordinated attacks in Kenya. Al Shabaab pulled a fast one on Kenya. The fact that the attackers were able to successfully target an installation that is supposed to be one of the most defended military installations in the country shows how significant that attack was. Whether it is established that the attack was triggered by a suicide bomber or an improvised explosive device, it is a major blow to Kenya's efforts in the war on al Shabaab. That the militants were able to cross over into the country, launch an attack on such an installation, destroy military aircraft and walk away without a trace is an indication that al Shabaab is here with us. This shows that since Kenya went into Somalia under Linda Nchi, the country has become more unsafe. The ambush was not your ordinary al Shabaab attack. This was not an attack on a hotel or mall in Nairobi, or any other building in East Africa. This was an offensive on an installation that is supposed to be highly defended. This is an attack of great significance for the al Shabaab militants. It is an attack that signifies al Shabaab's resurgence as a terror group within the region. This attack definitely took several months to plan and execute. The fact that the base was a joint KDF/USA installation funded by the United States makes the target very significant and the successful attack a first for the militants. The militants took their time to mobilise resources, assemble equipment and conduct their intelligence survey before launching the attack. This attack will definitely have an effect on Kenya. It coincides with the DusitD2 attack in Nairobi on January 15-16 last year and the El Adde attack on the Kenya military in Somalia on January 15, 2016. The attack has nothing to do with the Iran-USA problem. That can happen maybe in future in shops and malls in Nairobi.
