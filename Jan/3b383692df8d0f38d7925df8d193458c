A high school class teacher has denied stealing Sh9,600 KCSE registration fees from a student, causing him to miss the exams. Benard Owino was released on a Sh Sh50,000 bond and a cash bail of Sh30,000 by Kibera senior resident magistrate Faith Mutuku. Court documents say Owino obtained the cash from the student's parent on diverse dates between March and October last year. The court papers say that the student joined Sudi Academy in September 2018 while in Form 3 and in 2019 he was in Form 4. The deputy head teacher, a witness in the case, and the accused person ordered all the Form 4s to bring KCSE registration documents including a birth certificate and KCPE certificate and pay Sh4,500 each, the police documents show. When the student brought the documents and paid the amount the class teacher failed to issue him with payment receipts. In second term, the accused person called all the students in a common classroom and told them that the head teacher had a word for them. When the examination time arrived, the student was shocked when he was informed that he had not been registered. A complaint was lodged with the police leading to the arrest of the teacher. The case will be heard on January 28.
