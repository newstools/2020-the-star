Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria has threatened legal action against people he claims keep linking him to the murder of former IEBC ICT manager Chris Msando. Msando was murdered on July 28, 2018 — nine days before the hotly contested August 8 polls — in what threatened to cripple the election. Kuria on Monday said he played his role as a responsible leader when he reported about Msando's abandoned vehicle to Kasarani police station. He did not state whom he would sue. The Jubilee MP, who was among the first at the scene where Msando's vehicle was found, said two women called to inform him of the abandoned vehicle. He said he was called while at a party function in Murang'a county together with area Woman Representative Sabina Chege. Msando was responsible for the entire body of electoral data, including voter identification, verification, results transmission and the entire electronic tallying process. Days before his murder, he had promised that it would be impossible to manipulate the presidential vote. More to follow
