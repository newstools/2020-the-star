Poor relations between police and residents have been blamed for lack of cooperation and provision of intelligence, leading to persistent crime in Mombasa. Frere Town assistant county commissioner Henry Rop said the area has experienced calm because security agencies are on alert and have intensified patrols. "We held a meeting on how to enhance security in our areas early December and we agreed with the police to  cooperate in keeping confidentiality of crime cases with the residents," Rop told the Star on phone. The  meeting that was held at Sarajevo grounds in Frere Town ward involved different officials including the ward MCA Charles Kitula, the area OCPD, DCI, village elders and residents. Drug abuse among the youth was blamed for rampant crime. Among the security measures proposed during the meeting was relocation of the methadone clinic from Frere Town to the National Youth Service centre in Jomvu. "We want the government to help us in relocating the methadone clinic which is now propagating drugs and also affecting the students at Frere Town primary school," Rop said. Frere Town, which has one chief, will have a community policing centre to help enhance security.
