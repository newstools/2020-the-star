A Jubilee legislator has opposed a move by leaders in the party to join the ongoing BBI popularisation rallies, saying they are ODM leader Raila Odinga’s 2022 campaign meetings. Emurua Dikiir MP Johanna Ngeno, an ardent supporter of Deputy President William Ruto, said supporters of the DP have had enough humiliations and should not attend the BBI rallies, including the one scheduled for Saturday in Mombasa. He called it unwise for Ruto-allied politicians to attend the rally. Those planning to attend should join ODM, he said. "Akufukuzae hakuambii toka (A person who wants you out of her/his place will not tell you so," he said, implying that the signs are on the wall, hence Ruto supporters must act accordingly. “My advice to my group, especially Ruto’s supporters, is that we have been humiliated enough and Kenyans have seen and heard of the same, so I do not see any why we should attend." Ngeno said he will not attend BBI rallies planned by the Kielewke and ODM unless he reconsiders his stand to join the party and support Odinga as before when he was in the camp. The outspoken lawmaker asked the leaders supporting Ruto not to attend the rally but rather organise similar meetings with their supporters and come up with resolutions that will be handed over to the committee tasked to gather proposals. He claimed the rallies are not for the BBI as directed by President Uhuru Kenyatta but rather ODM functions that benefit the party and its leader alone.
