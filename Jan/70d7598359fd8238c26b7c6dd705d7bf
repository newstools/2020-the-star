The unwillingness of clubs to release players is the main reason why Premier League teams have not had a busy transfer period, according to Wazalendo coach Fidelis Kimanzi. Only 50 percent of the men’s clubs had submitted player registration forms by the January 19 deadline, according to information from Deputy Match and fixture secretary Moses Majiwa. Transfer activities have been extended until the end of the month but will attract a fine due the late registration. Kimanzi, whose team is yet to sign a player, said the investment of the club on players makes it hard for players to be granted their wish apart from a few exceptions. The financial hardships experienced by clubs is another stumbling block with about 90 percent of the teams either being self-sponsored or institution-based sides. The soft-spoken tactician, whose side squandered the chance of dethroning Butali of the title, last season said: “No club want to lose a player and players want to remain in their clubs. It is only clubs like Butali who can offer a financial package to players. Fees involved in the deal is also a major concern. The Sh50,000 or Sh100,000 requested by clubs is unaffordable but every player has a price,” he said, “We have identified the players to beef up our squad. The secretary-general is following with their clubs with a view to complete the deals,” said Kimanzi. Former champions Kenya Police said they will not recruit players while Butali Warriors have acquired the services of Greensharks striker Clayson Luvanda who also doubles up as the University of Nairobi women’s coach. Warriors coach Godfrey Wakachunga previously said defensive reinforcements are a priority to his side. The 2016 champions Strathmore University Gladiators completed their trials last week and will soon announce new signings. Greensharks who finished fourth last season is in the run to finalise on their deals.
