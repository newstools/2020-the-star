The High Court has dismissed an application by Kiambu MCAs seeking to be enjoined in the criminal proceedings facing Governor Ferdinand Waititu. The application had been filed by 12 MCAs and two men describing themselves as Speaker and Clerk Bunge Mashinani Kiambu chapter. Judge Onyiego said the people of Kiambu have a right to follow proceedings at all stages to be able to be undeterred in the progress of the case. "But if any evidence is left out by the prosecution, they will be able to intervene and seek production of such evidence in compliance with the Victims Protection Act," Onyiego said. The two men are members of an amorphous kind of organisation which is not a legal entity. "To allow such an organisation to step into the arena of litigation in a situation such as that of Waititu's case would be akin to opening a Pandora's box for anarchy and total misdirection in the criminal justice system," Meanwhile, Waititu has protested his impeachment and poked holes in the charges levelled against him by the county assembly. The governor, through his lawyers, on Wednesday said the impeachment process was flawed and pleaded with the Senate to throw out the case. Waititu said the MCAs did not follow procedure as stipulated in the County Government Act and Standing Orders in impeaching him. Specifically, the county boss claimed there was no requisite number of members in the house during his impeachment. “The Senate must consider the process that the motion went through in the county assembly. The assembly did not provide a list of members who voted in favour of the motion,” lawyer Charles Njenga said.
