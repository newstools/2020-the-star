The United States has banned Dar es Salaam's Regional Commissioner over human rights violations. US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo on Friday announced the ban of Paul Christian Makonda via Twitter. "Today we designated Dar es Salaam Regional Commissioner Paul Christian Makonda as ineligible to enter the U.S. for his involvement in gross violations of human rights. We are deeply concerned over deteriorating respect for human rights and rule of law in Tanzania," Pompeo tweeted. In October 2018, Makonda announced the formation of a surveillance team dedicated to hunting down gay people. However, the Tanzanian government led by President John Magufuli a month later distanced itself from the Dar commissioner saying that Makonda was “only airing his personal views.” The US ban comes only days after US President Donald Trump said he was planning to add Tanzania to the travel ban list. The other countries were Nigeria, Sudan and Eritrea. The ban will not be a blanket one for all the listed countries but will be on specific types of visas, such as business or visitor visas.
