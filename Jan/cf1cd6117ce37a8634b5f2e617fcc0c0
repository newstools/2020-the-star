The government has set aside Sh750 million for drilling boreholes along the borders of counties prone to cattle rustling to help unite residents. The boreholes will be drilled in Marsabit, Turkana and West Pokot counties. Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa said the boreholes are part of a peace agreement that was signed last year in Uganda to help set up projects in counties that are prone to cattle rustling. “The projects are part of cross-border peace projects that were signed by the President and Ugandan President to help unite conflicting communities,” he said. Eugene said they had started implementing the projects and hope that once done, they will help unite communities, since residents will be sharing available resources. The CS said Sh250 million had been allocated for boreholes in West Pokot county. Eugene said the government plans to work with various economic blocs from the affected areas to ensure the regions have long-lasting peace. “Creation of water projects is a short term solution, but we are going to partner with economic blocs to ensure the counties have sustainable peace,” he said. He said in North Rift, the government will work with the North Rift Economic Bloc (Noreb) to ensure implementation of projects that will help develop the region and urge residents to abandon cattle rustling. He said most economic blocs had set up climate change initiatives that would help unite communities. “Most of the counties had signed up MoUs on how to deal with effects of climate change and as a government, we are going to work with them to ensure that vital projects are implemented to help reduce fights related to sharing of resources,” the CS said.
