Public universities should be compelled to offer free meals to students, according to Murang’a Governor Mwangi wa Iria. The governor said many students complain that they starve in universities as they cannot afford to buy food for all their meals. He said most of the students are from poor backgrounds and go for days without food compared to their well-off counterparts. Wa Iria said it was unfair to ask university students to cost-share foods yet other government learning institutions feed their students. He gave the example of the National Youth Service and police training colleges which adequately feed their students. “Even prisoners are fed several times in a day and they do not pay or work for it. Why are we starving our future doctors and engineers?” he asked. The governor said there should be a policy demanding that every student gets at least two standard meals daily. “I will push this agenda through my Civic Renewal Party whose slogan is Usawa Kwa Wote,” wa Iria said, adding that such issues should be part of the on-going debates on constitutional review. The governor spoke in his office during a meeting with Murang’a University of Technology managers on Wednesday. He pledged to construct a communal swimming pool near the institution to serve both students and locals.
