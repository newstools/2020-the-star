About 300 people among them tourists escaped death by a whisker early Thursday as the muddy waters of River Talek coursed through camps and lodges at the world-famous Maasai Mara Game Reserve. The river burst its banks at 4am following heavy rains upstream. The workers and tourists were woken by a roaring sound and before they realised what was happening water was gushing into lodges, tents and camps. Edward Musukut said quick decision to evacuate by the management, tourists and workers saved the day. Everybody scrambled to higher grounds with whatever they could carry from tents and staff houses in five camps and lodges. A few people were perched on rooftops and trees and only came down when the sun rose and the flooding had subsided. The rains had started at 8pm on Wednesday. All the tourists and locals were accounted for. The visitors were taken to nearby camps and hotels. The damage was estimated to be in millions of shillings as also lost as some of the structures were beyond repair. Talek road was impassable and motorists were forced to use a longer route through Sekenani gate to reach Narok town. On Tuesday a worker at Oloshaiki camp was electrocuted after floodwaters destroyed an electricity cable. Narok County Police Commander John Kizito Mutoro urged Narok residents to be alert for floods and landslides. He asked themÂ to move to safer grounds.
