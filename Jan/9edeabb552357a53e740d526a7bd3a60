Rwanda-based forward Mike Makiadi has joined the national team camp ahead of next week’s Afro-basket pre-qualifiers in Nairobi. Coach Cliff Owuor yesterday said Makiadi, who turns out for Rwandese champions Patriots, looked extremely good in training. “Makiadi has joined the side and this is good for our training. We are now awaiting the arrival of USA-based Robert Nyakundi to report today,” he said. Other than Nyakundi, the other diaspora player who is expected for the January 14-18 championship is Tunisia-based centre Bush Wamukota. Owuor said he will take a critical look at the boys during a friendly match he has organised against selected Premier League players. “I have arranged for a friendly match that should help me take a keen observation of the players before I name the final squad,” Owuor said. Team captain Griffin Ligare pointed out that the absence of sharp shooter Tyler Ongwae will open doors for other players to shine. The Danish-based shooting star has been ruled out of the qualifiers set to tip off on Tuesday due to an injury. “We will definitely miss Tyler’s play-making ability, understanding and execution of the game. But again, this is a chance for someone else to step up,” noted Ligare. Ongwae was Kenya’s best player in the inaugural African Championship in Mali. His exploits saw him bag the Most Valuable Player award. Ligare said despite the absence of zonal power house Egypt, Rwanda and Uganda, they will not take any chances against the rest of the teams. “Even without these three teams, it will not be easy. We will take every game seriously and play to qualify,” he said. The winning side in the January 14-18 tournament at Nyayo Stadium gymnasium will book a ticket to the next round of the competition. Angola, Senegal and Mozambique are the teams in waiting should Kenya pass the test.
