Marsabit County Government has disbursed bursary cheques for Sh40 million to 460 beneficiaries. The number includes all the 247 beneficiaries from last year as well as this year's 221 successful applicants. The cash prizes were also given to individual teachers and schools that have achieved pre-targets based on Academic Challenge Award criteria. While presiding over disbursement of funds, MarsabitÂ  Governor Mohamud Ali noted that the fund promotes enhanced access to education and helps in retaining students from poor background in school. "We have chosen to invest in our county's future through investing in education," he said. Governor Ali revealed that despite the advice he received from others to invest in physical structures, he opted that the best place for a leader to seek visibility is not on the streets but in people's heart. "I receive advice from some of our people that survival in politics depends on visibility in terms of the number of buildings and physical structures constructed in every town and villages," he said. He appealed to all beneficiaries to work extra hard so that they will be considered in future to further their studies. He advised those missing a chance in university to join technical training institutions, which are free of charge. The governor warned county staff against being lazy in service delivery and instructed county executive members to visit all the 20 wards in the county at least four times in a year to check on the development projects. Marsabit Senator Eng. Godana Hargura praised the county government for assisting students from poor family backgrounds. He advised parents to take their children to school saying denying children education causes a lot of social problems. "Parents have a major obligation to ensure every child gets the best education to help brighten their future lives and to also deal with the poverty associated with lack of education," he advised.
