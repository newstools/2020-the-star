ODM party leader Raila Odinga has said the Building Bridges Initiative is the only way to take Kenyans to the 'promised land'. "BBI is the only bridge to take us to Canaan," he said. The ODM leader spoke in Kisii on Friday during the first BBI consultative forum that brought together top politicians. Raila added that the country will be united by the BBI that was borne out of the handashake between him and President Uhuru Kenyatta on March 9, 2018. Raila said that there will be be more consultative forums across the country to educate locals about what the BBI report contains. Interior CS Fred Matiang'i lauded Raila and Uhuru for the unity in the country. Matiang'i urged Nyanza leaders to remain united. "This is the first time we are sitting as the people from Nyanza region to engage in one direction," Matiang'i said. He further said that the "wisdom of BBI is in Raila and President Uhuru Kenyatta". The CS called upon the MCAs to organise consultative forums in the wards to engage locals on BBI. "Every MCA should hold a congregation in villages to discuss the BBI report at the grassroots," Matiang'i said. Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa said devolution will be enhanced through the BBI report. Siaya Senator James Orengo said there is a possibility of a referendum before June. "It is possible to have a referendum within 90 days from today," Orengo said.
