National Olympic Committee of Kenya (NOCK) has congratulated Joe Okudo following his appointment as the new Principal Secretary in the Ministry of Sports. Okudo’s appointment comes at a crucial time when the country is preparing for   Tokyo Olympics slated for between July 24 and August 9 in Japan. In a statement, acting secretary general, Francis Mutuku, said Nock hopes to continue its good relationship with the Ministry of Sports as the new PS takes charge. "We remain committed to ensure more disciplines qualify for the Summer Games as well as provide adequate preparations for our athletes for the sports carnival. “Even with the changes, we are looking forward to continue working with the ministry during the qualifying phase. We want to churn out the road-map towards staging a successful campaign for Team Kenya at the Olympics,” said Mutuku. However, Mutuku said Nock remains grateful to outgoing PS for sports Ambassador Kirimi Kaberia for his support during the qualifying phase gone by. Under Kaberia's watch, Kenya qualified three team sports under his watch including rugby sevens (men and women) last year and women’s volleyball  last week. He said Kaberia has played a leading role in laying the ground for the Olympic Games and hope the new Ps will pick from where he has left. “Kaberia has provided government support in putting together Team Kenya for Tokyo 2020. We congratulate him on his appointment as the Principal Secretary in the Ministry of Mining and wish him all the best. We also hope and trust he will  continuing serving as sports ambassador!” intimated Mutuku.
