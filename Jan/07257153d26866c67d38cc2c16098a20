Kiss FM presenter Kamene Goro says Gengetone kids should be embraced rather than the negative criticism they are receiving. She said on the Morning Kiss yesterday, “I woke up to find hate against Gengetone. Just because they are speaking another language, are you going to say it is wrong just because you have made it and you think you are on a high horse you are going to call them out?” She added that just because a section of people don't like their language does not mean it is wrong. “What really is your problem with Gengetone? Old musicians want to come and bash the new generation. People are calling me out because I supported the young artistes with our recent release, 'Nyoka Ya Shaba'," she said. "Back then when I was starting this career, so many Kenyan artistes came forth, claiming DJ Pinye was blocking them out from airplay. The likes of Khaligraph Jones, DNA and now some of these people are bashing Gengetone.” This comes days after she released the song 'Nyoka Ya Shaba' featuring Exray, Magix Enga, Timmy  Tdat, Jua Cali, Kristoff and Harry Craze.
