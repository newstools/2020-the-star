MaryaPrude Raburu, Willis Raburu's wife, has shared on Instagram how bitter she is with God. She wrote, "Everyone is so quick to tell me about God. What they don't know is that every way I knew Him was tested and He didn't prove himself." Adding, "So as they say you should know God for yourself, I now can say I don't know Him. And I don't think I want to know Him cause He left me when I needed him the most." She shared this after fans found out that the couple had lost a child.
