Vihiga United are pulling all stops to ensure they are well equipped to battle for promotion when the National Super League second leg starts this weekend after the holiday break. Team Manager James Musasia said they are finalising on the acquisition of several new players to pave way for the release of those considered surplus to requirements. “We are just doing the finishing touches on the recruitments front. It’s a delicate situation particularly at this time of the season. We will therefore not give details on the players we will register until due diligence is done and proper documentation given to confirm officially that one is our player,” Musasia remarked. Musasia’s caution is understandable given the recent trend of players signing pre-contracts with clubs but leaving whenever a better offer has come up. The Vihiga TM confirmed that so far only former international Andrew Murunga has officially left the club. “We expect a few players to leave latest by the end of next week when we confirm our squad for the second leg. So far, though, Murunga is the one who has left us but it is a void we expect to ably fill,” said Musasia. Murunga, who in his prime featured for Harambee Stars during the reign of Adel Amrouche has reportedly joined NSL rivals Ushuru. Vihiga are third place in the second division with 35 points. They face fifth placed Migori Youth this weekend at the Green Stadium in Awendo. Dominant team, Nairobi City Stars, are set to encounter Shabana at the Gusii Stadium on Saturday, in a bid to maintain their lead in the NSL standings.
