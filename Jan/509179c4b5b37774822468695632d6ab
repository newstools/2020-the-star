A 78 year old German tourist was found dead under unclear circumstances on Tuesday afternoon at his hotel room in Malindi town. Deterring Herman ,78, had reportedly went to sleep with his girlfriend on Monday night after drinking and chewing miraa up to 1 am Tuesday. "We are treating the girlfriend as a key suspect in the murder case as she escaped and is still on the run up to now," Malindi OCPD Vitalis Otieno told journalists. Otieno said they suspect that Herman was murdered and there must have been a scuffle at the scene. "This is because he had injuries on the head and stomach and there was also blood all over. Otieno said hotel staffers had to use a spare key to enter the room after the door was locked from outside. HOW IT HAPPENED Staffers at the cottage told the Star that they went to check Herman's room after he failed to come out in the morning only to find blood stain through the window. The manager of the Moriema cottages Kelly Kazungu said they found the body lying in a pool of blood with severe cuts all over the body. Kazungu said the deceased rented the hotel for two months and paid monthly. "..so most of the time he used to have his own keys. On that day, Herman drunk with his girlfriend up to 1 am when they retired to bed," he said. Upon returning to the hotel on Tuesday evening, Kazungu says he was briefed about the disappearance of Herman. "They said that Herman had not been seen and his door was locked. I used a binding wire to peep through the window and saw blood stains, I went to the police station and reported the matter . I was given police officers who accompanied me to the hotel," he said. He said the couples stayed together and never showed any signs of disagreements. Police who sought anonymity at the scene said the murderer had used a machete as knives in the room showed no sign of blood.
