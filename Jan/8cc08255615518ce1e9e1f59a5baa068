The signing of Tony Shiveka, Dan Obonyo and Boniface Dombi will make Wazalendo more competitive ahead of the Kenya Hockey Union Premier League season next month, coach Fidelis Kimanzi has said. Kimanzi observed that Shiveka (goalkeeper), Obonyo (defender) and Ndombi (midfielder) bring energy and desire to the already talented squad as the South 'B'-based side, last year's runners up, plot big this season. Shiveka and Obonyo arrived from Super League side Multimedia University and Ndombi from Parklands who were relegated to the second tier. Kimanzi said the trio will help the club achieve their ambitions, having watched them previously. "They are young guys who are ready to learn with much to offer to the team. They have proved a handful in their teams. They not only boost our bench power but also increase competition for places," said Kimanzi,Â  who also doubles up as Wazaledo Masters player. "We look forward to integrating them to the side with the view of developing them to international standards." "Winning the title is secondary for us but we will try to push for it. We want to see our players grow. Wazalendo is now a stronger team than we had last season. The defence and midfield were the only areas we needed new faces because the attack has quality. I am happy with our preparations as we look forward to a productive season." Wazalendo dropped points from the winning position and failed to break down defensive opponents. They also lost four times and Kimanzi has called for a tough mentality from all his players.
