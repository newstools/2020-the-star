The recruitment of young players, coupled with the commitment of experienced regulars will give Western Jaguars a competitive edge in the new season, coach Michael Malungu has said. Jaguars have acquired the services of forward Job Wandera, midfielders Dan Wafula and Keith Wemali as well as utility player Joshua Tatua from Musingu High School. Two more new players are expected to join from Kakamega High School while the duo of Dan Kuya and Gerald Simiyu has been released. The recruits are mostly 17 years old with Malungu observing that their policy of recruiting young players is becoming the norm amongst Premier League sides. "We are happy to give top tier clubs a challenge and quite a number are going for untapped talent. They have seen it works for us and they also want to give it a try," said Malungu. He revealed that the Kakamega-based side will fight for the title even though a top-three finish will also be welcome after finishing fifth last season. Malungu, who guided Team Kenya to the 2018 Youth Olympic in Argentina, was confident that with all his players now available, the youthful side is ready to rumble. "Our focus is on the Premier League title but if things do not go our way, finishing third will be a relief. That was our target last season but we fell short. The difference between us and Wazalendo, who were runners up was small and therefore we are in a position to close it this time," remarked Malungu, who was the team manager when Kenya won a bronze medal at the 2018 Africa Youth Games in Algeria. Jaguars won only three of their nine away matches, a worrying statistic for Malungu, who feels the quest for the title hinges on away form. Jaguars kept only two clean sheets on their travels, beating Strathmore Gladiators 2-0 and a goalless draw with USIU.
