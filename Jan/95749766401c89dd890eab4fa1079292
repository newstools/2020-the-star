The Kenya Tea Development Agency has set aside Sh30 million to educate 480 students this year. Ninety of these students will be joining form one in various secondary schools having performed well in the 2019 Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE) while the rest are continuing students who will be proceeding to their next classes. KTDA Foundation Manager Sudi Matara commended the students for having excelled in the national exams and assured them that the Foundation would continue to fully cater for their education. “High school enrolment for students in Kenya is still hampered by the high cost with parents incurring high entry costs for their children. The Foundation aims to bridge this gap to ensure that bright needy students, especially from tea growing areas are enrolled and retained in school”, he said. KTDA Foundation through the KTDA National Tea Scholarship programme has spent over Sh134 million in the last eight years to support needy students through secondary school education. The money has gone into paying the students' school fees and upkeep during the four years of secondary school education.
