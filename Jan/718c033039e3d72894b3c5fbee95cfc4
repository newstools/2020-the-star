Swimming stakeholders have poked holes in the recent directive to have the elections held on February 22. The Kenya Parents Swimming Association (KEPSA), alongside the coaches, noted that if the elections are not free and fair, they could be annulled in a court of law. World governing body,  FINA, have given the country  a deadline for February 29 or face a ban from international events like the Olympics, World championships and continental events. The country is currently under suspension until the polls are held. According to the stakeholders,  world governing body, FINA are yet to approve the Constitution after receiving it late last year and  have noted indicated when it will be ready for approval. The world governing body has also got to approve the list of candidates who are going to vie for the various positions and must pass the integrity and credibility test. Eight counties are expected to take part in the elections but the stakeholders want to know which counties have met requirements of the Sports Act. Stakeholders have raised issues to do with counties legibility to vote, membership register and the availability of the constitution. Another bone of contention are the finances with a forensic audit yet to carried out. A source asked why to the Interim Management Committee (IMC) are in a hurry to do elections without following due process to ensure is free and fair without any controversy. "If we go ahead with the elections  without following the due process, I  can guarantee you it  will be challenged in court and we will go back to the drawing board," said the source.  Kenya Swimming Federation last held their elections in 2014. KSF interim chairman Patrick Muyah said due process will be followed and the elections will be free and fair.  “ We are doing everything within our power to ensure  the exercise is credible during the next month's polls," he added.
