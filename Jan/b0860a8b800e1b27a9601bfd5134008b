Wajir Governor Mohamed Abdi said on Saturday his administration will continue collaborating with like-minded partners to help empower local youth. Abdi said both the county and national governments cannot afford to ignore the youth who form the majority of the population. He was speaking as he met a team from Centum Investments Limited that is driving the AJIRY Programme to empowers youth with needed skills to help them compete globally. “Kenya is a very youthful country and about 80 per cent of the population is below 35 years. Unemployment amongst youth continues to rise. So both levels of government and NGOs must come up with ways to address the problem, which if not well managed, is a ticking time bomb. Abdi said that devolution has helped a lot employing hundreds of youth in the counties , helping them acquire skills by setting up technical institutes and revamping those that had collapsed. Abdi, accompanied by Deputy Governor Ahmed Mukhtar, said that poverty and unemployment have made it easy for terror groups to lure youth into joining terror cells with the promise of good returns. “Being close to Somalia, our region has had its fair share of challenges, especially security. We are constantly faced with the threat of the enemy who not only wants to kill but also to recruit our own to join their ranks. We need to come up with workable solutions to arrest the situation,” he said. The governor said his aim is to improve the lives of the community and he said the programme will help greatly in achieving the agenda. The county is one of 10 counties for roll-out of the pilot skills program funded by Master Card Foundation. You will be trained in cyber-security, learn to start their own businesses and search for other opportunities. The governor urged the youth to take advantage of the team's visit, saying it will provide great opportunities to bridge the unemployment gap. (Edited by V. Graham)
