Gospel singer Size 8 is teaching fans the journey to a fruitful life through social media. She posted, "Running the race of life is not easy and if you want to achieve or enjoy something, endurance (long suffering) is required. Losers quit, winners persevere!" Adding, "Longer suffering is a fruit of the Holy Spirit. Tell the Holy Spirit to help you stick to it and not let go till you get the promises of God. For you have need of patient endurance [to bear up under difficult circumstances without compromising], so that when you have carried out the will of God, you may receive and enjoy to the full what is promised." The Mateke hitmaker had a rough pregnancy, with complications that she and her hubby DJ Mo spoke about on social media. She later became pregnant again in 2019 and gave birth to a baby boy, Sammy Muraya.
