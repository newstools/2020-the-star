Construction works at the historic Bukhungu Stadium has suffered a major blow after the budget was sliced by Sh100m, according to the Kakamega County supplementary budget for the 2019/2020 financial year. Initially, this phase, the second, was budgeted at Sh700m but only Sh600m was approved by the Kakamega County Assembly last week. The phase is set to be completed by 2022. The Assembly recommended that the slashed amount be reallocated to the county shelter improvement, development of children policy, youth policy and gender policy as well as boda boda programme. Hon. Samuel Limisi, a member of the sports committee in the assembly, argued that the amount allocated to the facility’s second phase was too much and should be reduced further, considering that the initial plan for the project was redesigned after a land dispute bordering the stadium. “As a committee, we feel the process should be suspended until a court case challenging the ownership of part of the construction site is heard and determined,” said Limisi. “I am also appealing to the county government to consider renovating other playfields in Kakamega.” Kakamega Homeboyz team manager Boniface Imbenzi is optimistic that Bukhungu Stadium will be completed and converted into an international facility. Kakamega County Minister of Sports, Tourism and Culture, Kundu Makhanu could not comment on the development. The addition of Sh600m sends the budget for the rehabilitation of the facility to Sh1.1bn.
