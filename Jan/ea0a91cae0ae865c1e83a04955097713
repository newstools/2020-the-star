  A fisherman died after he was attacked by a hippopotamus in Lake Naivasha, bringing to three the number of fisherfolks killed this month. The victim died at the Naivasha Subcounty Hospital where he was rushed while in critical condition. Two days ago, a buffalo attacked two workers from a private farm in Kongoni and killed a veterinary officer and leaving the other with serious injuries. Witnesses said the latest victim was among a group of illegal fishermen who were setting their nets when the hippo attacked. They said the hippos around the lake have become violent. “The hippo attacked the victim in the waters and we managed to drag him from its jaws and rushed him to hospital,”  the witness said. The boat operator who requested anonymity said the victim had been seriously injured and had bled a lot before he arrived at the hospital. Lake Naivasha Boat Owners Association chairman David Kilo expressed concern with the killings. He attributed the deaths to an increase in the number of hippos and illegal fishermen. “The number of illegal fishermen outnumbers the licensed ones and this is a major concern for the lake’s users,” Kilo said. Earlier, the chairman Friends of Lake Naivasha Francis Muthui said the only solution was culling the hippos. “The number of hippos around the lake has in the last five years tripled raiding nearby farms and attacking fishermen,” Muthui said. He said the situation had been worsened by the closure of wildlife corridors and fencing of riparian land where the animals feed.  Edited by R.Wamochie
