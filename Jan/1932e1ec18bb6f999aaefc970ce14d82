Belgium-based Kenyan Afropop singer Ms Sunshine has released 'Kassa money' featuring Juliet Ochieng, a renowned beauty queen. Kassa Money is a manifesto for the hustle in 2020. Through the song, the artistes want to encourage go-getters not to lose hope but to keep on fighting and work towards achieving their dreams. The message is that all dreams are valid, no matter where you are from. The song is not only meant to inspire but prove that all things that we think of and work on are achievable. As Africans, this is evident by the number of artistes, producers and actors from foreign lands who are now being recognised on the world stage. Her popular singles include 'Riding Low Low' (2017) and 'Mama Africa' (2013), which have continued to bring new fans to her enthusiastic following.
