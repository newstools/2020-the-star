 Manchester United have been charged by the Football Association for failing ‘to ensure its players conducted themselves in an orderly fashion’ as they lost 2-0 at Liverpool on Sunday. The charge relates to an incident where United players confronted referee Craig Pawson after he had initially allowed a goal by Liverpool’s Roberto Firmino. The video assistant referee ruled out the goal for a foul by Virgil van Dijk on keeper David de Gea in the build-up. United have until tomorrow to respond. The incident, which happened in the 26th minute as Liverpool led 1-0, saw De Gea booked for his protests to Pawson. Meanwhile, United goalkeeper Sergio Romero is unhurt after crashing his car, the club have confirmed. Pictures were posted online of a badly damaged Lamborghini wedged under a crash barrier on the A6144 Carrington Spur Road on Monday morning. Greater Manchester Police confirmed a crash involving a Lamborghini happened at 10:00 GMT, but no-one was injured and there were no other cars involved. Romero, 32, was on the bench as the Red Devils lost 2-0 at Liverpool on Sunday. The crash occurred near to Manchester United’s training ground. As understudy to David de Gea, the Argentina international has made 53 appearances for United, mainly in cup competitions, since his move from Sampdoria in 2015.
