ODM party leader Raila Odinga on Monday wrote an emotional tribute to his late father Jaramogi Oginga Odinga. Monday, marked the 26th anniversary since the former vice-president passed away. Raila described his late father as a patriotic man who worked selflessly for his country. "26 years ago you took a journey from our beloved country never to return. Your patriotic and selfless actions remain engraved in the hearts of those who knew you and in the collective memory of the nation you helped build. Your memory remains a permanent presence in your absence," Raila said. Jaramogi died on January 20, 1994, as a result of a heart attack. Oginga was born in the village of Nyamira Kang'o, Siaya county to Mama Opondo Nyamagolo and Odinga Raila. Jaramogi played a key role when the country was struggling for independence. He is well remembered for the phrase "Not Yet Uhuru" which is the title of his autobiography written in the 1980s during his time under house arrest. The ODM party also idolised Jaramogi describing him as "the Father of Democracy" and a "luminary" in the struggle for the second liberation. Oginga was the first Vice President in Kenya, a position which he got after the country gained independence in 1963. He, however, resigned as VP in 1966 after disagreeing with the founding President Jomo Kenyatta. Oginga wanted the country to have close ties with the People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union, and other countries while Jomo Kenyatta was after the Western countries. In 1991 he co-founded and became the interim chairman of FORD. The formation of FORD triggered a chain of events that were to change Kenya's political landscape, culminating in ending KANU's 40 years in power – eight years after Odinga's death.
