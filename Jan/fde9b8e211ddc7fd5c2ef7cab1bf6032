Counties owe the Kenya Medical Supplies Authority Sh2.8 billion according to data from the authority. This is despite the government’s directive that all debts owed to suppliers be cleared by the devolved units. The data shows that by January 16, Nairobi topped the list with a debt of Sh353 million. The authority has, however, noted goodwill from the counties with some, like Nairobi, promising to clear the bills. Kilifi follows with the second-largest debt at Sh199.1 million, Kiambu (Sh141.6 million), Busia (Sh119.08 million) and Vihiga at Sh114.4 million. “We have a service level agreement with counties and we have signed an MoU with them. We have a credit period of 45 days with them and some counties have been going beyond that period,” Kemsa CEO Jonah Manjari said. Turkana closes the list of counties with debts above 100 million, with data showing that the county owes the supplier Sh102.5 million. Others are Homa Bay with Sh92.06 million, Nakuru (Sh91.3 million), Bungoma (Sh84.9 million) and Kajiado with a debt of Sh84.1million. Makueni’s balance stands at Sh83.5, Narok at Sh83.2 million, Kakamega (Sh83.1 million), Murang’a (Sh81.5 million) and Kirinyaga (Sh70.8 million). Uasin Gishu’s bill stands at Sh69.4 million, Mandera's at Sh65.9 million, Bomet (Sh65.4million), Trans Nzoia (Sh64.6 million), Taita Taveta (Sh60.2 million), Nandi (Sh57.08 million) and Kitui at Sh52.9 million. Machakos, which is a UHC pilot county, owes the authority Sh48.7million while Kisumu and Nyeri have an outstanding bill of Sh77.5 million and Sh2.1 million respectively. “Our model was initially what we call supermarket model but as we go to the UHC rollout we will be doing a drawdown on what will be packaged for them as we draw the money that has already been given to Kemsa so there won’t be debts going forward.” Isiolo, also a UHC pilot county, has cleared its debt and has an outstanding debt of Sh380,000. According to the balances statement, Tharaka Nithi owes the national supplier Sh47.1million, Garissa (Sh44.8 million), Lamu (Sh44.7 million), Kericho(Sh36.9 million), Kisii (Sh36.4 million), Elgeyo Marakwet (Sh36.1 million), Samburu (Sh35.6 million) and Laikipia (Sh35.4million). Nyamira’s debt was Sh33.9 million, Siaya (Sh22.3 million), West Pokot (Sh18.4 million), Marsabit (Sh17.8 million), Embu (Sh15.8 million), Mombasa (Sh15.1 million) and Baringo at Sh11.9 million. “We have a robust way of debt management and collection within the institution and what we do is we collect as we serve the patients. The Kemsa Act provides that we supply to all the health facilities that are public and we cannot deny any county any drugs in the interest of the public because of issues to deal with debts,” the CEO said. Counties with balances below Sh10 million include Nyandarua, Meru and Wajir with Sh7.1 million, Sh4.1 million and Sh426, 480 respectively. Kwale and Tana River are the only counties with a clean bill of health, Kwale having a zero balance while Tana River has an overpayment of Sh7,349. Kemsa currently has stock worth Sh15 billion at the Embakasi depot that is intended for counties. Immediate former Health CS Sicily Kariuki last week ruled out the possibility of stopping supplies to counties over the huge debts but instead called on the governors to meet the authority for negotiations on possible payment terms.
