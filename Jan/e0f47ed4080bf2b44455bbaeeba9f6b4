Bidco United coach Anthony Akhulia has challenged his side to maintain the standards they have set in the National Super League after they beat Talanta 1-0 yesterday to continue their unblemished start to the second leg of Kenya's second-tier league. "This is the kind of performance that everyone connected to this club has been yearning for. To beat a team like Talanta with a very good squad and coach shows the players have the right mentality to challenge for bigger things. Our challenge now is to ensure we do not put our feet off the pedal," said Akhulia in the aftermath of the victory that kept them in second place with 45 points from  21 matches. Earlier at Camp Toyoyo, struggling Administration Police succumbed to  yet another defeat as they were beaten 3-1 by Ushuru. Dangerman Brian Yakhama, Luis Masika and captain Barrack Odhiambo were on target for James Omondi's side as they rose to third in the standings with 36 points from 21 matches. "It's a good feeling for us. We know what we want and where we want to be and this win takes us another step closer to our target," said Omondi.
