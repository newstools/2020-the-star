Six people have been confirmed dead after the matatu they were travelling in collided with a bus at Mida forest along the Malindi-Mombasa highway on Monday afternoon. Several others sustained injuries in the accident in which the driver of a matatu travelling from Mombasa lost control of his vehicle and rammed into the bus. The matatu driver died. None of the bus passengers died. Malindi base commander said those injured were taken to the Malindi Subcounty Hospital. "The bodies have been taken to Malindi hospital mortuary. We cannot know the number of those injured immediately as some were taken by well-wishers to different hospitals," he said. The base commander said it was raining when the accident occurred near a sharp bend and warned motorists to be careful along the highway. Ali Sharif Hussein, the driver of the Emirates bus with 60 passengers onboard, said he sustained slight injuries and blamed the matatu driver for the accident. Hussein said he saw the matatu from a distance and it was on the wrong lane. "I flashed my headlights to warn him but he didn't move," he said.
