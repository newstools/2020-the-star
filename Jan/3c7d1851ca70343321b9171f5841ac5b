Discovery Kenya road race returns to Eldoret next month after a four-year hiatus. The annual race that was held in Nyahururu as a half marathon for the last four years but will return to the streets of Eldoret as a 10km event. Race organiser David Letting said the event returns to the athletics-mad city due to public demand. “We had to succumb to public pressure and bring back the race to Eldoret,” said Letting. “Being an Olympic year, the race provides a great opportunity for distance runners, especially those angling for the 10,000m slots, to test their speed and endurance,” added Letting. The race had moved to Nyahururu as part of the commemorations for the late Samuel Wanjiru, who was the first Kenyan to win an Olympic marathon title. “This is a good move for runners as Rosa and Associati and Nike will be issuing good prizes for top runners to motivate them ahead of Olympic Games,” added Letting. He was speaking at the Eldoret Sports Club as they intensified preparations for the  29th edition of Discovery Kenya cross country set for this Sunday.
