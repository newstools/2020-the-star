Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko on Monday nominated Anne Mwenda as the deputy governor in what he said was to ensure continuity. This is following his being barred from office after being charged with misappropriation of Sh357 million. DPP Noordin Haji however dismissed the nomination, saying Sonko was violating his bail terms. Mwenda, who is currently the chief officer for disaster and acting chief officer of water at Nairobi county, was once a switchboard operator before moving on to the security industry to work as a supervisor. Who is Anne Mwenda? She was born on May 1, 1980. Mwenda sat her KCSE exam at Our Lady of Mercy High School in 1999. She holds a Bachelor of Science in criminology and Security Management from Dedan Kimathi University, which she was awarded in 2016. Mwenda also holds a diploma in criminology and security management from St Paul’s University, which she got in 2013. Work Experience Until her appointment to serve in the county government, Mwenda was the security supervisor in charge of quality control and training at the Kenya Airports Authority. She also served as a personal assistant at H Mugambi & Co Advocates. Mwenda has also worked as a switchboard operator at the Kenya College of Communications Technology. During her vetting before the county assembly committee on Culture, Mwenda said that she applied for a position because her work experience as a security supervisor would help her manage disaster in the capital city. Mwenda lost her husband Philip Njiru in an Athi River road accident last year. In November last year, Sonko appointed Mwenda to act as the Chief Officer of Water. Mwenda was among the county officials who were at Wilson Airport when  Sonko was flown to Nairobi after his arrest in Voi on December 6 last year.
