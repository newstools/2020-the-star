Wiper party leader Kalonzo Musyoka has said the current IEBC team, led by chairperson Wafula Chebukati,Â  would go home if the BBI report is implemented. "Mimi ninafurahi kwamba akina Chebukati wataenda nyumbani. Tuwapigie makofi ya kusema kwaheri Chebukati," Kalonzo said. This translates to, "I'm happy Chebukati and his team would go home. Let's give them a round of applause as we bid them farewell." The BBI report has recommended changes to the electoral commission, including its tenure in office. The report proposes to remove all the current commissioners from the office and establish a new team ahead of the 2022 polls. Kalonzo said the only way a federal system can stand is through free and fair elections. Speaking on Saturday during the BBI meeting in Mombasa, Kalonzo said that the current commission has brought more problems than solutions to the country. The changes to the commission are meant to enhance the capacity of IEBC in order to deliver free and fair elections. The IEBC is currently operating with the chairperson and two commissioners after four others resigned. Just days before the October 26, 2017 repeat election, commissioner Roselyn Akombe resigned and fled from the country, saying she had received death threats. Paul Kurgat and Margaret Mwachanya and vice chairperson Connie Maina resigned on April 16, 2018, saying they had no faith in the chairman.
