 @magatinews The 200-bed capacity Mother and Child Hospital is almost complete and will soon be opened to the public, Governor James Ongwae has said. Once operational, the facility is expected to boost healthcare services and decongest other hospitals. "The ultimate purpose is to offer advanced healthcare services to patients especially women and children who often have unique health challenges," Ongwae said. Ongwae said the Sh250 million project is part of the flagship legacy projects he is banking on. "My ultimate purpose is to leave an indelible mark in the provision of health services to our people." The facility has been annexed to the Kisii Teaching and Referral Hospital and will expand the bed capacity at the hospital to 900. “An efficient and high quality health care system that is accessible and equitable forms the basis of the need for such facilities in our region," Ongwae told the Star on Tuesday. “Our concept is to offer specialized services to pregnant mothers and children under one roof. This is definitely a milestone." An expansive doctors' plaza at the facility is already complete.  edited by p.o
