Title dark horses KCB have captured Bidco United custodian Daniel Odiwuor as they continue to position themselves for the second half of the Kenyan Premier League season. Bidco have, in return, signed Adisa Zamu from Mt. Kenya United, who's stalled move had seen Odiwuor's switch look unachievable. “Confirming that we have completed the transfer and paperwork for Daniel Odiwuor from Bidco United. The keeper joins us on a-year long deal,” confirmed a statement on the bankers' social media feeds. Earlier, Zedekiah Otieno’s charges had already captured forward Victor Omune from Nairobi Stima on a two and a half years deal. Thomas Harun came in from Sony Sugar with the bankers stealing a march on Tusker to capture highly-rated Migori Youth winger Anthony Abwao. The quartet are likely to be considered for this weekend’s league match against Western Stima at the Kenyatta Stadium in Machakos. With one game in hand, KCB are fifth with 32 points, five off top spot occupied by Tusker.
