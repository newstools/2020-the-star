Former Africa Player of the Year, Victor Ikpeba will grace this year’s Safaricom Sports Personality of the Year (SOYA) gala as chief guest on Friday at the Mombasa Sports Club. The former Nigeria Super Eagles star, who was crowned Africa’s finest in 1997, is expected in the country on Tuesday before travelling to Mombasa, where he will hold a series of clinics with the local football sides before the gala. “I’m so excited to be returning to Kenya after many years. It’s a great honour to be invited as the chief guest of a sports awards gala in country that has rich sporting talent,” Ikpeba said. He added: “I have just been in Kenya twice; first, when we played Harambee Stars in a World Cup qualifier. This was immediately after we won the 1996 Olympics gold medal in Atlanta, Georgia and they frustrated us, holding us to a 1-1 draw. The second time I came in quietly for an Olympic promo in 2012. This time, I will have more time to see the beauty of the country and mingle with some of the world beaters.” Ikpeba, who featured at the 1994 and 1998 Fifa World Cup tournaments with Nigeria, has had stints with French Ligue 1 side AS Monaco, Bundesliga side Borussia Dortmund and Spanish La Liga side Real Betis. He also had stints with teams in the Middle East before hanging his boots. This year’s gala has been sponsored by Safaricom with co-sponsorship from County Government of Mombasa, Kenya Pipeline, Communication Authority of Kenya, New KCC, Lap Fund, Kenya Power, UBA Bank, Nairobi Bottlers, Kenya Ports Authority, NHIF, NSSF, Kenya Tourism Board and GOtv.
