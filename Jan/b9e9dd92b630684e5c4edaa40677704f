DCI has arrested a police impostor after extorting Sh30,000 from unsuspecting Kenyan. Daniel Ochieng, 23, was arrested on Tuesday evening after the victim reported the case. Ochieng is said to have visited Kabete National Polytechnic and introduced himself as a police officer posted from Central Police division to conduct investigations on crimes within the institution. “In the course of his unlawful conduct, he arrested a student on allegations that he was peddling narcotic drugs. He further intimidated the victim with severe police action and in the process extorted Sh30,000 from him,” DCI said on Wednesday. The George Kinoti led directorate said the victim thereafter made a report to DCI offices who moved swiftly and arrested the impostor. “Upon searching him the officers recovered one roll of bhang, a toy pistol and the Sh30,000,” read part of the tweet. The Directorate of Criminal Investigations will present Ochieng' at the Milimani court today.
