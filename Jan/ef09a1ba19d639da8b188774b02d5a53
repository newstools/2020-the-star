Hip hop artiste Juliani in partnership with The Kenya Fight Inequality Alliance will host a concert at Railways Club, Nairobi, on Saturday to raise awareness on inequality. Titled 'Usawa Festival’, the concert will bring together music, art and cultural activities, graffiti artistes and a photo exhibition. It is designed to model a community that provides resources and services for people. Juliani says this initiative will provide an opportunity for people to express social injustices through art, music and poetry. “This is the first time we are doing this concert and we are encouraging Kenyans to turn up in large numbers and support the concert,” he said. "We have lots of social injustices taking place in the country: gender-based violence, extrajudicial killings, people living with disability, and so on, and this is a great new platform to share some of our concerns through music." Last years event was graced by former Chief Justice Dr Willy Mutunga and Oxfam executive director Winnie Byanyima.
