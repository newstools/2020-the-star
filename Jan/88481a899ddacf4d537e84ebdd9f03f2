Award-winning Ugandan star Eddy Kenzo says he will be introducing a new woman in his life this year. Edriisa Musuuza told Bukedde TV last week, "I believe this year won’t end before I get a lover. I am very sure that I will get one. In fact, I’m even very excited that I will be introducing her to my family and friends, but I don’t want to repeat the same mistakes I did in my past relationship." The Sitya Loss hitmaker broke up with his long-time girlfriend and baby mama Rema Namakula, who married one Dr Hamza Sebunya late last year and moved in with him. Their traditional ceremony was attended by the who-is-who in the Ugandan entertainment industry. "A woman doesn't need a perfect man, she just needs a special guy who can accept her the way she is and make her feel special. Thank you for making me feel special my sweetheart, Hamza," she tweeted after the wedding. "For the first time, I have found someone I hate leaving, someone I can't get enough of, someone who accepts me for who I am and doesn't tell me I need to change. I think I have found someone I can fall madly in love with."
