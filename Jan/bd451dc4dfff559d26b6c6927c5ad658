Firearms can be lethal if carelessly handled. There have been many incidences where firearms are misused by their licensed holders. The most recent one is an alleged shooting of a city nightclub DJ by Embakasi East MP Babu Owino on Friday. To minimise such incidences, the government should cancel firearm licences for all public servants such as MPs, CSs, PSs, CASs, judges, magistrates and senior parastatal managers enjoying 24/7 VIP protection. Citizens clearly need protection more than them. Alternatively, the government should retrain all private-licensed firearm holders on weaponry for not less than six months and follow up to ensure every gun holder has undergone the full course and has a licence.
