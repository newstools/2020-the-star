Embattled Kiambu Governor Ferdinand Waititu has told senators about the struggle he went through during the 2017 General Election in a last ditch effort to convince them to throw out his impeachment case. He on Wednesday said he traversed 12 constituencies in the county hunting for votes. "Getting rid of somebody who was elected with over 800,00 votes. You can imagine going around 12 constituencies to be elected," Waititu said. Waititu also said 35 MCAs were not present during the impeachment motion, where he was voted out. "There were only 57 members of county assembly in that assembly. The law requires two-thirds of the members," he said. He added that "even if you don't like Waitittu, the numbers are on my side". "Numbers are supreme. You cannot ignore numbers... I beseech this house to make a ruling that cannot be challenged in any court of law. So that everybody can admire being a senator," Waititu said. He distanced himself from the charges levelled against him.
