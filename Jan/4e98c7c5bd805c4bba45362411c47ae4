Organisers of the annual Discovery Kenya 10km road race have called off the event earlier scheduled for Sunday in Eldoret. The race was meant to return to Eldoret after a four-year hiatus having been last held in 2015. The event was held  in Nyahururu last year as half marathon in remembrance of the first Kenyan runner to win Olympic marathon gold, Samuel Wanjiru. The cancellation follows the installation of new Eldoret Catholic Bishop Dominic Kimengich on Sunday following the death of Cornelius Korir in 2018. While addressing the press at Eldoret Sports Club, Central Rift chairman Abraham Mutai said the race was clashing with mass hence they had no choice but postpone it. "There is no way we were going to run the two events concurrently because the race's finish-line is next to the church. Besides, the roads around the church are meant to be closed making it difficult for the run," he added. He urged athletes to continue training in readiness for other events including  Eldoret City Marathon on April 1.  “We humbly appeal and request athletes who were preparing for Sunday's race to keep up the momentum for the upcoming races," he added.
