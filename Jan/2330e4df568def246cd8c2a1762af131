Kenyan international Whyvonne Isuza is the latest signing for ambitious Kenyan Premier League side Wazito. Isuza was until recently in the books of cash-strapped KPL giants AFC Leopards and was part of the Harambee Stars team that won the 2017 Cecafa Senior Challenge Cup title in Kenya. He was also in the squad that participated in the 2019 edition that was staged in Uganda. “Isuza is a national team player and he is definitely a good addition to the team. The technical bench recommended his signing because they understand his abilities and we are glad that he agreed to join us. His addition makes us stronger,” CEO Dennis Gicheru said in a club statement. The acquisition of Isuza on a free transfer, after he terminated his contract with Leopards, is a significant coup for Wazito owner, Ricardo Badoer, who has set his sights on conquering the top division. Wazito team manager Bramwell Makotsi lauded the player’s capture saying he will greatly improve our midfield. "Isuza has been one of the best midfielders in the Kenyan Premier League in the past few years and we are glad to have him on board. He is a versatile player who can play in different positions and that versatility is important for the team. We are trying to beef up the team by getting quality players, players like him (Isuza) make us a better team,” he said. Isuza rejoins former Ingwe teammate, Dennis Shikayi who joined Wazito on Friday. Two other players Kennedy Owino, and Dennis Ng’ang’a both from KCB, are the other January signings for Wazito.
