The top-of-the-table clash at Camp Toyoyo pitting National Super League leaders Nairobi City Stars and second-placed Bidco will be the highlight of this weekend's second division fixtures with Stars vowing to cement their status as the promotion favourites this year. City Stars striker Ezekiel Odera, who has already scored twice on his return to the club in the second leg of the campaign, said a win against Bidco will show how serious they are in their quest to reclaim a place in the top-tier league. “Only three points will be at stake on Sunday but if we beat Bidco, a team that is following us, it will be a huge statement to our rivals and a morale booster to the squad as the belief will be enhanced further that we can bag promotion,” said the experienced striker. Bidco have an unblemished record in the second leg and have emerged as another favourite to clinch one of the two automatic promotion slots. Anthony Akhulia’s charges have won all three of their second leg fixtures to open up a six-point gap between them and third-placed Nairobi Stima. Stima who, it was recently reported, lost sponsorship from their benefactors Kenya Power face Ushuru in another top billing NSL encounter. Stima are third with 39 points with Ushuru following closely with 36 points.
