Embakasi East MP Babu Owino has completely failed to portray the moral values of a leader which contravenes the Constitution on leadership and integrity. Even prior to his election, Babu has had a bad record from abusing fellow leaders to assault. Though he is tactful in his abusive utterance whereby he majorly speaks with ambiguity, he usually defends himself saying he meant otherwise, was misunderstood or misquoted. This is wrong of a leader and it is high time the legislator embraced change before Kenyans kill his political career. The DCI, EACC and police should keep safe the criminal records of leaders and use it to show them they are risking public trust.  Nairobi.
