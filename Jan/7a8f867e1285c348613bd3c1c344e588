Vihiga Bullets assistant coach Milton Kidiga has challenged the team to forget the disappointment of their defeat last time out and claim maximum points from their National Super League encounter with  Murang'a Seal at the Bukhungu Stadium on Saturday. Bullets were humbled 2-0 by league leaders Nairobi City Stars to leave them down in position 13 and out of the promotion race. "We have enjoyed our home matches but results need to improve on our travels. The match against City Stars was a good lesson for the team and hopefully, we will apply them in our game against Seal," Kidiga remarked. Bullets are likely to retain their NSL status largely on the back of home results something that Kidiga was keen for them to keep up. "The platform to our good performances is our results at home. Our fans are always behind us and the team plays with confidence if it can apply on our travels we will improve further in the standings," he observed. There will be a full roll of fixtures with  Migori Youth and Coast Stima clashing at the Awendo, Green Stadium as the League enters round 22 across different venues. NSL leaders Nairobi City Stars face a tough trip to take on  Vihiga United in Mumias Complex on Sunday. Vihiga United will be looking to move to second as City Stars seek to maintain top spot position in the league.
