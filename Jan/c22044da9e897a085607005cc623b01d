The Ford Kenya party has distanced itself from the decision by its two MPs to attend a two-day Tangatanga meeting in Naivasha. Party organising secretary Chris Mandumandu said on Tuesday MPs Charles Gimose of Hamisi and Bungoma Woman Representative Catherine Wambilianga attended the meeting as individuals, and they did not represent the interests of the party. "Both Gimose and Wambilianga attended the Jubilee retreat for selfish gains and did not represent the views of Ford Kenya on BBI matters," he said. The two MPs went against their party boss Moses Wetang'ula's support on BBI, he said. Mandumandu also said the statement, which was read by Wambilianga during the Jubilee meeting, was against the party's decision. He said despite the party supporting the BBI report, it does not belong in either Tanganga or Kieleweke factions of the Jubilee party. "We fully support BBI report, but we don't belong either in Tangatanga or Kieleke in Jubilee party." On Monday, Wambilianga read a statement during the Jubilee meeting where she castigated BBI rallies "for discussing personalities and not what was in the report".
