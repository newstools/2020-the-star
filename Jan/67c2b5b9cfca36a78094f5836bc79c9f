 The DPP has directed that the incitement to violence case against Makadara MP George Aladwa proceeds to a full hearing following a review of the file. The case was mentioned on Thursday before Milimani chief magistrate Martha Mutuku. The prosecution said there were instructions from DPP Nordin Haji asking for the hearing date. The DPP last year recalled the police file to review the evidence gathered by investigators. Earlier, Aladwa through his lawyer John Khaminwa had urged the court to terminate the charges, saying they were defective. The MP said trial magistrate Daniel Ogembo, now a High Court judge, had ruled that the charge sheet violates the Constitution as it is not consistent. "A charge sheet is a state document and must be consistent with the Constitution," he said. Aladwa faulted the charge sheet, saying it did not contain sufficient details. Khaminwa said politicians have freedom of speech while addressing the public during rallies and their rights should not be violated. The prosecution dismissed the defence's application, saying the charge sheet was properly drafted and contains sufficient details of the allegation of incitement to violence. Aladwa is accused of uttering words indicating it was desirable to bring death to certain Kenyans in Kibera on October 20, 2018. He is out on Sh3 million bond with an alternative Sh500,000 bail. Mutuku directed the case to be mentioned on February 17.  edited by p. obuya
