For years, the human rights of the LGBTQ people in this country have often been regarded as a gay issue and end up being sidelined as a result. LGBTQ rights are either denied by law or practices.Â As a result, the LGBTQ people end up facing violence and inequities because of who they are, who they love and how they look. We need to understand that LGBTQ people do not claim any special or additional rights. They just want the observance of the same rights as those of the heterosexual people. They need equality in rights and before the law. Just because one has a different sexual orientation or gender identity from what is 'normal', it should never lead to discrimination or even abuse. Sexual orientation is an integral aspect of our lives and we need to embrace it.  Kisumu
