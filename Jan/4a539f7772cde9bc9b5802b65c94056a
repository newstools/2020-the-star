Locusts have now invaded Tana River county, causing great damage. Reports indicate that the locusts crossed from Garissa through Bura Dhima, Madogo, and Bua. They have destroyed more than 12 acres of crops and pasture in the villages. County Director of Special Programmes Abdulahi Hanti said, “The locusts have left banana plantations leafless. They are also competing with livestock for the grass in the area.” He said the locusts move through the vegetation at a high speed consuming more than 100 metres of vegatation per hour per swarm. Elder Mohamed Hassa from Bura Dhima said within 30 minutes the pests had destroyed all the bananas on their farms. He said they used iron sheets to chase them away. Residents have been urged to report if they see locusts in the area.
