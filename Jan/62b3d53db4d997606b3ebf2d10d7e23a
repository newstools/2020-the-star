Isiolo Woman Representative Rehema Jaldesa has for the first time revealed she has had differences with her father over land adjudication in the county. Their differences started last August following the issuance of a legal gazette notice by lands CS Faridah Karoney establishing Isiolo county as an adjudication zone. Her father, former Isiolo South MP Dida Jaldesa, was then appointed by Governor Mohamed Kuti to chair an 18-member boundary and dispute resolution committee tasked with carrying out sensitization programs to persuade residents to support the adjudication process to enable land owners obtain title deeds. Rehema has called for revocation of the gazette notice, arguing it was issued irregularly and without adequate public participation. “It has a hidden motive to legalize parcels of land acquired fraudulently under the county government’s watch. We want the revocation of the gazette notice to allow the land adjudication process to be conducted in line with the Community Land Act of 2016,” she said. The legislator further argues that her father’s 18-member committee lacks fair representation from all the ten wards and has called for its immediate disbandment. Her strong stance has now put her at crossroads with her biological father, prompting critics to warn her of incurring a curse if she doesn’t desist. She spoke at Emejen Primary School in Burat ward during her thanksgiving ceremony. Rehema vowed to take on her father head on till the matter is concluded, even if it means attracting the perceived curse. She argued that she will not allow her family ties to affect service delivery to Isiolo residents who overwhelmingly voted for her.
