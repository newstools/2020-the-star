 The body of a Meru man who had been missing for three days has been found in a thicket at Tutua village, Buuri, minus the legs. Samuel Kaimenyi’s head and the rest of the body had deep cuts. “The man was murdered. The body was found at Tutua village, about 1.5 kilometres from the local police post. His head had deep cuts and both legs, from the knees, were missing," county police commander Patrick Lumumba said. Catherine Gakii, the widow of the 50-year-old man, had reported him missing on Sunday. The body was found by neighbour Fred Bundi on Tuesday evening as he searched for his goats.  He stumbled on the body and alerted police officers at the nearby police post. Lumumba said the increasing cases of murder in the region were alarming. However, he told the Star that his collaboration with region county commanders is bearing fruits and gave the example of recovered livestock from Samburu and Isiolo after he alerted his counterparts in those counties. On Tuesday, the officers recovered 19 head of cattle stolen from farmer Benedict Kiathe.
