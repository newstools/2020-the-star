Serial goal scorer Ezekiel Odera's future is up in the air after his contract with AFC Leopards ended with his loan spell with KCB also over. Odera had joined KCB on loan from Leopards at the start of last  season but according to the player's father, he is now unattached. "I do not know what his next move will be because his loan with KCB ended and his contract with Leopards  also  lapsed in December," said Odera Senior. In the over ten years he has plied his trade in the country's top flight league, Odera has cemented himself as one of the most lethal finishers in the country. However,  his exploits with KCB, Gor Mahia, Thika United, Sofapaka, Nairobi City Stars and AFC Leopards have not earned him recognition with the national team selectors. Now 31, the striker is unlikely to be short of suitors either in the top flight league or in the National Super League where his former employers City Stars have reportedly shown interest. City Stars are pursuing a return to the topflight league and have a healthy seven point advantage at the top of the NSL league at the halfway stage. The second tier league resumes this weekend with City Stars traveling to face Shabana.
