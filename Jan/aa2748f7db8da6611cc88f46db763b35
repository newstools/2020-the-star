A businessman accused of stealing 127 goats valued at Sh356,600 is facing charges of obtaining goods by false pretences. Hassan Nache is accused of stealing 79 goats worth Sh205,400 from Abdinoor Ali and 48 others valued at Sh151,200 from Adan Boru on November 15 last year in Kiamaiko, Huruma estate, Nairobi. Nache allegedly told the two men to follow him into a mabati room so he could count the money and hand it to them. But he escaped through a rear door. The complainants dashed back to the goat market where the livestock had been corraled under the care of the suspectsâ€™ aides but found the kraal empty and the aides gone. Nache went underground until he was arrested. He denied the charges before senior principal magistrate Angelo Kithinji at the Makadara law courts. He was released on Sh100,000 bail and an alternative bond of Sh200,000. The hearing will start on May 20. Edited by Josephine M. Mayuya
