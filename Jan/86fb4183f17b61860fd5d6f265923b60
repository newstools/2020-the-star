A student who sat his Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education last year has drowned in Homa Bay. Robert Odhiambo, 18, drowned in river Oluch in Koyugi location, Karachuonyo constituency on Friday evening. Odhiambo met his death when he was crossing the river as he herded cattle. Those who saw him crossing the river were shocked to miss him a few minutes later. Residents said he was confused by water which flooded the area after the river broke its banks due to heavy rains which pounded the area a few days ago. Speaking on Sunday, Koyugi chief Irene Ojwang said the boy was following cattle which had crossed the river. “He was overwhelmed by the water when he was trying to catch up with cattle which were already on the other side of the river,” Ojwang’ said. She urged the public to desist from crossing rivers where there are no bridges. Residents retrieved his body a few hours later before it was moved to Kendu Adventist Hospital mortuary. Odhiambo scored a D+ in KCSE at Kandiege Mixed Secondary school in the constituency. He was to attend secondary school as part of government 100 per cent primary to secondary transition.
