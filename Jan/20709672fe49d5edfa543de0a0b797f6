More than Sh11 million in the old Sh1,000 notes would have remained concealed from security officers had nine people not quarrelled over it in Nairobi. Police were informed about the fight and stormed the suspects' hideout in Kilimani, where they recovered the notes. Police boss Lucas Ogara called the notes "a mere heap of papers". Speaking at his office on Tuesday, he said officers are investigating the January 4 incident. “Today at around 1650 hours, police received a tip-off from members of the public that there were people counting a large amount of money within Kamburu Road," a report seen by the Star reads. "Police rushed to the scene at Blue Violet Plaza 1st floor, room no. 105.” Eight men and a woman were arrested. “There was information that some people were quarrelling inside a room in Kilimani. When police officers went there, they found people locked inside the house in possession of the old Kenyan currency,” Ogara said. The suspects include Brian Musyimi, Caroline Mwende, Edwin Karuga, Humphrey Waweru, Junet Ali Abbas, Lawrence Chebet,  Michael Ngugi, Victor Nzivo and Wellington Odhiambo. “All were in the process of counting the currency which amounts to Sh11.5 million. On interrogation, the first three men each claimed to own the amount,” Ogara said. A police source said all the suspects have been released from custody as investigations continue. In September last year police recovered fake $1 million and 147 gold bars from a night club in Kilimani. The officers from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations arrested the owner of Plan 254 Club, Steve Oduk. They acted on a tip-off from a foreigner who had been asked to visit the club to buy some of the gold bars. Edited by R.Wamochie
