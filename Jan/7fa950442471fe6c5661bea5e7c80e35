The death of Kajiado woman who fell off from a speeding county government ambulance on Friday night is under police investigations. County officials said the woman opened the back door of the ambulance after her child died and jumped off as the vehicle sped off towards Kajiado town on Friday night. Health CEC Member, Esther Somoire, confirmed on Sunday the woman succumbed to injuries at Kajiado County referral hospital later on Saturday. Somoire declined to comment further on the matter but denied claims the ambulance had no door when the woman, her sick child, and another relative boarded it. “I do not want to comment on this unfortunate incident because the police are investigating it. What I can only say is the ambulance has serviceable doors,” said Somoire.’ Nurses at Bissil health centre on Friday called the services of the government ambulance from Kajiado town after the woman’s child required specialised treatment. Somoire added that the woman jumped off the car after realising that her child had passed on as a nurse was attempting to resuscitate the little child. Eye witness Paul Mutua said that had said that the passengers boarded the ambulance on Friday night and the nurse sat with the driver in front of the vehicle. Another person, who sought anonymity claimed that the woman who jumped out of the speeding car after the death of her child was left on the road. “The victim was pregnant and her relative in the car attempted to stop the ambulance by banging it but the nurse, who was seated at the front could not hear her,” claimed the witness.
