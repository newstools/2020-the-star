Kenyan teams begin their 2020 Tokyo Beach Volleyball qualification against Rwanda in the Africa sub-zonal competitions at Mbalamwezi Beach in Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania this afternoon. Head coach Sammy Mulinge said the girls are eyeing to top the competition in a bid to advance to the CAVB Zone V qualifiers. “We are ready for the championship. All the teams have come here (Dar) to qualify so we shall handle a game at a time. We want to instil confidence in  our players to settle down early and probably control the match,” noted Mulinge who also guided the men’s lineup to advance to CAVB Zone V qualifiers. In the Championship, only Rwanda have fielded pairs of experienced players who have already tasted the world waters. Kenya have only one experienced player, Gaudencia Makokha who has played at the World stage (U-23 in Vienna 2016) with three others making their debut on the international stage. “Rwanda have the same players who represented them at the World Championships whereas both Uganda and Tanzania have changed their pairs. We will strategise by observing how the girls respond and adjusting accordingly. Our target is to qualify,” added the tactician who has returned home after nine years as head coach of Rwanda’s APR Volleyball Club. Kenya One pair of experienced player Makokha and Brackcides Agala will face Rwanda Two partnership of Seraphine Mukantambara and Judith Hakizimana.
