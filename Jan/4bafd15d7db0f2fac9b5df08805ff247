Singer Susumila says his friend Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho funded his new project with Mbosso titled 'Sonona'. He told Word Is on Thursday, "The project was like Sh1.3 million and Joho funded all of it. Music production is expensive." He said 'Sonona' means disappointment and feeling like you are down. "Like you want something but you can't have it. We shot the video in Dar es salaam," he said. Previously, the governor had funded his other project with Lava Lava, titled "Warembo", but Susumila says the record label 001 Music is not owned by Joho. "It is a record label founded by myself and three other people, it's a partnership. Joho does not own any record label," he said. The 'Ngoma Itambe' hitmaker says he has been friends with Joho for over 15 years. "We are friends and he knows my potential and that's why he supports me. I have been with him since 2,005 when he was campaigning for a Member of Parliament seat," he said. "I'm a loyal friend and I don't campaign for anyone other than him. I believe in him and I believe in his ideologies." He says he and the Tanzanian singer met while in Mombasa, where he went to perform. "He came to a show and Joho asked me to talk to him so we can do something together. It was easy working with Mbosso but also hard for me to fit into the Bongo vibe cause I'm used to a whole different thing," Susumila said. "When we arrived in Dar, It was raining for the three days that we were there." Susumila has more collabos with Ommy Dimpoz, Nandy, Redsan and Fally Ipupa. He tells fans to expect the best from him and thanks them for the support.
