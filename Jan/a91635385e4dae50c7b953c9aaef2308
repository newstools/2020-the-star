Uhuru met the BBI taskforce at State House Nairobi on December last year where he requested the team to continue leading the process. The President who was in the company of ODM leader Raila Odinga, thanked the team for putting together a report that 'captured the aspirations of Kenyans'. According to the statement from State House Spokesperson Kanze Dena, the Taskforce will now be mandated to steer the next phase of the process. "This will largely involve expanding and guiding public participation and structuring recommendations by Kenyans into implementable action plans," the statement read. However, the communication from State House did not indicate the exact time period of the extended term.
