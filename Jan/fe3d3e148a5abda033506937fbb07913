IEBC chairperson Wafula Chebuklati has told Siaya senator James Orengo to resign following his criticism of the elections agency. In a press statement on Wednesday, the commission said that it should not be used as a 'punching bag for political mileage'. The Electoral Commission also dismissed Orengo's claims that it should be disbanded. "The honourable senator is an elected member of the Senate, who is, therefore, a product of the same alleged criminal enterprise. If he indeed stands by his sentiments, he should honourably resign to gain moral grounds to criticise the institution that oversaw his election to the Senate," part of the statement read. The IEBC's response was to the senator's remarks on Tuesday while appearing on Citizen TV. Orengo had said that Kenyans needed a commission in place that can apply the law during transmission of results. "We need free, accountable and transparent elections. Over the years, problems have come after the elections. That is because the Commission does not carry out a free and fair election in terms of accountability and accuracy," Orengo said. The senator said that the first step in ensuring that there is a fair election is to make changes to IEBC. The commission added that it has been working round the clock to ensure it delivers according to the Constitution. "We wish to firmly reiterate that IEBC is committed to delivering on its Constitutional mandate," IEBC said. Orengo was speaking on the issue of the Building Bridges Initiative report.
