Lille have asked the French League (LFP) to tell Dijon to improve the soundproofing of its away team dressing room after coach Christophe Galtier was heard apparently comparing Dijon to a pub team. Local newspaper Le Bien Public reported on Saturday that Lille made the request after losing 1-0 at Dijon in Ligue 1 last weekend. Neither Lille nor the LFP could immediately be reached for comment. Reporters in the news conference room were said to have been able to hear Galtier fuming at his players in the adjacent dressing room after the game, saying: “We lose to pub teams! Amiens, Reims, Toulouse!” Galtier later apologised for his wording, saying that he had meant teams fighting for their survival in the top flight of French football. Meanwhile, teenager Rayan Cherki scored two and set up another as Olympique Lyonnais avoided a last-gasp slip-up to advance into the French Cup last 16 with a 4-3 win at Nantes on Saturday. The 16-year-old netted twice within the opening nine minutes to inspire Lyon to victory despite Nantes’s late fightback while other Ligue 1 teams struggled against lower sides. St Etienne dug deep to beat Ligue 2 team Paris FC 3-2 in the capital after being behind 2-1 until the 71st minute. Lille left it late to down fifth division Gonfreville 2-0 with goals by Loic Remy and Victor Osimhen in the 69th minute and in stoppage time. In Nantes, Cherki collected Moussa Dembele’s pass before dribbling past goalkeeper Alban Lafont for a first-minute opener. He doubled the tally eight minutes later, latching onto Bertrand Traore’s cross. Renaud Emon headed home to reduce the arrears in the 16th minute, only for Cherki to set up Martin Terrier for OL’s third with a defence-splitting pass eight minutes from halftime.
