Kiambu Senator Kimani Wamatangi has asked MCAs to use their offices to fight corruption. He said residents were happy with the ward representatives' oversight role and encouraged them to keep up the spirit. "In Kiambu, we have agreed to fight corruption. We must now cultivate good leadership to enable us to grow," Wamatangi said on Saturday in Limuru. "I feel bad when I hear our people complaining too much over services. It is not supposed to be like that." Wamatangi also urged other counties to support the war on graft. Kiambu MCAs impeached Governor Ferdinand Waititu over the graft-related cases. He has been barred from accessing his office. Waititu's impeachment motion will be tabled in the Senate on Tuesday. Lari Kirenga MCA Joseph Karichu said that many projects have stalled since Deputy Governor James Nyoro  does not have powers to commission them.
