Supreme Court judges have retreated to Nakuru to strategise on the management of its affairs, a source has informed the Star. The judges will discuss a strategic plan for the court, prepare a case list for the year and talk about how to clear pending judgments. A team led by Judge Mohammed Ibrahim has been working on a strategic plan for the court and will present it to the bench for approval, a source said. The court's last five-year strategic plan was crafted by former Chief Justice Willy Mutunga for 2013-2018. The meeting comes a month before the retirement of Justice Jacktone Boma Ojwang. But the source said that the meeting will not discuss the retirement as there will be no crisis in the court given the quorum is five judges. "Most of the times the court takes the submissions from parties in cases and does judgments and rulings online and share for approval even when both the CJ and DCJ are sitting on JSC so that does not in any way affect quorum of the court. We also liaise with JSC on its diary to ensure smooth flow of the court," the source told the Star. The apex court bench comprises CJ David Maraga, his deputy Philomena Mwilu, judges Mohammed Ibrahim, Jacktone Ojwang, Smokin Wanjala, Njoki Ndungu and Isaac Lenaola. The retreat began yesterday and the judges will be back to Nairobi on Saturday.
