 Wajir politicians will next week start holding meetings in the subcounties to popularise the Building Bridges Initiative. Eldas MP Aden Keynan on Saturday said the document is good and only requires a little finetuning to be the best because it captures the interests of all communities. Speaking in Eldas town, the lawmaker said it was regrettable that the majority of residents in remote villages were only aware of the BBI but do not know the contents of the report. He said the leaders will move to the ground to explain in details the contents of the report to their electorates. "I want to tell our people from all corners of our three counties of Northeastern that as leaders, we have read the document and fully understood it. They will however still have an opportunity to add their input on the things they want to be included in the final report,” Keynan said. Keynan said the region vigorously campaigned and subsequently voted for the 2010 Constitution that brought devolution and promised to do the same for the BBI which proposes an increase in budget allocation to counties. “It is an open secret that matters devolution are dear to our lives. We have seen a total transformation in our counties in the last seven years with the meager resources allocated to us. You can imagine how far we will go if the resources are increased,” he said. Keynan further noted that any effort that is geared towards uniting Kenya and making it better for all must be supported. BBI campaign in the grassroots will be spearheaded by governors in coordination with elected leaders. Garissa Governor Ali Korane was assigned to lead BBI campaigns in Northeastern.  edited by p. obuya
