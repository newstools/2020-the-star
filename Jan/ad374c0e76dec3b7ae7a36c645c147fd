Africa Sokoni signed a partnership with Bolorims.com from Nigeria, an e-commerce platform, as they celebrated their second anniversary at the Eka Hotel on Sunday. This partnership is an expansion strategy, considering the unprecedented growth of SMEs and the urge to reach a wider customer base through online stores. Bolorims CEO Michael Tokunbo Orimobil said, "Bolorims was eager to invest in the e-commerce market in Kenya to build a cohesive partnership between Nigeria and East Africa. We have acquired a 10 per cent stake of Africa Sokoni but we will be trading in West Africa as Bolosokoni.com." Present were African Sokoni CEO Ebrima Fatty and chief operating officer Celeste Liyai.
