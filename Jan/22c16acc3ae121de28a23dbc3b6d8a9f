After signing a six-month long deal with Township Rollers of Botswana, former Gor Mahia striker Francis Afriyie wants to aid the club retain their title before his stint elapses. The Ghanaian striker, who joined Gor before the season began, was yesterday unveiled at the Gaborone-based club putting to end the speculation over his return to the Kenyan champions. His exit from Gor is understood to have been orchestrated by lack of pay with his father Manfred Takyi who was in the country last month to meet Gor chairman being the mastermind to the termination of the contract. Besides losing Afriyie, the club parted ways with Ivorian striker Gislein Yikpe who decamped to record Tanzanian champions Yanga. Before heading to the festive season holiday at USA, Afriyie had hinted of a possible return to Gor but instead flew to complete the deal with Rollers yesterday. After his short stay in the US, the former Bechem United man returned to Ghana where he met sacked Black Stars head coach Kwesi Appiah for a possible consideration in international matches. The striker was earlier linked with a move to Spanish-based Real Zaragoza and South Africa’s Black Leopards but opted for Rollers who won the title last season with former AFC Leopards tactician Rodolfo Zapata. “I have signed a half year deal with Rollers. They offered me a good deal which was way above what the rest of the other suitors were offering. I am hoping to win the title with them before my stay comes to an end,” he said.
