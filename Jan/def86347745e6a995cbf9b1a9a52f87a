The Director of Criminal Investigations George Kinoti has rubbished claims from Sarah Wairimu that they have denied her access to her late husband's house to collect her clothes and cosmetics. Through her lawyer Philip Murgor, Sarah had claimed that the DCI and ODPP had disobeyed the court orders issued last week by the High Court. On Friday, through KTK advocates, Kinoti said that the orders being referred to by Sarah were "irregularly, unlawfully and mischievously" dismissed. Kinoti said the order alleged by Sarah to have been disregarded was invalidated. The DCI boss also said that they are still working on the case of Cohen's death together with the ODPP to ensure that those who killed him face the law. The High Court had last week allowed the widow to access her Farasi Lane home in Kitisuru to collect her clothes, make-up kit and handbags. Her access was, however, restricted to the bedroom she was using before her arrest in connection with Cohen's murder. Wairimu, through lawyer Philip Murgor, says that the DPP and the DCI have been evasive to enforce the order.
