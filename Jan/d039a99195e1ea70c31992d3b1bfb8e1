Meanwhile, a Kenyan Premier League club has petitioned FKF to halt tomorrow’s SGM claiming it is against the federation statutes and instead institute a dispute resolution mechanism to chart the way forward. The letter addressed to the federation secretary-general further stated: “That the term of the 40 FKF branch officials representing the 20 FKF branches for four years comes to an end on January 26, 2020 having been elected in the office on January 26, 2016. Therefore the 40 officials from the 20 branches listed to attend the SGM of January 28 by virtue of the fact that their term will have expired and therefore any business or deliberations by them at the SGM will be null and void.” “Based on the issues raised, the SGM of January 28, 2020, cannot transact procedurally and legally due to the fundamental and procedural branches of FKF statutes,” the club stated in their letter.
