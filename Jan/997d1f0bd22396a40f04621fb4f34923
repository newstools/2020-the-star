Don't forget about the voters as you drum up support for the Building Bridges Initiative report, Kiambu Senator Kimani Wamatangi has urged politicians. President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga allies have organised a BBI rally in Mombasa on Saturday, and Deputy President William Ruto's allies have said they will join them. "We all should remember that our people are watching us. They are following what we are saying, where we are going as they cry to reach us out to assist them" Wamatangi said in Limuru on Thursday. "Do you think they feel good when you lied to them but are speaking loudly at those rallies? "They might even heckle you when you come over after a long time telling them why it was not possible to fulfil their promise." The senator urged religious leaders to pray for peace as politicians with different opinions participate in those rallies and utter words that might cause chaos. "We need to dedicate this country before God. We need peace, we do not want to see chaos in the BBI rallies. Our religious leaders are capable of leading us" Wamatangi said. He urged elected leaders to remember the promises they made to voters as time is running out. "When we start these BBI rallies, we should realise that the next general election is approaching and we should work hard to fulfil the pledges we made," Wamatangi said. Edited by Josephine M. Mayuya
