Public Service CS Margaret Kobia has welcomed the changes made by President Uhuru Kenyatta to the Cabinet. Kobia said the move to shift the Youth Affairs functions from her ministry to the ICT ministry is in order, adding that CS Joe Mucheru will deliver. She hailed the move, saying the time it was being transferred, the Public Service ministry had restructured the NYS. “Remember I said if any more money is stolen from NYS, I will resign. I am happy to hand over after restructuring as it is now best placed to handle its mandate. I am confident CS Joe Mucheru will use it to deliver," Kobia said. Uhuru, in his address to the nation on Tuesday from State House, Mombasa, moved the State Department of Youth Affairs from the Ministry of Public Service, Youth, and Gender Affairs to Ministry of ICT and Innovations and renamed the ministries - Public Service and Gender and ICT, Innovation and Youth Affairs. Kobia has further urged the CS taking charge to implement the Kenya National Youth Policy which was adopted in Parliament last month. “That is where it belongs. This leaves me with two portfolios - Public Service and Gender, which will now be strengthened for better deliverables,” she said. Meanwhile, Treasury CS Ukr Yatani also lauded the President for the changes, which included his confirmation as the National Treasury CS, a post which he has been serving in an acting capacity since July 2019. "It is with great pleasure and humility that I thank President for appointing me the substantive Cabinet Secretary for the National Treasury and Planning. I am humbled by the faith and trust that H.E the President has bestowed upon me," Yatani said. The CS said he will dedicate his effort to realising the Big Four Agenda. He added that he will turn around Kenya's economy by instilling fiscal discipline and undertaking comprehensive policy measures.
