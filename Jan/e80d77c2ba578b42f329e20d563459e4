Bayern Munich scored four second-half goals to beat Jurgen Klinsmann’s Hertha Berlin and move up to second in the Bundesliga. Thomas Muller volleyed home Ivan Perisic’s cut-back to give the visitors the lead on the hour mark.

Germany midfielder Goretzka was involved in Bayern’s third three minutes later, teeing up Thiago to fire into the top corner from the edge of the penalty area. Perisic capped a superb second-half display late on with a powerful header from Muller’s deep cross
