Kenya National Union of Teachers has urged its members to vacate Northeastern following the al Shabaab attack in Garissa on Monday in which three nonlocal teachers were killed. Secretary general Wilson Sossion told Education CS George Magoha to convene an urgent meeting with the Interior ministry, Teachers Service Commission and the union to discuss the deteriorating security in the region. He said should the CS refuse to convene a meeting, the union will be forced to mobilise a mass pullout of teachers from any other insecure area across the country. "We are telling teachers that no one will protect you apart from yourselves. An injury to one is an injury to all," Sossion said. He also demanded that the government deploy armed security personnel to all boarding schools. Garissa county director of Education Khalif Isack said the three teachers were killed by militants at 1.30am.
