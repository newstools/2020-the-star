ODM leader Raila Odinga arrived for the Mombasa edition of the BBI forum on Saturday at 1pm. Clad in a white shirt with three black stripes, he was received by droves of supporters who cheered him as he entered, waving at the crowds atop a black Prado. Raila and at least 11 ODM-affiliated legislators, including those from the host Coast region - wore matching shirts, reminiscent of the matching shirts attire worn by the NASA team during campaigns for the 2017 election. Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka also arrived atop his vehicle. Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang'ula was also present. Deputy President William Ruto had not arrived by the time the event was starting. ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi was also not present. However, his allies, Majority Leader in the Senate Kipchumba Murkomen, Malindi MP Aisha Jumwa, Nyali MP Mohamed Ali and Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria, were present. The meeting has been attended by the governors from the coastal region, various MPs and other leaders. Kirinyaga governor Anne Waiguru, Kitui governor Charity Ngilu, Kakamega governor Wycliffe Oparanya are among the leaders. The meeting was moved to Mama Ngina Water Front on Friday from the previous scheduled place, Tononoka ground.
