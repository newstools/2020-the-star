The two players depart today for Cyprus capital Nicosia, where they will play for women’s top tier side Lakatamia FC. “I feel excited. I’m looking forward to joining Lakatamia. It’s a step in the right direction in my career,” said Ingotsi. She said she is keen to help the team improve from last year’s sixth place finish. Kundu said: “This is a good opportunity for my development. I’m looking forward to be the first choice goalkeeper. I want to continue working hard.” Ingotsi and Kundu, a defender, used to play for Kenya Women’s Premier League side, Eldoret Falcons.
