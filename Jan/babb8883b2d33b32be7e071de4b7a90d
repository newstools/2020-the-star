Construction of a four-storey theology building at St Paul's University will start in February, vice chancellor Joseph Galgallo has said. Speaking during the groundbreaking ceremony at the main campus in Kabuku, Limuru, on Wednesday, he said the building will house modern lecture halls, an amphitheatre, a modern library and offices. "This is one of the institution's five years strategic plan, and it will take eight months to be complete. It will host the whole theology faculty" Galgallo said. "We hope to open this building before the graduation ceremony of this year in October." It will cost Sh100 million to put up. The initiative will be undertaken in partnership with Matthew 28 Ministries founder Jewel Hyun and her husband Elder Gene Hyun from Massachusetts, United States. Jewel said when she visited the university last year, she felt a need to support it to have a centre dedicated to theology. "When I went back to the US, I dreamt of building such a centre for the university. That issue disturbed me until I decided to share it with my husband and other people" she said. They agreed to help and invited Galgallo to the US for discussions. "We held a fundraising in the US, and raised the funds to build this centre," Jewel said. She said the building will be among the most beautiful theological training centres in the world. Edited by Josephine M. Mayuya
