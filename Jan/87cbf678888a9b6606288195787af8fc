Kenya Cup side Western Bulls coach Obi Solo is looking forward to improved performance when the second leg resumes on Saturday. “The first round was tough. We would have won more than three matches but we made errors which cost us. Our plan in the second leg is to be competitive,” said Osolo. He is confident that the team will maintain their Kenya Cup Status. “Our target at the beginning of the season was to remain in Kenya Cup this season. We are on course but we must work hard to achieve it,” said the  former Bulls player. Solo, however, said the club did not make any signings due to limited time. “We identified some potential signings but we didn't have enough time,” he said. Commenting on their encounter with eighth-placed Nondescripts  this weekend, Solo said they expects a tough game. “Nondies are a good team especially their forwards. They have a number of experienced players but we are prepared for them and we hope to have a good game,” he added. The club sits ninth on the 12-team log with 13 points from three wins. At the same time, KRU Championship side Kisii RFC has suffered a blow after their efforts to sign experienced duo Amos Obae and Rodgers Gworo on loan from Nakuru RFC failed. “We wanted to have them back on loan from Nakuru but the deal did not go through. We did not sign any player during the mid season transfer window,” said captain and team manager George Sagini. Kisii, who are  bottom on the KRU Championship log, travel to Ukunda where they face South Coast Pirates at St Joseph's Primary School on Saturday. Sagini appealed to well wishers to help the club financially. “We failed to honour three first leg matches due to financial challenges. I want to take this opportunity to appeal to well wishers to help the club,” said Sagini.
