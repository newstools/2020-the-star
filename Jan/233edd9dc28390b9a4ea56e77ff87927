Three nominated MCAs have raised concerns over the increase in gender-based violence in Kisii. Caren Magara, Josephine Ombati and Naomi Bosire said GBV, especially against women, hurt their social, education and financial growth. The trio singled out a case in which a man chopped off his sister-in-law’s hand in Bomachoge Chache over land. The suspect, who is still at large, had feuded with Eunice Moraa, 30, over a family parcel. He was against her tilling of a section of the land. The leaders condemned the attack and added that many women in similar situations have been suffering silently in fear of further victimisation. Speaking separately, they called for concerted efforts to end every form of violence and boost the social standing of each person. “Rising cases of GBV, especially among women, in the region is worrying. We cannot understand why a man can carry a machete and chop off a woman’s hand because of land,” Ombati said. Maraga said, “The incident must be condemned in the strongest terms possible by all because it will hamper the victim’s work.” The MCAs urged law enforcers to arrest and prosecute all culprits. They appealed to the government to help women access basic services and celebrate and motivate those who have ventured into business or political leadership. “It is high time law enforcers took action against GBV perpetrators because it is the only way to curb the vice, which has been increasing tremendously,” Bosire said. Elsewhere, Kisii Woman Representative Janet Ongera called for the immediate arrest of the suspect. "Cases of violence against women have become a menace in our region. I call upon all stakeholders to come out and condemn these incidents,” she said. Ong’era said her office, in partnership with the county government, will open a rescue centre to take care of GBV victims.
