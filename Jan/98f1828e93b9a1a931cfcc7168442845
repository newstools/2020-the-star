Private security guards should be paid Sh27,000 as basic monthly wage, their union's secretary-general Isaac Andabwa has said. Andabwa said guards had been exploited for a long time by being paid peanuts despite the hard economic times. The Kenya National Union of Private Security Workers boss said they support the government’s directive on private security reforms. He said guards should not be paid minimum wages but basic salaries and allowances. Andabwa was addressing over 500 KK Security guards at their training school in Nairobi on Thursday. “I was invited by the guards to sensitise them on the reforms," he said noting that several companies have submitted their reports to the Private Security Regulatory Authority for scrutiny and approval. Andabwa said that apart from the Sh27,000 basic monthly pay, each guard should get Sh10,000 house allowance, Sh2,500 commuter allowance and insurance cover, among others. The unionist said guards will support the Private Security Regulatory Authority boss Fazul Mohammed and the government to meet the April 1 deadline for the reforms’ implementation. Most firms pay guards Sh15,000 per month. Some pay even less despite charging their clients Sh50,000 for each guard. Andabwa said security guards were ready to be armed to be at the forefront of securing the country from terrorists like al-Shabaab. He urged the regulatory authorities to thoroughly vet security companies and individual guards before they were armed. However, not all guards will be armed. Those issued with guns will be the ones on special assignments like protecting cash in transit, securing busy malls, government premises and embassies, among others. “You can’t protect clients’ lives and property when you can’t protect yourself. Protect yourself first,” he advised members.
