The infrastructure of many public schools is so bad that one can tell by just looking that this is a public school. This includes schools in towns and, therefore, in close proximity to education officials and the political class. Where there are buildings, they are missing windowpanes, doors, paint and even doors. The sanitation facilities are inadequate, security is lax and access is not controlled, while the playgrounds are rocky with uneven surfaces risking the lives and limbs of children. In most cases, private schools look better organised and my guess is that this is a contributor to the desire for all who can afford to have their children learn in private schools. There is a need for a change of mindset towards public schools which will, in turn, improve our desire to make them better for learning to take place. Kisii
