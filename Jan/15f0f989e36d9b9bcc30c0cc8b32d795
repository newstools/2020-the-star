Moses Owiro a film producer, content creator and actor has created a Kenyan series, 'The Yard'. The series is based on a low-level drug dealer and aspiring rapper, Dash, who finally gets his chance to make it big in the Nairobi hip hop scene, but a case by the Criminal Investigations Department brought against his father threatens to derail his dreams and test his loyalties. Speaking to Word Is, Moses says the series' target audience is Kenyan youth who identify themselves as creatives. 'The Yard' has actual musicians (Fena Gitu, Linda Muthama and Barak Jacuzzi) and media personalities (Angela Muiruri, DJ Kace, Wanjira Longeue), who play themselves but on a fictional plot. The series won the best TV Series and Best Web Series at the Zanzibar International Film festival.Â  The first episode is being released today on YouTube.
