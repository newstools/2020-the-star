Nakumatt Supermarket has been liquidated after creditors vote on Tuesday for its dissolution. The secured creditors are to be paid the little amount obtained from sold assets. The creditors' meeting comes just days after the administrator ruled out the possibility of resuscitating the retailer which owes creditors at least Sh39 billion. Peter Kahi, the court-appointed administrator of the retail chain that went under in January 2018, had last week given creditors 72 hours to submit their claims, following an independent audit that cast doubt of the firm’s ability to return to profitability.
