Homeboyz coach Jason Hector believes there is still room for improvement for his charges despite a good run of form in the Kenya Cup. The Deejays currently sit third on the log on 44 points one point behind champions KCB and six behind leaders Kabras with just five matches to go to the end of the group phase at the end of next month. The South African tactician said he was keeping his charges grounded and focused. "We can't get ahead of ourselves. We are in a  good position but there are certain facets of play we can still improve on heading into the playoffs,” said Hector. Hector's charges have lost only twice this season, 27-24 to champions KCB and 18-17 to Mwamba and Hector hoped his charges will be in peak condition come the playoffs in March. “We need to build momentum from now until the end of the season and ensure our players are in the right shape and frame of mind. Hector was non-committal if his side can surpass either KCB or Kabras in the standings before the playoffs. "We will take one game at a time. Our target will be to win all our remaining matches," he added. The Deejays have a date with Quins on Saturday at the RFUEA ground before tackling Nakuru, Oilers, Western Bulls and then a rematch with KCB. "We are meeting teams who want to be in the playoffs and so the games are going to be competitive. We can't allow our standards to slip, instead, we must at our best,” added Hector For the match against Quins and Nakuru, Homeboyz will be without Alvin 'Buffa' Otieno, Jeff Oluoch and Bush Mwale, who are with the Kenya Sevens team for the World Sevens Series in Hamilton and Sydney, starting this weekend.
