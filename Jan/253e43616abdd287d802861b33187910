An MP has asked the government to hire more teachers and set aside funds to build classrooms to attain the 100 per cent transition. Limuru MP Peter Mwathi said since the drive to ensure all students who sit their KCPE exams transition to secondary schools started, the infrastructure has been overstretched by the high number of students enrolled. He said schools that used to admit 40 students now enrol more than 80 students in Form 1. Mwathi said CDF cash is not enough to build classrooms each year for every secondary school in a constituency. He said some MPs have asked the education parliamentary committee to come up with infrastructure grants as part of the solution. "The 100 per cent transition is good. We would not want it to fail. The problem is overcrowding of students in a classroom," Mwathi said. He also appealed to the Teachers Service Commission to employ more secondary school teachers to handle the increasing number of students.
