Former Kasipul MP Oyugi Magwanga has urged police in Homa Bay to investigate causes fires that destroy property in town markets. Speaking on Friday when he visited traders who lost property in the recent Homa Bay town fire,  Magwanga said security personnel should investigate what causes the fire incidents. He said this would enable stakeholders to get ways of curbing them in the future. “We cannot prevent these fire incidents if we don’t know what causes them. I urge security personnel in the county to investigate and help us know the cause,” Magwanga said. Traders in Homa Bay and Ndhiwa towns have lost property of more than 40milions in various fire incidents that burnt down their business premises in the recent past. The latest incident occurred in Ndhiwa town on the eve of Christmas day after a similar tragedy occurred in Homa Bay town six days earlier. Homa Bay town has experienced numerous fire incidents prior to the festive season. The former MP said the incidents might discourage residents from doing business. “Investing in business is not easy but it is unfortunate that for residents to continue losing property in this manner,”  Magwanga said. He challenged the Homa Bay government to put in place proper modalities of fighting fire to cushion residents from massive loss of property during fire. “Let the county government put proper measures of disaster preparedness. The county currently has fire fighting engines but it needs to make them more active to help fight fire,” he said. The former MP also challenged all eight MPs and woman representative in the county to set aside funds from the emergency kitty in the NGCDF and NGAAF to help address emergencies in Homa Bay town. “Homa Bay is a cosmopolitan town which is occupied by residents of all the eight constituencies in this county. Let the legislators also contribute funds in rescuing it from destruction by fire,” Magwanga added.
