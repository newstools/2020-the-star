Nairobi County Assembly Minority Chief Whip Peter Imwatok has vowed to teach Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria a lesson  if he continues to 'disrespect' ODM leader Raila Odinga. Addressing the media on Monday at his office in the assembly premises, he said he will not sit back and watch Kuria throw insults at Odinga On Saturday in Mombasa during the Building Bridges Initiative rally, Imwatok and Kuria were involved in a confrontation on the dais over seating arrangements. In what he described as "bullying" and being manhandled , Kuria claimed that Imwatok took his seat and grabbed his BBI branded cap at the Mama Ngina Drive where the function was held. The MP complained about the matter to Raila. He said, "Dear Raila Amolo Odinga. This is MCA Peter Imwatok of Makongeni, Nairobi, who accosted me, took away my BBI hat and even my seat at the Mombasa BBI meeting. "He is also the ODM minority whip in Nairobi County. My fault? Refusing to stand up when Baba entered the venue. Question: Baba is this how Kenya would be if you were to become president?" However, Imwatok who doubles as Makongeni ward rep justified his action, saying he acted in a point of "intervention" when he heard the MP insulting Raila. He explained that Kuria hurled insults at Raila in his mother tongue as he swayed his hands in the air. “Where I was born in Makongeni, if a small boy pockets while the elders are passing, his age mates will remove his hands from his pockets forcefully. Therefore as the sons of Raila Odinga and President Uhuru Kenyatta we will not sit back and allow Kuria to disrespect and humiliate everyone across the country. We will not tolerate the continued disrespect of Kuria to senior politicians ,” Imwatok said.
