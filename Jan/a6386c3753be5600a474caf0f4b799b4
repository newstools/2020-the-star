The rate at which boys are dropping out of school in Lamu is worrying and this might in the future lead to increased crime, the education office has said. County Director of Education Joshua Kaaga said on Saturday there are fewer boys in schools compared to girls. He said all the focus is on the girls and the boys have been neglected. “It’s a worrying trend. Most education campaigns are focused on girls. The boy child is forgotten and its affecting his performance in school and in life. We need to put similar effort into their [boys] education, else we risk raising criminals. We must do something now,” Kaaga said. Lamu county has only two boys secondary schools – Lamu Boys and Mpeketoni secondary schools. There are five girls’ schools. The rest are mixed secondary schools. Kaaga said there is an urgent need to balance infrastructure development in all schools so that both boys and girls can enjoy a conducive and productive learning environment and an equal education opportunity. He also urged education stakeholders to encourage boys to stay in school. “The girls have been empowered. There are more girls attending school now compared to boys. Their schools have better amenities too. Let’s strive to strike a balance and have all these children on the same pedestal,” the educationist added. Lamu county commissioner Irungu Macharia announced on Thursday that parents whose children will be found loitering during school hours will be arrested and charged with denying their children education. He said the move is meant to keep parents in check and ensure they take up their role. He said free primary school education is meant to ensure all children enjoy the right to education and any action by parents or guardians otherwise infringes on that right. “My officers have strict orders to look out for any school children who won’t be in school for whichever reason and arrest the parents and have them presented in court. Our children must learn no matter what,” Macharia said.
