Manchester United captain Ashley Young has opened talks over a move to Inter Milan. It is understood no decision has been made yet by United about whether Young will be allowed to leave Old Trafford this month. The 34-year-old’s future is expected to become clear in the next 24 hours. As his contract expires at the end of the season, he is now free to talk to clubs outside of England. Young was left out of the United squad for Tuesday’s 3-1 Carabao Cup defeat by Manchester City. United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said after the game that ‘it was not the right time’ to discuss Young’s future, adding: “We can’t weaken ourselves, we need to strengthen ourselves, if any movement is going to happen.” Young joined United from Aston Villa in 2011 and was part of squads that won the Premier League, FA Cup and EFL Cup. Meanwhile, Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Moussa Sissoko has been ruled out until April after having knee surgery. Sissoko, 30, injured the medial collateral ligament (MCL) in his right knee during Spurs’ 1-0 defeat at Southampton on New Year’s Day. The France international has featured in 20 of Spurs’ 21 Premier League games this season, scoring twice. The club said his recovery will be monitored with ‘a view to returning to training in early April’. Last week, Tottenham announced striker Harry Kane will be sidelined with a torn hamstring, although no timescale was given for the England captain’s return. Spurs are sixth in the Premier League, five points behind fourth-placed Chelsea.
