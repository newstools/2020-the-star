A Milimani court has issued a warrant of arrest against ex-Kasarani MP Elizabeth Ongoro’s husband for absconding court in Sh 48 million embezzlement case. Magistrate Lawrence Mugambi issued the warrant despite Ferdinand Masha Kenga’s lawyer saying he had been taken ill and could not attend court. “I hereby issue a warrant of arrest to the second accused person noting that his advocate does not know where he is and there are no medical records to prove his medical condition,” Mugambi said. In October, eight people including former Kasarani CDF officials were charged with embezzlement of Sh48 million public funds meant for construction of the Kasarani Girl's High School. They are Silvan Thomas, Pamela Achola, Jecinta Akoth, Nashon Okumu, Kefa Omanga, Douglas Ntaine, Peter Otingo and Vitalis Ogingo Obunga. Kenga adds to seven other people that the court has issued warrants of arrest against for failing to attend court in the case. In November, the Milimani court issued a warrant for the arrest of Ruth Kanini Kitony, a Kenyan diplomat serving in Malaysia, over embezzlement of the funds. Mugambi ordered the arrest of the Kuala Lumpur-based diplomat alongside seven people who failed to turn up in court to answer to charges of conspiring to steal Sh48 million. Kitony, who was employed by the CDF board as a District Development Officer before her appointment as a diplomat, did not present herself to the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) for processing. She also failed to present herself to the court for prosecution.
