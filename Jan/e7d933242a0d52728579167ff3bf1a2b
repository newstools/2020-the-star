Every Kenyan should take time to scrutinise the Building Bridges Initiative report to make informed decisions on its contents, Water CS Simon Chelugui has said. Chelugui said he has read the BBI report and he is satisfied that it is a good document. “It is time individuals, leaders and respective communities in Kenya are allowed to go through it and discuss before finally being called for a referendum,” he said. The CS spoke on Saturday during the funeral of the five youths who died in a road accident in Eldama-Ravine, Baringo county on New Year's eve. “The document proposes a president, his deputy and a prime minister and to me that is fine,” he said. Chelugui said there was nothing wrong with changing the title of cabinet secretaries to cabinet ministers because they will still serve the same duties. He termed those politicising the report as cowards. “Even an expectant woman or an initiate no longer requires a speech to act, if the fixed time is today then there will be no room for unworthy excuses,” he said. The CS urged leaders to gather their people and discuss the document conclusively to make informed decisions about it. “Because I believe every tribe in Kenya has got an equal political interest going into the 2022 general election,” he said. Also present at the funeral were Eldama-Ravine MP Moses Lessonet, Baringo Governor Stanley Kiptis, Woman Representative Gladwell Cheruiyot, National Filims Association chairman Jackson Kosgei and assembly Majority leader Lawi Kipchumba. Kiptis called on the residents to read the document before settling on their decision. But residents said that they are yet to receive the printed copies of the BBI report. “We hope it is on the way coming and we will push the government to fast-track the printing of more copies,” Lessonet said.
