The High Court has declined to stop the swearing in of Ferdinand Waititu's deputy. The impeached Kiambu Governor had moved to court to stop the swearing in of James Nyoro that is to take place today in Kiambu. But Justice Justice Weldon Korir maintained the parties should appear on Monday before Justice James Makau for hearing inter parties as had earlier been directed.

This court will be over stepping its mandate by ordering the judge not to proceed with the swearing in.In the circumstances, order cannot be issued"  More to follow
