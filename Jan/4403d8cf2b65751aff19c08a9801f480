A 21-year-old man suspected to have defiled and murdered a schoolgirl, 12, in Ndhiwa constituency was arraigned on Monday. Kenneth Owuor appeared before Ndhiwa principal magistrate Mary Ochieng’ but failed to take a plea after the police requested a 14-day extension of time to enable them to complete investigations. The suspect allegedly committed the offence on December 28 last year. The court ordered that he be detained for 10 days at Ndhiwa police station. Owuor pleaded for a bond, saying he was ready to cooperate with investigators. "I'll be available during court proceedings and promise not to interfere with the case," Owuor said. But the prosecution, led by Ishmael Kiragu, objected saying the suspect should remain in custody until investigations are completed. "The suspect hasn’t taken a plea to be issued with a bond. Any freedom accorded the suspect is likely to make him interfere with the investigations," Kiragu said. The case will be mentioned on January 17. On Monday, MCA Nicholas Owaka urged the police to ensure the suspect face legal action. “Sexual offence cases are rife in Ndhiwa because of such behaviour. There is a need for people who violate minors' rights to get punished,” he said. The victim's body was found dumped at the roadside, with blood coming out of her nose. An examination of her body showed she was defiled then murdered. Her case adds to other multiple cases within the same area. Villagers threatened not to bury the body until all suspects are arrested and charged.
