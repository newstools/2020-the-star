A union on Thursday condemned attacks on teachers over poor performance in last year’s national exams. Kenya Union of Post Primary Education Teachers (Kuppet) called on Education Cabinet Secretary George Magoha and the Teachers Service Commission (TSC) to step in, investigate and ensure the safety of educators. The call came a day after a teacher was lynched in Kitui county by parents who were protesting poor exam results. Daisy Mbaluka Mbithe, a primary school teacher, was reporting for the new term on Monday when parents attacked and set her body ablaze. Kuppet secretary general Akello Misori urged TSC to withdraw its teachers from the school. “We condemn this heinous act. It is inconceivable that learning can take place in the environment created by this killing," Misori said. "We urge the Education CS to close down the school to allow for investigations into the crime.” Misori also called on the Director of Criminal Investigations to probe cases in six other counties where parents invaded schools and attacked or evicted teachers to protest against poor examination results. “Education stakeholders are concerned when our children fail in examinations. But exam failure cannot warrant the wanton criminality being perpetrated by parents around the country,” he said. Marker's pay The union also raised concerns over delayed payments for teachers contracted to mark the 2019 KCSE exams. Misori said they were to be paid in December, but the cash has not been released. He said it is disheartening for teachers to be kept waiting at a time when most need the money pay school fees and take care of their families. "After taking the examiners through a breakneck marking process, Knec is now playing ping pong games with the teachers over their pay," Misori said. Knec chief executive officer Mercy Karogo disputed the claims, saying plans to ensure the markers receive their pay are underway.
