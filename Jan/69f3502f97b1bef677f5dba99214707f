Kisumu Woman Representative Roza Buyu on Sunday termed remarks by Kandara MP Alice Wahome on President Uhuru Kenyatta's leadership as reckless and unfortunate. On Thursday, Wahome hit out at Uhuru accusing him of being a threat to the country’s democracy. She claimed that the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) was a plot by the President and ODM leader Raila Odinga to remain in power after the 2022 General Election. Wahome claimed that Raila was the President's new political mercenary for hire. “How can you say that Raila is a mercenary for hire? Raila will never be a mercenary for hire. If you look at his history and life, you will definitely know that he has always chosen the right road to get you to where we are, including being in detention," Buyu said. Buyu said Wahome is being used to openly rock the leadership of Uhuru and his handshake with Raila. Buyu, who is also the national vice-chairperson of the Kenya Women Parliamentary Association (KEWOPA), said women leaders must not allow themselves to be used to fight political wars. Instead, she said, they should take up their rightful position on service provision. “You must be respectful. You do not have to fight and abuse people to be presumed to be a good leader,” she said. She says any attempts to thwart the BBI idea by the likes of Wahome shall be defeated. Buyu spoke in Kisumu at Ragumo chiefs’ camp in Kolwa East, where she led a relief food distribution exercise. Hundreds of residents received rice, beans and maize from the national government.
