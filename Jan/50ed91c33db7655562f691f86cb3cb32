Marsabit county government has issued 1,350 title deeds to residents of Sagante in Saku constituency. The issuance of titles came after 750 title deeds were issued to Karare residents in Saku subcounty. Marsabit governor Mohamud Ali while issuing titles to beneficiaries told them not to sell their land but instead use it to develop themselves. He said land adjudication is ongoing across the county and promised to give more titles. There was jubilation at Kubi dibayu cultural site when residents handed over the land documents they had waited for for decades. He stated that the title deed issuance is part of his government plan to empower residents to develop themselves. "Titles restore dignity to the people by giving ownership of their land," he said.
