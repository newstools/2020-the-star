Good evening, Impeached Governor Ferdinand Waititu petitioned the court over his impeachment, while the government confirmed the student admitted at KNH over coronavirus is in stable condition. Meanwhile, Kiambu Deputy Governor James Nyoro's swearing-in has been postponed, while the deputy IG has warned police against brutality against journalists. From cringe-worthy statements such as suggesting that landlords should be forced to 'divert rivers' instead of having their property demolished; to being captured on video throwing stones at people he claimed were land grabbers, impeached Governor Ferdinand Waititu never fails to court controversy. Waititu is currently the second governor under the 201o Constitution to be impeached by the Senate. The student who was put in an isolation ward at Kenyatta National Hospital suspected to have the Coronavirus is now stable, the government has said. Spokesman Cyrus Oguna said the male student is still however been monitored for further observation.  Deputy Inspector General of Police Edward Mbugua has cautioned the uniformed men and women against brutalising journalists. Mbugua in a memo on to the officers said stern action will be taken against officers who will be found guilty of harassing journalists.  The swearing-in of new Kiambu Governor James Nyoro has been cancelled over unavoidable reasons. "...the swearing in of Dr James Nyoro will not be conducted today. A new date will be communicated in due course. We apologise for any inconvenience caused," Judiciary said in a statement on Thursday. Three people have been arrested and smuggled goods recovered along the Garissa-Thika highway. Police manning a roadblock on Thursday intercepted a bus carrying contraband products from Dadaab to Nairobi.
