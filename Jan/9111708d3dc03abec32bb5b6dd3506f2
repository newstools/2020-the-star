 A rancher was on Monday killed by a buffalo in a game ranch in Kongoni, near Naivasha. A worker at the ranch was seriously injured during the attack. The two were working in the ranch near Lake Oloidien when the wild animal attacked. Hellsgate National Park's warden in charge Lillian Ajuoga said the buffalo was later shot dead. “We had a sad incident where two workers from one of the game ranches in Kongoni area were attacked by a buffalo and one of them died,” Ajuoga said. The buffalo gored the two as they screamed for help according to a witness who did not want to be named. They were rescued by security guards and rushed to Naivasha Subcounty Hospital. “The vet was confirmed dead on arrival while the other worker was referred to Kijabe Mission Hospital for specialised treatment,” Ajuoga said. Last week, the government said it had used Sh1.2 billion to compensate victims of human-wildlife conflict with 163 people losing their lives over the last five years. Elsewhere, a fisherman drowned in Lake Naivasha while on an illegal fishing mission. This brings to three the number of foot and line fishermen who have drowned in the water body since the year began. Naivasha Boat Owners Association chairman David Kilo said the man was fishing in Tarambeta area of Kasarani when he drowned. He said the number of illegal fishermen was on the rise, saying they were the biggest victims of drowning. “The majority of those who drowned fell into underwater tunnels left behind by flower farmers and its time the county government addressed this issue of illegal fishermen,” Kilo said. He said none of the four patrol boats from the county government were operational, making it a field day for illegal fishermen.  edited by p. obuya
