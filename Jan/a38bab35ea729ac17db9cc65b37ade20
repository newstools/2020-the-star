A German national has been charged with the theft of agro-chemicals from Rosendahi farm in Moiben, Uasin Gishu county. Alexander Hergen denied the charges on Monday. He was released on Sh1 million cash bail and ordered to deposit his passport. Eldoret senior resident magistrate Richard Odenyo ruled the prosecution had not presented sufficient evidence to warrant his continued detention. Hergen allegedly committed the alleged offence between September 2017 and February 2018 at Rosendahi farm where he had been the manager. He was arrested at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport in Nairobi. He was awaiting a flight to Germany, police said. Hergen's arrest marked the end of a cat-and-mouse chase since 2017 when he allegedly went underground after he was linked with the theft. Investigating officer Isaac Koskei told the court Hergen was planning to flee the country after learning of his imminent arrest. Through his defence lawyers, Hergen accused the police of misleading the court that he was planning to flee the country when he was arrested at the airport. The magistrate set the hearing for January 28. (Edited by V. Graham)
