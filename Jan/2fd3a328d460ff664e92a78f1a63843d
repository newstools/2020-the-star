2013 World Junior champion Alfred Kipketer is the latest Kenyan athlete to be provisionally suspended by the Athletics Integrity Unit for doping violations. Kipketer, was suspended for failing to avail himself for doping tests contrary to the AIU’s article 2.4 which says: “Any combination of three Missed Tests and/or Filing Failures, as defined in the International Standard for Testing and Investigations, within a twelve-month period by an Athlete in a Registered Testing Pool.” AIU adds that: "a Provisional Suspension imposed in a non-doping case does not in any way abrogate the presumption of innocence and it is not an early determination of guilt. Rather, it is an order made on a precautionary basis to safeguard the interests of the sport." Kipketer’s case comes just days after former marathon world-record holder Wilson Kipsang was suspended for a similar violation.
