Kisumu RFC coach Brian Makalama is upbeat that the five new signings will help the club maintain their Kenya Cup status. The club has signed Kenya Cup log leaders Kabras duo of Washington Ombima and Teddy Omondi. Other new signings are lock Kelly Fredricks from nationwide side Kisumu RFC, full back Ryan Moses (Maseno) and prop Maximilian Simiyu (Bungoma). The club has lost Ian Wamalwa and Biko Masiva who have joined Mwamba. Bill Arigi has also left Kisumu for Impala Saracens. The club's team manager Caleb Kiprotich, however, disputed reports that they have sold Samuel Onyango to Homeboyz. “He is still our player,” he said. In an interview yesterday,  Makalama said: “The new signings' key role is to compliment the team. I expect them to express themselves freely and enjoy their game.” Ahead of tomorrow's clash with Kenya Cup champions Kenya Commercial Bank at Mamboleo ASK show ground in Kisumu, Makalama admitted he is under pressure having won only one game. “The pressure is there but we strive to remain in Kenya Cup. We play against KCB who are the champions and the boys must be mentally strong and believe in themselves,” he said. Last weekend, Kisumu lost 45-15 against Kenya Harlequins while KCB thumped Blak Blad 81-10. Kisumu remain rooted at the bottom of the table with five points after 10 outings and Makalama said the trend will change in the second leg of the top tier. Kisumu and Kenyatta University's Blak Blad occupy the last two positions on the table. Blak Blad hosts ninth-placed Western Bulls at Kenyatta University grounds.
