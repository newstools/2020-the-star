 Nairobi matatu owners have challenged in court increased parking fees imposed by the county government, saying there was no public participation. The Federation of Public Transport on Thursday asked the court to block the implementation of the new charges, saying the move was illegal. The federation has sued the Nairobi county government together with county assembly. It says the decision to increase parking fees was illegal because there was no proper public participation as required by law. The county issued a public notice on December 3, 2019 to notify the public that its Finance Act 2015 had been operationalised due to unavoidable circumstances hence the upward adjustment of parking fees. Charges for 1-13 seater matatu was increased to Sh5,000 with those carrying between 14 and 41 passengers required to pay Sh8,000 per month. Buses with a capacity of more than 42 passengers are charged Sh10,000. The county also imposed a daily fee of Sh1,000 for buses, a charge the federation said will have a ripple effect on fares paid by commuters. The federation told court the county failed to ensure there was ample security in its parking bays before asking for more money. “It is common knowledge that many motorists pay parking boys for security because the respondent does not provide security even after receiving parking fees,” the federation said. The federation noted that no reasonable cause has been given by City Hall for the increase of parking fees at a time when most consumers were struggling to provide basic needs for their families. 'The county government has not demonstrated it needs more funds on parking as it has never fully accounted for proceeds of parking fees confirming our fears that if the increase is not stopped it will lead to harassment of federation members." The federation together with the national confederation of matatu transporters control 95 per cent of public transport vehicles in Nairobi and its environs.  edited by peter obuya
