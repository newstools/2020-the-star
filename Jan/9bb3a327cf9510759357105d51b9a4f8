Embattled Kiambu Governor Ferdinand Waititu on Thursday petitioned the High court over his impeachment. The matter has been certified urgent. Senators on Wednesday upheld Waititu's  impeachment, following three charges. The first charge was gross violation of the Constitution, Public Finance Management Act and PPD Act. For this charge, 27 senators upheld the charge, while 12 voted in the governor's favour. In the second charge - crimes under the national law, 28 senators upheld the charge, while 11 voted to drop the charge. In the third charge - abuse of office - 28 voted to uphold the charge, while 11 voted to drop it. Waititu became the second governor to have the Senate uphold his impeachment. His petition will be heard inter partes on Monday. Meanwhile, the swearing in of James Nyoro as the new governor was on Thursday cancelled over 'unavoidable reasons'. "...the swearing in of Dr James Nyoro will not be conducted today. A new date will be communicated in due course. We apologise for any inconvenience caused," Judiciary said in a statement on Thursday. High Court Judge John Onyiego  was to swear in Nyoro in a ceremony to be held in Kiambu county at 8am. Speaker of the County Assembly Stephen Ndichu and County Commissioner Wilson Wanyaga had arrived at county headquarters by 10am. Earlier, pro-Nyoro leaders led by MCAs, friends and relatives were in frenzied mood anticipating swearing in of their new Kiambu Governor. They danced and sang as they eagerly awaited for the moment of truth. According to the Kenyan constitution, If a vacancy occurs in the office of county governor, the deputy county governor shall assume office as county governor for the remainder of the term of the county governor.
