Former Vice PresidentKalonzo Musyoka has urged Kenyans to support the Building Bridges Initiative and a referendum to change the leadership structure in the Constitution. Kalonzo said Kenyans should supportÂ  BBI in one voice without division and said leaders should not use the BBI meeting platforms to plant enmity. The Wiper leader urged Kenyans not to be swayed distracted by the political noise and focus on the issues in the BBI report. "This year should be a referendum year. You cannot touch those chapters in the Constitution like the Bill of Law and Structure of the Government without going to the people and only through BBI can we achieve this," he said on Sunday in Mavoko. "So we should be prepared to speak one voice and support BBI in a non-contested referendum," Kalonzo said. Speaking in Machakos where he MCAs from the three Ukambani countries, Kalonzo leaders were free to campaign for the BBI in any part of the country without being harassed. "I see nothing wrong with that, we are a free country and you cannot be bullied for your opinion. So let us come up with a document to guide the future generations of this country," he said.
