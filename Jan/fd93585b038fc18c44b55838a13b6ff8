Ever wondered why some people in Kenya behave as if they own the country and its people? Others have a tight grip of their communities, tribes, clans and other social units; not to offer cogent solutions and broader understanding of what the people's needs are, but to lord over them and make sure their not very people-centric ideas carry the day. To gain knowledge of this, one need not look further than the current crop of leaders, both in the ruling and opposition ranks. Today, members of the opposition are the greatest and loudest proponents of abuse of power by the state officers. They brag about being in the government as if some Kenyans are outsiders in their own country. Slightly over a year ago, they were talking secession but having 'seen the light', are bombarding people's ears with their newfound status and exhibiting childish if not rudderless excitement. One may be forgiven to think that all of a sudden we have got the panacea to all our problems. While their closeness to power in the past never yielded much to the people, every time they are invited to the dining table, they behave as if that was the reason they were yapping and yelling while outside the tent. Some of the changes to the Constitution being proposed by the opposition just show how their previous noise rang hollow and deceptive. They are proposing that changes for the removal the constitutional safeguards be effected to serve their myopic, narrow and retrogressive agenda. They look at the law with certain people in the mind. Law is no longer crafted for prosperity but to fix others and gain or retain power. They have shown a perplexing eagerness to roll back all the democratic gains just for the sake of power. It's time Kenyans of goodwill rose to the occasion to safeguard their liberty.  Economic and political analyst
