Drama unfolded at a secondary school in Bomet central yesterday after angry parents stormed the institution demanding answers about poor KCSE results. More than 200 parents of Kwenikabilet forced their way into the school compound at 10am, bringing learning activities to a halt for more than two hours. Chanting 'Principal must go' and waving placards, the parents expressed their disappointment at what they termed as mass failure over the years. In last year's KCSE results, the school had a mean score of 2.6 while in 2018 it had 2.3. In Mathematics, which the principal teaches, the school had 24 Es while in Chemistry they were 21. Reached for comment, principal David Langat said he was not to blame, adding that for a school to post good results there must be concerted efforts among all stakeholders. Led by Andrew Bosuben, the parents asked Education CS George Magoha to bring in a new team to improve performance. Bosuben said the principal had overstayed and that there was a poor working relationship with the teachers. "Indiscipline in this school is at its peak but those responsible are doing little to check that," he said. Parents Ann Chumo and Raston Korir said exam failure in the school has been the norm. "As other schools are celebrating the good results of their children we are left to contend with the shame. That is why today we are saying enough is enough," Korir said. Joseph Langat, a village elder, accused the principal and board of management of failing to convene a meeting with stakeholders to address poor performance in the school. "These people have never at any time invited us for a meeting to discuss ways of ensuring better results are achieved in this school. That is why we blame them," he said.
