Deputy Governor Moses Mulomi on Tuesday said Busia is one of the most vulnerable parts of the country and the least prepared to fight locusts in case of an invasion. "This is something that can get us all off-track in terms of our economic development, in particular, our food security. With the effort being put in place by the government, we hope the spread of the pests will be controlled," he said. Mulomi, an entomologist, urged the government to ensure the chemicals used to control the voracious pests do not harm plants and animals. He said although aerial spraying is usually effective, ground spraying is also necessary to control the insects at the young stages. "We need to be prepared and keen on environmental management to ensure that the chemicals used do not harm plants and animals," Mulomi said. He said people should be trained to identify the pest. The deputy governor further said swams of locusts are still munching their way into counties and many more are still coming in from Somalia. Last week, Agriculture PS Hamadi Boga said more resources were needed to exterminate the insects. Boga assured Kenyans that the pesticides being used are effective, saying ministry officials are touring sprayed areas to ensure the pests are dead. "The chemicals are not harmful to people and their livestock."
