The move by Education ministry to extend Form 1 admissions by a week to ensure 100 per cent transition to secondary school has minimal chances of bearing fruits. Some counties, particularly in the Coastal, Northeastern and North Rift, have already recorded a lower number than was expected, a matterÂ that has drawn concern among stakeholders. Going by the recent numerous incidents of learners who used all desperate means to get into school for lack of school fees, there must be many more who are yet to enrol to Form 1 for financial reasons. The best way to see that a satisfactory number join Form 1 will probably use the local leaders to identify those who have not joined and do their best to see how they can help them move to the next level of education. In future, the government should then consider making secondary education free.  Nairobi
