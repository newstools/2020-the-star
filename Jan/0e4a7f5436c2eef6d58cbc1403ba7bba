The Senate has rejected the motion seeking to establish an 11-member committee to investigate the impeachment of Kiambu Governor Ferdinand Waititu. Sections of the senators who were called from recess had proposed that the committee be chaired by Kakamega Senator Cleophas Malala and be deputised by Nakuru's Susan Kihika. However, after a 10-minute adjournment, the senators voted to have Waititu's investigations done in the plenary. The senators further agreed that the house should stick to regulations barring senators coming from counties whose governors are facing impeachment from debating on the floor of the house. The embattled governor is facing impeachment after Kiambu MCAs voted to remove the county chief on December 19 for alleged gross misconduct and abuse of office. The impeachment split Jubilee senators, with those allied to President Uhuru Kenyatta pushing for the upholding of the assembly’s decision while DP William Ruto’s supporters opposing it. There has been intense lobbying by both camps. Waititu, his wife Susan Wangari, and eight others are facing graft cases after being accused of irregularly awarding themselves Sh580 million tenders. Waititu also faces charges of abuse of office by awarding tenders to get kickbacks Speaker Kenneth Lusaka said the Senate will sit at 2.30pm on Tuesday to consider the ouster bid after the House Business Committee ratified it yesterday. The sitting followed a petition by Majority leader Kipchumba Murkomen, backed by at least 15 senators. As a result,  Waititu and the MCAs will appear before the full house during the sitting to defend their cases. The matter will then be debated a vote taken the same day.
