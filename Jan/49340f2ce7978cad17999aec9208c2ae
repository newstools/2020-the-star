A Nairobi court has restrained six people including the owners of Anointed Academy from selling or building on a property where Goodrich Schools stands. The two schools are located in adjacent parcels of land at the border of Mukuru Kwa Njenga and Imara Daima. The Goodrich Schools is a private facility built on land where the Mukuru Community Centre (MCC) a public primary and secondary school that admitted pupils from around the constituency was located. Senior resident magistrate David Mbeja restrained Josphat Murimi, Evans Murage, Joseph Njoroge, Julius Chale Mupio, Philip Mula Kimeu and Pastor Nimrod Mwangi from interfering with the property. Goodrich Schools claims that Anointed Academy on December 27 last year commenced construction on the parcel on the Embakasi deputy county commissioner's instructions. “The school has already suffered damage to property and reputation as students are being withdrawn for fear of their safety and will continue to suffer harm,” Goodrich Schools says. Through lawyer Elkanah Mogaka, Goodrich claims that they are the purchaser for value of all that parcel of land and they have the registered title. While seeking the orders, Goodrich Schools said that on December 21, last year, thugs landed on the suit property and for over five hours damaged classrooms, buses and a wall. Mogaka further claims that Goodrich runs a school where young children and minors attend and whose safety is threatened by the incessant infighting between the parties. The school further claims that the Embakasi deputy county commissioner has already threatened to take over the property purporting it to be public land. Further, he claims that Goodrich Schools pupils are expected to report to school today (January 8) and not granting orders meant harm to the pupils.
