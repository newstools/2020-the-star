Chief Justice David Maraga has now changed tune saying that he cannot attempt to try and ridicule the president. "He is not only the chief of the executive but the head of state. He is the unifying factor. And I recognise that Your Excellency," he said. "When I had a press conference last December, I raised a few issues that some of which have been misunderstood. I saw from social media that the arms of the government are at loggerheads. That's not right and that is not correct," Maraga said. The CJ spoke on Thursday at the Supreme court during the official release of the State of the Judiciary and Administrative of Justice Report. Last year, Maraga vowed not to attend some state functions unless the government starts treating him and the Judiciary with respect. "Unless I am treated with the respect I deserve, I will choose state functions to attend," Maraga said during a press conference. "The CJ is not accorded the respect accorded to his office. CSs and PSs are cleared to enter in places before the Chief Justice." But on Thursday, Maraga said he and President Uhuru Kenyatta are on a different league. "You are in a senior league.. mine is on a lower level.. my league is with that of the Speaker of the National Assembly and the Senate.. that is where I belong ...the other officials of government are below us.." Noting that he runs an institution which is like a hospital, Maraga said he will be the last person to stand and try to talk back at Uhuru, Deputy President William Ruto ODM leader Raila Odinga. "I will be the last person to stand and try to talk badly...why do I say so,.. mimi si rika yako (I am not your age mate).. you play from a different league," he said. "There can be a few disagreements here and there I am one person who respects authority.. I will be the last person to stand and appear like nakusomea (I am scolding you) .." he said.
