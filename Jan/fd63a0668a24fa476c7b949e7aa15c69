Embakasi East MP Babu Owino has urged Kenyans to wait for his side of the story over the shooting incident at B-Club last Friday. "I urge Kenyans to wait for my side of the story of what happened when I come from my new home at Industrial area prison," Babu tweeted. The MP said that he needs justice and it must be served to him, adding "meanwhile these are occupational hazards." Babu Owino was on Monday charged with the attempted murder of Felix Odhiambo, popularly known as DJ Evolve, at B-club. He was also charged with behaving in a disorderly manner while carrying a firearm. Babu appeared before chief magistrate Francis Andayi on Monday and denied all charges preferred against him. He was represented by lawyers Danstan Omari, Cliff Ombeta and five others. The prosecution opposed his release on bail or bond, saying he is likely to interfere with witnesses since he is an influential man. He will remain in remand for seven days. The court ordered that aÂ  bail report be filed by the probation department within seven days. The court will rule on whether he will be granted bail on January 27.
