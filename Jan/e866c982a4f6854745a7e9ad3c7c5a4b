The Director of Public Prosecution Noordin Haji has asked the public to ignore ongoing rumours that his office has cleared Maasai Mara University Vice-Chancellor Mary Walingo. The VC is facing allegations of embezzling the university's funds. Haji's commented through the ODPP's official Twitter page saying that the prosecution is still reviewing Waringo's file and will give appropriate guidance once complete. The clarification came after one person on Twitter by the name Mwalimu Mutemi wa Kiama alleged that the VC had been cleared over graft charges. The DPP has urged the public to treat the information as false and malicious and aimed at interfering. It added that the rumours are meant to divert the attention and undermine the work of investigative and prosecution agencies. The VC had recorded the statement late last year on the allegations facing her. On September 2019, an expose by a local tv station dubbed "Mara Heist" alleged that the university officials were squandering the institute's funds. Walingo was grilled at the DCI headquarters to explain how the university withdrew more than Sh190 million from the university bank's account without following due process. Informers wrote their statement at DCI alleging that university's money was being mismanaged. The Kenya Universities Staff Union and the University and Academic Staff Union said Walingo is unfit to occupy public office. Uasu secretary-general Constantine Wasonga said in September after the expose that the VC  should step aside to allow for investigations. Kusu secretary-general Charles Mukhwaya said the professor, who is accused of presiding over runaway graft at the institution, fails to inspire confidence and should step aside until she is cleared by investigating authorities. "She demonstrated that she will go an extra mile to have staff standing on her gravy train route harmed," he said.
