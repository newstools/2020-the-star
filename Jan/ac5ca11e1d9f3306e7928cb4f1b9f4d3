COTU Chairman Francis Atwoli has said that anyone who is against the BBI is pro Tangatanga and that "I will tell everyone in every constituency that we will do a research with universities and we will let you know who to elect. We are not leaving you without nothing. How many agree with this? I'm not going to let anyone behind. Atwoli will lead us. We are going to the government via BBI," Atwoli said. He went on to state that Kenya has two formations, the BBI and Tangatanga. "If you see anyone talking anything about the BBI or against Uhuru Kenyatta or against handshake then they belong to Tangatanga," Atwoli added. Atwoli spoke while in Bukhungu Stadium in Kakamega during the Raila Odinga BBI meeting. Meanwhile, ANC party leader, Musalia Mudavadi has cautioned leaders against using BBI to cause rifts with fellow leaders. "Kuna wengine hapa ambao juhudi yao ni kuleta porojo ambayo haina misingi,( there are some who are here whose agenda is to bring worthless gossip),"Â he said. "Hii siasa ya mchezo ya kujaribu kuleta utangano kati ya viongozi tuepukane nayo, mimi napenda amani na kukaa na Wakenya wote tukafanye kazi pamoja ( lets shun games of division , i love working with all Kenyans)," he said.
