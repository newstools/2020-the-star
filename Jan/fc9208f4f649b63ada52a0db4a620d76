Cotton farmers in Lamu have threatened to abandon the trade following the invasion of the crop by strange resistant pests that have cost them millions in losses. The region has over 10,000 cotton farmers with the major producing areas being Baharini, Uziwa, Tewe, Hongwe and Wetemere, Hindi and Witu in Lamu West. The crop is also grown in Faza island in Lamu East. Farmers in the region have frequently complained of invasion of their cotton farms by pests resistant to all pesticides used by farmers, thereby causing them immense losses. They are calling on the government to intervene and save the cotton sector from collapsing. Speaking at a meeting converged by cotton farmers in Mpeketoni on Tuesday, Lamu County Cotton Farmers spokesperson Joseph Migwi said at least 5,000 farmers have since quit the trade due to the numerous challenges facing the cotton sector. They have instead opted to grow food crops and watermelons. “As farmers, we are really discouraged. Thousands have already quit and many more are on the way. Apart from the stubborn pests, there is also the issue of a cotton industry that is non-existent. Something needs to be done or else the trade will be history,” Migwi said. Mpeketoni cotton farmer Johnston Kamau said he quit after numerous losses and lack of market for the produce. Kamau said there is need for the county government to help by seeking ready markets for the produce because on many occasions, farmers have had to sell it to available middlemen at ridiculously low and unfair prices. “I now do watermelons on a large scale and it’s bringing in better returns than cotton. We need a cotton industry in place, good seeds, extension services and much more to make it even better,” he said. Farmers have also urged the government to sponsor research that will develop better cotton seeds that will be resistant to harsh conditions to boost production.
