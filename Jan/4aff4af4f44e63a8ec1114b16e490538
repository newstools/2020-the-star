Kaluluini men's handball team has the opportunity to win their first match of the season with a quartet of fixtures to look forward to this weekend. The team is without a point in eight attempts, the only winless side in the Kenya Handball Federation men's league. The bottom-placed side face Makueni Bees, fifth-ranked Buccaneers, General Service Unit and Kenyatta University. Makueni Bees have played the fewest number of games — four— winning two and losing two. Bucaneers have 19 points from 14 matches while the Paramilitary side have only won three of their nine matches to sit 18th on the log. Two wins for Kaluluini will move them to position 21 in the 25-team league. Other fixtures will see KU play Warriors as the Bees also tackle Administration Police, Generations and GSU. St. Paul's University raffle feathers with Warriors. The top four teams in the league,that is, Strathmore, Black Mamba, Kimilili-based Rangers and NCPD are not in action. The women's league resumes after more than one month break, where Kaluluini have three fixtures to play. First, they take to the field against National Youth Service before going toe-to-toe with National Cereals and Produce Board. Sunday will see the team entertain Rising Starlets.
