Ugunja MP Opiyo Wandayi has asked the Building Bridges Initiative Task Force to expedite the public forums to allow Kenyans to hold a referendum in April. Wandayi said the speedy implementation of the BBI report will pave way for the drafting of a referendum bill and questions for the citizens to vote on. The ODM party secretary of political affairs said that issues that could derail the process to June have been agreed upon by all Kenyans. “Over the weekend we saw even those who at first used to oppose the report struggling to be at the forefront in the Mombasa rally,” he said. The lawmaker said he trusts the BBI task force committee headed by Senator Yusuf Haji to do a commendable job. “We are only waiting for the task force to craft a bill and a referendum question. We don’t expect them to take more than two months on these,” Wandayi said. He spoke at the Ugunja NG-CDF office on Sunday. Wandayi asked the task force to plan for two meetings in two counties per day to pave the way for the referendum in April. “We want to do away with the practice of concentrating power in the hands of one person,” Wandayi said. He said in the new governing structure, the president and prime minister must share equal executive powers. The Ugunja legislator also backed the governor’s regional government proposal. He said that if the positions are entrenched in the Constitution, they will not be a preserve of the governors who have served for two terms. “As Parliamentary Accounts Committee chairman, we have issues with corruption and not the creation of positions. Again, there is no guarantee that the positions will be occupied by governors serving their two terms,” he said.
