The Building Bridges Initiative has noble intentions – to end decades of acrimonious political competition that has plagued our nation for nearly 60 years. Politicians, by virtue of their role as representatives of the people, have taken an inordinately strident role in recent public debates in Kisii and Kakamega. The highly-publicised Mombasa (January 25) meeting has the spectre of chaos and bloodshed hanging over it because our politicians have never let a chance to disagree violently go to waste. The fear of chaos has made organisers change the venue from Tononoka grounds, the home of major political meetings, to Mama Ngina Drive. They have unwisely resolved to dictate terms to a group of rivals coalescing around Deputy President William Ruto who initially rejected the BBI meetings (Kisii and Kakamega) as a waste of public cash and time. In the spirit of the handshake between President Uhuru Kenyatta and opposition chief Raila Odinga, they should demonstrate sobriety and leadership and play their part in creating a new nation by taking advantage of the new dawn. But typical of our politicians' notoriety for myopic and selfish grandstanding, they have resorted to what they know best – hurl threats and baseless ultimatums at each other. We call upon the police to deploy a well-equipped and robust team of men and women to keep troublemakers and their sponsors away from Mama Ngina Drive. We are fed up with politicians' insatiable appetite for self-serving one-upmanship in which the only thing that matters is their grating egos.
