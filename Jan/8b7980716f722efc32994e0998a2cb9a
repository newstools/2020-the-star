Regional low-cost carrier, Jambojet will sell over 10,000 tickets at the price of Sh2020 for the next three days as part of the New Year celebrations. The promotion, which started yesterday to Saturday, will see Jambojet sell 2,020 tickets to and from each of its five local destinations at the promotional price. The airline flies to five local destinations including Malindi, Ukunda, Mombasa, Kisumu and Eldoret from its hub in Nairobi. The tickets sold will be valid for travel from January 6 to March 31, 2020. According to CEO Jambojet Allan Kilavuka, the promotion is a reward to customers for their loyalty. “We are always looking for ways to reward our customers for their loyalty to us and this is one of the ways in which we are able to do this,’’ Kilavuka said. ''As we usher in the New Year, we want to assure all our customers that they can continue to fly Jambojet affordably, safely and conveniently,” he added. Last year, the airline carried similar promotions selling tickets for as low as Sh50 to celebrate its fifth year anniversary, seeking to revolutionalise flying. In November, Jambojet completed its inaugural Flight JM 8546 to Kigali, its second regional route after Uganda.
