Bahati MP Kimani Ngunjiri has surrendered his hunting rifle at the police station. Ngunjiri surrendered his rifle at Directorate of Criminal Investigations offices in Nakuru on Tuesday. He was carrying the brown rifle covered in white clothing as he walked to the offices. Ngunjiri is one of the government officials who was asked to surrender his weapons for his involvement in crime. Governors and MPs facing graft allegations will also lose their security detail following a directive by Inspector General of Police Hillary Mutyambai. The new directive means all Governors, MPs and any other leaders with state security who are facing criminal prosecution – graft related or otherwise – will have to seek alternative security and do without firearms. Ngunjiri was summoned to appear before the Directorate of Criminal Investigations headquarters in Nakuru over last week’s assertion that DP was kicked out of his official residence in Mombasa. He disclosed that he was ordered to surrender his guns and the licenses which are to be handed over to the authorities today.
