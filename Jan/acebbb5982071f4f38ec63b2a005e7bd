Willy Paul seems to have let things cool down in his beef with Ravyvanny, as he stepped into 2020 saying he didn’t want to go on holding a grudge. Pozze had accused the Tanzanian singer of stealing his song “Chuchuma” when the WCB singer shared a teaser of the song online. After the two songs were released, they appeared different but the beef continued. Paul said in a social media video, “Okay, what’s up, people. I would like to bring this to the attention of people. [Rayvanny] is trying to steal from a Kenyan. Yet all along Kenyans have supported their music. I have gotten support from his country as well." "Someone is stealing my idea. It is so painful. You cannot do that to a brother. You cannot steal and get away with it. My friend listen, nobody steals from Pozee!” he said in a video. But now they seem to have buried the hatchet. Willy Paul shared a collabo he did with Vanny Boy called “Mmmh”. “Anthem! Tag this guy.. ajione song ilivo kuwa kubwa.. big up to everyone one kwa support yenu.. #mmmh1 I dont want to end the year with grudges manze. God said, learn to forgive right? So haijalishi nini ama nini. Wacha kazi iendelee.. this song is still a masterpiece manze. Big up brother Rayvanny.”
