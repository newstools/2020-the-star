Rhonex Kipruto smashed the world record at the 10k Valencia Ibercaja on Sunday (12), clocking 26:24* to win the World Athletics Gold Label road race. Sheila Chepkirui, meanwhile, ran 29:46 to win the women’s race. Her time was initially reported as 29:42, which would have been a one-second improvement on the world record, but her official time was later confirmed as 29:46, consolidating her position as the second fastest woman of all time. Kipruto’s half-way split of 13:18* was also an improvement on the 5km world record. His second half of 13:06 was even faster, although would not be eligible for ratification. The world 10,000m bronze medallist, still aged just 20, took 14 seconds off the yet-to-be-ratified mark set just six weeks ago by Joshua Cheptegei in the same city, albeit on a different course. Kipruto's fellow Kenyan Benard Kimeli finished second in 27:12, just ahead of Switzerland's Julien Wanders, who set a European record of 27:13. Chepkirui was one of three women to finish inside 30 minutes – the first time that has happened in any 10km road race. Her performance takes 11 seconds off the PB she set in Prague last year. Rosemary Wanjiru and steeplechase specialist Norah Jeruto were second and third respectively, both clocking 29:51 to move to equal third on the world all-time list.
