Promotion chasing Ushuru will not relent in their pursuit of a way back into the top flight league, star striker Brian Yakhama has reiterated. Ushuru recovered from a goal down to beat free-falling APS Bomet 3-2 at camp Toyoyo yesterday to improve their points tally to 35 in the National Super League. “There is still a lot of points to be fought for because the second leg has only just started. We have to keep going and getting results to remain in contention towards the end of the season,” remarked the burly forward after the match. Twice in 15 minutes, APS had looked on course for a shock win far away from home when Simon Karanja put them ahead in the 7th minute. Yakhama restored parity for the tax-men just three minutes later of a frantic start. The visitors re-took the lead on the quarter hour mark through James Kalekha. Ushuru got another way back into the  tie in the 23rd minute with Yakhama netting from the spot after an infringement on Barrack Odhiambo. The game was turned on its head by an own goal from Dominic Kipkirui with an hour on the clock. Ushuru then held of steadily in the last 30 minutes to put three important points on board as the promotion race continues to shape up.
