National Division One Zone 'B' leaders Zoo Youth have signed seven players in a bid to boost their chances of playing in the National Super League next season. Head coach Andrew Ongwae confirmed the entry of the seven while revealing that they have parted ways with six players. Oscar Oketch joined NSL side Vihiga Bullets while former Gor Mahia defender Yusuf Juma, John Odhiambo, Pascal Ngobi, Abdul Etoo and Ocean Alibu were released. The new signings include Samuel Lemashon from Kibera Black Stars, Vincent Angwenyi from Gesero Secondary, Wilfred Mwirohia and Abraham Wakaso from Muhoroni Youth, Douglas Oroni from Zetech, Vincent Nyabuto from Nyamarambe and Nahashon Okatch, who was unattached. Ongwae also said that the club is looking to sign two goalkeepers, who are currently undergoing trials at the club’s base at Mosocho Academy. “The transfer window opened last week but we intend to finish the business of signing new players in the coming week,” said Ongwae, a former defender at various top clubs including Kenyan Premier League giants Gor Mahia. “We are top of the log with three games remaining. The second round is always very tough but we want to remain grounded. We don’t want to be carried away,” said Ongwae. He also revealed that the club will in second leg play their home matches at Gusii Stadium. The club which is currently based at Mosocho in Kisii County will change its name from Zoo Youth to Gusii United after former Shabana chairman Paul Mayieko acquired it.
