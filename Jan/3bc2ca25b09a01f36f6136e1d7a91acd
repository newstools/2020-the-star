The locust crisis is worsening as new swarms of ravenous insects have been crossing daily into Kenya from Somalia. The new invasion has strained the budget for spraying, even as crops are being destroyed and food security threatened. Agriculture PS Hamadi Boga said has said more resources are needed to exterminate the insects. Addressing the press at Lengusak in Samburu East, Boga identified poor network coverage as a major challenge in Northern Kenya. Late last week, the PS said most of the infested areas are extremely remote, forcing the team carrying out surveillance to cover long distances. “Our team encountered communication challenges when they try to call and give directions to the spraying team based at the Isiolo Airport,” the PS said. Five planes are used for spraying and four helicopters for surveillance and identification of target areas across nine counties battling the invasion, he said. He said the team is already exhausted after three weeks of intense work with hardly any rest. He said more personnel were necessary. Boga assured Kenyans that the pesticides being used are effective saying ministry officials are touring sprayed areas to ensure the pests are dead. "The chemicals are not harmful to people and their livestock." The PS was accompanied by a team from the Food and Agriculture Organization and the Kenya Plant Health Inspectorate Service who trapped some of the insects to carry out more research at their laboratories.
