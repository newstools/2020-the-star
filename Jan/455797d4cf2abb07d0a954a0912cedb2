For quite a long time, Kenyans, and more so the lower class, have been the worst hit but the poor economy. They have been left to struggle to put food on the table thanks to the hiking prices of food commodities. The result has been that saving to attend to other life responsibilities such as education and healthcare is an additional burden or an equal to impossible task. This is a possible reason why thousands of pupils who did last year KCPE are unable to join for form one. Our leaders ought to question themselves how the future of the nation shall be if this will trend untamed. Legislators should enact laws that drive the responsibility of determining prices of food commodities to the government, whereby price adjustments are only be done by an appointed authority. Through this, Kenyans will feel relieved. Joseph Macharia is from Nairobi
