Over 60 teams have confirmed participation in the 11th edition of the Homa Bay High School annual tournament. Tournament coordinator Stanislaus Khaemba said: “So far 60 teams have confirmed but we expect more than 100 to take part. This is a big tournament and most schools will take part to test their teams ahead of the inter-school competitions.” “Most schools from Homa Bay have confirmed their participation but we also expect teams from Kisii, Nyamira, Migori, Kisumu and Siaya Counties,” Khaemba revealed, adding that winners will get kit, balls, trophies and certificates. Nyanza region basketball champions and rugby 7's runners up Agoro Sare are among the early birds. Agoro Sare basketball coach Paul Odock will be chasing his third title this year after winning at the Biro Lich and Agoro Sare Open tournaments. Hosts Homa Bay, the Nyanza region boys hockey champions, will have a double-prong attack at the tournament defend their title and gauge their team ahead of the schools' competitions. Meanwhile, Kisumu Day will host a five-team hockey tournament this weekend, according to the school's hockey coach Booker Odhiambo. Among the schools expected are Maranda, Ramba, Nyang'ori and Kisumu Young Stars Club and hosts Kisumu Day. “I preferred this tournament because players will have quality playing time. This will help me test their endurance," said Odhiambo. Elsewhere, Nyanza region boys soccer champions Kisumu Day face stiff competition from rivals Magadi, Kisumu School, Awasi and upcoming Kasagam at the Kisumu School Open tournament. Kisumu School's HOD for games Phillip Omondi said more than 30 teams are expected to grace the two-day tournament which will be played at various venues including Jomo Kenyatta Sports Ground, Kisumu School, Kisumu Day and Kisumu Girls.
