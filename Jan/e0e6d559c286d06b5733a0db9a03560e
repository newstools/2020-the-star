Low-cost carrier Jambojet has introduced a new product that allows group bookings targeting senior citizens, students, chama groups, among other segments. Dubbed 'Shukrani', the platform enables group bookings of 15 passengers and above, with tailor-made services for the groups. Management on Thursday said the move is part of the carrier's commitment to enrich its product offering and enable more people to fly. “We have seen an increased interest in special requests from groups and a need to offer a tailor made product for this customer segment. We are keen to continue coming up with innovative products to address our customers’ needs,” CEO Allan Kilavuka said. The product offers one free seat; with applicable taxes, for every group booked, dedicated check-in desk, meet, greet and assist services, special in-flight mentions and pre-assigned group seating. To launch the product, Jambojet in partnership with Sarova Whitesands, flew a group of 16 women aged between 45-68 years from Ngonde PCEA Church in Kiganjo, Nyeri County. It was their first time flying, after they were nominated in an online competition carried out by Jambojet between October 15-20 last year. “It was a golden chance for us because we had never traveled by air before,” said Teresa Matu, one of the beneficiaries. Since inception in 2014, Jambojet, which was awarded the coveted IATA Operational Safety Audit certification (IOSA) in July 2019, has flown over three million passengers, 30 per cent of whom are first time flyers. The airline flies to five local destinations Mombasa, Eldoret, Kisumu, Ukunda and recently launched flights to Kigali, Rwanda, in November, making it their second regional destination after Entebbe, Uganda.
