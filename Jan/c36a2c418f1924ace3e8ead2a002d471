Bomet Governor Hillary Barchok on Monday sent six officers on compulsory leave over alleged abuse of office. The six officers from the Lands, housing and urban planning department are accused of facilitating payments to proxy companies and making fictitious claims at the county. The officers are Lands chief officer Victor Ngetich, procurement officer Robert Ngetich, Jackline Kirui, an accountant at the department, and procurement assistant Evans Kiprono. Others are Stella Chepkemoi in charge of stores and Wesley Kiplangat Korir, who is an accountant in charge of examination. Addressing the press at his office, Barchok said the group will remain out of office pending investigations. Without giving details of the companies being used by the officers and the amount they have been claiming over services supplied, the county chief said he would forward details to EACC. Barchok said he has constantly warned staff against abuse of office but, "these particular ones have failed to heed to the call." "I have always talked to them asking them to be diligent in their work with the recent warning being last week during a staff meeting where I reiterated my call, but still they do not seem to obey my orders," he said. He said he will not condone corruption in his administration. "Everyone is going to carry his or her own cross, whether working under my administration or the previous one, I do not want to go to Senate to answer queries which are of other people's making," Barchok said.
