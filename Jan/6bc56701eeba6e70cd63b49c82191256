Twelve Samburu pupils who excelled the KCPE exam are to benefit from Equity Bank’s Wings to Fly scholarship programme for their secondary school education. Equity Bank’s Maralal branch manager James Mwangi said the beneficiaries were selected from poor families. The programme covers full tuition fees, textbooks, transport and pocket money. "We received over a hundred applications but we selected 12 who really deserved these scholarships. We have over 90 who are remaining and we ask all other stakeholders to join hands so we can support these kids for them to go through secondary school education," Mwangi said. Abdi Kadir Ismael, the Kenya Secondary School Heads Association county chairman and board member of the Equity programme, thanked the bank for supporting poor children to achieve their dreams. He urged the beneficiaries to work hard and maintain discipline.
