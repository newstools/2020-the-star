A middle-aged man in Mwingi was on Sunday morning beaten to death by a mob in Mwingi and his body burnt. According to locals, the man was a notorious thief who had been causing residents sleepless nights together with his gang. The residents said the man had been terrorizing businessmen in Mwingi town by breaking into their premises at night. Maliti Mengi, a business man in Mwingi town, said the deceased tried breaking into a retail shop before members of public saw him and attacked him, beating him to death. In the botched robbery, two others were said to have escaped unhurt even as residents continue decrying rising insecurity which has hit the town in the recent past. Maliti stated that it was high time Mwingi police took immediate action to arrest the situation before it goes out of hand. “Mwingi town is known for its peaceful life and so police officers should step up and ensure the peace continues,” said Maliti. Late last year, a tutor at Mwingi KMTC was killed inside her car near Mwingi livestock market. However, according to Mwingi Central Deputy Sub county commander, Nicholus Mutua, there is no insecurity in Mwingi. Mutua said that as the security team, they were doing their best to ensure that all corners of Mwingi are secure enough. “The lynched man was a thief and members of the public took the law into their own hands and saved the owner of the shop from being stolen from,” Mutua said. He urged residents practicing theft to shun the unlawful acts because the law will catch up with them. The body of the deceased was taken to Mwingi level 4 hospital mortuary.
