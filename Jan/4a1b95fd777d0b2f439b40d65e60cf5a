Song, dance and ululation rented the air at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport terminal 1A as a jubilant crowd assembled to welcome the triumphant national women’s volleyball team home on Friday night. Family, friends, club-mates, volleyball federation, National Olympic Committee of Kenya’s and government officials all converged at the terminal’s exit to receive the 2020 Summer Olympic Games-bound Malkia Strikers. Kenya won their matches to become the only African women’s team that will compete at the Olympic Games. The outfit last participated at the most coveted world Games at the Athens 2004 and makes a return at the after 16 years of absence. They missed the Beijing 2008, London 2012 and Rio 2016. Head coach Paul Bitok remains hopeful that his proposal of the team’s training regime in the run-up to the Olympics which includes training in Europe, South America and Asia will get a nod from the government and Nock. “I have talked to a few friends abroad and they are willing to host Malkia Strikers in Europe for international friendly matches. I hope the government will okay us,” intimated Bitok. Team captain Mercy Moim took the opportunity to ask the government, KVF and Nock to accord the team a good training regime ahead of Tokyo 2020. She also reiterated her statement made after their encounter with hosts Cameroon, that Kenya should have faith in indigenous coaches’ abilities to deliver results. “We are so excited about our qualification and I will still urge Kenya to trust our local coaches and give them the chance to deliver. Let us exhaust all our available resources before looking elsewhere. “We also implore the government and all organizations involved to give the team an ample and continuous indoor training time of three months locally and two in Europe.  We really want to register the best results Kenya has ever brought at the Olympics,” said Moim beaming with joy.
