Migori youths want to raise Sh300 million to revive Sony Sugar Company and they have a paybill number for donations. Sony owes farmers Sh552 million and 2,000 workers Sh548 million in salary arrears. “We plan to collect Sh300 million from members of the community to benefit the company and other well-wishers. especially politicians,” Sony's youth representative at the Kenya Federation of Sugarcane Farmers Evance Otieno said in Migori town on Monday. In May last year, the company sent all casual employees on compulsory unpaid leave. Managing Director James Oluoch cited financial woes in his May 9 letter to the workers. Oluoch previously said the company needs Sh346 million for maintenance but attempts to source Sh210 million from the Migori county government had failed. Otieno, who is the chairman of the Youth for Sony Revival Movement, was accompanied by treasurer Leonard Okumu and secretary Mashel Nyagilo. Okumu said they will have a paybill number through which contributions can be sent. “We are passionate about reviving the company. We need other leaders to help in the initiative,” Okumu said. Nyagilo regretted that Sony's collapse had pauperised many families whose children were now out of school for lack of fees. (Edited by V. Graham)
