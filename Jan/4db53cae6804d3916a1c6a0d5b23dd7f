 An assistant chief says his life is in danger after some police officers allegedly threatened him over of the disputed Gacibine sub-location on the border of Tigania and Tharaka. Musyoki Mwenga on Tuesday appealed to Inspector General of Police Hillary  Mutyambai and Interior CS Fred Matiang’i to reinforce security at Kiembeni chief’s camp. He claimed the officers had colluded with some individuals to disrupt normal trading activities at Gacibine market. They have also threatened to demolish his office. Last week, residents appealed to the Njuri Ncheke Council of Elders to speedily resolve the longstanding border dispute between Tigania and Tharaka. This followed an attempt by Tharaka residents to stop the ongoing construction of the chief's office. “We have not had peace since Saturday when Tharaka MP Gitonga Murugara and Mukothima MCA Mwenda Gataya convened a meeting here. There is tension after they declared they will demolish the office under construction,” Mwenga said in his rented office at Gacibine. The MP and the MCA, who we could not reach for comment, are said to be rallying residents against the construction of the chief's office. On their part, Tigania East MP Gichunge Kabeabea and Thangatha Ward representative King’ori Gituma say nobody will be allowed to stop the construction of the Sh850,000 office at Kiembeni. Gataya accused Kabeabea of initiating development projects without consulting Tharaka leaders. According to him, the site of the chief’s office is in Tharaka. Musyoki said Ann Munyoki, who donated the two acres on which the office is being constructed has also received death threats. She confirmed having received threats, although she is yet to report to the police.
