Encroachers on Kenya Railways land in Nanyuki town have been given two weeks to destroy their structures and vacate the property. Laikipia county commissioner Daniel Nyameti said that the government wants to revive the 240-kilometre Nairobi-Nanyuki railway line at a cost of Sh3 billion. Nyameti also gave farmers growing crops on the railways land up to Sunday to remove their produce failure which they would be uprooted. He spoke on Thursday after he led a team of officials in assessing the progress of the revival being undertaken by a National Youth Service (NYS) cohort. The Kenya Railways Corporation has set aside Sh1 billion for the rehabilitation while the extra Sh2 billion will be provided by the National Treasury. “The NYS personnel will embark on uprooting all crops growing on Kenya Railways land from Monday,” Nyameti said. The administrator said the revival of the old railway line would take six months to complete. It is expected to revive the economy of Mt Kenya region by facilitating the swift transport of farm produce, livestock and other goods to and from the area. “Nanyuki railway station will be the busiest in the entire line in the region as it will serve areas as far as Isiolo and Meru where there are plans to extend the line to in future,” he added. The railway line that traverses Kiambu, Murang'a, Kirinyaga, Nyeri and Laikipia counties was expected to be extended to Isiolo to link up the region to the Lamu Port and Lamu-Southern Sudan Ethiopia Transport corridor. Nyameti said that over 400 NYS servicemen had been deployed to work on the Nanyuki section. It will be restored in three stages of Nanyuki-Marua, Marua-Sagana and finally Sagana-Thika stretch. Engineers from the Kenya Defence Forces are also expected to join in to offer technical support.
