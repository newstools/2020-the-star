Elected leaders in Kiambu county are waiting for deputy governor James Nyoro to invite them to a meeting to chart a development plan, an MP has revealed. Limuru MP Peter Mwathi said the challenges facing the county can only be solved when leaders sit and talk. Mwathi reminded Nyoro to plan for that meeting he promised when he took over the county leadership, after the area governor Ferdinand Waititu was barred from accessing office by a court. Waititu, his wife Susan and other county officials were charged with abuse of office in a case involving a Sh588 million illegal roads tender before magistrate Lawrence Mugambi. The MP claimed that Waititu would not find any reason to call for such a meeting, adding that leaders were waiting for it. "This is another year and we need to lay a strategy so that this term does not go to waste. It can be a waste if we do not do anything," he said. The MP spoke on Tuesday at Equity Bank Limuru branch during the flagging off of Wings To Fly beneficiaries. The legislator said MPs and MCAs have been disagreeing over road projects, especially when MPs come to assist pathetic county roads. "Recently, we disagreed with an MCA over a road. Locals are making noise over a county road, I decided to look for funds and when received it and we came to repair that section, the MCA complained a lot," he said. "How will we help our electorates? It is through dialogue. They voted for us and trusted us to work together." Mwathi said Kiambu is home county of President Uhuru Kenyatta and it should not be in the media with all the wrong reasons.
