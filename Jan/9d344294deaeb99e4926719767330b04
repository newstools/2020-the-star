It only took a debt of Sh10 for all hell to break loose. On Friday Makadara chief magistrate Heston Nyaga ordered Kasarani neighbours who fought in public over Sh10 debt — one woman claimed it was Sh20 — to shake hands. Then she acquitted them. The court heard that Angelina Kerubo, Ruth Kwamboka and Ongeri Ntabo caused an affray —  a public disturbance — on January 4 at Kahawa west in Kasarani, Nairobi. An affray is taking part in an unlawful fight in a public place. It was reported that Kerubo had asked Kwambokato repay the Sh10 she had lent her, as she needed it for personal issues. Kerubo also insisted that Kwamboka owed her another debt of Sh10 but Kwamboka said she was not aware of another debt. Kerubo later visited Kwamboka's house and threw a Sh10 coin at her door and began insulting her. “She referred to me as an uncircumcised young girl and further demanded that I come out of my house for a fight,” Kwamboka said. They then started fighting before Kerubo’s husband Ongeri joined in solidarity with his wife. They both pleaded guilty and asked the court to allow them to resolve the matter outside the court as they had forgiven each other. “Your Honour, we would wish to solve this matter outside the court and we have talked and forgiven each other,” Ongeri said. Nyaga ordered the three to shake hands before releasing them. (Edited by V. Graham)
