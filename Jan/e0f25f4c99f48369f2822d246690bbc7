Masinde Murilo University of Science and Technology (MMUST) are keen to continue with their impressive run when the second leg kicks off Saturday. “We had a good run in the first leg and finished number two. We want to continue pushing because we want to play a home semi final which will enhance our chances of qualifying for Kenya Cup which is our target,” said assistant coach John Asila. Speaking ahead of Saturday's encounter against 11th-placed Mombasa RFC at Mombasa Sports Club, Asila said he expects a good but tough game. “We resumed our training on time and all has been well. We didn't make any major signing but we have two school boys who are joining us,” added Asila. In the first round, MMUST lost only one game against leaders Strathmore Leos. Log leaders Strathmore Leos will will intensify their quest for a quick return to Kenya Cup when they host Egerton Wasps at Strathmore University grounds in Madaraka. Leos is the only team with a 100 percent record. Three-time Kenya Cup champions Mean Machine, who are also seeking a quick return to Kenya Cup, will play fourth-placed debutants Eldoret RFC at the University of Nairobi grounds. Struggling Kisii will hope to make a long trip to Ukunda to play South Coast Pirates. Up to Thursday afternoon, the trip was in doubt due to the club's financial challenges. The club has been struggling financially since the withdrawal of their sponsors Resolution Insurance last season. Catholic University in Karengata will host a double header. In the first game, fifth- placed Northern Suburbs will face University of Eldoret's Trojans (2pm) while Catholic Monks face off with arch-rivals United Sates International University Africa's Martials in the second match.
