The unending outcry from the university students on crimes in campuses across the country has finally reached the government who have come up with strategies to rein in on the worrying trend. Cases of murder, theft with violence and even rape have been in the headlines from universities as students complain of organised gangs within the institution and from the nearby centres harassing them. Interior CS Fred Matiang'i cited the recent incidences reported in Kibabii University and Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology caught the attention of President Uhuru Kenyatta. "When there was a challenge at the JKUAT and another at Kibabii, it drew the attention of the President and we began having the conversations of what we are going to do," Matiang'i said. He said the first strategy this year is to create University Community Security Committees across the country. Addressing a meeting on Wednesday that brought together the top security team in Mombasa, the CS said they have already set up one at JKUAT main campus in Juja town. The committees will draw representation from all community stakeholders. He said the committee's primary mandate is to foster harmonious co-existence between the University and the communities within which they exist. Cases of attacks on students have been rampant in JKUAT as students blame the security for laxity. In the first 15 days of November, 10 JKUAT students had been waylaid on their way from school. Some incidents were reported as early as 4 pm. JKUAT is arguably a major factor in the development of Juja town. Residential estates are emerging around the institution.
