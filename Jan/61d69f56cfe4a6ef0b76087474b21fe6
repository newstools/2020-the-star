K24 news anchor and producer Anjlee Ghadvi has succumbed after a battle with cancer. Ghadvi died on Friday while undergoing treatment at the Agha Khan University Hospital. Ghadvi had at a point gone into remission, before the cancer recurred. K24 news editor Peter Opondo on his Twitter page said, "Oh my friend @AnjleeGadhvi You fought that cancer beast with all your might. You did it for your kids, husband. Never lost hope. You always smiled through the pain & insisted on coming to work even at your weakest points. We believed you were winning...until now! RIP my friend". In August last year, Ghadvi was admitted to a hospital in India. The journalist shared an update on the kind of treatment she underwent in India on her Twitter account. “I had an intense CyberKnife treatment early February this year. The area treated was large, hence the recovery period took time. The body and disease has responded to this form of treatment and I had to finish what was left. Praying done and over!,” she shared. The CyberKnife System is a radiation therapy device that is used to deliver radiosurgery for the treatment of benign tumors, malignant tumours, and other medical conditions. She said being strapped in a single position with her arms stretched above her head had made her body sore. The anchor further added that that had led to an inflamed throat and swallowing food was a struggle. She urged her followers to appreciate good health saying she would cringe in agony and suffocation when the air got stuck in her chest.
