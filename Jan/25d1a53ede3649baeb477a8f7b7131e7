United States International University (USIU)-A Spartans believe the current squad is competitive enough to fight for titles without necessarily adding new players. The students have had a quiet recruitment period but tactician Willis Okeyo exuded confidence that his charges have what it takes to wrestle the title in the league that starts in a month's time.  Spartans finished second last season. The team also won the Kenya University Sports Association (KUSA) East Africa games in Eldoret in December last year. With the team maintaining their squad, Okeyo will push the girls to play to the expectations in order to deliver the much-sought title. The team also boasts of  international experience having participated in the Africa Cup of Club Championship in 2018 in Abuja Nigeria. The team finished fourth to rank Africa's finest hockey university in January 2019. "I have not signed anybody because our philosophy in USIU is to build our own. Getting players from outside is not something we want to explore now. We want to maintain the squad we have. The players we have can match the best in the league if their performance in the recently  concluded university games is anything to go by," Okeyo remarked. "Beating Kenyatta University Titans 1-0 in the final was no mean feat. The girls have the potential and we only need to tighten up in the league. If anything, maturity from the players will be key," observed Okeyo who doubles up as dependable Kenya Police midfielder. The students recorded 10 clean sheets in the women's Premier League while conceding only nine goals. The students will count on striker Vivian Esimi who is expected back in training before the league starts after being out for the last six months with a knee injury.
