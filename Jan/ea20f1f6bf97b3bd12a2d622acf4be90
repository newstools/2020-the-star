Politicians allied to Deputy President William Ruto were on Saturday booed as they made their entry into the BBI rally at Mama Ngina Waterfront Park. They are Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria, Malindi's Aisha Jumwa, Mohammed Ali (Nyali), Mwashetani Khatib (Lunga Lunga) and Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Murkomen Kipchumba. The politicians had initially been blocked from entering the venue with their bodyguards with the security from the Kieleweke team members taking over. It took the intervention of Mombasa Governor Joho to allow the crowd to give way for the politicians to enter. Politicians started streaming into the grounds as early as 10am. By 10.30am, the venue was half full. Governors had their seats reserved, while other politicians were ushered to the second and third daises. Security was beefed up with a contigent of police manning the venue and ensuring security is maintained. Attendees include Kirinyaga and Kitui Governors Anne Waiguru and Charity Ngilu, senators, MCAs among others.
