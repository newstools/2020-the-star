Deputy President William Ruto has said there will be no room for corruption in his government if he ascends to the presidency. Ruto on Thursday said if that time comes, he will be ruthless as there will be no money to steal. The Deputy President further distanced himself from claims that President Uhuru Kenyatta's war on graft is targeting him. He said the claims are baseless and mere propaganda by those seeking political sympathy. Ruto said he has been labeled as corrupt since he declared intentions of running for President, yet he does not come from a prominent family. "I don't think the war against corruption is targeting me, until it becomes apparent. Why are you saying I'm corrupt because I'm running for president yet I'm a son of a peasant," he said. He added: "Is it that you are saying it's okay to be corrupt as long as you are not running for higher office?" Ruto said the founding father Mzee Jomo Kenyatta and retired President Moi would have found themselves in the same problems had they been running for president now. "Let us accept that people from humble backgrounds have gotten themselves somewhere and can equally excel in the political arena," he said.
