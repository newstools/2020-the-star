The police officer alleged to have defiled a 16-year-old girl about a week ago has been granted Sh400,000 bond. Thirty-two-year-old Stanley Kisang, who is attached to Ratta police post in Seme subcounty, will, however, be remanded at the Kakamega Prison because of security purposes should he fail to raise and pay the said amount. The case will be mentioned on January 22 and heard on March 4. The officer was charged on Wednesday with defilement. He denied any wrongdoing. The court heard that he committed the offence on December 31 at Ratta police post. The girl's mother had taken her to the police post for counselling after she attended a night disco on New Year's Eve against her advice. She said her daughter was locked up at the post awaiting counselling the next day. “When I went back to where my daughter was being detained, I found her in pain and could not easily close her legs. She told me that the police officer raped her more than four times before returning her to the cell,” she alleged. The officer's house is within the police post. The girl was taken to Coptic Hospital before her mother insisted on her referral to Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital. The suspect faced another charge of committing an indecent act with a child contrary to the Sexual Offences Act, 2006. He pleaded not guilty to all the charges before senior principal magistrate Robbinson Ondieki. His lawyer, however, requested that his client be released on bail and be detained at the Maseno police station. This was opposed by prosecutor Mokaya Nyakundi, who argued that there is no prison at the police station. Nyakundi stated that normally, after plea taking, a suspect is remanded in a prison, which no police station has. “I, therefore, pray that the accused be taken to either prisons in Kisumu — Kibos or Kodiaga”. The magistrate chose Kakamega Prison.
