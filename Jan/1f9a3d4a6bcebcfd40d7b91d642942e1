Khaligraph Jones was honoured as the best rapper in Africa by Soundcity MVP Awards, which were held over the weekend in Lagos, Nigeria. Jones brought home the award, beating Nyashinski, Nigeria’s Falz and Ghana’s Sarkodie, among others. "Thank you so Much fam, the biggest achievement of my career, Never give up on your dream no matter what some may people will say about it and about You. stay Hungry and God will always come through," the rapper wrote on Instagram. After the awards, a Nigerian rapper by the name Blaq Bone was roasted by Kenyans for going after Khaligraph in a video that he said, "Somebody tell Khaligraph that I'm still the best rapper in Africa, Soundcity got it wrong, I'm sorry they got it wrong, diss track in the morning." Khaligraph then asked rapper MI to allow him to hit back. "Boss Am Asking For Permission to diss Nigerian Rappers. Let me fix up their lives, they be doing Afro-pop too much. Am not seeing spitters. Blaq Bones has provoked me," he wrote. Bone later took to social media to say he was joking about releasing a diss track and congratulated The OG. In a previous interview with the Star, Khaligraph said he has been recognised more abroad than at home. "Awards mean that people are appreciating your efforts, it gives you the motivation to work even more. When I see that happen, I see God opening doors and people acknowledging my efforts. Until the other day, I had never been awarded in Kenya. I never complain I'm always grateful," he said. "In 2012, I made a tweet that I will get to BET and I was laughed at. People made fun of me. I'm gonna win and I'm gonna go back to that tweet. I once said I'm gonna be the best rapper in East Africa, look at me now."
