 Development projects in several Mbeere North primary and secondary schools have stalled due to what the area MP says is the overzealousness of headteachers. Muriuki Njagagua said on Monday the headteachers extended the facilities beyond what was funded by the National Government Constituency Development Fund. The projects are now incomplete and more funding is required to restart and complete them. “This tendency should stop because students or pupils for whom the facilities are built suffer while waiting for more money to be got to complete them yet the structures were being put up to alleviate identified problems,” Njagagua said. He urged the headteachers to use the money as per allocation reminding them that the NGCDF budgets its money according to identified needs. “Don’t succumb to the schools' management committees to add even an inch of a classroom because it’s not budgeted for. You can do with what you have and then seek more funds to build other facilities later but first complete the ones identified,” he counselled while opening a dormitory at Kigwambiti Secondary School on Saturday.
