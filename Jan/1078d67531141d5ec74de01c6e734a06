Kenya Defence Forces chief General Samson Mwathethe presided over the commissioning of six MD 530F helicopters on Thursday at the Joint Helicopter Command (JHC) in Embakasi. Speaking after receiving the helicopters from the US Government representative, Commanding Combined Joint Task Force Horn of Africa (CJTF-HOA) Major General Michael Turello, Mwathethe appreciated the US government for its sustained bilateral relations with Kenya. “Among other capabilities, the integration of the MD 530F into our inventory will go a long way in enhancing our capacity to operate in the contemporary security environment, and we appreciate that this achievement is underpinned by cooperation with our allies,” he said. Kenya Army commander Lt Gen Walter Koipaton said the helicopters are a great asset and will be crucial in supporting the infantry units in the defence of the country against land based aggression. "The helicopters have come at a time when we most need them in our operations both within our borders and beyond. As you are aware, Kenya is currently involved in operations against terrorist organisations, notably the al Shabaab in Somalia, as part of Amisom and along the Kenya-Somalia border," he said. The purchase of the helicopters fixed with contemporary airborne and armament systems is part of KDF’s modernisation programme which is fully funded by the Ministry of Defence. Present during the commissioning ceremony were Defence PS Ibrahim Mohamed, vice chief of Defence Forces Robert Kibochi, Assistant Chief of Defence Forces – Personnel and Logistics Major General Fatuma Ahmed, Asssistant Chief of Defence Forces Operations, Training and Doctrine Major General Jonah Mwangi and Deputy Army Commander Major General Thomas Chepkuto among other senior military officers from both Kenya Defence Forces and the US military.
