 The High Court on Monday lifted an order freezing the bank accounts of the Child Welfare Society of Kenya. The move followed a consent signed by parties agreeing on among other things the reinstatement of the society's chief executive officer. The parties in the case entered consent which was accepted as a court order by Justice David Majanja. The board of directors will also be reinstated on condition it will forward any grants, donations or gifts from government and donors to the board of trustees. Another condition is to mobilise resources for the society, contribute towards the development and revision of the national strategy for promotion, securing and protection of children's rights. They are also required to promote public-private sector partnerships for sustainable child welfare programmes. The board of trustees will nominate two representatives to the board of directors and the day to day running of the society will be done by the trustees. It was also resolved that all members of staff on the payroll of the society during the impasse and up to and after October 7, last year remain in employment. The society’s accounts had been frozen following an application by activist Okiya Omtatah. The freeze order was issued by Judge Weldon Korir. Omtatah had sued the society after it opened new bank accounts and changed signatories. The activist said Sh117.2 million had been transferred from that account on November 15, putting the money at risk of misappropriation. He accused the Solicitor-General, the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection and the National Treasury of meddling with affairs of the society. “The decision to close bona fide bank accounts belonging to CWSK and to irregularly as well as unlawfully open others not controlled by the trustees has paralysed operations of the society and put the lives of the many children in their care in jeopardy,” Omtatah said.  eidted by p. obuya
