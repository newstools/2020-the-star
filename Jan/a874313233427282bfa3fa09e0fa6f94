Music mogul Diamond Platnumz celebrated 10 years in the music industry on New Year’s Eve with a show he titled ‘Twenzetu Kigoma’. “I am a person that not only sings but also thinks and I invest in the things that I think about. I have a team of advisers in my circles and I thank them for being there for me,” he told Wasafi Media “I do shows and whether they are free or there is an entrance fee, the show must be full. It has become normal for me. In my 10 years, I have been supported so much and I am here to thank my people. That’s why entrance [to the show was free]. If you thank someone and then take their money, it means you are a thief; you are ungrateful.” Asked what is his secret to his songs always topping music charts, Diamond said, “I know the strategy of the Bongo Flava music industry. I have 10 years of releasing songs that are hits. It’s a talent that I identify what people what to listen [to and] at what time and season.” In 2009, he topped music charts with the song Nenda Kamwambie followed by Mbagala. The songs introduced him to East Africans. In 2014, he released the remix to the song Number One featuring Davido, which propelled him to the top of the African market. In early 2018 he released his album A boy from Tandale, which was launched in Nairobi and became a hit, with the cover song African Beauty featuring RnB star Omarion. Years later, Naseeb Abdul Juma (his real name) has changed the face of Bongo Flava, garnering millions of fans along the way. The multi-award-winning star has dropped hit after hit and helped kickstart the careers of many other artists among them his signees Rayvanny, Mbosso, Queen Darleen and Lava Lava. He also signed Harmonize and Rich Mavoko. Diamond is the CEO of WCB, one of the biggest record labels in East Africa. He also owns a radio and TV station.
