Plans to put up a sugar miller in Nyangweta area, South Mugirango are still on course, Kisii Governor James Ongwae has said. Ongwae said there is no going back on the Sh2.5 billion miller as it will boost the region's economy once completed. The governor said a preliminary environmental impact assessment has been finalised and that the Senate has okayed the project. "For the naysayers, I want you to know the project will go on and the investor is around ready to hit the ground running," he said. On Sunday, South Mugirango MP Silyavnus Osoro said the proposed project was an empty promise. "There is nothing like that, it is promise after promise," Osoro said. But speaking to the Star yesterday, Ongwae said the project was now at an advanced stage to commencement. He said they had already identified an Indian investor who is committed to pumping money into the project. "Construction will be completed in a span of two years from the date of the groundbreaking," Ongwae said. The plant will will create 600 direct jobs once complete, he added. Cane farmers in the region said they will reap huge benefits from the venture once it begins operations. It will significantly reduce transportation costs incurred during the ferrying of the produce to millers in neighbouring Migori and Narok counties. “Cane farming has immense economic potential hence the decision to invest in a sugarcane factory. The factory will create direct and indirect employment besides lowering production costs,” Ongwae said. Farmers from the region currently market their cane to Sony Sugar, Transmara and Sukari sugar factories in Migori and Narok counties. “Current production stands at 245,000 tonnes per year but research shows this can rise to 600,000 tonnes annually with modern farming methods,” the governor said. He said residents of  Nyangweta area have welcomed to the project. Also panned is a soapstone factory in the area.
