The player registration window for clubs that will take part in the 2020 FKF Women Premier League and Women Division One Leagues is open according to a notice from Football Kenya Federation. The 2020 WPL season is scheduled to kick off on February 22, 2020, with the Division One League slated to kick off on March 7, 2020. “The First Registration Period for both Leagues will commence on January 1, 2020, and will close on February 14, 2020, for the Kenya Women Premier League and February 28, 2020, for the FKF Women Division One League,” read part of a communique from the Federation’s Competitions Department. “Kindly note that all Transfers and Registrations will be processed electronically through the DTMS and the Online Registration platform, Kenya Connect,” continued the letter. Kahawa Queens, Nakuru West Queens, and SEP Oyugis have been promoted to the top tier Women League, replacing Nyuki Starlets, Spedag and Vihiga Leeds. Vihiga United won the WPL amidst a strong challenge from Gaspo. Like their male counterparts, financial constraints bedevilled most clubs in the two top tiers of Women football in the country but FKF Vice President Doris Petra promised a change in fortunes this term vowing that the promised grants of Sh700,000 to WPL clubs would be backdated should funds, particularly from world governing body FIFA, become available.
