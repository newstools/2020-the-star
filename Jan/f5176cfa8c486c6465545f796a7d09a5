Shujaa have moved one place to tenth in the overall standings after garnering 10 points in the Hamilton Sevens on Sunday. Kenya had a mixed performance in New Zealand losing 24-19 to England in their opening match drawing 12 -12 with minnows Japan before resounding 36-14 win over powerhouses South African to finish second in Pool B. Kenya now have 25 points from three tournaments, an improved display from last year, where they were battling relegation right from the opening tournament. In the seventh-place playoff, Kenya led 17-7 at half time before going down 19-17 to Argentina. Head coach and Kenya Sevens technical director Paul Feeney was delighted with the performance but said there is still room for improvement ahead of next weekend's event in Sydney, Australia. "Beating South Africa was the highlight for me. We had not beaten them in five years but everything clicked for us in attack, defence and setpiece. Scoring six tries was no mean feat following Saturday's disappointment,” said Feeney. However, he said they must improve especially in the restarts and in the second half. Kenya led England 19-12 at half time before surrendering the tie to the English and led Argentina 17-7 before losing 19-17. "England and Argentina starved us of possession in the second half so it's one area we have to address this week when we are in Sydney," noted Feeney. “In our first  two games, our restarts were bad but we improved in our games against  South Africa and Argentina.” Willy Ambaka, Geoffrey Okwach, Collins Injera, Jeff Oluoch, Alvin Otieno and Vincent Onyala were on the scoresheet against South Africa with Johnstone Olindi and Daniel Taabu adding the extras. Against Argentina, Nelson Oyoo, Ambaka and Injera scored a try each with Olindi kicking over one conversion. The team head to Sydney today.
