Kenya has nominated Humphrey Kayange for a position in the International Olympic Committee (IOC) Athletes’ Commission from 2020– 2028. The elections will be contacted during 2020 Tokyo Olympics Games in July. The National Olympic Committee of Kenya (NOCK) nominated Kayange to vie for one of the four elective positions available. Each continent must produce a candidates and have to reflect diversity in terms of the sports they represent. The IOC executive board approved the celebrated retired rugby Sevens player and an Olympian last month. Kayange, 37, was part of Team Kenya to the Rio 2016 Olympics where Rugby Sevens was for the first time included in the Olympic Games. He was nominated for IRB Sevens Player of the Year in 2009 and in 2010, he was awarded the Presidential Order of Golden Warrior (OGW) for his services in sport. Currently, he sits in the Nock executive as  athletes' representative with his key role being advising the board on matters concerning athletes. The Olympic Agenda 2020’s mission is to ensure athletes are at the heart of the Olympic Movement. The commission has a leading role in the Olympic Movement as it serves as the link between Athletes and IOC. The commission comprises members elected by athletes to represent them in the Olympic Movement and through them, their views will be represented and resources to assist sportsmen and women are shared. Four places will be filled in the Tokyo 2020 election; to replace outgoing Commission members whose terms come to an end in 2020. The chairperson, Kirsty Coventry from Zimbabwe is one of the members leaving the Commission. Coventry is also Zimbabwe’s Sports Minister. The campaigns start immediately and candidates will be able to promote their candidature to fellow athletes. All accredited athletes, who will be participating in the 2020 Summer Olympic Games in Tokyo will be eligible to vote. Voting booths will be available in the Athlete 365 Spaces at the Olympic Village.
