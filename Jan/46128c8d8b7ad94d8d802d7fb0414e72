The county assembly of Nairobi has resolved to deliberate on the Deputy Governor position in February once they resume from recess. Speaker Beatrice Elachi on Tuesday said she will pronounce herself in the issue in line with the Jubilee Party and the law. Embattled Governor Mike Sonko had on Monday nominated Anne Kananu Mwenda as deputy governor. However, DPP Noordin Haji said the nomination was null and void, adding that it was a violation of Sonko's bail terms. Sonko was charged alongside other county officials in December last year over the misappropriation of Sh357 million. On Tuesday, for the first time, the whole House agreed that the county is in crisis. “We want to state categorically that we are aware that there is a leadership issue within Nairobi County after the Governor was arrested and charged with issues relating to corruption,” Elachi said. The Speaker said the assembly stands firm together with President Uhuru Kenyatta and Raila Odinga on the war on corruption. “We want to assure Nairobians that the era of corruption, nepotism, intimidation, favoritism and victimisation is history in the Nairobi county government," she said. A special sitting is set to be gazetted for on Thursday where the MCAs will discuss pertinent issues pertaining to the current crisis in the county. Elachi further said that the House will bring a motion to create an ad hoc committee to oversee resumption to normalcy of services in the county government. The MCAs had attended a closed-door kamkunji which took almost four hours, discussing issues concerning the county. On Wednesday, all parties represented in the assembly will be holding their respective kamkunjis to discuss all mentioned issues in preparation for the special sitting.
