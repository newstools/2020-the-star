Gone were days when teachers were required to furnish the employer with at least three districts or sub-counties they preferred most. Back in the 1990s, teachers — before they graduated — were tasked to provide at least three districts they preferred for posting. Things have since changed — they don't have that choice. Teachers, particularly administrators, are transferred amid hostilities ranging from sacking threats, poor perception, and reception from new counties and stations. Transfers are based on national integration and performance contracting, amid negative perception from a section of parents that transferred tutors are underperformers thus taking laws in their hands. The murder of Daisy Mbaluka Mbathe, a teacher at Ndooni Primary School in Kitui on Monday by a mob allegedly over the school’s KCPE poor results, is a wakeup call for education policymakers to change the perception that the principals are the school and vice versa. The sooner we embrace the freedom of choice, reward all teachers equally and educate the importance of respecting teachers by the parents in new stations and team up for good performance the better.
