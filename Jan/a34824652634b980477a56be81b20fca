Muthaiga Golf Club’s Greg Snow carded an impressive score of 4-under par, 68 to remain on course for a fourth Safari Tour title at the Sigona Golf Club. Snow has a total score of 6-under par, 210 going into the final round of play this morning. He hit a triple bogey at the par-5, fourth. Until this point, Snow had hit two birdies at the first and third and a bogey at the second while a further two birdies and a bogey in the next five holes saw him turn with a 1-over par 37 score. A dropped shot at the par-5, tenth was the only blemish in a stellar back-nine run, that included four birdies and an eagle on the par-5, 15th, earning him a 6-under par score. Snow said: “I played well today. I am pleased with my round and the fact that I have started getting consistent, which is what I was struggling with in the last couple of legs. I look forward to another great showing tomorrow (today) and hopefully win the title.” Snow now holds a four-stroke advantage over second-placed Robson Chinhoi of Zimbabwe, who is on a gross score of 2-under par, 214 after returning a score of 1-under par 71. Chinhoi hit birdies at the third, fourth and 17th while dropping shots at the first and 14th. Royal Nairobi’s Erick Ooko moved into third place after returning a 2-under par score, one stroke off Chinhoi on 1-under par, 215. Thika Golf Club’s Simon Ngige is fourth on 2-over par, 218, two strokes ahead of the trio of CJ Wangai, Sujan Shah and Dismas Indiza who are on 4-over par, 220. Attention now shifts to the last round of action which tees off at 7:30am, with all eyes on Snow and the scramble for qualification points to the 2020 Magical Kenya Open.
