Malindi MP Aisha Jumwa (ODM) and her Nyali counterpart Mohammed Ali (Independent) on Monday defended their move to join Jubilee MPs allied to Deputy President William Ruto in Naivasha. At least over 120 MPs both from the ruling Jubilee Party and others supporting Ruto are currently meeting in Naivasha to take a common stand on the BBI public meetings. The legislators are also expected to come up with a national calendar on how they will be conducting their BBI rallies. "I'm not a Jubilee MP but independent. I attended this meeting because I'm aware it is about issues affecting Kenyans. It is not about leadership politics but issues affecting the common mwananchi. So I have come so that I see if the issues affecting the people of Mombasa will be discussed,” Ali said. The firebrand Jumwa noted that the meeting is bringing together national leaders from the Senate and the National Assembly saying it is the next forum do discuss issues affecting Kenyans. “If you are a child and you’ve gone somewhere and found your mother exposed, to protect her from ridiculed, you will tactically tell her she is being called by the husband when she stands, she will have straightened her cloth," she said. “We must speak the truth even if it hurts. The common mwananchi should be given priority first. This country has no leadership vacuum and the over 180 leaders attending the retreat should give priority to issues affecting Kenyans,” Jumwa said.
