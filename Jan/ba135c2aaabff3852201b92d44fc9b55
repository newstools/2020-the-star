Security officers in  West Pokot county have asked business community in the area to be vigilant while importing goods from neighbouring countries. North Pokot sub county commandant Nathan Sanya said that many businessmen from the county order goods from the neighbouring  countries without following laid down rules. Sanya made the remarks after a lorry that was transporting 500 bags of sugar from Uganda was impounded in Kacheliba. The officer said that the lorry was impounded by police officers after the owner failed to pay tax. “The lorry was seized in collaboration with residents and police officers but the owner of the lorry escaped,” he said. Sanya said the sugar was being ferried to Makutano, Kitale and Eldoret town. The officer asked businessmen to stop violating the law and evading tax since police officers are on alert and will not allow goods to enter the country through porous borders. “Our officers are alert and will not allow few individuals to con the government by evading tax,” he said. He said many goods are sneaked into the country by boda boda riders. “We have intensified patrol along the border the border so that goods are not smuggled in without paying taxes,” he said. The officer encouraged residents to engage in business but asked them to strictly follow the laid down laws by the government. “I encourage people to start small business but they should not violate the law to enrich themselves,” he said.
