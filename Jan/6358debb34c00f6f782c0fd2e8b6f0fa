DJ Mo has responded to trolls after posting an advertisement of Valentine’s dinner event titled, ‘Dine with the Murayas’, an event open to those in relationships or single folks, too. The red-carpet affair will go down at The Emory hotel and charges are Sh7,000 per couple and VIP Sh10,000 per couple as well. Speaking to Word Is, DJ Mo said the event is a limited edition and is meant for only those willing to spend on their loved ones. "I don't know why people think the event is expensive because the fee includes all the activities and the four-course meal. We want to make Valentine's Day different from what people have been doing," he said. Followers of the couple have had mixed reactions to the charges, and some who had interest in attending complained that it was a bit expensive. One follower wrote, "You forgot to indicate that it’s a #RichGangAffair." Asked why he chose to have the event in an expensive place, Mo said they are not inviting a crowd but those who want to treat each other. "Even if we put it at the lowest price, there are still those who will still not afford," he said. Others wanted to know what the power couple would talk about. "As the Murayas, we are just the moderator of the event, but many other couples will come and share their stories, which will inspire people," he said. The guest speakers will be confirmed on a later date. The theme of the event is matters relationship. "Relationship is a beautiful thing, especially with the right partner and well-rooted in God, whether married, dating, courting or even mnakatiana," DJ Mo said. "So come hear our story, ups and downs, we also dine together with you and yours, play games galore with your partner, love dance and open mic for different lovebirds sharing their testimonies.
