The Ministry of Education should solve cases of students receiving wrong KCPE exams results and those left out of Form 1 selection, Githunguri MP Gabriel Kago has said. Kago said it was disheartening for students to be selected to schools which they had not chosen due to blunders done during marking. He spoke on Friday at Githunguri town when he issued sponsorships to six needy  Form 1 students who scored over 400 marks in the 2019 KCPE exams. “In Githunguri Township Primary School, it was by sheer luck that it was detected that the pupils' results of English composition had not been included,” Kago said. The incident was reported and the results were rectified. “This had demoralised the pupils and it is not only here but across the country where such incidents were reported,” Kago said. Kago said that the Ministry of Education should put stringent measures to ensure that the marking of exams is taken seriously so as to spare students the agony. The legislator said that it was unfair for students who scored over 400 marks to be selected to join a day school while disregarding their choices. "We have seen a parent whose son got 420 marks and was selected to join a day school. These are the things which ought to be looked into," Kago said. Kago said that pupils in Githunguri have improved and are aiming higher in their studies. "We have allocated money in our CDF kitty to help the needy children get into Form 1 which will be disbursed soon," Kago said. The MP called upon poor parents and guardians not to exploit children who did well or discontinue their education because the government has committed to ensuring everyone goes to school.
