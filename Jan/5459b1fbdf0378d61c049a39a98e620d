Fresh from bagging 10 points in the Hamilton last week, Shujaa are seeking to engage high gear in tomorrow's  Sydney Sevens tourney. Shujaa have been pooled in arguably the group of death and will open their campaign against a dangerous Fiji  at 6:09 am at the Paramatta Stadium. Kenya and the Pacific Islanders met five times last season with Fiji winning all five meetings 43-12 in Dubai, 38-7 in Cape Town, 36-12 in Vancouver, 22-5 in Hong Kong and 24-17 in London. Paul Feeney's charges will then face Wales at 12:05 pm in their second match.The two were engaged in a relegation battle last season with Kenya winning all three encounters 33-26 in Cape Town,  19-14 in Singapore and 26-21 in Paris. Kenya's final preliminary match will be on Sunday morning (5:41am)  against log leaders New Zealand.  Kenya and the All Blacks Sevens team met once last year in Hong Kong with the Kiwis winning 36-0. Just like in Hamilton a week ago, only the group winners will advance to the semifinals with those failing to make the cut playing in the  classification matches on Sunday. Kenya Sevens' head coach Paul Feeney said the boys have had an excellent week of training and were keen to rectify the mistake from the last event in Hamilton.   “We have worked on our restarts and defence alignment and so we will be competitive against our three opponents in the pool,” he added. Feeney said with the new format, there can be no margin for error . " We learnt the hard way last weekend when we lost to England 24-19, drew with Japan 12-12 and beat South Africa 36-14. I strongly believe we should have won won our opening two matches,” added Feeney. Kenya had a disastrous outing at last year's event in Sydney,  losing 24-14 to Canada, 41-0 to USA and 40-17 to France. Kenya then lost 20-17 to Tonga in the classification matches for 13th and 14th place.  Shujaa are ranked 10th on the log with 25 points after three rounds.
