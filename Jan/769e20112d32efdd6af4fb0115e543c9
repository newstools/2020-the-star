Menengai Oilers skipper Harold Anduvate has been ruled out for the reminder of the Kenya Cup season, owing to a a shoulder injury. Anduvate will miss the next three months but could be back for the start of the National Seven Series in July. Anduvate has been a standout performer for the Nakuru-based outfit for the last two seasons in both the short and longer version of the game, earning a call up to the Kenya Sevens squads under former coaches Innocent Simiyu and Paul Murunga. Head coach Gibson Weru termed the injury a blow to Anduvate's promising season but said the Nakuru club will soldier on as they seek to qualify for the playoffs for the first time in their history. "We are in a good position despite the setback of Anduvate and we have the second half of the season to come starting on Saturday mentally and physically the boys will put up a strong showing so that we meet our target for this season,” added Weru. Anduvate has been having a recurring shoulder injury and the doctors have identified the exact problem with the injury. "The doctors have pinpointed the injury on the shoulder which has been bothering him for the past two months. It's  the rotator cuff and he will undergo surgery at the end of the week,” added Weru. Clinton Odhiambo will skipper the side in Anduvate's absence. During the just concluded transfer window,  Nakuru-based side  bolstered their roster by signing Nakuru RFC playmaker Geoff Ominde and  Dalmas Chituyi also formerly of Nakuru both on loan and Impala utility back Mark Kwemoi on a permanent basis. "The three are excellent players with experience and will complement our young core of players hence we hope to move up the table,” added Weru. Oilers are sixth on the log with 24 points and host playoff chasing Mwamba at the Nakuru Show ground on Saturday. They will then travel to the capital to face Impala Saracens on January 18 and entertain cross town rivals Nakuru RFC on January 25.
