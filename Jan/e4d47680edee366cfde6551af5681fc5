Eldoret City Marathon organiser, Moses Tanui, has defended Athletics Kenya against doping cases in the country. Tanui said AK, alongside government, have nothing to do with doping and only provide a platform and environment for athletes to operate. He said AK have invested heavily in education of athletes on matters doping and deserve a pat on the back. “Athletes should carry their own cross when it comes to doping and spare AK and government. All we know is that AK's duty is to provide a good environment to compete,” said the two-time Boston Marathon champion. Tanui said the reason why AK and even race organisers like him have worked closely with Anti-doping Agency of Kenya (ADAK) and Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) is because they want to end the menace. “We are against cheats and that is why we invest a lot of money in the testing of the athletes," he added. While launching the third edition of the Eldoret City Marathon scheduled for April 1,  the former world 10,000m silver medallist, said they received one case of doping in 2019 edition, which they dealt with in line with the rules governing athletics. " I personally ran clean and that is why I would like to see doping being  criminalised. Dopers spoil for clean runners and this is not good for the country," he added.
