Kenya Under-20 international Sydney Lokale has been unveiled as a player with HIFK Football in Finland’s top tier league for the 2020 Finnish football season. Lokale said he is ready to hit the ground running at his new club and thanked his former club Kariobangi Sharks for giving him the platform to realise his dream of moving to Europe. “It feels good to be in Helsinki and with HIFK! I know (Arnold) Origi from before, and this made it a bit easier to come here. I’m not that familiar with the club, but I’ve been watching some videos and reading  the club's history. I see myself as a good and versatile player and I want to achieve big things here. To the supporters, I want to say that I’ve come here to work hard and earn your love!”he said on his new club's website. The club's sports director, Mika Lönnström, said the Kenyan youthful exuberance will be like the final piece of the club's attacking jigsaw. “He’s a young, humble and ambitious player and these are important values that we’re building our team on," said Lönnström. Lokale’s loan contract includes an option for HIFK to buy the player from his current club Kariobangi Sharks. The 19-year-old Kenyan arrived in Helsinki on Thursday.
