The European Parliament has voted to ratify the Brexit withdrawal agreement by 621 votes to 49, with 13 abstentions. Speaking after the vote, European Parliament President David Sassoli says MEPs are "deeply saddened" to see the UK leave the EU. Paying tribute to the departing UK members, he says: "We truly appreciate all the work you have done over the last few years". "You are leaving the European Union, but you will still be part of Europe". Quoting Labour MP Jo Cox, who was murdered during the Brexit campaign, he adds: "We have a lot more in common that what divides us." Chief EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier says the debate was a "moving" one. "I am very touched," he adds. "We continue to regret the decision [of the UK to leave the EU] but we respect it," he says. He argues that the withdrawal agreement ensures the UK leaves the EU in "an orderly fashion". He says seeking to protect EU citizens from uncertainty has "always been our priority".
