Kwale county has so far registered a low turnout for Form 1 admissions. Out of the 18,335 candidates who sat the Kenya Certificate of Primary Education last year, 18 per cent had reported to various secondary schools by Thursday morning, according to the records from the county education office. The figure is expected to rise to over 30 per cent after a mass enrolment of government and Wings to Fly-sponsored students anticipated to be admitted latest by Friday evening, the office revealed. In Lunga Lunga constituency, Education director Rashid Roba revealed, from the 3,540 KCPE examinees, some 2,516 were to join subcounty schools but only 611 pupils had been enrolled by Friday. He said the majority of those who have been enrolled are from the national and county levels. “We are remaining with a huge number from the subcounty schools but the rest have transitioned,” he said, adding that the turnout is a little higher compared to last year’s. The government, the official said, will make sure all candidates have transitioned to Form 1. They have started a door-to-door campaign to force out candidates from hiding, he said. “We have spoken to primary head teachers to give us the lists of children who are supposed to transition to secondary and we will be going after them." They will even use neighbours and classmates to get to them, Roba added. The director expressed confidence in the success of the 100 per cent transition and urged parents and guardians to enrol their candidates to secondary school, adding that it's mandatory. Lunga Lunga High principal Nduthu Mathai said 114 students have registered out of the 322 expected "but he expects the total number to build up by next week". Mathai said a majority of enrolled students still have fee deficits, expressing optimism things will improve. Edited by R.Wamochie
