Mental health planners and budgeters are focussing on alcoholics and neglecting heroin addicts, experts say. Experts at Reach Out Centre, a rehabilitation centre at the Coast, say there are many heroin addicts at the coast and many suffer from mental illness, especially d “Statistics have been geared much to alcohol users but there is not much focus on heroin users who are a large number,” executive director Taib Abdulrahman said on Friday. He said of every 10 patients they receive, four or five are suffering from mental illnesses. President Uhuru Kenyatta in November last year directed that action be taken to stem the rise in suicides, which are closely linked to mental illness. The Ministry of Health selected a task force to collect views in 10 counties, including Mombasa, on how to improve mental health treatment. It was given 90 days to report. "We are moving around to identify challenges and what the government should do to address this crisis," task force member Dr Halima Mwenesi said. She addressed journalists during a public participation forum on mental health in Mombasa last week. She said it mental illness causes many different problems in a community. Psychologist Anna Onjagwa complained her profession is not recognised and given due consideration as people dealing with mental problems. She said a budget should be set aside to enable them to provide services in different areas. Onjagwa said they are not paid and are hence demotivated. "You might be informed that there is a temporary rehab somewhere and we are needed, some are paid but there is no money for psychologists." Onjagwa said she deals with as many as 18 cases of depression in a week in Mombasa alone. Edited by R.Wamochie
