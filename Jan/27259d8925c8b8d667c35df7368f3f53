As Kenyans ushered in the New Year, Kandara MP Alice Wahome, who doubles as the leader of Inua Mama lobby that is campaigning for Deputy President William Ruto to succeed President Uhuru Kenyatta, came out guns blazing. She sensationally claimed that Uhuru was planning to cling onto power after his second term in office expires in 2022. This, she said, is by contesting the PM’s post. In trying to justify the claims, the MP referred to the recent remarks by former Jubilee vice chairman David Murathe who had argued President Kenyatta is free to contest the executive PM’s post if the proposal to create the position contained in the Building Bridges Initiative was adopted by Kenyans. Listening to the MP, she wanted Kenyans to believe that if Uhuru went for the seat, such a move would be unconstitutional and this should never be allowed to happen. But I disagree. The power comes from the people. So, if Kenyans pass that recommendation, then who is she to say no? It seems she was championing the agenda of her Tangatanga team which explains why she would call it “clinging onto power”. We know that the President has rolled out a number of flagship development projects and some of them will not be completed by the time his term comes to an end. For this reason, I believe that the majority of Kenyans would not mind having him at the helm, this time as a PM. He would work hand in hand with the new President to ensure his projects are implemented. The President has not categorically stated that he will contest the Premier. He has only said he wouldn’t mind serving if Kenyans and leaders gave him that opportunity. Uhuru will state his position when the time comes.  Political Analyst and blogger
