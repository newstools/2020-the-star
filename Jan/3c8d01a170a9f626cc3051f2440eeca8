University of Eldoret Panthers will debut in the women's hockey Super League this season. They become the second team from Rift Valley region to play in the second tier.Panthers, who played in the Kenya Universities Sports Association  (KUSA) games last year in Eldoret, join Nakuru who finished sixth last season in the eight-team league. Coach Collins Cheloti said the team is keen on developing the game from the grassroots since a lot is done in Nairobi yet the majority of the players are from upcountry. Cheloti is confident he will steer the women's side top greater heights considering his experience with the institution's men's squad. "We have been training and the opportunity to play in the league has taken some time. We felt it was the perfect opportunity to register our ladies team so that people around Eldoret, Kitale and Kakamega can have the opportunity to play." The tactician said they have talked to the Kenya Hockey Union (KHU) and will play most of their first leg matches at home. This, he believes,  will reduce the traveling costs and enable the team to adjust to the rigours of the league with the view of achieving their targets. "The union will allow us to play majority of our matches at home to minimise costs. The university has promised support and so have well-wishers. Our target is to start strongly and make the team competitive. We need at least three seasons to move to the top tier and this is possible with financial stability." On the challenge of playing on the astro-turf, he said: "There is no much difference between marram and astroturf." He, however, admitted that shuttling between Eldoret and Nairobi could be a major challenge. "We have 13 players and will conduct trials today and tomorrow to get another 12,"  he added.
