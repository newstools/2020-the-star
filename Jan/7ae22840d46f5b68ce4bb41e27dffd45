Nairobi matatu saccos lead in violating the National Transport and Safety Authority’s regulations, followed by the Western region, a survey shows. Kisumu is the most compliant. Authority’s head of licensing Hared Adan said on Tuesday in Kakamega that a countrywide survey showed that out of the 21 matatu saccos operating in the Western region, only one has complied. He spoke while addressing regional directors and chairpersons of the saccos in a Kakamega hotel. Adan said the violations included drunk driving, lack of licensing and insurance, unroadworthy vehicles and carrying excess passengers. Others include inadequate number of drivers and vehicles per sacco  – each sacco is supposed to have a minimum of 30 vehicles. He directed saccos with less than 30 vehicles to merge with others. “All PSVs must bear the sacco’s name, be operated by a driver with a class A driving license and stick to one route,” Adan said. The officer also directed that starting February 1, 2020, all drivers must be on the payroll and the National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF) and National Social Security Fund remittances paid. He also said that the Ministry of Transport is in the process of improving its electronic system for efficient services. Regional police commander Leonard Omollo warned that Toyota Probox vehicles operating as PSV in the region would be impounded and owners charged. Omollo said saccos and vehicle owners will be held responsible for drunk and reckless drivers.
