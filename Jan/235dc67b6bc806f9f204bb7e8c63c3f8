ODM leader Raila Odinga has dismissed remarks made by Deputy President William Ruto that he had approached him before his Handshake with President Uhuru Kenyatta. Raila on Saturday said he made the decision to meet with Uhuru because he was the person who ran for President. He spoke at the BBI rally at the Mama Ngina Waterfront Park in Mombasa. "Look for you as who? There were only two candidates. You were not a candidate. If I was to look for anyone that would be Uhuru. I did not reach for Uhuru. But that is the past," Raila said. He also said he was not the one who took the initiative to meet the President. "I did not look for President Uhuru. You can decide how things were," Raila added. Raila said that the issues raised by Coast residents, including historical land injustices, will be addressed. He said the problem of land in the entire Coastal region will come to the end in order for the people to have their title deeds. "We must find a solution so that people can have their title deeds. Land is a factor of production and you need land to create wealth. We cannot be sitting idle looking to our people who are poor and yet there are big tracts of land lying idle," Raila said. He also said the residents should benefit from the Port of Mombasa.
