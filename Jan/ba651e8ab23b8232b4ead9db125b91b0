The High Court has suspended a 100 per cent parking fee increment by the Mombasa county government. Judge Erick Ogola directed that the increment to Sh200 be stopped until a petition filed in court is determined. Ogola issued the conservatory orders, following a petition by a civil society group organisation. The judge said the petition raised pertinent issues that need to be resolved before the court can determine whether to allow the increment or not. He said the petition had raised questions about whether there was public participation. "The petitioner raises fundamental issues which need to be determined. Therefore, the increment should not be implemented until the hearing and determination of this petition," he said. The matter will be heard on February 6. Petitioners lawyer Maurice Mkan said the county government had failed to follow due process in enacting the Finance Act. Mkan said the Hassan Joho-led administration ought to have published the notice and informed the public about their intentions to increase the parking fee. He said the public should also have been allowed to give their views. But the county, through lawyer Hilda Omboga, said the application should be dismissed since it does not meet the conditions to warrant granting of the orders being sought. Omboga said the county requires the money for its 2019-20 budget to improve services. She further told the court that the respondent was willing to compensate if the court rules in his favour of the petitioner.
