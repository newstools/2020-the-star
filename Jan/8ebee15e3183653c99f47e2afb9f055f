Harambee Starlets have booked a date with Tanzania as their quest to reach a second African Women Cup of Nations starts. David Ouma's charges will feel confident of prevailing in this duel of regional rivals after edging Tanzania at their own backyard to claim the CECAFA Women Championship in December last year. "The qualifiers are a different ball game but when the time comes and with good preparation and proper insight on our opponents from our previous meeting i know the girls will be ready to give their all," said Ouma, who is vying for the Women coach of the Year at the SOYA awards on Friday night. Following their stellar exploits in the CAF Olympics qualifiers, where they were eliminated in the penultimate round and their triumph in the CECAFA Women Championships, several Starlets players have moved to Europe; among them goalkeeper Annette Kundu, striker Ruth Ingotsi (Lakatamia FC, Cyprus) and star forward Mwanahalima Adam (Djugardens IF, Sweden). Starlets will face Tanzania in the first round set to be played between April 6, and April 14. The first leg will be played away. The winner of the first-round tie will then face off with the winner of yet another first-round tie pitting DR Congo against Sao Tome & Principe, between June 1, and June 9. The second-round winner will grace the 12-team final tournament which will be held between November 28 and December 12.
