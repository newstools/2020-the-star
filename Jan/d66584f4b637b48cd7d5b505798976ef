Wajir Governor Mohamed Abdi on Thursday warned county workers against laziness. He said they must focus on serving residents to ensure the benefits reach those at the grassroots. The county chief was addressing County Executive Committee members, chief officers and County Public Service Board members at ICT Hall. They deliberated on mid-term performance review. He said the surest way of earning the trust of residents is when they are seen to be working and attending to their needs without favour. Abdi said he is keen to deliver on the promises he made to the electorate, warning that he will not hesitate to "crack the whip if need be on people out to sabotage his administration in whatever manner". He told employees to give value for the money they earn in salaries and allowances. Anyone who fails to perform will be dismissed. “Each one of you, be it a CEC, a chief officer or even a director, has his job cut out. You know what is required of you at all time. You should remain professional and adhere to set standards,” the county chief said. "We must be a civilised society where you do what you know is expected of you without necessarily having somebody monitor or push you. When you fail to deliver on the ground, you are failing me." He urged the new members of the CPSB to be impartial and honest. Abdi said residents expect high levels of integrity and their work must be aboveboard. The county chief presided over the swearing-in of the board members in the county assembly chambers. Mid last year, county employees signed performance contracts in a move meant to improve services. Abdi said those who failed to comply would be shown the door. And those who met set targets would be rewarded. "Employees have free will, but they must be wary of the consequences," he said. In October last year, Abdi reshuffled his cabinet and urged residents to hold the public servants accountable and demand services, saying that it was their right to be served.
