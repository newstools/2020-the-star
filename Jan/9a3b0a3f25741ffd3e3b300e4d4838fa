The High Court has declined a request by former Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero to have the Chief Justice constitute a three-judge bench to hear his Sh68 million graft case. Justice John Onyiego said Kidero’s application did not meet the threshold of matters to be handled by a three-judge bench. “To that extent, the application is dismissed and hearing of the petition shall proceed before a single judge for hearing and determination,” Onyiego said. Among the issues raised by Kidero are a discrepancy between the charge sheets read to him and the one which was eventually presented to the court. Justice Onyiego said the discrepancy is a simple issue and a single judge can determine it. The former governor has also complained of a failure by the police to give him a chance to shed light on the alleged crime as they carried out their investigations and eventually decided to prosecute him. Kidero said he challenged the institution of the charges on grounds that they are unreasonable and irrational. The ex-governor is accused of conspiracy to steal public funds. He has since denied improperly receiving Sh14 million in the Sh68 million corruption case. Kidero said the Sh14 million that he received from lawyer Stephen Kariuki Mburu was for the sale of his high-end Toyota Lexus vehicle. According to the EACC, on January 7, 2014, Nairobi County made suspicious payments amounting to Sh58 million to Mburu, through his law firm Wachira Mburu Mwangi and Company Advocates. However, Kidero says that this payment to the lawyer was the result of a court order made in 2011 before he became governor. Mburu was contracted in 2011 to defend Nairobi City Council against a double claim of land allocation worth Sh3.3 billion. “The case was dismissed and a bill of costs was raised of Sh 131 million which the then city council disputed as exorbitant,” Kidero argues.
