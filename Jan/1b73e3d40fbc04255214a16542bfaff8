Coast Stima coach Paul Ogai has challenged match officials to maintain integrity and professionalism in executing their duties. The Coastal side lamented the incompetence levels shown by the referee in awarding Fortune Sacco two penalties last weekend at the Kianyaga Stadium as the seventh-placed outfit lost their eighth match of the season in the National Super League. The determination irked and demoralised the playing unit. Ogai claimed the judges had a fixed mind and were responsible for their loss even though the deplorable state of the playing surface was partly to blame. The former Western Stima coach, who took over reigns from Kinero Swaleh at the start of the season, said: "We played well but poor officiation by the referee denied us points in a match we controlled. He awarded unwarranted spot-kicks and all his decisions went against us," claimed the youthful tactician who at one point guided Kisumu All-Stars. "We have not had troubles elsewhere but Kianyaga was a totally different scenario. Whoever does the appointments of the officials should look into the matter. The officials need to be spot on with their actions and be very decisive." Ogai, whose target is to steer the side to the Kenya Premier League promotion, maintained that the sorry state of the pitches does not bode well for the future. "The Kianyaga field is pitiable and more of a shamba. The players can't express themselves in such a poor state. The management of football needs to do something." Coast Stima will be keen to maintain their perfect home record when they take on former Premier League side Mt. Kenya United at Mbaraki grounds on Sunday. Stima lost 2-1 at Ruaraka grounds in the reverse fixture last year.
