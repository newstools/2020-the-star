 Wajir Governor has defended his administration from accusations of poor services and misappropriation of funds, saying the claims were unfounded. Senator Abdullahi Ali accused the county government of doing too little despite receiving funds for services. In a post on his Facebook account, Ali said the county government receives Sh150 million in emergency funds every year but has never responded to any crisis. “They pocketed the public funds and watched as Wajir residents were ravaged by drought and killed in their hundreds by flash floods with no mitigation and emergency response. Now that there is locust invasion, they are not doing anything about it because the money meant for such emergencies has already been mercilessly chewed,” Ali wrote. The senator added, “The county has purportedly bought relief food worth Sh250 million but the reality is that they have bought substandard and poisonous food with much less than the quoted amount and looted the rest of the monies. The cereal store at Wajir is full of poisonous food and a spot check by members of the public will reveal the same.” But Governor Abdi, through a statement released by his press director Ahmed Abdi, said the allegations leveled against his administration were unfounded and based on hearsay. "The unsubstantiated and far-fetched remarks made by the senator created unnecessary tension and hatred among peace-loving residents of Wajir and was least expected from a leader of his caliber," Abdi said. He said the county used the emergency funds to mitigate the negative impacts of droughts, disease outbreaks and floods. “It is with the grace of the Almighty Allah and through the use of the emergency funds that no fatalities in terms of human beings were recorded," the statement said.  edited by p.o
