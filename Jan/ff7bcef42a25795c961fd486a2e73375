Muthaiga’s Greg Snow ended his four-month wait for a Safari Tour title after lifting the Thika Greens Golf Resort title. Snow posted rounds of 67, 73, 72, 71 for an impressive gross of 5-under par, 283. The Johnnie Walker-sponsored Snow, who last lifted a 2019/20 Safari Tour title in the opening leg, at the Nyali in August, came into the seventh leg with a point to prove and wasted no time in doing so. He got his campaign underway with a score of 5-under par, 67 to give him the lead after Round One—a lead he would hold on to till the end. Greg came into the last round holding a two-stroke lead over Thika’s Simon Ngige with the two playing off the same group. Snow shot two birdies on the par-5, second and par-5, eighteenth, three bogeys on the eighth, tenth and twelfth and one eagle on the par-4, fifth for a round score of 1-under par, 71, one shot better than Barclays Bank-sponsored Ngige who managed two birdies and two bogeys, for a gross score of 2-under par, 286. Speaking after his win, Greg admitted that he enjoyed playing at the Thika Greens Golf Club and thanked his sponsor, Johnnie Walker for the continued support. “I have been in great form over the four days, I enjoyed myself and consistently played some great golf. It feels great to finally get my hands on a Safari Tour title after a long wait. I still have a bit to work on before Muthaiga and I look forward to the challenge. I want to thank Johnnie Walker and KBL for their continued support during this Safari Tour,” he added. He explained that at one point his form had dipped due to fatigue. “I played a lot of golf towards the end of the year in both Sunshine and Safari Tour and I was simply burnt out. I got some good rest over the holidays and I am now ready for the new year,” he said. David Wakhu finished in third after playing rounds of 74, 74, 69 and 72 for gross score of 1-over par, 289. Despite not making the cut at Thika Greens, Dismas Indiza still leads the ‘Road to the 2020 Magical Kenya Open’ standings on 290.6 points while Royal Nairobi’s Eric Ooko is in second place on 272.3 after picking up 40 points in Thika leg. Thika Club’s Simon Ngige is in third on 262.6 points while Greg Snow’s 50 points in Thika takes him up to fourth on 250 points. For his efforts, Greg Snow takes home Sh150,000 which includes a Sh45,000 bonus for a gross score of 3-under par or better. Second placed Ngige takes home Sh70,000 with third placed David Wakhu pocketing Sh56,000. Safari tour action now moves to the Muthaiga Golf Club from the 11th - 15th of January for the eighth leg, with four legs left on the calendar expect the competition to hit a crescendo as players battle for the eight available slots to the 2020 Magical Kenya Open.
