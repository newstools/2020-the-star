The rare migratory bird known as Osprey that flew over 6,000km from Finland to Kenya will be taken back to where it was rescued once it stabilises. Kenya Wildlife Service Director Biodiversity, Research and Planning Dr Patrick Omondi said on Friday this will ensure the bird does not lose its bearings. "We have been in touch with the people who ringed the bird in Finland. We found out that it was ringed in 2017," he said. Omondi said the Osprey male bird has reached breeding period and by Monday, they would have known if it could be taken to where it was rescued. "Once stable, we will take it to Lake Victoria catchment. The vets are closely monitoring it at the bird rehabilitation centre in Karen," he said. The bird was rescued by Walter Oloo on January 20 from the waters of Lake Kanyaboli in Siaya county. It had been caught in a fishing net and was struggling to free itself. It got bruised in the process. The bird was delivered to the KWS Veterinary Department on January 23. Apart from the bruises, the bird looked healthy. However, it had lost some weight and looked dehydrated. The service located its origin after getting information from a ring on its leg. The details showed that it had been ringed at Museum Zool Helsinki, Finland. The Osprey species is a diurnal, fish-eating bird of prey with a cosmopolitan range. It is a large raptor, reaching more than 60cm in length and 180cm across the wings. Omondi urged the Siaya county government to promote the protection of Lake Victoria catchment areas, includingÂ Lake Kanyaboli National Reserve. He said Europe-Africa migration happens in Tsavo, Lake Nakuru, Elementaita and Bogoria.
