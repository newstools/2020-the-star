Mumias East MP Benjamin Washiali has assured his supporters that he is safe. Mumias leaders led by former sports CS Rashid Echesa claimed that Washiali was missing. But speaking to the Star on Sunday, Washiali said that he went underground as security officers were on his tail. "I am okay. These guys were on me so I had to find a way out of their circuit. I am now available," Washiali said. Washiali was a key organiser of a parallel BBI meeting in Mumias which police blocked on Saturday. The aborted meeting was scheduled to counter that which was led by ODM leader Raila Odinga at Bukhungu Stadium. Washiali who double up as National Assembly Majority chief whip allegedly went missing on Friday night.
