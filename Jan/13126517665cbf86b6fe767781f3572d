A police officer who shot dead a Leeds University engineering student in Kibra in 2018 will be charged with murder. Carilton Maina was shot and killed after he was confronted by two officers in Kibra's Laini Saba. He had travelled to Kenya for the Christmas break. Witnesses who recorded statements with Ipoa said the police officers first shot Maina in the left ankle and he fell. They then shot him in the stomach, chest and face, even after he surrendered, desperately pleading for his life. Maina was with five friends and they had just watched a late-night football match on December 22, 2018. The Independent Police Oversight Authority completed investigations and made recommendations for a charge of murder to the Director of Public Prosecutions on May 16, 2019. "Ipoa immediately launched investigations into the matter with a view of unravelling the circumstances in which the death occurred and to establish culpability if any," Ipoa chairperson Ann Makori said. "Finding the evidence sufficient to warrant prosecution, the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) also concurred with IPOA’s findings on December 20, 2019." Ipoa started investigations on December 27, 2018. Insiders told the Star that it took longer to compile the findings after police started intimidating witnesses. “We still have other legal challenges since the police officers involved framed criminal charges against a number of witnesses and the matters went to court,” an officer privy to investigations told the Star. A witness said, “Two chest bullets ended his life. He was a young man with a bright future.” Maina, 23, scored an A- in KCSE from Maseno School. Former Kilimani police boss Michael Muchiri had defended the two officers, saying they had been alerted by locals that muggers were harassing them. Edited by Josephine M. Mayuya
