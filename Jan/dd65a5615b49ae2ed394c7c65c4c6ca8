Timothy M’Kuciana has won a staggering Sh 10,000,000 on an eight-leg Multi Bet that he placed using Betway’s Live in Play feature. Timothy wagered just Sh83 on his bet on basketball games to achieve his monumental win. "I am very excited. I would never have imagined that this would have been my luck but I am happy all the same.
