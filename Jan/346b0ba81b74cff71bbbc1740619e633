The influx of an Ethiopian variety of bhang at the South Coast is driving addiction to drug use, a youth-affairs organisation has said. Teens WatchÂ director Cosmus Maina said a rise in the use of shashamane is a major challenge in fighting drugs and substance abuse in the area. "Shashamane has now taken control of our many young men and women and is slowly killing them," he said. Maina spoke to the Star on Wednesday at Ukunda in Msambweni subcounty. About 2,500 drug addicts are receiving methadone treatment at Teens Watch Centre in Ukunda. Maina said many of those who are recovering from substance abuse have withdrawn from medication and returned to smoking the bhang. He said the strong drug has, in turn, made a section of them crazy. "Combining methadone and other drugs is not recommendable. That's why some end up having mental issues," he said. He added the efforts of rescuing people who have discontinued the treatment afresh is tiresome and expensive. "Imagine someone is about to complete his medication and all of a sudden goes back on drugs. It means an extra budget for methadone, food among other things that are normally given to them for recovery," he said. The Teens Watch director called upon well-wishers, sponsors and government to combine forces in saving the youth lives. He said already over 1,000 out of 3,700 drug addicts in Kwale have recovered by the help of methadone. Maina said he wants to see many young lives are saved and helped to lead a normal life.
