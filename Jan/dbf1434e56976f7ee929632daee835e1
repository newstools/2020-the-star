Cotu has warned the new regulations introduced by National Hospital Insurance Fund will hurt low income earners. The workers' umbrella organisation accused the  NHIF of not consulting widely before effecting the changes. “Mismanagement of NHIF is to blame for the changes. The new rules are just a ploy to cover up the mess at the organisation,” said deputy secretary general Benson Okwaro. Speaking at a press conference, Okwaro added that the new rules should be suspended immediately to give room for consultations. NHIF reviewed its terms reducing the number of beneficiary children to five from the current 10, while only one spouse will be eligible. Additional dependents are subject to payment of additional premiums to be communicated after actuarial valuation. The new regulations further require new members to wait for three months before accessing services. This is an increase from the previous two-month waiting period. Other regulations introduced include a 50 per cent penalty for defaulters and introduction of a six months waiting period for maternity health care. The new rules have also been condemned by a cross-section of leaders who have asked President Uhuru to intervene. Ford Kenya party leader Moses Wetang’ula last Friday said the President must stop the new rules from being implemented if his administration is to achieve its Agenda 4 development goal on healthcare.
