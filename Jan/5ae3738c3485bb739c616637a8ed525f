A Naivasha pastor has called for prayers to end the increasing suicides among youth. Pastor Mary Mwihaki said cases of youth committing suicide had become a common phenomenon. Her warning followed the death of a man in Mai Mahiu township said to have committed suicide after he failed to find a woman to marry. The tragedy brought to five the number of people who have committed suicide in Naivasha in this month alone. In the latest incident, the body of the 23-year-old was found hanging in his house a day after he was seen in the company of friends in the town. Witness James Kuria said the man left a note, saying no one should weep during his burial. “The note indicated he had failed to secure a job and a wife and he could not see the reason to continue living,” Kuria said. He said the deceased was a disciplined man who mingled freely with people. Mwihaki said the society was losing its moral fabric and called for counselling. They said the menace was threatening to wipe out a generation. She said the time had come for Kenyans to pray over the cases that she said were increasing by the day. Mwihaki said many youths were frustrated in life while others had engaged in love affairs that had turned fatal. She asked church leaders to dedicate prayers to minimise suicide. “These cases are all over. We need to curse this demon that has befallen the youth," Mwihaki said. Meanwhile, a boda boda rider was crushed to death by a trailer at Maili Mbili area along the Naivasha-Mai Mahiu road. Witness Paul Kimani said the cyclist was joining the busy road from Mirera area when the trailer knocked him down. He died on the spot. “He did not check and joined the highway carelessly, resulting in the fatal accident. It is unfortunate that we have lost him at his prime age,” he said. Naivasha police boss Samuel Waweru confirmed both incidences and said the bodies had been taken to the Naivasha Subcounty Hospital Mortuary.  edited by p. obuya
