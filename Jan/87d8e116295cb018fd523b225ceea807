The recent Cabinet reshuffle and changes in government have spurred fear to corrupt leaders who hold high offices. p President Uhuru Kenyatta on Tuesday fired  Agriculture CS Mwangi Kiunjuri and Treasury's Henry Rotich, who was on suspension. The move is supposedly expected to bring about groundbreaking changes in steering the country’s economy. Kiunjuri has had his fair share of problems in the Agriculture ministry, including the NCPB scandal — although he was not implicated. The locust invasion could have been prevented if not for delaying tactics. But the question I ask is how many more will be fired for us to have a clear and transparent agricultural sector in efforts to boost our food economy? How many more will have to go for us to have a corruption-free country? Some leaders have not yet understood the mandate bestowed on them by the President. Some are taking the problems facing wananchi lightly,  while others are seizing every opportunity to steal from the public coffers. Why thrive on wananchi’s misfortunes to fatten your already fat pockets. Kenya has leaders who always had a high affinity for corruption. They step in with all merry filled empty promises and once they get into the system they join the looting. For us to have a corruption-free country, the President should fire everyone in government named in any corruption scandal, should be relieved of their powers. Importantly, their replacements should be people of integrity. The crackdown on corruption should continue until every Kenyan feels its impact. More steps in the shaking of government offices should take place, mop them Mr President. We are tired of having corrupt leaders who deliver nothing but their sweet words. We are all behind you as Kenyans!
