The Majority Chief Whip of the National Assembly, Benjamin Washiali, has blamed his opponents for releasing a video in which he is shown assaulting an unknown man (see P28). In his defence, Washiali claimed it was an old video from 2015 and that the man had been siphoning fuel from Mumias Sugar tractors at a time when the company was struggling. Neither of these arguments excuse Washiali's behaviour. He should just apologise. A crime committed five years ago has not exceeded the statute of limitations and is still a crime today. The police could still prosecute Washiali if they wished. And it is no justification to claim that he was beating a fuel thief. All citizens have rights. Washiali should have taken the alleged thief to the nearest police station, especially as he was accompanied by his police bodyguards in the video. Washiali has a history of getting involved in hot-headed confrontations, as when he scuffled with Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya in 2016. Washiali is a lawmaker and should obey the law himself. He should apologise for his actions rather than trying to justify them. Quote of the day: "The mediocrity with which Africa has been ruled is responsible for its underdevelopment."
