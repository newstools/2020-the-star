Schoolchildren are among suspects wh have been arrested in Nyeri over links to possible recruitment to al Shabaab ranks. County commissioner Loyford Kibaara on Thursday security officials were working closely with principals and headteachers to monitor the behaviour of pupils and students suspected to have been radicalised. Police will monitor what they do and their movements. The administrator asked parents to be vigilant and closely monitor what their children do, especially with mobile phones which Kibaara said could be one of the gadgets being used to lure them into al Shabaab. “When children take phones, just abruptly check what they are reading or viewing so that we minimise the number of people who are getting radicalised,” Kibaara said. He said monitoring the children will help detect early when they are falling into radicalisation traps. Kibaara said for the only three weeks he has been in the county, they have managed to arrest a good number of suspects including school-going children. The administrator was deployed to the county last month. “You may not understand but children in Witemere and Majengo slums have been going missing and they are not reported,” Kibaara said. He asked parents to report when they realise their children have gone missing so the government can trace them. The county commissioner also decried the increase in consumption of bhang believed to be coming from the neighbouring Ethiopia. He said some of the drugs make their way to other parts of the country through Nyeri. The official spoke during a public consultation forum on the Public Finance Management (Coffee Cherry Advance Revolving Fund) Regulations, 2019 held at a hotel in Nyeri town.  edited by peter obuya
