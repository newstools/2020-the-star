 Kisumu health workers have given the county government 21 days to implement their return to work agreement of last year or they go on strike. The workers from the Kenya National Union Nurses, Kenya Union of Clinical Officers, Kenya National Union of Medical Laboratory Officers and Union of Kenya Civil servants signed a return to work agreement with the county in September last year. In a letter dated January 13 and addressed to the county secretary, secretaries of the unions Maurice Opetu (KNUN), Hilary Awiti (KNUMLO), and Craus Okumu (KUCO) asked the county to effect promotions and pay their arrears. “We hereby issue a 21-day strike notice with effect from January 13 if the above issues among others are not implemented as per the return to work formula,” the letter says. The unions and the county had agreed that promotions for all health workers shall be concluded by December 31, last year. They also agreed that all the staff promotions shall be implemented and payments paid in arrears effective July 1, 2019. “You recall that the concerned unions have made several attempts by way of correspondences and other engagement such as meetings with the executive to ensure the full implementation of the agreement. However, nothing has happened.” The unions said, “All our unions, institutions and departmental representative shave been advised to mobilise members to down tools on the expiry of this notice.”  edited by p.o
