The stage is set for the annual Rachuonyo 15km road race to be held at Kendu Bay town in Homa Bay County on Saturday. Athletics Kenya Nyanza North chairman Joseph Ochieng yesterday said the event will also be used to select a team to represent the region at the national cross country championships in Nairobi. The race is sponsored by Benjamin Njoga, the Athletics Kenya Prisons chairman, who has been supporting the race since it's inception five years ago. Besides the main 15km race, other races lined up are 6km junior women and 8km junior men. “We shall for the first time have 5km for women aged under 18 and 6km for men,” Ochieng said. “We expect a good turn out in the 15km race and the junior races where we expect athletes from Kisumu, Siaya and Homa Bay counties.” He said they have also lined up sprints from 100m to 800m for upcoming athletes. “This is a region of sprints and we want to use this opportunity to tap talent,” added Ochieng. Experienced road runner Sammy Nyokaye said he will seek to lift the title after failing last year. “I have opted out of the Nyanza South cross country to run in Rachuonyo. Last year, I finished fifth but this time, my target is to lift the title,” said Nyokaye. Ochieng said winners of the 15kms road race will receive Sh15, 000 which will trickle down to the tenth finisher.
