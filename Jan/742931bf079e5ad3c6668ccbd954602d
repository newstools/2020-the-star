  People accusing Uhuru Kenyatta of plotting to become Prime Minister after his retirement as President have sinister motives, Trade Cabinet Secretary Peter Munya has said. "I have frequently talked to him and he has not declared interest," Munya said, stating that Uhuru has never said he wants any political post after his constitutional retirement. The former Meru governor spoke at the weekend during the burial of AIPCA Church archdeacon Jeremiah M’Ithira at St Mary’s Mwerokieni in Karama. Munya hit out at Tangatanga MPs allied to Deputy President William Ruto who accuse the President of abandoning his principal assistant ahead of the 2022 elections. “It is not written anywhere in bold that the Presidency is a reserve of only two communities. What about other Kenyan communities? I will not be intimidated not to give a genuine opinion on constitutional changes just because I do not hold a political seat.  I have a constitutional right,” he said. He at the same time drummed up the support for the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI), the brainchild of the handshake between President Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga. He said the BBI will end the political impasse, chaos and bloodshed the country suffers from every general election cycle. He said it will entrench peace and encompass inclusive executive structure of governance such that all Kenyan communities are incorporated. Munya said he is willing to be Prime Minister and urged those aiming their guns at the President to stop and instead support him for the post. “Will BBI prevent someone from vying for President? I wonder why some MPs say BBI is to block one person.  It is no guarantee he (that person) must be the President. Kenyans will decide,” the CS said.
