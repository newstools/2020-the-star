Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria has claimed to have received threats from the Kilimani Division OCPD after last week's arrest. Kuria on Monday told the Milimani Law Court that the police boss said, "It is now between you and me," after he was arrested last Friday. Kandara MP Alice Wahome, who is also one of Kuria's lawyers also claims to have received similar threats from the OCPD. The Gatundu legislator is now demanding for the OCPD to be questioned on his conduct and that of his officers at the Kilimani Police Station. Claims had been made that the police assaulted Kuria's lawyers who had gone to serve them with last Friday's court order. Kuria appeared before Chief Magistrate Martha Mutuku to take plea in a case where he is accused of physically assaulting a woman at the Royal Media Services premises. Kuria was released from the Kilimani police cells last Saturday around 7 pm after he deposited Sh20,000 to secure his freedom. The vocal legislator was forced to spend Friday night behind bars despite the court directing that he be released on a Sh50,000 cash bail. "It is dishonourable for the DPP to violate the rights of an accused person and still prosecute the person," the defense said. The defense wants the court to defer the plea pending the hearing of a matter in another court. They also want the court to grant Kuria an anticipatory bail saying the police are likely to rearrest him after his release. The ruling will be made on Monday at 2 pm Last Friday night, several leaders led by Kandara MP Alice Wahome were teargassed by police officers at the Kilimani Police Station after they had gone to demand Kuria's release.
