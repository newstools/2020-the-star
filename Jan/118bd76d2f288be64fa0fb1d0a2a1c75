A public administrator has rescued two pupils from a primary school in Awendo, Migori county who ran off to Nairobi to dance in pubs and appear in music videos for cash. Kanyasrega assistant chief Ezekiel Wire said the two had failed their exam to join Standard 8 and after being challenged by parents and teachers to improve their grades by studying, they opted to look for informal jobs in the city. Wire said the two had refused to study during holidays and when schools re-opened, hatched a plan to escape to Nairobi. Shortly after schools re-opened for the first term, the two boys disappeared. A classmate told the Star the two boys hitched a ride on a lorry ferrying cattle to Nairobi for sale. “After following up with classmates, we established where they were and got them arrested and brought back to the school,” Wire said. He said the children were disciplined and counselled by the community and told to always seek help from village elders and Nyumba Kumi officials in case they have problems with their parents and teachers. He said the two will be monitored to ensure they complete their education. Edited by R.Wamochie
