Two hundred Isiolo residents were conned out of Sh2,300 each by tricksters who promised them an appointment with Deputy President William Ruto on Monday. The furious victims said a man they did not know well asked them to contribute Sh1,100 for printed T-shirts to show support for Ruto and an additional Sh1,200 for transport from Isiolo to Nairobi where they were to meet the DP. Joyce Mwari said the journey to Nairobi was to begin at 5am. Most of the travellers, she said, would converge at Nyara where hired vehicles were to pick them at around 4.30am. “But it dawned on us that the journey was never to be as the 'organisers' kept telling us to have patience as the vehicles were being fueled. Six hours later, it became apparent no T-shirts were forthcoming and the journey to meet the DP was actually a big hoax,” Mwari said on Wednesday. The victims were furious and embarrassed that they had wasted an entire day waiting for a journey that was never to be. The victims reported the con to the Isiolo police station. They want police to arrest the conmen and recover their cash. Most of the victims were too ashamed to have their pictures taken. Edited by R.Wamochie
