Incompetent police officers can no longer sit pretty hoping that the worst punishment they can get is a transfer to other work stations. President Uhuru Kenyatta on Friday warned that services to Kenyans cannot be sacrificed on the altar of laziness. "We will not be transferring corruption from one region to another, no," he said at State House, Mombasa, as he addressed police bosses on the state of security. "If you make a mistake, be ready to go home... Hakuna kucheka na mtu (it's no laughing matter)." Uhuru reiterated that he will not allow the police service to be compromised by rogue officers. "We want to go to a platform where we reward those who do good and allow for the exit of those who are not performing." He urged the police bosses to pass the message to those serving under them.  "The thing I expect from you is the same thing I want you to expect from those who serve under you," he said. The police service will deal with any officer who fails to take action against incompetent juniors. The head of state asked them to report underperforming officers to the National Police Service to be dealt with. "If you don't take action early enough, we will," he said, urging the officers to pursue with determination, the victory against corruption and terrorism.
