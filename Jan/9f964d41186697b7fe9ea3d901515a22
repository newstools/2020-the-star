Governors from the Coast region now say that Saturday's BBI rally in Mombasa is for the local people and no one else should be allowed to speak. The governors, Hassan Joho (Mombasa), Amason Kingi (Kilifi), Dhadho Godhana (Tana River) and Granton Samboja (Taita Taveta) on Thursday declared Saturday's rally at Tononoka is purely a Coast affair. "This is a golden opportunity for Coast people to have their problems addressed. Others should wait for their chance in their regions," declared Kingi. This is in complete contrast to Wednesday's statement by Joho where he said other people are welcome to the rally. Deputy President William Ruto's allies have already said they will be attending the rally. "You can't come to one's house and go to the kitchen to serve yourself food," said Samboja. The Taita Taveta Governor said being welcomed to a meeting does not mean you will be allowed to speak. Godhana said Coast people want their issues captured in the BBI without any interference from outsiders. "Let no one come to disrupt our meeting, which is for Coast people," Godhana said. The governors said all six of them, including Lamu's Fahim Twaha and Kwale's Salim Mvurya, are in support of the BBI. The two were however not present at the presser at the Tononoka grounds. However, Kwale Senator Issa Boy represented Mvurya while Godhana issued an apology for Twaha who had not arrived by the time of the presser. On Friday, the governors will lead delegates in a meeting at the Wild Waters Complex where 15 people from each ward at the Coast will be present. On Tuesday, ODM leader Raila Odinga held discussions with Joho, Kingi, Samboja and Godhana ahead of the third BBI forum in Mombasa.
