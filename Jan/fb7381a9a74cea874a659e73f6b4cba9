Protection International Africa launched its Africa Hub at the Belgian ambassador's Muthaiga residence. PIA board chairperson Gitahi Githuku presided alongside Belgian Deputy Ambassador Ivan Feys. Headquartered in Brussels, Protection International is a Belgian NGO that has been working with local partners across the globe since the late nineties to support human rights defenders at risk, especially women. It does so by developing their security and protection management strategies. Also present at the launch were KNHCR commissioner Jedidah Wakonâ€‹yo, PI CEO Liliana de Marco and Kenyan and African human rights defenders.
