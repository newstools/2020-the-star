A man pleaded guilty to tree destruction on Tuesday and forced his alleged accomplice to do the same. Japheth Okoyo and Irene Opondi were charged with stealing a rare tree species from Ng’ong Forest. Okoyo took the plea first. When Opondi hesitated, Okoyo blurted, “Ala! It is true, yes we did,” sending the courtroom into laughter. The woman then quickly pleaded guilty. The court documents, however, do not show the relationship between the two. The prosecutor told the court that the two were arrested by officers on patrol and booked at Jamhuri police station. The court was told they are first offenders. Okoyo and Opondi apologised and said they stole the wood to fend for their families. The case will be mentioned on January 9, when the probation officer's report will be filed. Edited by R.Wamochie
