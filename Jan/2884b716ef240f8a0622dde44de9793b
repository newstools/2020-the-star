A Nairobi businessman has built toilets at the busy Lugulu market. The facility lacked toilets and traders, as well as customers, went to the bush when nature called. The traders' officials, Catherine Kubende and Bernard Kimokoti, had often pleaded with Noah Chiuli, who is also a politician, to help build the facility to prevent disease outbreak. "We have suffered for quite some time for lack of a place to relieve ourselves and we feared that cholera and other diseases could easily break out," Kubende said on Thursday at the market. The market is on the border of Webuye West and Webuye East constituencies and serves residents from both areas. The toilets were opened on Wednesday. The traders also complained of lack of adequate space at the market, forcing them to display their goods along the Webuye-Kitale road. They said this exposes them to danger, especially from out-of-control vehicles. Kimokot said they are "very unhappy" with their leaders since they pay tax every day but the county has failed to build toilets and modern market stalls. "We want to thank Noah for having given us a New Year's gift by building this facility," he said. "We do not want leaders who after we elect them disappear and do not come to listen to our plight." The traders said some markets across the county such as Chwele, Kimilili and Webuye have clean toilets. Chiuli, who has expressed interest in running for Webuye East MP in 2022, said on Wednesday he will support residents any way he can. He urged residents and local leaders to support Bungoma Governor Wycliffe Wangamatiâ€™s plan to have Webuye declared a municipality. Edited by Josephine M. Mayuya
