Kenya Handball Federation Western branch will hold two-day coaching and refereeing courses at Busia County polytechnic starting this morning. Over 30 coaches and referees, who are preparing for the annual Ebugwe Nyanja extravaganza to be held on February 2, have confirmed their attendance. Western branch KHF secretary Akaka Shisoka said the exercise is highly geared at equipping the participants with modern methods of coaching and refereeing. “Highly qualified and experienced instructors will be present to share experiences and challenges in modern handball, aimed at improving the technical abilities of the participants," said Shisoka. “All the participants should carry their training and refereeing gear, writing material and will be expected to carter for their own transport and accommodation.” Shisoka also challenged all the teams and schools taking part in all events that are organised by the Western branch to ensure that all their coaches have the minimum qualification. “The federation will not entertain untrained referees to participate in any events sanctioned by the federation as we seek to improve the standards of the game in this region,” warned Shizuoka. He also advised handball-playing schools and clubs to take advantage of such courses. The SG also called upon the county governments to support handball teams in the region as one way of diversifying sports.
