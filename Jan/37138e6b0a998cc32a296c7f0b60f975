Over 1,000 students from poor families in Shinyalu constituency have benefited from the National Government Constituency Development Fund as parents struggle with Form 1 enrollment this week. Shinyalu MP Justus Kizito who presided over the disbursement of cheques said his office had allocated over Sh25 million to be distributed to boarding secondary schools where the beneficiaries have been admitted. Each student will get between Sh20,000 and Sh55,000 depending on the school they will be joining. “The issue of school fees is very key in my manifesto and as you know a community that does not educate its children stands to perish. That’s why we have given out Sh25 million for this cause," the MP said. "As a leader, I’m committed to working with my CDF committee to make sure that our children get the required education. We have given a full scholarship to those joining national schools and we shall as well support those going to other schools, colleges and universities.” The legislator thanked the national government for providing bursary funds, saying he was cognizant of the fact that the families of the students are poor and their condition has got worse during the current hard economic times. Last week, Education Cabinet Secretary George Magoha called upon MPs and governors to chip in and support children from poor families. "I challenge the MPs at this time not to think of their cronies or those who voted for them but very kindly think of the poor children who have passed in their areas and since they are in charge of Sh100 million perhaps they can put aside a sizable amount of that money and look for the poor,” Magoha said.
