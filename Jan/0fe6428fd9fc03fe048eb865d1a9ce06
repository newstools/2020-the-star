Jubilee nominated MP Maina Kamanda has hinted at Central Kenya backing Internal Security Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang'i for the Prime Minister position under BBI. Kamanda heaped praise on Matiang'i saying that the Jubilee Government is being guarded by the CS. The nominated MP spoke in Kisii County on Friday during the first BBI consultative forum that brought together top politicians from across the country led by ODM leader Raila Odinga. Kamanda called on residents from the Gusii region to protect their son for when the right time comes, Central Kenya will throw their weight behind the CS for the PM post. "Even the work done by cabinet secretaries from Central cannot be compared to that of Matiang'i," Kamanda said amid wild cheers from the crowd. During the meeting, Raila said the Building Bridges Initiative is the only way to take Kenyans to the 'promised land'. "BBI is the only bridge to take us to Canaan," he said. Raila added that the country will be united by the BBI that was born out of the handshake between him and President Uhuru Kenyatta on March 9, 2018. Raila said that there will be be more consultative forums across the country to educate locals about what the BBI report contains. Matiang'i lauded Raila and Uhuru for the unity currently being witnessed in the country and urged Nyanza leaders to remain united. "This is the first time we are sitting as the people from Nyanza region to engage in one direction," Matiang'i said. He further said that the "wisdom" of BBI is in Raila and Uhuru. The CS called upon the MCAs to organise consultative forums in the wards to engage locals on BBI. "Every MCA should hold a congregation in villages to discuss the BBI report at the grassroots," Matiang'i said.
