County governments have been urged to support councils of elders in their area of jurisdiction. Devolution PS Charles Sunkuli on Tuesday said elders play a critical role in resolving disputes and conflicts, and they have been on the front-line in ensuring cohesion among communities. He spoke during the end-year party for Ololmasani Council of Elders at Olchobose Shrine, Ololmasani ward, in Transmara East subcounty. “We have seen these elders working around the clock to bring peace when tribal issues arise. We need to support their work,” Sunkuli said. He told the counties to build offices for the councils of elders to make their work easier and efficient. “As the national government, we are fully supporting these elders and their move to change society. If there will be changes to some constitutional clauses to support these elders, we will back them,” he said. He said Kenyans should support elders by ensuring they maintain peace and live harmoniously among all the people. Sunkuli urged elders to introduce traditional academies to teach the new generation about traditions. “Our elders should be the ones teaching in these traditional academies in their native language on tradition and the values to the children,” Sunkuli said. In attendance was MCA Richard Keter.
