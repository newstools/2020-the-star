Want to keep lifestyle diseases at bay? Have more sex. This is according to Pastor Mike Bitok of Founder of International Family Church in Eldoret. He did not cite any scientific evidence, however. Bitok was speaking during a fish dinner for adults at Nkubu, Meru county, at the invitation of Nominated MCA Gacheri Muthuri and Neema Bridge Builders, a community based organisation. The clergyman urged men to share their visions with their wives. He said husbands who ignore their wives in future plans die early, paving the way for their women to prosper while being served by other men. “If you die and leave your woman, you will be buried outside your house where other men will be jumping over your grave when heading to your bedroom for intimacy with your wife," he said. "Your wife then starts to prosper more than when you were two of you, in a manner that if you resurrect, you would wish to die due to the shock.” Bitok said men who leave their wives out of their plans end up poorer. He urged women to praise, cheer, give hope to and support their husbands. “I was a street urchin, then a watchman years back before marrying. My wife kept on praising me even when I was hopeless and that has made me what I am. She now lives in a Sh30 million house bought by me,” he said. The pastor said men cheat on their wives because they are too nagging. Bitok said every man has a woman he secretly admires or a mistress whom he would promptly marry in case the wife dies. “The reason she has not come home is because you [wife] are alive,” he said. Bitok said if every married man or woman would be given a chance to start over, only one per cent would choose their current spouse. The father of two said he chose to go back to school at the age of 36 to be a role model to young people. He scored 396 marks in his Kenya Certificate of Primary Education exam in 2011 and attained an A of 86 points in his KCSE exam.
