A woman food kiosk vendor on Tuesday made an impromptu visit like a determined locust at a Nairobi court, took a court caretaker “hostage” and ordered him to pay her Sh75  for the food he ate in November last year. The court official, who had shocked colleagues with his fluent English, however, escalated the matter when told her that she was going to pay it in seconds as the money was too little for such an embarrassment.“Mum, you are my mum, just go back to your workplace and I will pass by your place and pay you and Sh30 more at around 2pm. Just understand like my mum. I am working and busy,” he requested her. However, in a strong rejoinder, the woman remained adamant and vowed to stay until the debt is settled. Some insiders said the woman has been sending her intermediaries to tell the man that she wanted him to go and say hi, all in vain. The Star could not immediately establish what happened later as it left the venue to concentrate on other court stories. A man caused drama at a Nairobi court when he breathed in pain moments after he arrived in the courtroom and said that one of his teeth had broken into pieces. The man who looked composed in a black cool jumper was reluctant to open his mouth after the prosecution challenged him to do so.“ If I ask you to open your mouth so that we can check the broken tooth are you sure it is in the state you are telling the court because as I see, your mouth is not swollen?” the prosecutor asked. In the rejoinder, the man smiled and painfully nodded his head in disagreement. The magistrate ordered the case to proceed and he was released on bond. A witness was infuriated when a suspect asked her what she said was a silly question and even said she would crush the “young boy”.She briefly demonstrated how she was going to crush the man outside the court.“Akiamungu, huyo ningemkunja kunja kama anageendelea na hiyo maneno yake. Katoto kadogo eti sasa kananiuliza maswali mob,” she said.
