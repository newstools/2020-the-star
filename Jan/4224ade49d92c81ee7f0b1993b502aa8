A teacher at Muvandori Day Secondary School in Embu North subcounty was on Tuesday charged with defiling a student. Moses Kimanthi who is a computer teacher allegedly lured the girl with promises he would pay her school fees arrears before defiling her. He appeared before senior resident magistrate Tony Kwambai. He was charged with defiling the child on diverse dates between July 7 and 23 last year. The girl, aged 16 years, who is an orphan, said the accused invited her to his rented house in Manyatta town where he promised to clear her fees arrears before engaging in sex with her. The two continued meeting on weekends before the girl realized she was pregnant and informed him but he threatened to kill her if she disclosed the matter. When the mother of the girl realized her daughter was pregnant after she was taken to hospital for being ill, she confronted her and the girl revealed everything before they reported the matter at Kibugu police station. A manhunt for the teacher who went into hiding was launched and he was apprehended last Monday. While representing the accused who denied the allegations, Victor Adande, an advocate for the accused, urged the court to release his client on bond saying he was a student at Mt Kenya University. Kwambai released the teacher on bond of Sh100, 000 and a surety of a similar amount. The case was set for hearing on March 30.
