There was tight security in Kiambu County Headquarters ahead of James Nyoro's swearing as the governor. Armed policemen were seen all over the place as residents sang and danced in the event that is about to kick off. Invited guests were already seated by 12pm and were eagerly waiting for the ceremony to kick off. This was after the swearing in of Nyoro was cancelled over unavoidable reasons. "...the swearing in of Dr James Nyoro will not be conducted today. A new date will be communicated in due course. We apologise for any inconvenience caused," Judiciary said in a statement on Thursday. Earlier, pro-Nyoro leaders led by MCAs, friends and relatives were in frenzied mood anticipating swearing in of their new Kiambu Governor. Senators voted to uphold former Kiambu Governor Ferdinand Waititu's impeachment. He faced three charges, all of which were upheld.

In the second charge - crimes under the national law, 28 senators upheld the charge, while 11 voted to drop the charge. In the third charge - abuse of office - 28 voted to uphold the charge, while 11 voted to drop it.
