The Kenyan political landscape is in turmoil. As is the custom of the country to have political and crisis debates every day, a tougher debate of the Building Bridges Initiative has taken the better roots and has resulted in political divergence. Massive rallies have been fired in support of the initiative especially by leaders that support President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM chief Raila Odinga while those allied to Deputy President William Ruto seem to watch from the periphery. BBI was formed by a handshake meant to unite all Kenyans but it has instead deviated the country into different political inclinations. It has triggered mixed reactions from Kenyans who seem to have a little knowledge of the 156-page report. The voice of Wanjiku, in this case, seems almost invalid since only a few Kenyans have copies of the report. The rest will either be swayed by the decisions of a few leaders as has been the case in other national decisions or sit silently and wait for the outspoken ones to decide.  Mombasa
