Parents in Teso South have been urged to get involved in their children's lives at home and in school to improve the education standards in the region. "Parent involvement acts as a bridge in two key contexts in our children's early development â€“ at home and in school. We must take this seriously and not only blame teachers for the poor performance of our children. We should also chip in," Teso South MP Geoffrey Omuse said. He spoke after issuing a Sh8 million cheque for the construction of eight additional classrooms and an administration block at Busia Township Primary School. The school has a population of 865 pupils and hence the need to construct more classrooms to accommodate the increasing number of pupils. He condemned cases where teachers are chased away from schools by irate parents over poor performance in schools. "If you heed by my advice, and take up good parenting practices, we shall forever be associated with higher academic success, avoid school dropouts and reduced alcoholism and teenage pregnancies," Omuse said.
