The Lamu Port South Sudan Ethiopia Transport corridor project has resumed operations after it was shut down following recent al Shabaab attacks. The more than 2,000 casual labourers who had been sent on compulsory leave have been recalled. On January 7,  the China Communications Construction Company suspended activities following an attack on neighbouring Manda-Magogoni navy base. The company said in a statement that the security situation in Lamu was still very dire. The Lamu port is located about a kilometre from the navy base that was attacked by al Shabaab militants on January 5, leaving three US soldiers dead. “To ensure the personal safety of all employees, we have to suspend all the works and close the site until next Monday January 13th, 2020,” the notice read in part. Lapsset regional manager Salim Bunu said on Wednesday that construction works had since resumed and were progressing as per the schedule. Bunu said the casuals were recalled in phases, some last week and some this week. The casuals expressed relief at being recalled to work since many of them believed they had been sacked when the memo went round. “That day we were just called and asked to pack our bags and leave. But we are glad they called us. Our families would have suffered,” Kideri Musa said. Meanwhile, the Lamu Port Corridor Development Authority (LCDA) has confirmed that the ongoing construction of the Hindi Junction-Lapsset access road will be done by March. LCDA boss Silvestre Kasuku said that they will be seven months ahead of schedule if the March 2020 completion date is achieved. The total contract period for the Sh2.3 billion road is 20 months. “So far the construction of the first 10-kilometre lane is complete with the construction of the second and last lane of another 10 kilometres in length being already underway,” said Kasuku.
