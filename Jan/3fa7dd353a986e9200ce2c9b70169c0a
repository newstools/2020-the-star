Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko's administration is once again on the spotlight after the Ethics and Anti Corruption Commission said it has detected suspected fraudulent payments of pending bills. In a letter dated January 30, 2020, EACC CEO Twalib Mbarak said that the commission has received credible information concerning the illegal payments. "Some of the beneficiaries of the suspected fraudulent payments are suspected not to have offered services to the county government," the letter reads. As a result, EACC has urged the county to suspend any payments until the anti-graft institution is convinced that all payments made are legal "In order to safeguard public funds and to ensure that only deserving contractors and suppliers are paid, we advise that the intended payments be put on hold until this commission and other concerned government agencies are satisfied that the payments are genuine and that they are being made to deserving persons," Mbarak said. Mbarak explained that the commission's mandate is to investigate any acts of corruption, bribery or economic crimes on its own initiative upon receipt of the complaint from any person. EACC also highlighted that there are allegations of conflict of interest in regards to the payments. The letter was addressed to National Treasury's Principal Secretary Julius Muia and copied to the Governor of Central Bank and the County Secretary of Nairobi County. Last week, drama was witnessed at the County Executive Finance Office when a group of MCAs attempted to kick out former CEC for Finance Pauline Kahiga in office and install Allan Igambi in her place. At the centre of the controversy is Sh1.4 billion, which was released by the National Treasury this month for the county to settle its pending bills. It was said the drama came about after a tiff between Sonko and Kahiga. Kahiga had refused to pay lawyers and suppliers whose details were not captured in the pending bills.
