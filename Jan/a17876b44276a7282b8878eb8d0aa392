President Uhuru Kenyatta on Monday launched Kenya's first green bond at the London Stock Exchange (LSE). The President urged UK investors to use Kenya as a gateway to investing in Africa. He told investors that Kenya is a bridge to the emerging market of more than one billion people created by the African Continental Free Trade Area. It is Africa’s first green bond to be listed on the London Stock Exchange. Uhuru was among more than 20 heads of state from Africa who attended the UK–Africa Investment Summit 2020. He also said Kenya’s business environment is ranked among the top three on the continent. The President said he was delighted to open the day’s trading at one of the world’s oldest stock exchanges. The bond will also be used to finance student accommodation in Nairobi. The Summit also brings together heads of businesses and international institutions. The summit will showcase the quality and scale of the UK’s investment potential for African countries. The World Bank, ADB and IMF will exhibit their portfolios and launch initiatives to support more investment in Africa.
