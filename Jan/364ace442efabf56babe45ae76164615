Kenya Sevens' powerhouse Oscar Ouma, playmaker Sammy Oliech and utility forward  Dennis Ombachi have resumed training with the team. The trio last played for the national team in the 2017-2018 World Sevens Series as well as the Commonwealth Games and World Cup but did not play last year due to contractual dispute between the senior players and the union. According to a source, the three have been training on their own for the past two months and looked good in training yesterday. Ouma is expected to play against Kabras this weekend in a Kenya Cup clash and Oliech could feature for the Sarries in top of the table clash against Homeboyz tomorrow in an attempt to get matches under their belt hence prove their fitness. The trio trained with the rest of the squad yesterday at the RFUEA ground and according to sources, will be part of the team that heads to Nakuru for a three-day training camp ahead of the Hamilton and Sydney Sevens tournaments later this month. Sources in the team said head Coach Paul Feeney wants to asses their form and conditioning before giving them a chance to play for the national team in subsequent legs like Las Vegas, Vancouver, Singapore and Hong Kong in March and April The return of the three to training will make selection competitive and add experience to the squad. Shujaa lie 11th on the log with 15 points and face South Africa, England and Japan in Pool B during the Hamilton sevens. The team will be named on January 16 at the conclusion of the training camp in the Rift and will leave on January 18 for Australia. Feeney has set a target of qualifying for quarterfinal in each of the 10 legs in the  2019-2020 season. During the training sessions, the team has worked on improving its defensive alignment and set-pieces as well as educing their error rate.
