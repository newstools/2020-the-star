Embakasi East MP Babu Owino will be treated at the Industrial Area remand prison after falling ill while in remand. The order by a Nairobi court on Thursday came despite Babu's lawyers asking that he be treated outside the prison. The MP's health condition was made public before Milimani magistrate Kennedy Cheruiyot, after he failed to appear for a hearing on an incitement to violence case. In the case, Babu is accused of subversion and uttering abusive words against President Uhuru Kenyatta in 2017. The magistrate declined to issue the order to have Babu referred to a different facility, saying that the prison has sufficient medical treatment facilities where he can be attended to. The prosecution, through Catherine Mwaniki, said the prison authorities failed to produce him in court because he is unwell. Through his lawyer, the defence informed the court that the MP is suffering from chest pains and pleaded with the court to direct that he be taken to any other facility other than the prison clinic. The magistrate however adjourned the hearing to February 7 to confirm the hearing dates. In the hate speech case, Babu is accused of uttering the inciting words against the presidency during a public rally at Kawangware in Nairobi on September 24, 2017. Babu is alleged to have made a demeaning statement against Kenyatta. He also faces an alternative charge of incitement to violence and uttering words calculated to lead to disobedience of lawful authority. The MP was released on bail, but is at Industrial Area remand after being charged with the attempted murder of DJ Evolve at B-Club in Kilimani. Babu is expected in court next Monday to know whether he will be released on bail.
