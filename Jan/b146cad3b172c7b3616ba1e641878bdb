About Sh24 million is needed to repair schools that were destroyed by floods in West Pokot county. Governor John Lonyangapuo said more than six schools have to be renovated before schools reopen next week. "Each school needs between Sh3 million and Sh4 million to help repair infrastructure,” he said. The county chief urged the national government and well-wishers to help in the reconstruction. “We don’t want children to miss school because of lack of infrastructure. Let’s pull resources that we have to ensure they report on time,” he said. The schools are also in need of learning materials. Most of their books were washed away. They also need lightning arrestors. The region is prone to lightning. “We call upon on organisations like Safaricom to help us in setting up lightning arrestors in the schools,” Lonyangapuo said. He also appealed for scholarships and sponsorships to children from the affected areas, saying most parents lost everything and cannot afford to pay fees. “Organisations and institutions offering scholarships to students in the country should help us in offering help to the children so they can further their education without hitches." The governor thanked the media for highlighting victims' plight, saying they had helped to create awareness, which led to raising of funds to help the needy. “We have received over Sh30 million that will help in resettling the affected families,”  he said.
