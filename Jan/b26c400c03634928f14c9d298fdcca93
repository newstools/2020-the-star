Reigning Africa Youth Championships 5,000m silver medallist Jacob Krop and Boulogne Half marathon champion Nancy Jelagat will be the star attractions during the  Athletics Kenya (AK) North Rift regional Championships this weekend in Lodwar, Turkana County. Fresh from finishing fourth at the Valencia Ibercaja 10km race, where world 10,000m Rhonex Kipruto broke the six-week 10km world record, Krop will represent West Pokot County in the 10km senior men's race. The vast region comprises of five counties- Elgeyo Marakwet, Trans Nzoia, West Pokot, Turkana and Samburu. However, Krop, a Form 3 student at Chewoyet secondary school, will be chasing the title against his training and school-mate Shadrack Kipngetich as well as Rodgers Kwemoi. North Rift public relations officer, Boniface Tiren, said Krop, who witnessed the world record being broken in Valencia, will be the key highlight as they seek to select a formidable team to represent the region at the national trials. Athletics Kenya (AK) intend to use the trials to select a team to the Africa Cross Country Championships to be staged on Lome, Togo. “He has been consistent in his steps and we hope he will make the cut into the national team. Look at his running skills at his age! He has pushed great runners to the record and no doubt he starts favourite,,” said Tiren. Apart from Krop chasing the national cross country title, he will be using the event as part of his preparations for the World Under-20 that will be hosted at Moi , Kasarani in July. “He is a probable for the World U-20 and we want him to run his best,” added Tiren. Jelagat, who broke the Boulogne Half Marathon course record in 68:24 will lead Elgeyo Marakwet County. Jelagat faces opposition from Brilliant Jepkorir in the humid conditions.
