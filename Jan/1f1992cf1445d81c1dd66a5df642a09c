Trade and Industry CS Peter Munya has said the country needs a powerful president and a prime minister to address the ethnic imbalance and avert post-election violence. He said the Constitution should be amended to give the President powers to appoint judges. He said the president has been reduced to a rubber stamp and that is not good for proper governance, hence the need for the BBI to fix it. "The President currently cannot make a decision. Even in the US, president assents and then the names are sent to the Senate. It’s like we went overboard and the President cannot rectify the ills,” he said. Munya spoke at a funeral in Muriri, Tigania East. He was accompanied by former Tigania East MP Mpuru Aburi, who is now an EALA lawmaker. He said nobody should be given powers through the back door, cautioning that governance cannot be reduced to an agreement between two people. Munya said the BBI will not create a seat for anyone. Kenyans will decide as presidential candidates go round the country campaigning to have many legislators, he said. The former Meru governor criticised Jubilee leaders, who are allied to DP William Ruto, for opposing President Uhuru Kenyatta. He said they are not genuine and could have been paid to steer smear campaign against the head of state.
