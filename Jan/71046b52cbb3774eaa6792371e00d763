Some 1,700 Lurambi Primary School pupils will miss learning after the indefinite closure of the institution due to unhygienic conditions. The school lacks adequate toilets and the classrooms are dilapidated. It needs five new classrooms and 16 toilets. Kakamega public health officer Francis Wamono said on Tuesday that the institution posed a danger to pupils and teachers. Wamono said several classrooms have cracked walls and floors. “Some buildings are in a deplorable condition. There are inadequate toilets," he said, adding that the school had ignored a warning issued a month ago to fix the situation. Headteacher Jared Wasike said the closure letter was from the Ministry of Health. Wamono said the school will only be reopened after all the requirements have been met. County quality education assurance officer Isaac Kuya said pupils will only be allowed back after the classrooms and toilets have been fixed. “We do not want disaster to happen here and that is why learning has been suspended. We want children to experience a high level of hygiene and study in a conducive environment," he said. Pupils and parents arrived at the school on Monday when schools reopened for the first term, only to be turned away. Local MP Titus Khamala promised Sh1 million from the Constituency Development Fund to repair the classrooms and build more toilets.
