A man who allegedly engaged in unnatural acts with a dog and later strangled it to death has been arraigned before a Kagundo court. Boniface Mutuku Munyao denied the charge and was released on a Sh100,000 bond and a surety of the same amount. He was charged with killing an animal and committing an unnatural act with a dog. The case will be mentioned on January 22. The 35 year old man from Mbondoni in Kangundo was arrested on Wednesday for bestiality after he was caught having sexual acts with a neighbour's dog until it died. The man is said to have chocked the dog to death during the heinous act. Police had to rescue the man from an angry mob that was threatening to teach him morals for such a deed. The neighbors reported the matter to the police who arrested him and managed to collect 10 condoms suspected to have been used by the man during the act. Munyao is said to have returned from unknown place to his abandoned home with the German shepherd dog on Monday. According to the area chief Bethuel Kingele, Munyao is alleged to have been engaging in sexual acts with the dog since Monday using the 10 condoms as protection. "He was found having sex with the dog after some neighbours noticed a foul smell since the homestead which belongs to his grandmother is abandoned," he said. Kingele added that Munyao might have been under the influence of drugs which might have forced him to commit the shocking. There are also reports that the suspect is mentally ill.
