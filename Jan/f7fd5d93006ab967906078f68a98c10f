On-form Tusker and Harambee Stars striker Timothy Otieno will draw inspiration from the November Sports Journalist Association of Kenya(SJAK)/LG player of the month award to achieve his target for the season. Otieno disclosed that he is targeting 18 goals and looks well on course after netting 10 in 17 Kenyan Premier League rounds. The former Gor Mahia man revealed that he was aiming to score ten goals in the first leg and helped himself to half the number in November, breaching Nzoia Sugar twice then getting on the score sheet each time he came up against KCB, Western Stima and his former employers Posta Rangers. His hot form during the month saw him make a return to the national team Harambee Stars for the Cecafa Senior Challenge held in Uganda in December last year. He now wants to score eight times in the remaining 16 league games to hit a target set at the beginning of the season as well as muscle for the ‘golden boot’ where trails the leading scorer, AFC Leopards' John Makwata, by two goals. “That month got me called up to the national team and I want to keep scoring to maintain my stay with Harambee Stars and help Kenya achieve something special. I also aspire to lay my hands on the golden boot," said Otieno. "It has been my dream and I’ve tried to win it in the past but it looks feasible this season with the entire team firing on all cylinders. They can really help me win it. I had set a target of netting 18 goals and from the remaining matches I feel I will be able to hit and even surpass the tally.” The November gong was contested by among others Brian Nyakan of Sofapaka and Ulinzi Stars striker Oscar Wamalwa. However, Otieno’s performance was overwhelmingly superior to hand him a second gong, adding onto the one he won four years ago while playing for Posta Rangers. He becomes the third player to win the monthly gong more than once in the last five years.
