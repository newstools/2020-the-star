Kenyan DJs have formed an initiative, 'DJs4Justice initiative', after the ongoing online petition calling for safer places of public entertainment, where guns and all manner of violence are not allowed. This petition seeks to stop the culture of allowing firearms into entertainment spaces in Kenya. Petition organiser Gregg Tendwa says club owners should be championing the conversation on the safety of workers and revellers. In a statement, he said, "In the short term; #Justice4DJEvolve delivered- ​According to a video clip circulating on social media, Babu Owino is accused of unlawfully attempting to end the life of Felix Odhiambo Orinda alias DJ Evolve after shooting him twice in the neck." Together with local and diaspora DJs, they are calling for action that ​"No Guns in our Clubs". Under the Workmen's Compensation Act, any personal injury caused to a workman by accident arising out of and in the course of employment, the employer is liable to pay compensation following the provisions of this Act. Tendwa said, "Eliminate sexual & gender-based violence in the entertainment sector. The DJ fraternity wants measures to significantly reduce and eliminate violence. "Working with human rights organizations, the level of awareness, organising, campaigning and actioning on matters rights for the Kenyan entertainment worker will be strengthened."
