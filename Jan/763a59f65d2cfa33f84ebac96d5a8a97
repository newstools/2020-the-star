Kirinyaga MCAs on Monday elected a new speaker, five months after David Wachira's resignation infighting. Former lands chief officer Anthony Gathumbi beat his four rivals to clinch the seat with 32 votes out of the 33. The Kirinyaga county assembly has 33 MCAs. Jennifer Wanjiru, Linet Njeru, Timothy Mwangi and Philip Migwi all got no votes. One vote was spoilt. Gathumbi promised to unite two camps that have been fighting, saying the war had caused the stalling of businesses at the assembly. He said MCAs were unable to pass crucial bills and carry ut the oversight role. He denied MCAs were compromised to elect him their new speaker. "I did not bribe any of them. They voted freely," Gathumbi said. The new speaker said he will not allow his office to be influenced by the executive to compromise the oversight responsibility of the assembly. Former speaker David Wachira resigned in July last year, citing infighting in the assembly and personal reasons for his decision. In his resignation addressed to Governor Anne Waiguru, Wachira said he wanted to concentrate on his Nairobi-based law firm. A voter had moved to court seeking to overturn Wachira's resignation but withdrew the petition. Francis Waweru Muchiri argued that Wachira's decision to leave the office was against the Constitution.  edited by p.o
