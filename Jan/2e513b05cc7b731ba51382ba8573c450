She has also shared the stage with International acts Nasty C, Konshens, Burna Boy and a studio session with the award-winning Mr Eazi. The Ballantine’s’ True Music winner 2019 took a one year break off music to focus on her studies in the UK, and is back with a bang and promises her fans more music this 2020. “This year, I am focusing on creating musical experiences for both myself and my fans.” TheOnlyRosa, said.
