Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang'ula has denied being involved in the multimillion-shilling fake gold trade scandal which came to light last year. "I am not a gold trader and I have never traded in gold in my life. I have nothing to do with it…If anyone was looking for me, they know where to find me,” he said on Tuesday. Wetang'ula spoke during an interview with Citizen TV's Newsnight. A leaked audio last year put Wetang'ula at the heart of the multi-million shilling fake gold scandal, with detectives saying he was a person of interest. In the audio conversation, Wetang'ula dropped the names of President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM's Raila Odinga to assure a Dubai gold investor believed to be Ali Zandi that their detained consignment would be released. In the call, the person, believed to be Wetang'ula, assured Zandi, a business associate of United Arab Emirates ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, that he had talked to Raila who in turn reached out to Uhuru to secure the release of the pricey containers. However, Wetang'ula denied any involvement, saying, “There are so many people who mimic others…I am not a gold trader. If the DCI wants to talk to me I am available.” "You can see that voice is muffled. It sounds like me but it's a muffled voice... how many people have voices that are like each other?"
