Tanzanian singer Vanessa Mdee has opened up about how a furniture shop with a page ‘Furniture_mat’ on Instagram conned her. She took to her Instagram and revealed how she was convinced into paying for furniture that was never delivered.“Nasemaje Watanzania wamekuchoka mwizi wewe leo ni mwisho wako, you messed with the wrong one!!” she wrote in her post. Vanessa said she realised she had been duped when her enquiries about the furniture delivery were met with excuses after excuses. To ensure no one else falls prey to the con artists, Vanessa asked her fans to report the page and have it closed.
