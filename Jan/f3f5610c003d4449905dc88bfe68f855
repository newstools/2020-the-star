A businessman of Italian origin was on Friday arraigned in court for deliberately 'cooking up' company details in a bid to evade taxation. Tony Rosafio allegedly faked a purchase worth Sh79 million in order to cut off Sh20 million off his company's value-added. For a period between 2015 and 2019, the Smoky Hill Limited Director purposefully presented false documents to the commissioner of Domestic taxes in the company's VAT returns. KRA  commissioner, Investigation and Enforcement Department, David Yego said after depth investigations into the company's tax returns, he tried to engage the company through the directors but they were unresponsive. "According to the prosecution, Smoky Hill Limited deliberately and knowingly failed to declare income earned and unjustifiably used fictitious invoices to defraud the government revenue," he said. Yego Said that Rosalio neither filed income Tax Company Returns for the years of income from 2015 to 2018 nor paid any corporation tax on the same. Rosafio pleaded not guilty to the charges before Chief Magistrate Edna Nyaloti and was released on bond of Sh4 million and an alternative cash bail of Sh1 million. This comes amid efforts by KRA to nab tax evaders especially business and company owners in the country. In November last year, a businessman was charged with sh 58 million tax evasion following allegations of indulging in “missing trader” scheme. David Ngari Ndiritu, who is the sole proprietor of Aberdare Solutions is said to be a beneficiary of the ‘missing trader’ tax evasion scheme, a tax fraud syndicate where a taxpayer uses several registered business names for fictitious invoicing. In two counts, Ngari is accused of using fictitious invoices from Bosco Enterprises and Davron Petroleum Limited to illegally claim Value Added Taxes(VAT) refunds of Kshs.14 million and KShs.6.6 million respectively.
