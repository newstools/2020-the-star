A Nairobi businessman could face up to five years in jail for allegedly assaulting his wife last year in May. Randeep Singh Deogun has been charged with assaulting Dal Jeet Kaur Bhambra causing her bodily harm. He is said to have been angered by the amount of time his wife spent on her phone and grabbed her by the hair attempting to pluck it out. Due to the firm grip on her hair, the court heard on Friday, Bhambra shot up to defend herself but was overpowered by her husband of a month. The couple had exchanged marriage vows at a Sikh temple last year in April, the prosecution says. Deogun hurled insults at her vowing to teach her a lesson “lest she forgot her marriage vows to love him for better or for worse”. Looking subdued by the force of law, Deogun–who wore a white turban–stood before Milimani senior resident magistrate Roseline Aganyo to answer for his alleged breach of the law. Aganyo read out the charge to him that he assaulted his wife last year on May 22 at their Balozi Estate home in South B within Industrial Area. Deogun denied the charge and was released on a bond of Sh50,000 or an alternative Sh10,000 bail. His case will be mentioned in two weeks. Edited by R.Wamochie
