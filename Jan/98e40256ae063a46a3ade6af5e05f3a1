AFC Leopards head a list of three Kenyan Premier League clubs currently chasing for the signature of former green Commandos striker Henry Mejja. This is after the star grabbed 10 goals in the annual Senator Cleophas Malala Cup which was concluded last month. Others clubs seeking to sign the player are Kakamega Homeboyz and Tusker. Mejja has never hidden his desire of featuring in the top tier league and the youngster confirmed that he has been approached by several clubs but he was still doing consultations on the way forward and the best outfit to join. “It’s true I want to realise my dream of playing top level football right from Kenyan Premier League and even outside the country. All this will depend on the play time I will get as I need  good exposure and also the development of my skills. “I have offers from AFC Leopards, Tusker and Kakamega Homeboyz but at the moment, I want to relax a bit before deciding where I will go. It has been very busy for me during the festive season with so many matches and I feel I should relax and recover,” he noted. “I intend to feature in KPL for one or two seasons then see if I can get opportunity to play in European leagues that are very attractive. I am aware all these will require hard work and discipline something that am currently working on,” said Mejja. The youngster, who also featured in NSL side Green Commandos, played an instrumental part in helping Lirhembe Arsenal win Cleophas Malala Cup and the Golden Boot for himself.
