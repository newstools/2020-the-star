Members of the newly formed County Executive Audit Committee have been urged to be vigilant and focused as they monitor fiscal matters in the executive. Finance executive Roble Nunow promised the team chaired by Ibrahim Khalil of his full support. He addressed the auditors during their inaugural meeting. Nunow said they will play an important role in internal controls and governance. He urged them to be strong in case of resistance and hostility in the course of their work. The Public Finance Management Act, 2012, and the Public Finance Management Regulation, 2015, require each public entity to establish an audit committee. Garissa is one of the first counties to comply. The committee forms a key element in the governance process by providing an independent expert assessment of the activities of top management, quality of risk management, financial reporting, financial management and internal audit. Other critical roles include ensuring external audit recommendations are fully addressed, the quality of internal audit is of an appropriate standard and line management has full regard for internal audit recommendations. They will ensure information made available to stakeholders is reliable, thereby enabling them to make sound judgments about management quality and future prospects for the county government. Also present at the meeting were secretary Zeinab Hussein, who is the director of internal audit services, Aminazahra Mohamed, Mohamed Elmi and Abdikadir Aden.
