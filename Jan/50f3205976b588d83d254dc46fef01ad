Bridget Achieng says her baby Sekani's future is secured by three business empires. "Wow and to think that I was scared to death that Sekani Rich was going to stop me from shining. So far as I look closely to his birthday next month and the fire that this boy has put in me, it can only be God," she wrote on Instagram. "He is covered for life his three business empires will see him through school until when he says he can't do it anymore. I got you my prince for life." Achieng gave birth last year.
