The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have announced they will step back as "senior" royals and divide time between UK and North America. In a statement released by Buckingham Palace, the couple said they plan to "carve out a progressive new role within this institution". They said they intend to "work to become financially independent". Last September, Prince Harry and Meghan publicly revealed their struggles under the media spotlight. In an ITV documentary, Meghan admitted motherhood was a "struggle" due to intense interest from newspapers. Prince Harry also responded to reports of a rift between him and his brother William, the Duke of Cambridge, by saying they were on "different paths". In October, the duchess began legal action against a newspaper over a claim that it unlawfully published one of her private letters. She accused the Mail on Sunday and its parent company of a campaign of "untrue" stories.
