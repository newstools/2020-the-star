A total of 24 schools will battle it out for the 15's and 7's titles during the annual Maseno-Amadi Open tournament this weekend. According to Maseno School rugby coach Mark Nyamita, who is one of the organisers, national secondary schools rugby champions Kakamerga High School headline the schools which have confirmed participation. Others include hosts Maseno School, Dagoretti High, Ofafa Jericho, Lenana School, Nanyuki High, Moi Sirgoi, Friends School Kamusinga, Koyonzo, Chavakali, Vihiga High, Kabianga Boys and Cardinal Otuga High, Mosocho among others. Nyamita said: “We played and won the Lenana School Open 15's tournament last weekend. We used it to test our systems ahead of our tournament which we also want to win. Several top ruby schools in Nyanza, Western and Rift Valley have entered the tournament.” He added: “Our target this year will be to defend the Nyanza region 15's title and also qualify for the East Africa games.” At the same time, more than 100 teams are expected to attend the annual event according to Maseno School's director of sports, Caleb Olang. “I'm actually worried but I have secured extra playing fields at Maseno University and Maseno campus. We expect more than 100 teams to participate in various disciplines for both boys and girls. "The tournament has attracted champions in various disciplines from across the country because they want to engage against each other ahead of first term term competition,” said Olang. The annual tournament will also feature soccer, basketball, hockey, handball, volleyball and racquet games for boys and girls.
