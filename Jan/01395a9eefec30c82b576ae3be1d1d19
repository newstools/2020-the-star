Wazalendo are looking to sign talented players with a view of nurturing them, coach Fidelis Kimanzi has confirmed. Kimanzi said last season's runners up have identified at least two players who can help bolster their midfield and defence and are currently locked up in talks  with their clubs to finalise the deals. Attacking-wise, he said they will promote players from the club's lower leagues in a bid to make them  gain experience at a higher level and enhance competition in the playing unit. "Basically we have earmarked certain players whose names will be announced later  and we are in discussion with their team managers and we hope they will be granted their wish. "Defence and midfield is our priority. In attack, we have exciting prospects who we intend to give an opportunity in the coming season to showcase their ability.  We would have loved to promote players from other departments but none is ready for the big step," observed Kimanzi. He said it is not in their policy to sign established players. "We abide by the club's policy of scouting for raw talent before moulding  them. We actually look at the players' potential," he added. The South B-based club, however, made it clear that they will only release players if they are offered better terms and opportunities elsewhere although none has asked to leave. The self-supporting club further reiterated their commitment to fight for the title next season after an aborted attempt. "Nobody has contacted us and we rarely lose our players because we are like a family. However, If there are opportunities at a higher level with jobs involved,  we will be open to discussion."
