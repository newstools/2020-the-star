As the battle for Kenya Cup playoff intensifies, Nakuru, Menenegai Oilers and Mwamba are locked in a three-way contest for the remaining two slots. Nakuru lie fifth with 33 points with Oilers sixth two points behind. Mwamba are seventh with 29 Points. Nakuru edged Oilers 19-17 in a hard-fought derby at the Nakuru Athletic Club as Mwamba edged Blak Blad 15-14 in last weekend's matches. Oliers coach Gibson Weru said they are ready to put Saturday's disappointments behind them as they look forward to their next fixtures, which include three home matches against Western Bulls, Homeboyz and Quins. Their last encounter will be a visit to Ruaraka to face KCB and Weru is hopeful they will have sealed their place in the top four by then. "Our home form has been good and I believe the boys will rise to the occasion. We tend to struggle on the road and playing three matches at home will work to our advantage,” said Weru while lamenting about their slow start against Nakuru. "We started slowly and never got going until the second half. It was an up-down encounter but at least we got a losing bonus point which will aid in our push for the playoffs,” noted Weru. Nakuru coach Felix Oloo was delighted with the victory, saying:  "It's always good when you win a derby game. Oilers have been a thorn in our flesh since they were promoted to the top tier." Oloo said two more wins out of the four remaining matches will guarantee them a place in the playoffs. In other results Kabras maintained top spot after thrashing Kisumu 52-13 at the Mamboleo showground. Champions KCB overcame Western Bulls 28-9 at the bullring in Kakamega. Homeboyz kept their good run of form with a 48-3 demolition of Quins to stay third on the log as Impala made light work of Nondies winning 28-18.
