North Rift residents and leaders ushered in the New Year with the hope 2020 will bring better tidings than 2019. Many residents thronged churches to pray for a better year. Governor Jackson Mandago joined residents of Uasin Gishu in ushering the New Year in Eldoret. He said counties and the national government must work harder to improve the lives of Kenyans in the New Year. "As we usher in 2020, it provides us with the opportunity to reflect and plan. We give thanks to God for taking us this far despite the many problems we have gone through as a county, families, and individuals," Mandago said. The county chief promised that his administration will continue to support entrepreneurs and other investors whose initiatives will help the country fight poverty. Mandago said he would focus on putting in place a good environment for investors, including improving infrastructure such as roads in Eldoret. "We will make sure that we tarmac all the feeder roads in town to be accessible and provide a conducive environment for doing business and everyone will get to do business and earn a living," he said. Mandago said he wants Eldoret to be known as a business town. "As a government, we will facilitate and make sure the business is flourishing," he said. Governors Patrick Khaemba of Trans Nzoia and Alex Tolgos of Elgeyo Marakwet also expressed hope that the counties and the country at large would achieve better growth in 2020. “What we urge most is unity and peace so that we can focus on real issues affecting our nation. We have good prospects and opportunities which God has given us, and we should serve our people with greater dedication,” Tolgos said. Governor John Lonyangapuo of West Pokot said 2020 would be the year to face Kenya’s challenges head-on. Bishop David Situma urged leaders to work together with the common purpose of serving Kenyans. “A good leader should not focus on selfish agenda. One becomes a leader to serve people, not for personal gain,” he said.
