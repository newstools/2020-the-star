A man charged with having an intent to commit robbery on Wednesday said he would rather die than pay Sh30,000 bail for an offence he did not commit. Daniel Mwangi was also granted alternative Sh50,000 bond by Milimani magistrate Nzibe Muthoni. He, however, wanted to hear none of it. He said he would prefer death to release through bail. "Afadhali nife, sikufanya chochote na sina pesa... Hata niko na dawa za Mathare na afadhali mniue (I'd rather die, I did not do a thing and I don't have money... I even have medicine from Mathare so you rather kill me)," he said. Mwangi was charged with a felony after he was found possessing a kitchen knife and a club on Kimathi Street, Nairobi. According to court papers, the police believed he planned to commit a crime. But Mwangi denied wrongdoing and instead accused the police of assaulting and pushing him into sewage, before handcuffing him. He said he was arrested on his way to a funeral ceremony and that he had no plans to rob anybody or any organisation. He demanded unconditional release, saying he had a sick elderly mother and children who depend on him. "Niko na matanga na watoto wananitegemea (I have a funeral to attend and my children depend on me)," Mwangi said. Some people whispered in the courtroom that Mwangi was a beggar in Nairobi's CBD. But in court papers, the police say they arrested Mwangi on Tuesday after suspecting that he had an ill motive. As they approached him, he allegedly tried to escape but they pursued him.Â The officers claim Mwangi threw himself into a pool of wastewater. They add that they found a rungu and knife on him. Mwangi also resisted efforts by a court orderly to return him to the cell. He became hostile as the officer tried to handcuff him. Mwangi head-butted the officer, causing him an injury. Five more officers had to be called to contain the situation. As he was whisked away, Mwangi swore that he will not provide bail or bond. The case will be mentioned on January 22.
