President Uhuru Kenyatta has sent a message of condolence and comfort to the family of Raphael Githiga Mwai, a leading Kenyan policy and governance expert who passed away recently.

The President paid glowing tribute to the late Mwai, describing him as a patriotic Kenyan who contributed immensely to the growth of corporate governance and ethics in the country. “Mr Mwai made a significant contribution that shaped the corporate governance sector in the country. He influenced many Kenyans especially those currently holding senior positions in our state corporations. “We are deeply saddened by his departure and we pray that the Almighty God comforts the family, relatives and friends at this very difficult moment," said the President. The President urged Kenyans in corporate governance to emulate the late Raphael Githiga Mwai by instituting measures aimed at streamlining the management of both public and private enterprises.
