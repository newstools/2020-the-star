ODM leader Raila Odinga says that a lifestyle audit on Deputy President William Ruto would show that his wealth is questionable. Speaking to NTV on Sunday night, Raila said that this was the major issue that he has with Ruto. "I wouldn't say I don't like him as a person but there are things he does that I do not agree with," Raila said adding that he met Ruto first in 1978. Asked if he sees Ruto being Kenyan President, Raila said; "Why not. If the people of Kenya elect him as the president who am I to say no." Raila also said that he appointed Ruto as Minister in the grand coalition government and gave him the largest docket - Agriculture. "When we were negotiating a joint cabinet I had my list of ministers, the other side was not comfortable with the name William Ruto, they said they didnâ€™t want him," the former prime minister said. The opposition leader however termed as unethical the claim by Ruto that he approached the DP first before the handshake with President Uhuru Kenyatta. Last week, Ruto repeated a previous statement that Raila had approached him for negotiations but referred him to Uhuru. "I was shocked and surprised when Ruto said I had approached him. That is very unethical. Some good samaritans spoke to me and I gave them my conditions. Ultimately the conditions were met and Uhuru and I talked," Raila said. He added that he can swear that Ruto was never part of the negotiations that brought about the 2018 handshake. "Why would I call Ruto? I never did. That I can swear. I never spoke to William Ruto." the former PM said. Raila also said that he has never discussed Jubilee Party affairs with Uhuru and their focus is on the BBI. The ODM leader said that they agreed with Uhuru that the 2010 Constitution was not working and this needed to be solved. "We have a new constitution, it is not working. So what is it that needs to be done to ensure that these things are working? These are the questions that we asked ourselves," Raila said.
