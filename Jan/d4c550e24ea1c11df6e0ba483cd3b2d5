Body of a 44 year old man, Peter Mukundi Mutiso, was discovered at Mama Ngina Water front by members of the public on Sunday. Mukundi allegedly murdered his wife Ruth Kaveke Mutiso, 42, in Majengo Mapya area in Likoni within Mombasa following a domestic row. Police had launched a man hunt for the suspect who had escaped after killing his wife in order to be arrested and charged in court. "The body had been identified by his brother and he is suspected to have poisoned himself, but at this point we cannot rule it was suicide until an autopsy is carried out," Likoni police boss Jane Munywoki said . Police had recovered a sharp blood stained machete suspected to be the murder weapon used to murder his wife before he later killed himself. Mundi is said to have escaped immediately after he realised that his wife had died after he slashed her severally. Mundi's wife was found lying on her bed in a pool of blood with deep cuts on her head and her back. Their bodies are at Coast General Mortuary awaiting for autopsy reports. Two weeks ago, a pastor in Mombasa stabbed his wife on the pulpit during a church service before he killed himself. Police investigations revealed that the murder was as a result of domestic violence.
