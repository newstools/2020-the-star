The High Court in Garissa on Thursday allowed 63 contractors to pursue a civil case against the county government over pending bills. While delivering the order, Justice Charles Kariuki said the petitioner should have first withdrawn the first petition before filing another case against the respondent. The court, however, declined to issue conservatory orders preventing the county government from utilising Sh1.9 billion other than settling bills. The judge said the petitioner did not demonstrate to the court that there was such an amount set aside for that purpose. The petitioners had argued that the President directed county governments to clear all pending bills before engaging new contractors and that the Controller of Budget released Sh1,927,137,092 to pay pending bills. They also alleged that the county government was utilising the released funds to pay new contractors and not clear pending bills. They said this infringed on their constitutional rights. They wanted the court to issue conservatory orders preventing the Garissa county government from utilising the funds and submit requests for reimbursement costs for expended time and money to prosecute the case. But the county government, in its submission, opposed the conservatory orders sought and argued that the petition was premature, misguided, misconceived, misconstrued and misapprehended. Petitioners lawyer, Abdirizak Mohammed, argued that the directive to have pending bills settled was from the President and should be honoured by the county government. The contractors had moved to court after the county government failed to pay them for rendering their services to the previous regime between 2013 and 2017. They said they were unable to pay school fees for their children while others risked having their properties auctioned for failing to service loans.
