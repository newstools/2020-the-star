Two Embu legislators allied to Deputy President William Ruto have faulted politicians criticising President Uhuru Kenyatta's decision to sack former Agriculture CS Mwangi Kiunjuri. Mbeere North MP Muriuki Njagagua and nominated counterpart Cecily Mbarire said on Wednesday that Uhuru has the prerogative to hire and fire Cabinet secretaries and it is wrong to fault him. “He has acted within the law. We hope that those he has brought in will do a better job,” Njagagua said. He said reshuffles make officials work harder and that he believes the changes the President has made will benefit the nation. Mbarire said that since the country only has two years before the next election, it is okay for the President to reshuffle and engage with the people he thinks will deliver. The duo hailed the government for the changes he made to improve agriculture, saying the move would revamp the sector, especially coffee, tea and dairy farming.
