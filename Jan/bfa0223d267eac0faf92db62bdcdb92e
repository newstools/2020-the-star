A case in which a controversial pastor James Ng'ang'a is charged with Sh3.6 million fraud will proceed in May, a magistrate has ruled. The case against the Neno Evangelism Church leader was scheduled for hearing yesterday before senior principal magistrate Peter Ooko but the prosecution was not ready. The preacher has denied obtaining from businessman Wickson Mwathe  Sh3.6 million at his church office in Nairobi county three years ago. The magistrate fixed the hearing in May 6 and 7 after pastor Ng'ang'a told the court that he will be out of the country  from the month of March until the end of of April. Court documents say Ng'ang'a took the money from Mwathe on the pretext that he was in a position to lease him a residential house at the upmarket Karen Estate in Nairobi. He was arraigned after losing his bid to stop his prosecution. The prosecution says Ng'ang'a committed the offence on April 6, 2016 at his office on Haile Selassie Avenue, Nairobi. Ng'ang'a is represented in the case by a team of lawyers led by Charles Ongoto. During the plea taking, his defence successfully applied for bail, saying he is an apostle and a public figure who cannot fail to turn up in court during his trial.
