The Inspector-General of Police Hillary Mutyambai dismissed reports of restructuring within the National Police Service touching on the General Service Unit. The IG was responding to an article on the Daily Nation on Thursday which stated that the GSU will cease to be an autonomous unit within the NPS following proposals to place it under the Administration Police Service in a new structure. In a statement released on Thursday, the IG said that a document doing rounds on social media that the NPS is prepared to make the said changes is erroneous and does not reflect the position of the NPS. "The NPS is currently undertaking a reform journey in line with the Policy Framework and Strategy for Reorganization of the National Police Service unveiled on 13th September 2018: this is the only document which gives direction to our reform and restructuring agenda," the statement read. The statement added that any information on the reform agenda and other NPS affairs originating elsewhere other than the office of the IG should be treated as inauthentic. "The IG has been working closely with stakeholders including the media about the path the NPS is taking and his office remains open for consultation on this front," the statement read.
