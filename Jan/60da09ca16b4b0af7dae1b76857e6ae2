Dickson Chumba faces an acid test at the Tokyo Marathon slated for March 1.

With a personal best time of 2:04:46 All African Games half-marathon, Titus Ekiru remains a formidable challenger having previously grabbed victories in Seville, Mexico City, Honolulu Marathon (twice) and Milano Marathon. World marathon bronze medallist Amos Kipruto is also in the mix for the event and has a personal best of 2:05:43 while another Kenyan, Bedan Karoki will also be seeking to win his first marathon. Karoki has a personal best time of 2:06:48 which he ran in Chicago last year. He also finished third at the 2017 London Marathon after clocking 2:07:41 Simon Kariuki, with a personal best of 2:09:41, has also been entered for the event. The Kenyan contingent faces a Herculean task from Ethiopia's defending champion Legese Birhanu, who has a personal best of 2:02:48. He leads compatriots Getaneh Molla (2:03:34), Lemina Sisay (2:03:36), Mengistu Asefa (2:04:08), Lemi Hayle (2:04:33) and Bahrain's El Abbassi El Hassan (2:04:43) also frontrunners. In the women's category, Valery Aiyabei spearheads Kenya's challenge with a personal best of 2:19:10 which she ran in Frankfurt last year. She will have Sally Sally Chepyego (2:21:06) for company. Ethiopia will be represented by Aga Ruti (2:18:34), Birhane Dibaba (2:18:46), Tigist Girma (2:19:52) and Shure Demise (2:20:59). Tokyo Marathon race director Tadaaki Hayano said the race will serve as trials for Japanese athletes, who are fighting for the last ticket to the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Marathon. "We can greatly look forward to a battle between the current and past national record holders of the same age, Suguru Osako and Yuta Shitara. We also expect Hiroto Inoue, with Japanese record of 2:06:54 from Tokyo Marathon 2018, to tag along," added Hayano. "For one to win the last ticket to the Tokyo 2020, he must clear the time of 2:05:49 set by Japan Association of Athletics Federation. If no one clears the time, Osako who finished third in MGC race last September will be picked," he said. "Osako could have chosen not to enter the race and waited for days to pass by. Instead, he chose to enter the battle. His will power is something like no other, and perhaps, his pride as the national record holder is what fuels him."
