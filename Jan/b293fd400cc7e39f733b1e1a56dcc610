The Catholic Church will on Saturday instal Bishop Dominic Kimengichas Bishop of Eldoret. He will replace Bishop Cornelius Korir who died two years ago. Kimengich, who previously served as Bishop in Lodwar, was appointed three months ago by Pope Francis, Bishop Maurice Crawley has been servicing as Apostolic Administrator since Korir's death. The installation ceremony will take place at the Seminary in Eldoret. For the last two month, Kimengich has been in Eldoret preparing to take over and meeting local leaders to discuss the state of affairs in the region. Last week he met Nandi Governor Stephen Sang in Kapsabet. â€œWe welcome the new bishop and we are ready to work with him as he takes over the big shoes left by Bishop Korir," Sang said. Korir was recognized internationally for his role in the fight for human rights, justice and standing up for the poor and oppressed in society. Last week Kimengich led religious leaders in the Rift Valley to warn that heightened politics around the BBI may plunge the country into a political crisis and deeper divisions ahead of the 2022 General Election. He said political leaders must slow down and drive the country in the right direction, noting that the wounds of the past were yet to heal. Kimengich said BBI should be handled as a separate process not linked to the 2022 polls. Political leaders must stop whipping up tensions and emotions over BBI, which Kimengich said was meant to solve some major problems that have held Kenya back. He said the situation in the country calls for a referendum and must be handled very carefully because 2022 is near. (Edited by V. Graham)
