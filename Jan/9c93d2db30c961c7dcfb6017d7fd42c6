Siaya Senator James Orengo has urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to gazette the extension of the term of the BBI team for it to start the second round of public participation to refine the report. He said there is an urgent need for the President to gazette the names of the team members to enable the country hold a referendum by July before 20222 campaigns kick off. Orengo spoke on Monday during a press briefing at Parliament Buildings in which he and a group of senators said the meeting scheduled for Friday meant to discuss BBI is not an exclusive affair of the region's governors. Orengo and Kisii Senator Sam Ongeri said the meeting has been organised by all leaders from the areas and will be attended by delegates from the six counties. They said the counties will not incur any expenditure on the meeting. "The BBI team has a Sh10 billion budget. So no county will spend a coin," Ongeri said.
