Teenager Erling Haaland scored a sensational hat-trick within 23 minutes of making his Borussia Dortmund debut as he helped his team come from two goals down to secure a 5-3 win over Augsburg on Saturday as the Bundesliga resumed after the winter break. The Norwegian’s performance took the spotlight away from RB Leipzig’s 3-1 comeback victory over Union Berlin, with two goals from Timo Werner, that moved them five points clear at the top on 40 points. Champions Bayern Munich, third on 33, travel to Hertha Berlin on Sunday. Borussia Moenchengladbach are second on 35 after losing 2-0 to Schalke last week. Haaland, who joined only weeks ago from Red Bull Salzburg for a reported 20 million euros ($22.18 million), scored his first goal with a low drive in the 59th, three minutes after coming on to cut the gap to 3-2. Augsburg had led 2-0 and 3-1 through a brace from Florian Niederlechner and a goal from Marco Richter after Dortmund had squandered plenty of scoring chances in the first half. Julian Brandt had briefly cut the deficit for Dortmund. Jadon Sancho drew the hosts level in the 61st and Haaland then tapped in Dortmund’s fourth in the 70th to put them ahead. The 19-year-old talent sealed their win to live up to heightened expectations and completed his memorable hat-trick in the 79th minute to put fourth-placed Dortmund on 33 points.
