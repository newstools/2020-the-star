Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria has claimed ODM leader Raila Odinga is behind controversial lawyer Miguna Miguna's tribulations. He said President Uhuru Kenyatta, on the other hand, has no problem with Miguna's return to Kenya. "When President was talking of allowing Miguna during the burial of (late and former mayor Charles) Rubia, he meant every word of it, but I have information that the person who is behind Miguna's tribulations is Raila Odinga," Kuria said. He spoke on Wednesday, during a press conference at Parliament Buildings. Kuria urged the government to respect the court order, insisting that Miguna is a Kenyan. The High Court has given the government until Thursday to file responses in Miguna's case. Justice Weldon Korir said the orders issued on Monday remain in force. The state has said that Miguna is free to come to Kenya, but must first obtain a Kenyan passport. In a statement on Wednesday, government spokesman Cyrus Oguna said it was puzzling why Miguna had not visited a Kenyan mission to obtain his passport. He went on to say Miguna had proved to be an unruly passenger, following his forcible deportation in 2018 and this threatened JKIA's good international status, which it has worked hard to achieve. Lawyer John Khaminwa on Wednesday told the court that he talked to Interior CS Fred Matiang'i who told him that the state is not opposed to Miguna's return. The case will be heard on Friday. On Tuesday, Miguna was blocked from checking-in on his flight from Germany thwarting his second bid to return home. Lufthansa airline told the Star the order not to allow the lawyer on board any of their planes came from Kenyan authorities. Miguna's flight was set to touch down at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport at about 9.25pm on Tuesday. Later on Tuesday evening, Miguna posted a photo inside a plane on Twitter saying he was on his way to Nairobi. But this announcement was short-lived with Air France kicking him out of the plane before departure.
