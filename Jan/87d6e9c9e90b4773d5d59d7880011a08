Nyeri parents who fail to enrol their children in secondary schools risk arrest and prosecution, county commissioner Lyford Kibaara has warned. Kibaara said the government remains committed to ensuring all 2019 KCPE candidates transit to secondary schools. He spoke in Nyeri town Tuesday when he flagged off 16 pupils who have benefitted from Equity Bank’s Wings to Fly scholarship programme. The programme provides financial support for their four-year secondary education. The needy learners were selected from Nyeri Central, Tetu, Kieni East and West subcounties. They were the most deserving cases. Kibaara emphasised the need for students to maintain discipline and shun drug abuse and outlawed groups. He reminded parents that day secondary education is free, hence there is no excuse to have a student drop out or fail to get enrolled. Also present was Nyeri Town MP Ngunjiri Wambugu, who urged the beneficiaries to take their studies seriously so they can break the cycle of poverty in their families and help society. He cautioned that those who misbehave risk losing the scholarship. The pupils were taken to Kenyatta University to join other beneficiaries for an induction programme before the commissioning of this season’s programme on Friday.
