After beating defending champions Gor Mahia 2-1 over the weekend to fortify their second place on the log, Kakamega Homeboyz head coach Nicholas Muyoti is hopeful his side will keep the fire burning and win the title at the end of the season. Homeboyz have defied odds to sit second with 37 points —one shy of league leaders Tusker and the former AFC Leopards midfielder believes the title will be theirs to lose at the end of the campaign. Muyoti said the one match at a time approach is the ingredient to their maiden league crown.He thanked the management of the club for the quality of players assembled before the season began. “The management did a great work to support the technical bench to establish  good side. We, however, believe this is work  in progress and we want to maintain good structures to ensure we dominate local football for decades to come," he noted. The youthful coach expressed his delight with the return of his defender Festus Okiring from injury. Okiring played a major role in thwarting sharp Gor Mahia striking force. “I pray for him to maintain the fitness as we forge forward with our fight for the title. "I thank the players for their discipline, commitment and the sacrifice they are making for the team. This is what we need to make Bukhungu Stadium our fortress," he added. ‘’We don’t want to exert a lot of pressure on our players but just urge them to maintain the focus by taking each match at a time bearing in mind that KPL is tough and each match comes with a different approach,’’ he noted. The former Thika United coach in the meantime revealed that the team is targeting to rope in four new players during this transfer window. He  also added that the team will do their best to get hold of all their  key players and release few who will be loaned to other clubs.
