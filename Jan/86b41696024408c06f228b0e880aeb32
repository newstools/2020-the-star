The Gertrude's Gardens Children's Hospital staff pension scheme has sued Stanlib Kenya for recklessness in investing its Sh20 million in the collapsed Chase Bank. Gertrude's says the decision was negligent as it did not conduct adequate due diligence prior to investing in Imperial Bank and Chase Bank. “Due diligence would have revealed the management and liquidity issues facing the two commercial banks,” the suit papers read. The hospital staff retirement benefits scheme now wants the fund manager to pay the money it invested without obtaining prior consent. According to suit papers, Stanlib Kenya did not get prior written consent from the scheme trustee, a breach of the agreement. The money was invested in 2015. Stanlib Kenya, the court heard, issued a 60-day notice to all its clients last year on October 31 saying that ICEA Lion asset manager was purchasing its business. It had indicated it will exit Kenya by the end of the year. Efforts to write to Stanlib Kenya demanding payment of the money in question has not been successful, the court heard. As a result of negligence on the part of Stanlib, the scheme says, it has suffered a loss of Sh53.4 million. Stanlib, however, said since it has an arbitration agreement, the matter in question ought to be heard in arbitration. It denied being negligent. Stanlib also informed the court that it will have a presence in the country for at least another 24 months which is sufficient time to start and finish arbitration on the issue. The case will be heard on February 20. Edited by R.Wamochie
