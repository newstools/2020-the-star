Bottom of the table Kisii RFC host the University of Eldoret's Trojans on Saturday in a KRU matchday 11 encounter seeking crucial points in their battle to avoid relegation. Coach Eric Bosire said the game is a must-win one for the former  Kenya Cup side. “We shall play all our remaining matches like finals. Avoiding relegation is achievable but we must win all our matches,” said the former Mwamba player. Kisii has only four points having lost eight for failing to honour four away games due to financial challenges. Last weekend, Kisii recorded a 16-11 win over fellow relegation-threatened side Mombasa RFC at Gusii Stadium. Leaders and promotion favourites Strathmore Leos will be at Catholic University in Karengata for an encounter against fourth-placed debutants Northern Suburbs. Leos, who were relegated from Kenya Cup last season are in pole position to seal a home semi-final. The Madaraka-based side is so far unbeaten in the league and leads the log with 53 points, eight ahead of second-placed Masinde Murilo University of Science and Technology (MMUST). MMUST will be at home to Egerton University's Wasps and Ochieng Ahaya's side will go for nothing less than a routine win. MMUST lost their only game, against Leos, at home in the first leg. Third-placed Mean Machine will be at home to South Coast Pirates. The three-time Kenya Cup winners are also looking for a return to Kenya Cup next season. Fifth-placed United States International University (USIU) Martials will travel to Eldoret for a game against Eldoret RFC.
