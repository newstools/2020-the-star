Ngong Road rivals Impala and Quins have bolstered their squads ahead of the second half of the Kenya Cup campaign. Impala, who lie third fourth on the log on 30 points, have signed Nesta Okotch (KCB),  John Kiilu (Quins) and  lock Billy Arigi (Kisumu RFC). Others are  Tony Khadambi, Dennis Juma and Albert Obura from Strathmore Leos and academy graduate Douglas Ochami who rejoins the side from Daystar. Ocholla said the signings were meant to create depth ahead of gruelling second half of the campaign which also includes the Enterprise Cup knockout fixtures. "We were a bit thin in terms of numbers so we opted to add quality players to our roster and I know they will add value to the team,” he said Ocholla expects to have internationals Samuel Motari (injury) and Samuel Oliech (personal commitments) back soon for the campaign. The former Kenya Sevens and 15's international said the new signings have had a couple of training sessions with their new teammates. “They will be considered for selection based on how they train and it will add to competition for places in the starting lineup,” he noted. Ocholla said he is taking one match at time after a promising start to the campaign. "So far, so good! The boys are looking good  and we hope to be in peak condition in the second half of the campaign,” he added. The Sarries have a date with Homeboyz this weekend at the Jamhuri Park Show ground. Quins, who lie 10th on the log of after a woeful start to the campaign have signed Homeboyz fleet footed winger Mark Wandetto. Edward Shitanda rejoins the side from Homeboyz, Leroy Njenga from Blak Blad, Haron Andati previously with Dagoretti High School and Allan Mukoya from Chuka University. Head coach Dominique Habimanna expects the signings to bolster his side as they attempt to move up the table. Quins host Kisumu RFC at the RFUEA ground on Saturday.
