Calling male colleagues uncircumcised has cost a nominated MCA in Embu her county assembly post. Judy Mbuya has been stripped of her position as county assembly majority chief whip for repeatedly terming her elected male colleagues uncircumcised. The Jubilee MCA was also accused of brandishing crude weapons and threatening to clobber her colleagues. Mbuya was replaced with Kyeni South MCA Salesio Kimaru in a party caucus on Friday. Majority leader Michael Njeru had written to Jubilee caucus chairman Duncan Mbui (Evurore MCA), accusing Mbuya of hurling insults at MCAs on social media platforms. She is also accused of misleading the ruling party leadership and failing to lobby her counterparts to support county government business in the assembly. Jubilee Party has a majority in the assembly. Another member kicked out was Murithi Kiura, who was stripped of his deputy majority leader post for his handling of members' welfare. He was replaced with Mwea MCA Harrison Mwaluko. His colleagues accused Kiura of not supporting legislative proposals forwarded to the assembly by the executive. He was accused of undermining the authority of the county assembly and fanning animosity among members. Mbuya and Kiura were accused of plotting to remove Njeru from his majority leader position and to scrap the position of county assembly Jubilee caucus chairman. Fifteen Jubilee MCAs voted to remove the two and elect new members, while three absconded; five failed to attend without apology. Edited by Josephine M. Mayuya
