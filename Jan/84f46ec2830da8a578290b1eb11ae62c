Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko will appear before a Voi court on Tuesday to be charged with assaulting a police officer. The governor was to be arraigned on December 18 last year before senior resident magistrate Fredrick Nyakundi but his lawyers said he was unwell and on bed rest. On Monday Sonko's lawyer, Cecil Miller told the Star that Sonko will be in court. The charge sheet says Sonko assaulted the police officer at 12.30pm in the due execution of his duties contrary to section 103 of the National Police Service Act 2011. The county chief has also been accused of kicking Coast regional commander Rashid Yakubu on the thigh during his arrest at Ikanga strip. Four witnesses including Commander Yakub and police officers James Mwanzia, Michael Muriithi,Â  Fred Sabai, Stephen Mtawa, Ibrahim Ahmed have been listed to testify in the case. The incident occurred on December 6, as the governor was being arrested at a roadblock in Voi over graft allegations at City Hall. Sonko is facing 19 charges of corruption, abuse of office and irregular payments that lost the county Sh357 million in Nairobi.
