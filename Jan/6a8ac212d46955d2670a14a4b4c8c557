Police have arrested a controversial blogger Cyprian Nyakundi and Emmanuel Nyamweya over plans to extort Sh17 million. The police said the two had already received Sh1 million from a victim as a down payment. The two had allegedly demanded the cash as a precondition for pulling down libelous posts appearing on a website they own. They are in custody and will be arraigned on Tuesday. The money recovered after a successful investigation on extortion, blackmail and false accusations will be used as an exhibit. Nyakundi has found himself in trouble on several occasions over defamatory articles. In 2018, he was arrested for making defamatory statements against Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko.
