The Building Bridges Initiative steering committee is currently meeting for the first time since its term was renewed. The 14-member team is expected to come up with a schedule of its activities and also elect among themselves the chair and vice-chair of the task force. The team will either confirm Garissa Senator Yusuf Haji and Adams Oloo as chairman and vice-chairperson respectively or pick new officials. Lawyer Paul Mwangi, the joint Secretary to the task force, confirmed the meeting. “It is an internal meeting. We will issue a statement later,” Mwangi told the Star on Monday. The team is also expected to unveil its road map for the second phase of public engagement as the BBI wave gathers steam. The members of the committee include Garissa Senator Mohamed Yusuf Haji, Bishop Lawi Imathiu, Maison Leshomo, James Matundura, and Rose Moseu. Others are Agnes Kavindu Muthama, Saeed Mwaguni, Bishop Peter Njenga, Archbishop Emeritus Zaccheaus Okoth, Adams Oloo, Busia Senator Amos Wako, Florence Omose, Morompi ole Ronkei, and John Seii. The joint secretaries are Martin Kimani and Paul Mwangi. President Uhuru Kenyatta and opposition chief Raila Odinga last month extended the term of the BBI team to spearhead the second phase of the public participation. The team is expected to isolate policy, legislative and constitutional review issues   to implement the BBI report.
