Former Nakuru county secretary Joseph Motari, now a senior official in the national government, was on Thursday charged with abuse of office in Nakuru. Motari was arrested by Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission detectives on Tuesday evening and held at Milimani police station overnight before being escorted to Nakuru where he was arraigned. The charge against him stated that he used his office improperly to appoint Johnson Njuguna Kamau to the position of director of water in the Ministry of Environment, Natural Resources Energy and Water. The charge read that Motari made the appointment on February 24, 2016 without following the laid down recruitment procedures. The man who has since moved to the national government’s Ministry of Water  denied the charge before senior principal magistrate Bernard Mararo. His lawyers Tom Ojienda, David Mong’eri and Harry Gakinya applied for his release on bond saying he was not a flight risk. Ojienda said Motari was a senior officer working under the Office of the President and promised his client will diligently appear in court whenever he is required to. He added that his client was no longer an employee of the Nakuru county government and would therefore not tamper with the evidence or witnesses. He was released on Sh500,000 bond with surety pending mention of the case on January 17.
