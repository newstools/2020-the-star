A prime suspect in journalist Eric Oloo's murder was on Monday denied bond by the High Court in Siaya. Judge Roseline Aburili said the information on the probation report indicated that Joel Lutta does not qualify to be released as he is a flight risk. In the probation report, it was established Joel is a drug addict and heavy drinker. Aburili had ordered a pre-bail assessment report on brothers Joel and Victor Lutta, which was filed by probation officer Rhoda Wanyonyi on Friday. Joel and Victor were jointly charged with the murder in November last year in Ugunja subcounty, Siaya county. The judge assured Oloo's family the hearing of the case will be fast-tracked. Victor was granted Sh2 million bond and Sh600,000 bail. During examination by the probation officer, Victor qualified to be released. The duo denied murder charges and the matter is slated for hearing on a priority basis between March 23 and 25.
