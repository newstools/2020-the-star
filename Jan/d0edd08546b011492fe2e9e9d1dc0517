Thousands of squatters in Sabaki, Magarini, have threatened to invade the over 900-acre ADC land if the government will not fast track the process of giving them back their grabbed land. The Agricultural Development Corporation's land was allegedly illegally allocated to top government officials, influential people, and tycoons at the expense of the locals, who gave out the land for the project. Led by MCA Edward Delle, the residents said the National Land Commission and Parliament proved the land was grabbed but wondered why they have not revoked the titles and initiated the process of subdividing it to locals. Speaking at Sabaki during cattle distribution, Delle told the authorities to speed up the process to enable the residents get back their land. "If you won't give us this land quickly, we are going to get inside. We want to get land ownership documents for this land because it was grabbed," he said. Currently, he said, the authorities are aware that the 900 Acre ADC land was grabbed from the genuine people. Delle said he was arrested together with locals for seven days but do not fear anything and are not tired of fighting for their land. The MCA said the titles of those who grabbed ADC land should be revoked but warned that the process should not take years as it could be grabbed again.
