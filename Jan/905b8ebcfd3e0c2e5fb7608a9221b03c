 Tottenham Hotspur and the Metropolitan Police have found no evidence of alleged racial abuse from supporters towards Chelsea’s Antonio Rudiger during last month’s Premier League match. Rudiger was involved in an incident in which Tottenham’s Son Heung-min was shown a red card and indicated shortly afterwards that he had been the victim of a monkey gesture from the home section of the crowd. Play was stopped at the Tottenham Hotspur stadium and an announcement on the public address system informed the crowd: “Racist behaviour from spectators is interfering with the game.” However, a Spurs statement on Monday said the club have now ‘exhausted all avenues of investigation’. “The police have notified us today that, having reviewed and investigated, they have closed the crime report as they can find no evidence to support the allegation of racial abuse,” Spurs added. “We fully support Antonio Rudiger with the action that he took — however, there is no evidence to corroborate or contradict the allegation and as such neither ourselves nor the police are in a position to take any further action.” “If any new information comes to light, this will be fully investigated.”
