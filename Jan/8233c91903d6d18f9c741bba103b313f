Debutants Nairobi Chapel teams are looking to play a few test matches to build confidence and endurance ahead of the Kenya Hockey Union (KHU) league kick off on February 29. The church-owned club has fielded a team apiece in the women's Super League and men's national league. The team currently trains at Kinyanjui ground near Kawangware and each of the two outfits has  20 players. "The majority of the players have played high school and college hockey and lack experience. Therefore, they  need for more exposure, said coach Emmanuel Were. The teams are considering shifting their training base to Lenana School with three training sessions lined up weekly. The former St. James Bulimbo Girls' secondary school coach said both teams have what it takes to put up brave show irrespective of their newcomer status. "We have a good crop of players though they haven't played at the league level. "Few have inter-college experience. Inexperience will be a major concern because we will be dealing with seasoned teams but I am unfazed about that. "We have played some matches and more will follow as we gauge the strength and weaknesses of the team. The management will have to get the goalkeeper's kit which is unavailable at the moment," he added. Pastor Festus Omoto, who is responsible for the spiritual nourishment of the team said members of the church will support the team materially. "Ours is to mentor them and we are open to anyone joining the team. We want to keep the youths busy and crime-free as most are just at their homes. Church members will come in handy for  the teams in terms of hockey sticks, field hockey shoes, and balls as part of the goodwill," he said. Kitale Hockey club will also make their maiden appearance in the men's national league. Parkroad Tigers and Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (JKUAT) will play in the Super League after gaining promotion from the lowest tier.
