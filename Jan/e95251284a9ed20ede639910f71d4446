Sunday's attack on a military base in Manda, Lamu county, by al Shabab Islamist group is a warning shot that Kenya is once again a soft target after the killing of top Iranian General Qassem Soleimani. Kenya's association with the US and its presence in Somali have always placed it at risk of terror attacks. The US Embassy attack, Westgate, Dusit 2 quickly come to mind as acts of revenge against Kenya. Terrorists do not engage in conventional warfare but thrive on surprise attacks. Kenya's border is porous and entry is almost unfettered. Restrictions and security are only felt at airports and seaports but it remains easy to come in by road. A month rarely passes without reports of foreigners caught in Nairobi or other major towns without proper documentation. Officials are compromised to turn a blind eye not knowing that those coming in could be on a suicide mission. Entry into Tanzania is not easy and you will hardly make it to the capital Dar es Salaam if your papers are not in order. The Nyumba Kumi initiative also works so well that a foreigner sticks out like a sore thumb. We must all be each other's keeper to deal with the ever-changing terror tactics.
