Busia woman rep Florence Mutua has advised her Nairobi counterpart Esther Passaris to stop responding to tweets from rapper King Kaka and focus on recuperating. "You will come back and continue the engagement. For now, I don't think it's healthy. Please totally log-off," she said. Mutua's comment on Monday came after Passaris told King Kaka he was full of himself following his criticism of her decision to seek treatment in India, rather than locally. King Kaka had on Monday hit at Passaris for seeking medical care in a foreign hospital while her constituents in Nairobi cannot access basic health care. Passaris underwent spinal cord surgery in India. She tweeted, "I invested Sh50 million to be elected a leader. I served way before being elected." This was in response to a Twitter user who told Passaris to stop posting about her seeking treatment in India because many Kenyans are unable to seek basic treatment in their own country. King Kaka last month released a track titled 'Wajinga nyinyi' in which he accused politicians of greed and graft. He on Monday blasted Passaris, calling her selfish for not ensuring development in the health sector in Kenya. However, Passaris did not let King Kaka's post slide and said the rapper does not have what it takes to drive change. Last month, King Kaka attracted the wrath of Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru after mentioning her in his 'Wajinga Nyinyi'Â song. She had threatened to sue him, but later changed her mind, saying he was a confused attention seeker.
