Controversial lawyer Miguna Miguna was yesterday stopped in Frankfurt from flying to Kenya (see P4-5). The German airline Lufthansa told media Kenya authorities had instructed them that Miguna should not be allowed to board flight LH590 that was due to land at JKIA at 9.25pm last night. On Monday the High Court instructed that Miguna should be allowed to enter Kenya and the Interior ministry confirmed that it would comply with that order. Yesterday government spokesman Cyrus Oguna said President Uhuru Kenyatta had not changed his view that Miguna should be allowed to returnâ‰¥ So who blocked Miguna's return? Does the left hand know what the right hand is doing? The government is making a mountain out of a molehill. Miguna is less newsworthy than firebrands such as Moses Kuria, Kipchumba Murkomen or Benjamin Washiali. He would not get much publicity if he entered Kenya normally. But now Miguna will shoot to the top of the TV bulletins and the front pages. The government is giving him more publicity than he deserves. The state should reverse its decision and allow him to enter Kenya. Quote of the day: "I have never met a man so ignorant that I couldn't learn something from him."
