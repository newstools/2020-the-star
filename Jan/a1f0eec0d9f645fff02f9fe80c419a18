Increased training sessions will boost Lakers' endurance and agility to challenge for the title this season, coach Austin Tuju has said. Lakers paid heavily for irregular training schedules last season with 2-1 back-to-back defeats against United States International University  USIU-A Spartans and Slider in October largely blamed by the tactician on inadequate drills. The Kisumu-based team have extended their training regime from three to eight days ostensibly to enhance the team's fitness levels, allow new players to seamlessly fit into the side and incorporate a winning culture. The soft-spoken coach wants consistency from his charges whose brave performance previously left much to be desired. The women hockey Premier League outfit, which was formed three years ago, finished fourth in their maiden season. The Linah Barasa-captained side has signed 14 more players to increase depth. Lakers have organised a local tournament by the end of this month to test their new signings before deciding on those players who will be ready for the first-team action ahead of the league's February kick-off. The signing of a goalkeeper brought relief to the tactician who had to depend on 16-year-old student at Sinyolo Girls, Millicent Adhiambo. "Our decision to add more preparation days is because we want the players to understand our playing style and for the the team to bond. The team has what it takes to fight for the title and our sole aim this season  is to improve our performance," Tuju observed. "We are not worried at all now because our goalkeeping department is sorted. We mean business and our opponents must be prepared." Lakers can fancy their title chances having lost only thrice and  pushed 22-time champions Blazers close. Lakers also took points from Strathmore Scorpions,  one of the best women's teams in the country.
