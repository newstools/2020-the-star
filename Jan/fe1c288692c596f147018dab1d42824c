Public Service and Gender CS Margaret Kobia has protested against Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria's reference to ODM leader Raila Odinga as a President Uhuru Kenyatta's wife. "This emerging trend of insults due to political differences must end to avoid destroying society," she said. Speaking to the Star on Friday, Kobia condemned insults in public meetings. "If we are to mentor the young through role modeling, we need to exercise restraint. Even in expressing displeasure we must respect other persons views," she said. "Why on earth would anyone misuse the status of a woman as a wife?" Kuria who spoke in Lari on Wednesday referred to Raila as Uhuru's second wife. "We are being humiliated by this wife you brought into this home," Kuria said. "We were in Mombasa and my seat was snatched away from me because I refused to stand for this wife you brought home. We do not have a problem with them because if a home has two wives, we as children can only accept and because we accepted this wife to come home. Why don’t you tell them to respect us too and stop despising us?" He said Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Murkomen was also forced to call Raila  'Baba' eight times during the BBI forum in Mombasa.
