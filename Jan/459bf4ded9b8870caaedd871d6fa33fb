Elgeyo Marakwet county government has started a door-to-door campaign against malaria after four people died. Health CEC Kiprono Chepkok has said the programme will also cover public primary and secondary schools along the highlands and lower parts of the Kerio Valley which is hardest hit. He said the county decided to come up with the programme after hundreds of people seeking treatment tested positive for malaria. Chepkok said it will take some time before they contain the situation because of poor communication network and shortage of drugs. “Accessing anti-malaria drugs is a problem because of the delay by Kenya Medical Supply Agency to dispatch the consignments to counties affected by the outbreak,” he said. Chepkok said they have dispatched another team of health staff to distribute mosquito nets to expectant mothers, the elderly and children who are most vulnerable. “We do not want to take chances and that is why we have come up with intervention measures to curb the spread of malaria that has so far claimed the lives of four people and left scores of others among them secondary school students hospitalised." He asked residents from areas mapped as malaria zones to cooperate with public health staff as it emerged that cases of the disease are increasing. “The county has deployed enough public health staff and drugs in all hospitals and there should be no cause for worry because the situation is now under control,” Chepkok assured. The suspected outbreak sparked fear among students from several public secondary schools in the county after a 14-year-old Sing’ore Girls student died and over 20 learners hospitalised. Some of the schools that have been affected by the outbreak include St Patrick’s Boys High, AIC Kessup Girls, Mutei Girls, Tot and Arror secondary schools. Edited by R.Wamochie
