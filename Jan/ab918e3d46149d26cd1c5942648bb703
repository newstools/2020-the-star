Security was on Tuesday withdrawn from the Nanyuki home of Agriculture CS Mwangi Kiunjuri shortly after he was sacked by President Uhuru Kenyatta. Officers who spoke to the Star on condition of anonymity on Wednesday said their colleagues were recalled to the police headquarters in Nairobi by their bosses. Kiunjuri's sacking was welcomed by Laikipia residents led by MP Amin Deddy. Speaking at the Nanyuki Central Park while celebrating the news of Kiunjuri's sacking, the Laikipia East lawmaker said Kenyans were hopeful that new Agriculture CS Peter Munya will improve the sector. "As residents of Laikipia East, we totally support the decision by the President to sack Kiunjuri. We have over the years been affected by bad leadership from our brother Kiunjuri,” Deddy said. Kiunjuri is a former MP for Laikipia East. Deddy appealed to politicians from Mt Kenya region to focus on development projects and not politicking. He accused Kiunjuri of using his political influence in the region to dictate his preferred leadership lineup in the county. “Kiunjuri should wait for 2022 to launch his politics. Gone were the days when leaders from this county used to worship him, we will only worship God. We will only serve the common mwananchi but not an individual claiming to be a kingmaker,” Deddy said. "We dare you to try selling that political party here in Laikipia East. You will not get any follower because we are deeply focused on assisting the President in realising his development agenda." edited by p.o
