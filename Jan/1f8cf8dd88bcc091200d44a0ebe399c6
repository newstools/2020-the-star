Machakos MCAs want Ukambani governors to call off their BBI meetings scheduled for Kitui, Makueni and Machakos. They instead urged Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua, his Makueni counterpart  Kivutha Kibwana and Charity Ngilu of Kitui to unite with Wiper leader Stephen Kalonzo Musyoka and plan joint meetings. The MCAs on Tuesday in a press conference in Machakos town said parallel meetings planned by Kalonzo, Kibwana and Ngilu at different dates would further divide residents and the nation at large. Led by Titus Kaloki of Kangundo West, the MCAs urged the three governors, Kalonzo, and other leaders, to meet and organise a calendar of events to popularise the BBI in Ukambani. "I urge the three governors and all other political leaders of the diverse political divide to plan an urgent meeting and Kalonzo to sit down and agree on an all-inclusive meeting encompassing key political players in the region for the sake of our people," he said. Kaloki said the objective of improving the lives of residents cannot be achieved if there is disunity among political leaders. "We request governors to reschedule the planned meetings in Kitui and Makueni to avoid sending different signals to the region," he said. "It’s quite important to be seen united and speaking the same language for us to be respected." This comes barely a day after Governor Mutua said parallel BBI forums will only send a different message to the Kamba community.
