Impala head coach Mitch Ocholla has attributed his side's 32-22 Kenya Cup loss to Homeboyz to lack of discipline. The defeat at the Jamhuri ground saw the Sarries lose ground on the Deejays who have opened a up a nine-point lead. They haveÂ  solidified the third position on the log on 39 points with Impala fourth on 30. Ocholla said skill errors gifted the Deejays soft tries in the frenetic encounter. "We gave away soft tries and a team like Homeboyz will always capitalise on opportunities. I also believe our line-out didn't function well and and our skill set in the backline also did not deliver," added Ocholla. Homeboyz led 18-8 at the interval and stamped their authority in the second half to secure a bonus point victory. Try scorers for Homeboyz were Bob Muhati with a brace as Kenya Sevens' star Alvin Otieno, Stanley Isogol and Bush Mwale scored a try each for the hosts with Evin Asena adding a penalty and two conversions. Duncan Ekasi, Sammy Oliech and Quinto Ongo crossing the whitewash for the visitors. Ongo added a penalty for the Sarries. Kabras stayed top of the log with 45 points after a crashing 38-0 bonus point victory over Nakuru. Fijian Jone Kubu had a brace with former Nakuru backrow Lawrence Buyachi, Kenya U20 scrum-half Barry Robinson, Eugene Sifuna and Brian Tanga going over the whitewash. Kabras led 26-0 at the interval.
