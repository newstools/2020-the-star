Lakers will get the opportunity assess the progress of their new players at the Eregi Teachers Training College hockey tournament this weekend. Coach Austin Tuju said the two-day tournament is part of the team's preparations for the new season that serves off on February 29. The women Premier League outfit have set their eyes on winning the trophy though they face competition from hosts Eregi and Kaimosi TTCs. University teams that have confirmed participation are Jaramogi Oginga Odinga University of Science and Technology, Maseno and Masinde Muliro. More than 10 teams will be involved. Tuju is keen to see the new recruits impress as they are part of the team's long-term project. Lakers have acquired the services of 13 new players who will have to fight for a spot in the first team. "I am excited to see what our new players have to offer to the team. They will fully participate since we need to gauge their skill level and if at all they can handle the pressure and deliver. We look forward to winning the trophy as the first sign of excellence," said Tuju. The Kisumu-based side finished fourth last season and have declared their intention of winning the Premier League title in their second season in the top-flight league.
