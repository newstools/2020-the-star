Kenyatta University Titans have been urged to be patient as Kenya Hockey Union mulls over the review of promotion/relegation criteria. The long-wait continues for the students who are relegated as of now but things could change with news that Nairobi Chapel and University of Eldoret Panthers will join the women Super League—paving way for the Titans to maintain their top-flight status. Titans were relegated alongside Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (JKUAT). Coach Richard Wandera earlier reiterated that the team was eager to have their position future cleared in order to accelerate their preparations. However, KHU deputy match and fixture secretary Moses Majiwa said the decision can only be made once the governing body receives the final details of the newbies joining the lower tier. Majiwa said there should be no cause for alarm  and called on the team to get ready for the new season. "In as much as there's anxiety, the team should get their act together because in the end, a resolution will be made. Even though the axe is on their foot, a lot is bound to change in the coming days."
