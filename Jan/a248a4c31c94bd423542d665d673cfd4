A 39-year-old man suspected of hacking his wife to death with a panga in her salon in Molo, Nakuru county, on Sunday has been arrested. Suspect John Ngige was arrested at his uncle's home in Limuru town. Ngige's uncle, Peter Mugweru, called the police and Nyumba Kumi officials after Ngige allegedly started threatening to kill himself. "When he told me that he was contemplating killing himself just like he killed his wife, I felt I should call the police before he commits suicide," he said. Mugweru said Ngige arrived at his home on Monday evening and started threatening to kill himself. “The day he arrived, he went to Kwambira area along the Nairobi-Nakuru highway, where he wanted to jump in front of a vehicle," Mugweru said. "We had a difficult time convincing him not to commit suicide." Mugweru said the following day, they called the police since they did not want him to die "before we knew the motive of his wife’s murder”. Molo subcounty police commander Isaac Odumbe said the suspect attacked his wife Lucy Waithira, 35, at her salon in Molo town. Police recovered a blood-stained panga at the scene of the murder. Her neck had been slit. Police suspected there were no customers at the salon during the attack. Limuru DCI officers, led by their boss David Makonge, handed over the suspect to their Molo counterparts who are leading the murder's investigations.
