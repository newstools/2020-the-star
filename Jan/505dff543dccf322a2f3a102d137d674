On its website, Kenya's Judiciary commits itself to deliver justice fairly, impartially and expeditiously. It further gives an assurance of promoting equal access to justice and advancing local jurisprudence by upholding the rule of law in line with the Constitution. However, going by the concerns raised by President Uhuru Kenyatta and Chief Justice David Maraga during the release of the 'State of the Judiciary and Administrative of Justice Report 'on Thursday, a lot needs to be done to deliver on this pledge. They said inadequate facilities, shortage of judges, low funding, questionable court orders and corruption are holding back or at worst derailing the wheels of justice. As an example, Maraga said fresh land cases can only be heard from next year because the Environment and Land Court's 2020 diary is already full. Uhuru, on the other hand, queried wastage in operations such as holding conferences in Mombasa and court injunctions to stop projects, saying some rulings are not in public interest. There are not just enough judges and magistrates to hear not only land cases but other matters. Justice delayed is justice denied and the two arms must work out ways that will keep the wheels of justice turning.
