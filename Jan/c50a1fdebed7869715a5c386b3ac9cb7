A section of Rift Valley legislators remains optimistic that President Uhuru Kenyatta will honour his promise and back William Ruto as his successor in 2022. They say Uhuru is unlikely to renege on his word in spite of the handshake with ODM leader Raila Odinga and the wrangling in the ruling Jubilee party. Emurua Dikiir MP Johanna Ng'eno and his Bomet Central counterpart Ronald Tonui said separately that they fully support the Building Bridges Initiative report but warned Uhuru not to be duped to create positions for him to continue clinging to power. Ng'eno said he has no problem with Uhuru and his new political friends but he should not stay in power after the end of his two-term presidential rule in 2022. “Mr President, we love you and respect you. That is why we voted for you to the last man in 2013 and 2017 and we know one day you will remember us by reciprocating the gesture,” he added. Tonui said state agencies and individuals in government should stop frustrating  Ruto allies. He was saddened by the "prosecution" of legislators allied to the DP due to their stance on some issues. He claimed there was a scheme to silence them but they will not be cowed.
