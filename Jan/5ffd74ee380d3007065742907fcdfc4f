The annual Rachuonyo 15kms road race will be held on January 26 and not 25 as earlier announced, Athletics Kenya Nyanza North chairman Joseph Ochieng said yesterday. "We decided to push it to January 26, which is a Sunday, since the area is predominantly Seventh Day Adventist," said Ochieng. Ochieng said the race will start at Kendu Bay Pier and finish at Kendu Bay Showground. “The athletes will run around the scenic Lake Simbi Nyaima," noted Ochieng. Karachuonyo MP Adipo Okuome is expected to grace the race. The MP, through the National Government Constituency Development Fund, sponsored last year's event. Besides the 15km race, Ochieng said they will also have 8km junior men's and 6kms junior women's cross country races. "We shall use the event to select our cross country team for the national trials," he added. He said Homa Bay, Kisumu and Siaya counties will hold their respective championships on January 11. At the same time, Ochieng revealed AK Nyanza  North will hold a five-day technical training at Kendu Bay town from January 21. Ochieng, a World Athletics lecturer said he will conduct the training for technical officials together with experienced starter, Thomas Ongwacho, and other officials to be sent by Athletics Kenya national office. He said those willing to attend the training will pay a registration fee of Sh2, 000. "The Sh2, 000 will cater for 10 am tea for the entire training period and certificates. Those attending the training will cater for their own accommodation and food," said the chairman. "We also wanted to have veteran Francis Nyatome but he is unwell. The officials will officiate the Rachuonyo Road Race on the last day of their training," Ochieng said. He said similar training sessions were held in Kisumu and Siaya counties.
