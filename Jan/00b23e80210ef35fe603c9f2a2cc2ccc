Flower farmers and hoteliers in Naivasha are up in arms over the poor state of Moi South Lake Road, whose rehabilitation was supposed to start late last year. Even after several government officials, including Transport CS James Macharia, issued statements on the construction of the road, rehabilitation work has not started. Frustrated residents on Friday said they would start weekly demonstrations to push the government to act. They did not say when the demonstrations would start. Speaking to journalists on Friday in Naivasha, Hells Gate youth leader Jack Karanja accused local leaders of failing to follow up on the matter. “We will close it and disrupt all activity on this road until we see the contractor on the ground,” he said. Naivasha Small Traders Association chairman Stephen Mungai said they can't wait any longer for the government to start rehabilitation work. Mungai, who is also the chairman of the New Kasese Sacco, which operates on the road, said they had held several meetings with government officials but nothing has been forthcoming. “We will join in the demonstrations because our local political leaders have failed. We only see them in rallies, yet they are supposed to forward our grievances to the concerned authorities.” Last week, Naivasha MP Jayne Kihara said the contractor was on the ground and was waiting for the rains to subsidise, before he could start repairing the road. “We are urging residents to be patient as we wait for the rains to minimise so that he can start the work but everything else is ready for the contractor,” he said. The road is critical to the economy of the lakeside town as it leads to 90 per cent of all flower farms in the country and several tourist lodges. The same road that leads to Maella- the breadbasket of Nakuru county –, Lake Naivasha and Olkaria Geothermal fields where the government has invested heavily.
