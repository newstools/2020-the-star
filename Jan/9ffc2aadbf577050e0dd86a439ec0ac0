Kariobangi Sharks forward Patrick Otieno is confident his side will be victorious against Kakamega Homeboyz in their next fixture this weekend. Sharks have enjoyed a purple patch recently despite losing two of their key players Sydney Lokale to Finnish side HIFK on a six month loan deal and Duke Abuya who switched to Zambian top flight side Nkana FC. Patrick said on Sharks portal: “We are going for maximum points this Saturday against Kakamega Homeboyz . I urge our fans to turn up in large numbers and cheer us on.” The youngster signed from Nzoia United has faced Homeboyz twice in his career and he will hope for a better result in Sharks colours. Abuya and Lokale’s departure, according to chairman Robert Maoga, opens the doors for other youngsters like Patrick to flourish. Maoga is adamant that Sharks will stay the course of giving the talented youth a platform to showcase their skills regardless of the results they  obtain. He asserted that in their programme going forward, preparing youngsters before eventually selling them to Europe informed their latest policy. This is evidenced by the recruitment of former Dagoretti High School left back Boniface Mwangemi who has featured in both their second leg outings.
