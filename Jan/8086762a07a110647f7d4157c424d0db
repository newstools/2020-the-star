Ndhiwa MP Martin Owino has urged The Building Bridges Initiative secretariat to print out the 156-page report so Kenyans can read it. It was released in English on November 27 last year and to date is only available online, though there have been calls and promises to print it in Kiswahili and other languages. Owino said on Tuesday that most Kenyans haven't read and understood the report. Politicians tell them what to think about it, he said. He expressed concern that many constituents cannot access it. Not everyone has a computer and reads English. On Tuesday, Ndhiwa residents including elderly persons asked him to supply copies of the report. They said politicians are trying to persuade them to support the report but they don't know what it contains. “My constituents challenged me to give them BBI report," he said. “Civic education is needed for a better understanding of the report."
