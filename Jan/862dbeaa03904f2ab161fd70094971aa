Rangers men handball team will move two points clear at the top of the Kenya Handball Federation (KHF) League table should they win their four matches this weekend. The league returns to action this weekend after a one-month break with fourth-placed Rangers facingÂ  Boomerang, Mount Kenya University Thika, Makueni Bees and Buccaneers. Top three teams Strathmore, Black Mamba and National Cereals and Produce Board( NCPB) are not in action because the bulk of their players are with the national team in Tunisia for the Olympic qualifiers. Leaders Strathmore have 24 points. The Kimilili-based side has racked up 18 points in 10 matches and the Gerald Juma -tutored side are seeking to cement their place at the top if their recent performance is anything to go by. Rangers have only lost once. Juma had earlier reiterated that the team is targeting a top-three finish though winning the title will be a major boost for the team comprising players majorly from Kimilili and Chesamis Boys High School as well as Kibabii and Masinde Muliro universities Elsewhere, Boomerang will also play Makueni Bees, General Service Unit and MKU Thika. Boomerang will move to fourth with 19 points if they win all their matches. Warriors, who languish in 19th place after a return of six points in 15 matches, lock horns with Makueni Bees, JKUAT and GSU who have lost five times this season.
