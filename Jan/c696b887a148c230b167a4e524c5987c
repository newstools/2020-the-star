The race for the Kenya Cup playoff and survival intensifies this weekend in various venues across the country. With the top-four seemingly locked up by league leaders Kabras, champions KCB, Homeboyz and Impala, the focus shifts to the three teams who are seeking the final two slots to the playoffs set for March. Nakuru, Oilers and Mwamba are chasing the final two slots where they have 33, 31 and 29 points respectively. Former champions Nakuru have a tough away fixture against a resurgent Homeboyz at Jamhuri Park. The Rift Valley-based side will be buoyed by their performance last week when they edged Menengai Oilers 19-17 in the Nakuru derby. Head coach Felix Oloo expects a stern test from the deejays. "Homeboyz have been playing well in the league and so we have to be at our best for this game as we chase a playoff position,‚Äù noted Oloo. Oilers will be seeking to bounce back to winning ways following the derby defeat when they host relegation-threatened Western Bulls at the Nakuru showground. Mwamba have a difficult trip to western Kenya to face leaders Kabras at the Kakamega showground. Mwamba will need to win their remaining four games and pray that the teams above them drop points in the race for the playoffs. Blak Blad, who lie 10th in the log with 14 points, have a date against Impala at Kenyatta University. Quins make the short trip along the Thika Super Highway to face KCB at the Lions' Den in Ruaraka while Nondies welcome Kisumu at Jamhuri Park.
