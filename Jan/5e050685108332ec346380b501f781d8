Embakasi East MP Babu Owino was on Tuesday released from the Industrial Area remand after depositing Sh2.5 million - the first installment of his Sh10 million bail. A Milimani court had on Monday ordered Babu to deposit Sh10 million bail to secure his freedom, part of which is to go towards paying hospital bills for DJ Evolve, whom he is accused of shooting. Babu was also ordered to keep off alcohol and narcotic drug in a public establishment during the tenure of the case. Babu was charged with the attempted murder of Felix Odhiambo, commonly known as DJ Evolve, at B-club on January 17. According to chief magistrate Francis Andayi, Babu will deposit the Sh10 millionÂ  bail in four equal installments of Sh 2.5 million each in the next three months. DJ Evolve's family had opposed Babu's release, citing security concerns. Babu was also charged with behaving in a disorderly manner while carrying a firearm. The MP is said to have become disorderly while carrying a pistol and firing one round of ammunition while intending to shoot at the DJ. Babu had denied all the charges preferred against him. The MP was represented by lawyers Danstan Omari, Cliff Ombeta and five others. The prosecution had opposed his release on bail and he was detained at Industrial Area for seven days, this in addition to the weekend he had spent behind bars following his arrest on a Friday.
