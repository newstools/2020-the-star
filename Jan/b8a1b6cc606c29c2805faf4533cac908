A Kisii assistant chief was on Tuesday fined Sh60,000 or serve a prison term of one year in default. The evidence against Ziporah Moriasi was "credible, tangible and sufficiently overwhelming", principal magistrate Nattan Lutta said while passing sentence. The graft case against theÂ  Kiogoro sub-location administrator had dragged since 2017 when Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission agents seized her from her office. The detectives had laid a trap following complaints that she had on October 9, 2017, attempted to extort Sh4,000 from Hellen Kwamboka in connection with a land succession matter. The assistant chief had told the court that the complainant was her cousin with whom she had a family dispute.
