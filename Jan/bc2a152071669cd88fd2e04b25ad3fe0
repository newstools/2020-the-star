Mikayu Friends Primary School in Kabuchai constituency, Bungoma county, risks being closed due to inadequate latrines and classrooms. The school has only 12 classrooms and two latrines against a population of 700 pupils. The two latrines are used by both pupils and teachers. Latrines were damaged by the recent rains. “As you can see heavy rains damaged our latrines, and we have only one set of latrines that were donated by Kabuchai businessman Tale Nabangi. The teachers and the 700 pupils share the latrines,” headteacher Morris Wanyonyi said. "If the Public Health officers come for inspection, I'm sure they will close the school." He said the situation in the school is pathetic and no longer conducive for learners and their teachers. "Some classrooms have more than 100 pupils, making it uncomfortable for pupils and hard to teach for teachers," Wanyonyi told journalists on Monday. He said desks are also few. A desk is being shared by at least five children. The ECDE which has more than 100 pupils, is also in a bad state. Wanyonyi said Kabuchai CDF, the department of special programmes in the Bungoma government and the national government have not helped. But Kabuchai MP James Mukwe on Tuesday said Wanyonyi has never informed him of the problem at the school. He said if he had been informed, the CDF could have chipped in. The legislator said the CDF recently bought land for the school. Mukwe said the school head should have used the capitation fund disbursed by the government annually to build toilets and classrooms and buy more desks.
