Health workers hired last year by the Vihiga government have started receiving their payments. The workers had gone seven months without salaries, resulting in court battles and unrest within the health department. “We have paid four months, and we are working to pay the rest in the shortest time possible,” Governor Wilber Ottichilo said on Tuesday. The governor has promised to take action on the people who messed up the process. Ottichilo has suspended Medical Services chief officer Arnold Mamadi and Public Health's Clement Manyulu, saying the mess happened under their watch. The workers were hired through January 17 and May 9 advertisements in newspapers. The county had advertised for only 149 health workers' jobs, but over 500 were hired. The hiring of the 500 caught the attention of the governor. After the county government failed to pay them, they sought court's help. In September last year, the court ruled that they be paid their dues. “We have written to the court that is handling this case to inform them that the county government of Vihiga does not have enough resources to sustain all 528 health workers," Ottichilo said. Previously, Ottichillo said the Controller of Budget had refused to approve the payments, citing the county is unable to sustain them.
