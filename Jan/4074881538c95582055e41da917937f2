Heavyweight boxer Elly Ajowi is relishing the opportunity of another shot at qualifying for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. The Kenya Police pugilist is among a group of boxer who will start training tomorrow at the Depot Boxing Club in Mathare with their eyes now trained on the African qualifiers set for Dakar, Senegal next month. The hard-punching Ajowi conceded the disappointment of missing out on the last Games in Rio, where the country was only represented by three fighters—Benson Gicharu, Rayton Okwiri and Peter Njenga. “It's a good opportunity for all of us. We have to take our training seriously as a team and as individuals in order to be prepared when the qualifiers come around,” said the soft spoken fighter. Ajowi surprisingly lost to Joshua Wasike in the fourth round of the Boxing Federation Kenya (BFK) national league in Nanyuki before recovering to dispose off his opponent in the Kisumu round. Both made the team and will be training together at Depot. “I know my capabilities as a fighter. I am in good shape and the best in my division and I will show it at the qualifiers,”said Ajowi. The ‘Hit Squad’ team, according to assistant coach and BFK Secretary David Munuhe will begin their training camp on Saturday with long road running sessions to gauge the fitness level of the fighters.
