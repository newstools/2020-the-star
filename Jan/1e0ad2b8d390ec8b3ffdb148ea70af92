Argentine Paulo Dybala scored twice as Juventus brushed aside Udinese to reach the Coppa Italia quarter-finals. He combined brilliantly with Gonzalo Higuain who prodded in the opener before scoring a penalty after keeper Nicolas tripped Federico Bernardeschi. Dybala then scored with a delightful clipped shot and Douglas Costa added another from the spot after Bram Nuytinck handled in the area. Cristiano Ronaldo withdrew from the squad after falling ill early in the day. The 34-year-old Portuguese forward picked up a sinus infection. Meanwhile, five-time Coppa Italia winners AC Milan defeated SPAL 3-0 to book their place in the last eight. Polish forward Krzysztof Piatek, linked with a move away from the club this January, outpaced the defence to give the home team the lead after 20 minutes. Samuel Castillejo curled in the second just before half-time, and Theo Hernandez hammered in the third in the 66th minute. Recent signing Zlatan Ibrahimovic remained on the bench. Wolves player Patrick Cutrone scored 11 minutes into his loan debut for Fiorentina who defeated Atalanta 2-1. The striker slotted home from 12 yards before Josip Ilicic equalised against his old club in the 67th minute. Three minutes later Fiorentina were down to 10 men when German Pezzella received a second yellow card for diving. However, La Viola secured victory six minutes from time when Pol Lirola fired into the bottom corner.
