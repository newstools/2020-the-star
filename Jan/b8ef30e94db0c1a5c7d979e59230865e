Afc Leopards and Nzoia FC have castigated the move by the Kenya Premier League Security Committee to ban the famous Mumias Sport Complex. The two clubs have been using the ground as their alternative venue for their home matches. Early last week, KPL Security Committee sanctioned the ban of Mumias Complex citing lack of water, poor playing surface maintenance and also dilapidated structure. Speaking in Kakamega yesterday, Nzoia Sugar chairman Yappets Mokua questioned the timing of the ban, saying there was a sinister motive behind it. "We have received the news with disbelief. We registered Mumias as our alternative venue for our home matches well aware that it was one of the best facilities. However, we smell a rat in this. I don't agree with the reasons being advanced for its closure. “KPL management should get serious. We have some venues in the country which they have approved yet they are in worse condition than Mumias. Why do they apply double standards? said Mokua He, however, said they are happy to have completed all their high risk matches  defending champions Gor and Leopards hence the remaining matches can be staged at  Sudi Stadium. His AFC Leopards' counterpart Dan Shikanda condemned the move and called on the government to speed up the renovation of Nyayo Stadium which has been closed for the last three years. “KPL management should understand the hard times clubs are currently going through and come out to support us. Let them not rush and make decisions that that will worsen the situation," he said. “I think both the national and county governments together with KPL are failing us. Where do they want us to play ? Do they want us to take matches to neighbouring Uganda or Tanzania? Shikanda wondered.
