 Mwingi residents have demanded compensation following the destruction of their crops by desert locusts. The voracious swarms invaded Mwingi a week ago and have destroyed crops in farms in Tseikuru, Ngomeni, Nguni and Kyuso wards of Mwingi North constituency. Residents said aerial spraying of the locusts have only been done thrice and that the pests were continuing to devour crops. The farmers are battling the pests by literally chasing them away using manual methods. Nguni farmer Esther Kyallo said she was expecting a bumper harvest of green grams but the locusts have eaten up three-quarters of her farm. "I had planned to sell my harvest of about 10 bags to get money for school fees for my children but these insects have eaten up the crops," Esther said. She said the government should compensate her for the loss. Julius Maluki, another farmer from Enziu said they have been desperately trying the chase away the locusts. "We have been forced to spend all our time in our farms chasing these locusts away," Maluki said. He asked the government to spray the insects and compensate farmers. Maluki said the locusts have eaten up his maize and cowpeas. Theophilus Kimanzi, a farmer from Mutwangombe, said the insects have fed on his millet and maize combs. "We are tired of screaming and making all sorts of noise in a bid to scare these insects away," Kimanzi said. Kimanzi urged the government to compensate them and ensure a proper measure is put to ensure the locusts die for the aerial spray done is not effective. "Ever since the swarms invaded Mwingi a week ago, only three aerial sprayings have been conducted but the insects are not dying," he said. Mathiakani farmer Martha Ngumbau urged the government to spray more chemicals on the locusts. She also urged the government to compensate farmers whose crops have been destroyed.  edited by peter obuya
