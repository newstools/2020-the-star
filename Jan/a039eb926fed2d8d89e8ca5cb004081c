An Embu teacher who allegedly defiled and impregnated his student after promising to pay her school fees arrears has been charged. Moses Kimanthi, a computer teacher at Muvandori Day Secondary School in Embu North subcounty denied the charges before senior resident magistrate Tony Kwambai. The prosecution said he defiled the student on diverse dates between July 7 and 23 last year. Kimanthi faces an alternative charge of indecently touching the girl's genitals with his private parts at Manyatta Town in Embu North subcounty. The suspect's lawyer Victor Adande pleaded with the court to release him on bond so that he can attend court from home. Andande said the teacher is a student at Mt Kenya University and he requires time to carry on with his learning. Kwambai released the teacher on Sh100,000 bond and a Sh50,000 cash bail. The hearing of the case is set for March 30. The girl said the teacher seduced her during a computer class trip to Nairobi last year. The orphan said after promising he would clear her fees arrears, the teacher invited her to his rental house in Manyatta Town where they had sex. The complainant said they had unprotected sex every Sunday thereafter before she later realised she was pregnant and informed the teacher. She said the teacher threatened that he would kill her if she disclosed what happened. Embu North subcounty police commander Godfrey Kere said that the family of the victim had reported the matter at Kibugu Police Station leading to the teacher's arrest on Monday. Kere said that the complainantâ€™s mother reported to the police station that Kimanthi had tricked her daughter into having sex with him and impregnated her.
