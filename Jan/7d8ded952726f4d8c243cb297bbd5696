American lifestyle and performance footwear Sketchers has embarked on an expansion drive in Kenya after the collapse of Nakumatt Supermarket, its local dealer. On Saturday, the brand opened its fourth store and biggest in Sub Saharan Africa at Nairobi’s Sarit Centre, the third in the country. It has other stores at Thika Road Mall and Village Market. The firm has other stores in Nigeria and two in South Africa. Nakumatt’s poor financial position saw Sketchers Phirdos Kenya a nod to franchise its brand in the country. Speaking during the launch of the new store, Phirdos Kenya Limited country manager Fathi Basheik said the firm is keen to tap into the growing demand for quality sportswear in East Africa, with Kenya, the economic giant in the region being the entry point. International fashion brands continue to flock in Nairobi as they seek to cash in on the expanding middle class and a growing taste for luxury brands. Last year, Hugo Boss joined LC Waikiki, Foschini, Clarks among other high-end brands that operates in the country.
