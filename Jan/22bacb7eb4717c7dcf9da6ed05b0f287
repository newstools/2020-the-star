Outgoing KNRC Division 2 champion Issa Amwari has been promoted to Premier Class following a career best season which saw him finish joint seventh with Ian Duncan in the 2019 KCB Kenya National Rally Championship (KNRC) drivers log. Former KNRC Division 3 and ‘S’ Class  drivers’ champion Karan Patel returns to Premier with Coast Pekee lead driver Izhar Mirza being relegated to Division One. Defending Group ‘N’ champion Jasmeet Chana has retained his place in the elite Premier Class which has the likes of Flash Tundo, champion Baldev Chager, Onkar Rai, Eric Bengi, Duncan and Manvir Baryan. Champion Ammar ‘Bushy’ Haq remains in Division 1 and so is his Mombasa Motor Club stablemate Sohanjeet Singh Puee who retained the ‘S’ class championship last season. Youngster McRae Kimathi, who posted a career best fifth on KCB Meru Rally, has moved up from Division 3 to Division 1. Outgoing Division 3 champion Geoff Mayes will now compete in Division 2 with the likes of Jonathan Somen, Raaji Bharij, Geoff Mayes, James Kirimi, Mombasa’s Naushad Kara Lota and Evans Kavisi among others. Kirimi, a former S Class champion, savoured a career best fourth on his Meru turf last year navigated by Michael Gitobu. Issa, one of the fastest rising indigenous driver, was all smiles after promotion and said: “First, we want to thank God for a fantastic year in 2019 and great results throughout the tough season. At the moment, we are fully rebuilding our car and getting ready for this year (Inshallah), Nothing has been decided yet by our sponsors.” “Last year, we drove at 50 percent of our ability and hopefully, this year we can go up to 70 percent and see what it will bring. Premier Class will be a good challenge for us but we do not doubt our ability and skills to be contenders this year. After four years in the cold, It’s one step at a time and we are hopeful,” he stated.
