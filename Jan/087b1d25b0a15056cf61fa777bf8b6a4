A college in Eastleigh has filed a case in court challenging its closure by the Technical Vocational Education and Training Authority. Alison community-based organisation was allegedly closed on Wednesday on grounds it was not registered by TVET. More than 50 illegal immigrants were arrested in a police operation targeting unregistered institutions. The foreigners — who are students and staff at Alison Community College — are from Somalia, with one Ugandan. But the institution claims they are a registered CBO whose objective is to teach Kenyan adult Somali businesspeople living in Eastleigh Swahili language with a view to growing businesses in the area. “We are not a technical college or institution registered under TVET we are a community-based organisation with the department of social development under the Ministry of East African Community.” In an affidavit, Alison director Liban Ahmed Abdi says the institution was formed in May 2019 to teach businesspeople living in Eastleigh Swahili language. Ahmed says TVET's decision was irrational and illegal and wants a decision closing down the institution suspended. “Our teaching of Swahili language to adult Kenyan Somali business persons has caused growth and improvement in the business environment of Eastleigh,” read the documents. But TVET claims Alison has been running a technical college without being registered as an institution that offers technical and vocational education and training as envisioned in their Act.
