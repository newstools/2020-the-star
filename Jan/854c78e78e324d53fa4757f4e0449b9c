High Court judge John Onyiego has said he declined to swear in James Nyoro as the governor of Kiambu county because the county failed to gazette the swearing-inÂ  and it didn't comply with the time element required before the ceremony. In a statement on Thursday, Onyiego said the County Committee on the Assumption of the Office of Governor failed to publish the time, date and place of the swearing-in in both the Kenya and County Gazette. He said, "It is those Gazette notices that grant the power to swear in the deputy governor in such a situation." Another reason for the decline was that the Assumption of the Office Governor Act requires that swearing-in be conducted on the first Thursday after the tenth day following the declaration of results of the county governor. Onyiego said he understood the reason for the shortening of the 10 days, but added that it had not been done. The swearing-in was scheduled to take place in Kiambu county on Thursday at 8am. However, County Assembly Speaker Stephen Ndichu announced it had been postponed due to unavoidable circumstances. The vacancy in the governor's office follows the upholding of Ferdinand Waititu's impeachment by the Senate on Wednesday following three charges, all of which were upheld. The first charge was gross violation of the Constitution, Public Finance Management Act and PPD Act. For this charge, 27 senators upheld the charge, while 12 voted in the governor's favour. In the second charge - crimes under the national law, 28 senators upheld the charge, while 11 voted to drop the charge. In the third charge - abuse of office - 28 voted to uphold the charge, while 11 voted to drop it. Waititu becomes the second governor to have the Senate uphold his impeachment.
