University of Nairobi Vice Chancellor Stephen Kiama has said he will not back out as Vice Chancellor despite Education CS Fred Magoha revoking his appointment. Through a memo to the University staff and students, the recently appointed VC has also asked the University's council members to ignore Magoha's move to get it dissolved. "For the avoidance of doubt, my appointment as the lawfully and validly appointed Vice Chancellor of the University of Nairobi still subsists. As such I continue in diligent service as your Vice Chancellor and remain available to you all for guidance and direction," he said. Kiama added, "I urge you all to continue rendering service to the University as per our respective appointments to continue our pursuit for schorlary excellence and supporting the vision of the university . Do not be given acts of lawlessness as peace and stability of the university is important to us all," he said. Earlier today, MagohaÂ  revoked the appointment of Kiama as the new vice chancellor of UoN. Instead, the CS appointed Deputy Isaac Mbeche to act as the new VC pending consultation. He said the appointment of a substantive vice chancellor will be done after the completion consultative meetings. But he noted that Kiama will continue dispensing his duties as the Deputy Vice Chancellor, Human Resource and Administration at the university.
