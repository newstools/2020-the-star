Pro-BBI MPs have taken a swipe at DP William Ruto over BBI remarks telling him to stop hiding behind ODM party leader Raila Odinga and face the President. Addressing a press conference at Parliament Building on Monday, the lawmakers from ODM, Jubilee and Wiper maintained that Ruto has declared war against the President and using the BBI and Raila as scapegoats. The leaders demanded resignation of Ruto who they claim has resorted to undermining the President. "The remarks by the DP are an affront to the President who is the head of state and government. Hiding behind BBI and Raila is open camouflage," said minority whip Junet Mohammed who read the joint statement." "It is clear the DP is hiding behind Raila and the BBI to fight the President and those public officers the President has entrusted with the power of helping him run the government." Accompanying Junet were Maina Kamanda (nominated), Ben Momanyi (Borabu), Benard Okoth (Kibra), TJ Kajwang' (Ruraka), Antony Oluoch (Mathare), George Aladwa (Makadara), Tim Wanyonyi ( Westlands), Simba Arati (Dagoretti North), Sabina Chege (Muranga MP) and Opondo Kaluma (Homabay Town). They threatened to sponsor a law change that allows the President to appoint and dismiss his Deputy. "We are asking the Deputy President that you are the principal assistant to the President, please give the President respect that he deserves," Kamanda said. Over the weekend, Ruto strongly came out to poke holes at the Building Bridges Initiative claiming it has been hijacked to serve political interests. Ruto said that the BBI and handshake are being used to craft ODM's 2022 political line-up. "Unity, inclusivity pretence and associated squander of public resources should stop. Unity? the opposition (NASA) is already dismembered/dead; now dividing Jubilee. Big 4 roll out the only way to go," Ruto tweeted.
