President Uhuru Kenyatta on Tuesday effected a mini-Cabinet reshuffle and reorganisation of government and state departments. This move is a clear pattern that Uhuru is taking an independent path and political course. Mwangi Kiunjuri, the immediate former Agriculture CS was a marked man for a while. As early as last year, he was accused of things that happened in the ministry way before he took over the docket the docket. That pointed to a bigger fight than people were made to believe. But with the political inclinations brought about by the politics of handshake and BBI, the yardstick seems to have shifted to how loyal one is in support of the report. As I have pointed, most, if not all, of the top Cabinet secretaries and key PSs are politicking, the only difference being which side is one supporting. By forcing people to see things their way, the proponents of the handshake are pushing their luck to the frontiers even the presidents who ruled under the old constitutional order never dared. Having a divergent opinion and voicing it is no longer tolerated as MPs are barred from attending functions in their areas, ostensibly on "orders from above": Forget the fact that the Constitution decrees such act, instead stipulating that such administrative actions must be conveyed in writing and under the seal of the President. It will remain the biggest con game of our time that a process that started as a rapprochement between the scions of the two grandmasters of Kenyan politics has turned out to be the high-prized government project that everybody who want to befriend the President must pledge loyalty to. Kiunjuri's sin was daring to dream, which irked some people but the political ramifications of his relief will be seen in days to come.
