A 24-year-old man was sentenced to three years non-custodial sentence after he threatened to kill his uncles in a Facebook post. According to court documents, Brian Shakoba used his aunt's mobile phone to chat with a friend on how he was planning to kill his uncles, but failed to sign out his Facebook account before he returned the phone. His uncle Kizito Shakoba told court that Brian borrowed a mobile phone from his aunt on Christmas day to take photos and chat with his friend. Kizito further said that when Brian returned his aunt’s phone  messages  from his friends were still flowing in, and when she read a message she found out a friend asking why he wanted to kill his uncles, which made her to read earlier messages. Brian alleged that his troubles were brought by his uncles whom he alleged that they had killed his mother when he was only  two years old. But Kizito declined the allegations in court and said that Brians’s mother died a natural death and requested court to forgive him since the family still loved him despite the threats. “I have lived with the accused person since he was young and  even paid for his college fee at Technical University of Mombasa,”Kizito said. He said the family didn't have anything personal against Brian since they  had lived together. The uncle said Brian's behaviour changed when he started smoking bhang. Mombasa chief magistrate Edina Nyaloti ordered the accused person to serve a non-custodian sentence of three years to enable probation officer monitor his behaviour.
