A Baringo North student has been admitted in hospital after taking highly poisonous insecticide in a suicide attempt. The 17-year old Form 4 student is currently admitted in the Intensive Care Unit of Moi Teaching and Referral in Eldoret where he was referred on Thursday. “We took the urgent step to resuscitate the patient who was rushed in an ambulance in critical condition on Wednesday,” Baringo County Referral Hospital director Thomas Chepchieng said on Friday. He said the victim had taken a whole bottle of Triatix Stock pesticide. "We even admitted him at our ICU trying to stabilise his condition but it seemed to get worse," Chepchieng said. By Thursday, he said, the boy was still dizzy and unconscious, “forcing our doctors to refer him immediately to MTRH". It is alleged that the boy was frustrated in school before resorting to take the poison on Wednesday around 2pm. His mother said the boy had earlier reported to her that one of his teachers summoned him for certain interrogations. “After which he came home through a trading centre where he may have bought the liquid and hidden in his school bag,” she said. She said when her son arrived home, he just dropped his bag and left silently. Passersby later found him unconscious by the roadside. In the same subcounty, Form 3 student Lucy Kimuge, 15, from Kapkiamo Secondary committed suicide after allegedly killing and burying her four-month-old child on Wednesday. It is beloved the teen girl made the move due to frustration and fear of arrest. It is the same area where an ex-KDF soldier and Bosei deputy principal Norah Koech committed suicide under unclear circumstances last year. Police Commander Robinson Ndiwa noted rising cases of suicide in the county saying at least 20 people have committed suicide since last year. Ndiwa, however, called on the members of the public to chose better alternatives to solving challenges. Edited by R.Wamochie
