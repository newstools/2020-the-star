As his side gears up for Sunday’s unpredictable clash against his former side Sofapaka, Mathare United coach Salim Ali has called on match officials to conduct themselves professionally. Salim was left fuming with the performance of the officials during their 2-2 draw with Zoo Kericho on Wednesday and has called on the authorities to crack the whip on errant officials. “The match officials were below par. The centre referee and her assistants made poor decisions throughout the contest,” said Salim. “We played really well, created lots of chances and bossed play like we always want to. But we allowed them back into the game by not burying our chances and we should blame ourselves for the dropped points.” On a positive note ahead of this clash of former champions, South Sudanese striker Daniel  Lual was on the score sheet in his fourth appearance for the club, earning effusive praise from the coach. “There is plenty to come from him. He has been growing with each passing day and his goal was very well taken. It will give him confidence and I expect him to be a regular scorer,” said Salim. Mathare, with 25 points, are 10th on the KPL table and could leapfrog their opponents with victory at the Machakos Stadium on Sunday.
