Two legislators from Kitui and Machakos counties have stated their firm support for the Building Bridges Initiative, seconding ODM's push for a referendum before July this year. ODM Party leader Raila Odinga said the push for a referendum was unstoppable. Raila promised Kenyans a new dawn free of corruption, poverty and clashes once the BBI is actualized. Yatta MP Charles Kilonzo who supports the outcome of BBI said he supports the poll and wished it was conducted as soon as possible. He told his opponents that even if they were given three years to decide on the need for a referendum, they would still be opposed to the initiative to amend the constitution. “In my opinion, I think we should conduct a poll soonest possible as those opposed to the report might never change their minds,” Kilonzo said. He urged BBI opponents not cling to the perception that BBI was meant to create top posts for certain individuals but it is instead aimed at a much-improved Constitution and not succession politics. His counterpart from Mwingi West, Charles Nguna, also reiterated that he was in full support of BBI and hoped it will be soon made a law. Nguna urged all Kenyans to support the  document for it serves the interests of all communities.
