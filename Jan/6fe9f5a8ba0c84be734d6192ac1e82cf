A JKUAT student was last Friday strangled to death and his body dumped in aÂ  forest barely three months after his colleagues demonstrated against insecurity around the institution. Lewis Arthur Wamboga Musebe, a civil engineering student, had been reported missing on January 9. The 21-year-old student is said to have been waylaid and his knees crushed before being strangled. The body was found adjacent to a coffee farm a few kilometres from the Juja town-based Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology. Juja DCIO Daniel Musangi said the death was being investigated. A postmortem report shows that he was stabbed randomly and his knees smashed. The problem of criminal gangs dominated headlines last year with reports showing more than 10 students had been killed within the first half of November alone. There were numerous other deaths throughout the year. The university has more than 35,000 students. It has a dearth of residential accommodation. Only 2,700 students reside at the university. The rest are accommodated at High Point, Sunrise Street and Gashororo. Others live as far as Nairobi, Ruiru and Thika. The non-resident students are often attacked and robbed of laptops and phones on their home at night. A gang known as Gaza is notorious for the attacks. Student Clinton Osoro feared that the dreaded gang was behind Musebe's killing. "The lights that we had demanded to be installed in the area were partly done," he said. The students had pushed for the installation of street lights in the aftermath of abductions, waylaying and murders. Edited by R.Wamochie
