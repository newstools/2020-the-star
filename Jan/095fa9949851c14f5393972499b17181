Kenyan Premier League side Western Stima have termed the unceremonious exit of their shirt sponsor Kenya Power a big blow in their quest to survive in the competition. Stima’s chairman Laban Jobita confirmed that the firm had served them with a letter ending their partnerships due to lack of sufficient funds. Subsequently, Jobita is uncertain of their survival in the league following their sponsor’s exit. National Super League sides Coast Stima and Nairobi Stima have also been affected by the move. The club is currently ranked seventh with 30 points—nine shy of league leaders Kakamega Homeboyz. “I have received a letter from Kenya Power cancelling all local partnerships due to lack of money. Even though I am yet to engage the regional chairman, their withdrawal will hurt our operations. It’s a big blow to us as we solely relied on them for our survival in the league. This does not affect football alone as there are other disciplines bankrolled by the company,” he said Despite the company’s decision to cut ties with the club, Jobita down played changing their name and camp but hinted on their plans to re-brand from next season.  The former player in the meantime appealed to corporates to fill in the financial void left by the power company. “ We can not change the name when the season is still on as we are likely to be axed. We may make that decision from next season. The club will also operate from Kisumu as we embark on scratching for a new sponsor,” he added
