Nyamira and Kisii County cross country meetings earlier scheduled for for today have been pushed to next week. Nyamira host their championships at Kiendege Secondary School on Sunday, according to Athletics Kenya (AK) Nyamira Country secretary George Ogeto. “After consultations, we have decided to hold the event on Sunday. We want our team to be ready for the regional championships which we shall host,” said Ogeto. He said the regional championships will be staged at Kiendege Secondary on January 24. He said the county will only field athletes who will qualify from the county to the regionals. “Initially, Kisii County was to host cross country and we were to stage track and field but we changed because Nyamira doesn't have a track,” said Ogeto. Experienced athletes Dickson Simba and Sammy Nyokaye are expected to battle it out for a places in the Nyamira County team. In the women's category, it will be a battle between rivals and training mates Ronah Nyabochoa and Teresa Omosa. Nancy Kerage and Eunice Onyancha are also expected to give the favourites stiff competition. At the same time, the Kisii County Championships will be held at Sameta on Friday next week. According to county chairman Evans Bosire. Bosire, who is also the AK public relations officer, said they pushed the event from today to give students time to prepare. “Schools opened this week. Having the event on Friday would have disadvantaged the students,” he said.  Schools like Mogonga PAG, St Peter's Keberesi and Eluni Academy will battle it out in the junior events.
