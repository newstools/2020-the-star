A man who reported an assault in the house of Kitui teacher Daisy Mbathe  who was lynched last Monday  will be interrogated, police said. The teacher at Ndooni Primary School in Endau ward, Kitui East, was hacked to death and her body burnt beyond recognition. She was pulled from a motorbike and killed by attackers who had laid an ambush. Kitui county police commander Johanna Tanui said police were seeking to interrogate the man who raised a complaint at Endau police station that he was manhandled in the teacher’s house in Makuka village. Tanui who addressed the press in his office on Saturday expressed concern over wild speculations surrounding the macabre killing of the teacher. He said it was imperative to await the outcome of investigations. Tanui said the man was said to have  been attacked by the teacher and  a gang of men after he was caught in a compromising  position with one of  the teacher’s  daughters in the tutor’s house. “We have Mutiso Mulwa who went to the Endau police station on January 2 and reported that he was assaulted by the now slain teacher and other people. He was attacked because he was found with the teacher’s daughter in the house,” the county police chief said. He said Mulwa was issued with a P3 form and was to return to write a statement once the form was filled. He said the complainant never returned and switched of his phone. Also in the police radar is a woman who was said to have been part of the gang that killed the teacher and burned her body to ashes. “Any person who was involved in the murder will not escape. We shall not leave any stone unturned until those who committed the heinous act are brought to book,” Tanui said.
