The Building Bridges Initiative should create opportunities for job seekers and special political positions for youth, Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana has said. He also urged employers to remove the experience requirements in job advertisements. “The young people may not have the experience, but they have technological skills required to perform specific tasks faster than the older generation,” Kibwana said on Wednesday. The county chief said that in line with the fourth industrial revolution, BBI should scrap requirement limitations given by potential employers whenever they have vacancies. “During interviews, the inexperienced should also be invited because they will show what they can do that the old cannot do,” he said. The governor also said political parties should create positions for those under 35 years. “In the interest of continuity of good leadership and transition for successful leaders in our country, we need to prepare the young generation by giving them positions in our political parties,” Kibwana said. “When you tell them they are the leaders of tomorrow, that tomorrow will never come. Their tomorrow is now.” Kibwana spoke during the swearing-in of members of Makueni County Public Service Board in Wote town. Kikumbulyu South ward representative Jades Kalunda said law and policymakers should listen to the voice of the youth. The first-term MCA said only a few young people get opportunities in private, government and political institutions. “When the document comes to us as leaders, let us examine it carefully to ensure the final document or law will address or respond positively to the challenges of youth unemployment facing the country,” Kalunda said. New Makueni County Public Service Board chairman Nicholas Muthui said they will ensure equity for the young and older generation.
