Kenya women’s beach volleyball head coach Sammy Mulinge wants the federation to enter teams several FIVB tournaments for them to gather experience. Kenya fielded a largely rookie players at the just ended confederation of African volleyball sub zonal 2020 Olympic qualifiers for beach volleyball (BVB) at the Mbalamwezi Beach in Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania. “We need proper preparations and together with the men’s line-ups, we should have an early training schedule for the next phase of qualification,” noted the coach. Kenya finished second to unbeaten Rwanda to advance. Kenya One partnership drew experienced Gaudencia Makokha and Brackcides Agala, while Phoscah Kasisi and Yvonne Wavinya featured for Kenya Two. “I congratulate the girls for qualifying given that it is the first attempt for most of them. We appreciation the federation for the support too, and I pray that the teams are entered to play in FIVB competitions where we can meet more experienced sides because we require more competition to expose these players,” said Mulinge. Both pairs have already been listed in the Nyerere BVB Open which serves off today to January 16 at the same venue. “Well, this is a great performance for the team. We have observed a lot of improvement with the girls. This is especially after they played a really experienced and exposed side (Rwanda) on the first day. It was the first time three of them are playing competitive beach volleyball and so we expected some inconsistencies while executing some important BVB skill. But they stabilized with each match. Yesterday’s win was the turning point,” said Mulinge. Kenya lost to Rwanda in the golden set after tying 1-1 in their tournament opener on Friday.
