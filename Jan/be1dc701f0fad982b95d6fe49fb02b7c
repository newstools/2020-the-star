The Teachers Service Commission has recalled six teachers from Ndooni Primary School in Kitui County. This comes after another teacher by the name Daisy Nbathe Mbaluka was murdered on Monday. On Monday a group of parents staged demos to the school over what they alleged as poor performance. The group stormed the school and closed it for undisclosed reasons. It was later reported that Madam Mbaluka had been hacked to death. The teacher's employer said it will only deploy teachers back to the school when their security is guaranteed. Ibrahim Mumin, commission secretary in a statement to newsrooms said the commission strongly condemns the gruesome murder. "The Commission strongly condemns the unfortunate death of the teacher as there are better ways of resolving whatever issue may have contributed to the death of Madam," Mumin said. He added, "The Commission will not post any teacher to Ndooni Primary School until the security of our teachers is assured". Mumin said TSC takes the safety and security of all its teachers seriously and it will not hesitate to take necessary measures, including petitioning for the closure of institutions where the security of teachers is at risk. He said the commission is working with other government agencies to establish the circumstances under which the teacher was killed. Meanwhile, two men were on Thursday arraigned in a Kitui court in connection with the gruesome murder of Mbaluka who at the time of her death was the headteacher of the school. The suspects, Wambua Mwangangi and Christopher Muli, who appeared before Kitui resident magistrate Felistus Nekesa were not allowed to take plea. The Mutitu CID office through prosecutor Kevin Gesture applied to hold the suspects for 21 days in order to finalise investigations. Nekesa granted the application that was supported by an affidavit by CID officer Benard Jeffer. The teacher was attacked by her killers as she walked home from school and slashed with pangas and her body set ablaze.
