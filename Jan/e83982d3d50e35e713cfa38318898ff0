Kenyan dance styles will be featured in Cartoon Network’s Pop UP Party, an Initiative that started with the first season in 2017. The styles to be featured are Bazokizo, Shaku Shaku, Kanyaga Lami, ODI, Vimbada, Gwara Gwara, Pilolo and Chocobodi. The Pop Up Party is travelling to Kenya, where a crew of nine dynamic young dancers will perform some trendy and amazing dance moves. The children are a part of a community centre in Dandora, Nairobi. They have been dancing and trained by Kenyan artiste Bruz Newton. The short clips will premiere as part of a special dance-themed stunt called « Let’s Dance » on the on-air channel on February 29, alongside a collection of episodes from Cartoon Network shows (Teen Titans Go! Regular Show and Supernoobs).
