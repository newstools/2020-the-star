 Garissa Governor Ali Korane on Thursday made his first cabinet reshuffle in a move he said was aimed at improving services. Roads, transport and infrastructure executive Abdi Omar Farah has been moved to the lands, public works, housing and urban development docket. Omar takes over from Mohamed Abdi Shale who was moved to the agriculture, livestock and cooperative development docket. Issa Yarrow who previously served as the agriculture executive becomes the new boss at the roads, transport and infrastructure department. In a statement, Korane said the changes take effect immediately. “The handing and taking over should be done and reports submitted with immediate effect. The county secretary shall preside," Korane said. Speaking in Garissa town on Monday, Korane urged county employees to strive to improve the lives of residents. He said each employee has a job to do and that failure to deliver would mean the county administration has failed. Korane said that it was morally wrong for any employee to draw a salary from the public yet they were doing very little or nothing. “I want to appeal to all county employees to use their God-given opportunity to better the lives of our people who are still faced with a myriad of challenges. Be it a doctor, clerk, nurse or even driver, don’t wait for anybody to come policing you to do what you are supposed to do,” Korane said. He urged residents to hold the public servants accountable and demand better services because "it was their right to be served."  edited by peter obuya
