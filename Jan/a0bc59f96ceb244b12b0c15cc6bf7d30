Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya and Senator Cleophas Malala have differed on calls for the formation of regional governments. Oparanya supported the calls for a federal system with regional, county and national tiers as proposed by Coast leaders during the regional BBI rally on Saturday. He added that Western Kenya residents support the proposal. But Malala said such calls are "egocentric". A similar proposal had been made by ODM leader Raila Odinga during the devolution conference in Kakamega in 2018. It was, however, not part of the resolutions by the Western leaders during the Kakamega BBI rally. Instead, they called for constitutionally guaranteed regional blocs. Yesterday, Malala accused second-term governors of hijacking the BBI process to advocate changes that will benefit them. "These calls are egocentric in nature and will defeat the objectives of devolution and weaken it," he said. The lawmaker said regional needs can be handled by existing economic blocs, adding that only a legal framework is needed on their leadership structures.Â The regional blocs are the Lake Region, North Rift, the Frontier Counties Development Council, South Eastern Kenya, Central Kenya, and Jumuiya ya Kaunti za Pwani. There is currently no law guiding their creation. The outspoken senator said the second-term governors are being used by the state to validate the BBI report. He said the ongoing audit of the Constitution must ensure changes that will exist for posterity. Governors had also made the proposal to the BBI taskforce but it never found its way into the report. The taskforce under its extended mandate is supposed to guide the validation process for its initial report and develop an implementation matrix.
