An electrician's contract with the Kenya Power company ended with a sad note when he was electrocuted on Tuesday night in Njeruri sub-location, Embu county. Isaiah Nyagah was the fourth electrician to be electrocuted in Embu in a fortnight. The other three suffered a similar fate on December 23, last year, while fixing a billboard on a wall of a supermarket. Nyagah died on the spot. He had been contracted to connect power to a residential house by KP. Residents said they saw flying sparks and when they went to establish what was happening, the body of the well-known electrician was hanging on a power post. They informed the police and the Kenya Power officials who arrived and removed the electrician's body to Runyenjes Level Four Hospital mortuary. County police commander Daniel Rukunga confirmed that the electrician had been contracted by Kenya Power. Two weeks ago, Samuel Wahome, Kariuki Ngiri and Joseph Ogonji were installing a billboard on the second floor of JatomyÂ  Supermarket in Embu town when they were electrocuted. The workers had been hired to install the billboard. Unfortunately, the board snapped and fell on power lines. The electricians were pronounced dead on arrival at Embu Level Five and Referral Hospital. Rukunga confirmed that the three were fixing the billboard on a wall at the supermarket. He cautioned electricians to always liaise with the Kenya Power company so that electricity is switched off before embarking on their jobs to avoid fatal incidents.
