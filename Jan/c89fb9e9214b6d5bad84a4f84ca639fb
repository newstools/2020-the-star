Kenya Airways and Alitalia have entered into a connectivity agreement that is expected to open up more rotes for both airlines. The code sharing will give tourists and businessmen access to the networks of the two airlines between African points into Europe, the Far East and South America. The agreement will see the Italian airline widen its codeshare network in Africa, by placing its “AZ” flight code on Kenya Airways’ service to Malindi. Similarly, Kenya Airways will expand its offer by placing its ‘KQ’ flight code on Alitalia’s services from Rome to Tirana – Albania, Podgorica – Montenegro, Santiago – Chile, Buenos Aires – Argentina, Sao Paulo – Brazil, Rio de Janerio, Seoul – South Korea. The national carrier launched flights to Malindi in June 2019 specifically to connect with the Italian market. “The expansion of this partnership reflects the opportunities that have been unlocked since the inception of the Nairobi to Rome flight ” said Kenya Airways Chief Commercial Officer, Ursula Silling. This agreement will enable customers to fly to their desired destination with a single ‘unique’ ticket, checking-in at the airport of departure, and collecting their checked-through baggage at the end of their trip in the arrival airport. Besides the new codeshare services and more convenient flight connections, Kenya Airways and Alitalia customers will have the opportunity to earn and redeem miles on the entire network operated by both airlines. In March 2019, Alitalia and Kenya Airways entered into a codeshare partnership to offer their customers more travel options at their hubs in Nairobi and Rome.
