Three children were killed in a house fire on Saturday midday in Githabai village, Nyandarua county. Property worth thousands of shillings was reduced to ashes. Nothing was salvaged. The three girls, aged between two and 11 years, died while undergoing treatment at Naivasha Subcounty Hospital. The trio had been left alone in the wooden house by their parents. Mother Jane Wanjiku, who lost two children, said she and her friend had left the kids in the house as they worked on the farm. She said an hour later, they saw smoke billowing from her house. “I fainted on seeing my house on fire but neighbours rescued the children and took them to the hospital. They died while undergoing treatment,” the tearful mother said. Witness John Kihara said the cause of the fire has not been established. “The fire started in the kitchen and spread very fast,” he said. MCA Samuel Rimui said, “We shall do everything possible to assist the two families.” Nyandarua Education executive Mwaura Njoroge said, “The governor is firmly behind you at this trying moment. We shall stand with the families.” The bodies were taken to Naivasha mortuary.
