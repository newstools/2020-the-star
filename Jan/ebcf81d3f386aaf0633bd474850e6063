Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru has hit at the group supporting Deputy President William Ruto's bid and told them to respect President Uhuru Kenyatta. Waiguru told off the politicians saying they were being used to harm the President's reputation the over BBI politics and that he deserves respect as the head of state. The governor explained that the MPS, "particularly from Mt Kenya region, were going around misleading Kenyans that the President is reluctant to go home after the expiry of his term". She told critics that no amount of lies will deter the President from campaigning for BBI. The governor spoke on Wednesday at Kagio town when she launched 15 skip loaders and skips to collect garbage. She also launched Mahigaini Bridge built by the county in Mwea. Waiguru exuded confidence that BBI will sail through. She called upon all leaders to rally behind the Building Bridges Initiative adding that it has solutions for the country. She cautioned that the region may be locked out of the national leadership in the next government if the leaders continue being divided. Only unity will see Mt Kenya in the next government, she said,  warning of people out to "divide the region then leave it in the political cold". She said she won’t hesitate to tell the region the truth terming it as the one reason she was elected. Waiguru also hailed President Kenyatta for the changes he made in Cabinet to save coffee, tea and milk sectors. The governor said the county has managed the garbage menace that has been facing the area. Edited by R.Wamochie
