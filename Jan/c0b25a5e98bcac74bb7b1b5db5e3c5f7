President Uhuru Kenyatta has scolded international media houses for painting Africa in bad light. Speaking in London during UK–Africa Investment Summit 2020 on Wednesday, Uhuru said he does not watch news anymore. "I keep telling people that sometimes when you watch news, which I stopped watching, you find Aljazeera, CNN, BBC, Sky News... talking about something that has happened in African countries and when the guy is signing off he says 'this is John White reporting from Nairobi, Kenya," Uhuru said. "We have this unfortunate problem created by the media that every single day it's the negative aspects of Africa that are brought out there." Uhuru said he would appreciate if Kenya and the rest of African countries are treated with the uniqueness they deserve. "I'd like people to appreciate that as much as we seek African unity, each country is unique and I believe Kenya is unique and should be known for it's uniqueness," he said. This comes a day after New York Times claimed in an article published on January 22, 2020 that KDF soldiers hid in the grass during the January 5 attack at Camp Simba in Manda Bay that saw three Americans killed when al-Shabaab attacked the base. But KDF spokesman Paul Njunguna rubbished the claims and questioned where the paper obtained the information they published. In 2015, Kenyans were angered when CNN reported that former US president Barack Obama was visiting a "hotbed of terror" in July 2015. President Uhuru Kenyatta expressed his disappointment at the story via the social media platform using hash tag #UhuruTellsCNN. In 2019, the government lashed out at Aljazeera over a Huduma Namba listing story. The story by the international media house ran the story titled 'If you are a Kenyan citizen, your private data is not safe'.
