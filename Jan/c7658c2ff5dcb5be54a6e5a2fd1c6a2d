Everton striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin says it is a ‘privilege’ to play under new Toffees manager Carlo Ancelotti. The ex-Real Madrid and Chelsea boss took over at Goodison Park in December. Ancelotti won his first two games in charge, with Calvert-Lewin scoring in both, before Everton lost 2-1 to Manchester City on Wednesday. “He is one of biggest managers in the world and as a young kid growing up you saw him on TV working at some of biggest clubs,” said Calvert-Lewin, 22. Speaking to Match of the Day before Everton’s FA Cup third-round tie at Merseyside rivals Liverpool yesterday, the Englishman added: “To have him here now, when you first see him you are little taken aback. He has a presence about him. That is just from the man he is and what he has done in football.” “To be working with him on a daily basis is a privilege.” Ancelotti took over at Everton shortly after leaving Serie A side Napoli, replacing Marco Silva who was sacked after 18 months in charge on 6 December with the Toffees 18th in the Premier League. The 60-year-old Italian won the Premier League and FA Cup during a two-year spell with Chelsea from 2009 to 2011, and has won the Champions League three times — twice with AC Milan and once with Real Madrid. “He is a man who knows how to win things and knows how to work with great players,” Calvert-Lewin told Match of the Day. “As a club these are exciting times. To have a manager to have done what he has done in the game, you can’t be anything but excited. “It is an unbelievable time to be an Everton fan and an Everton player. I am looking forward to what the future holds.”
