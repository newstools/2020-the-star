Bahati MP Kimani Ngunjiri has defended himself a day after being blamed by President Uhuru Kenyatta for undermining his work. The President said on Tuesday while addressing the residents of Bahati that the area MP should focus on the work that brought him to parliament. The legislature who is a close ally to Deputy President William Ruto said on Wednesday while addressing a local media that the President should be explaining to Nakuru people about the promises he made during the 2017 campaign period. Ngunjiri said the president had promised to expand dams located within the county, construction of roads among others yet he did not touch on such issues. He said the freedom of expression is not limited to him by the virtue that he is in the same party with the president. "I am just a leader like him. We had six ballot papers when we were being voted. We were not voted,Â  for him to lead and ourselves not to talk," Ngunjiri said. He added that as leaders they have to air the problems that are facing the people whom they represent. The MP dismissed claims that he has been abusing the President. "He was not coming to open any project in Bahati. He just came to insult and boo me, nothing else," The Mp said. Ngunjiri said he was shocked by the level of security deployed in his home area on Tuesday. "He came because of the fight and I'm shocked because I saw more than 1,000 askaris in Bahati. What was the problem? The MP?, Ngunjiri said. He said police officers deployed to Bahati should have been taken to areas with high risks of a terror attack. The President said on Tuesday that his efforts to unite the country as one will not be shaken by those opposing him.
