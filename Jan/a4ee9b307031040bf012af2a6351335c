A woman who allegedly stoned and damaged her colleague's vehicle after spotting her lover in it was on Tuesday charged in a Kibera court. Mutheu Nthuli was charged with malicious damage to property before senior principal magistrate Renee Kitagwa. She denied the charges. The charge sheet says that on December 25 last year in Dagoreti subcounty, Nthuli damaged the rear windscreen of a car belonging to Lilian Agola. The damaged windscreen for the Nissan motor vehicle was valued at Sh15,000, according to the prosecutor. The suspect was released on a bond of Sh50,000 and a cash bail of Sh30,000. Minutes later, the complainant appeared in court, seeking to withdraw the case because she feared for the safety of her daughter. She told the court that she did not know the accused person but had only offered to drop the man at Impala Club as he had requested her to. She said that the man was a friend and there was nothing more between them. The car belonged to her mother, she said. “He is just a friend and since I was driving, he requested that I drop him at Dagoreti Corner as I was heading to Yaya centre,” she said. The complainant told the court that she had no intentions of proceeding with the case. “I have fixed the windscreen and therefore I think the case should be withdrawn for security reasons,” she said. The magistrate said that she suspected they were fighting over the man. "If you were fighting over a man then it is unfortunate, of which I suspect that is the case," Kitagwa said. The accused person told court that she was not a criminal. “What I know is that I am not a criminal and I had never been found with any criminal records,” she said. Kitagwa allowed the case to be withdrawn.
