Gaspo Women FC have been warned against underrating mid-table teams in the coming season. Isaac Maluki's charges were firmly in the Premier League title race for the better part of last season but lost ground at some point to settle for second behind eventual winners Vihiga Queens. Maluki observed that the Kiambu-based club found the going tough against 'smaller' teams thus dropping points unnecessarily. He is, however, looking forward to steadying the ship this season as they chase a maiden WPL title. Gaspo garneredÂ  67 points, three adrift of Vihiga Queens. "We learnt our lessons and we will not underrate any of our opponents in the forthcoming season. Mid-table teams tend to produce shockers," said Maluki. "We start our campaign with the Kiambu derby against Thika Queens. We comfortably beat them in the first leg but drew 2-2 in the return leg despite taking 2-0 lead heading into half time. We have to produce better results no matter the opponent." Gaspo started pre-season training on January 8, focusing on strength, agility and fitness as well as testing themselves with several friendly matches ahead of the February 22 kick-off. "Our letdown came in front of goal. We had the second meanest defence but the worst scoring record among the top six teams. The club is working on deals to bring in attacking players and will make an announcement in due course."
