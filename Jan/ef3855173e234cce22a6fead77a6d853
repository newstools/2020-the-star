Former Mombasa mayor Shariff Shekue is dead. He suffered from diabetes, hypertension and had high cholesterol. Shekue, 52, collapsed in his bathroom on Monday and was later pronounced dead. His daughter, Shahma Shariff, said her father had been in stable condition. “His condition had been normal. I checked on him and he was normal,” she said. Shahma said that she was headed to work when she received a call that her father had collapsed and she should be accompanied by a doctor. When they arrived and the doctor pronounced him dead. “When I came, I realised that he was dead, but my cousin had hopes, saying that he was still alive and that we should call a doctor, so we did and that is when the doctor came to confirm that he was really dead,” Shahma said. Shekue leaves behind two wives and five children. On his Facebook page, Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho condoled with the  family, describing Shekue as a generous leader. “Its with great shock and deep sorrow that I have learnt of the demise of one of the former mayors of Mombasa H.W Shariff Ali Shekue. I join his family, friends, relatives and the people of Mombasa in mourning the late Shekue. I knew him as a visionary, generous leader with a loving personality,” Joho’s post read. Mombasa Speaker Kharub Khatri described Shekue as helpful. “It is great sadness which has befallen the people of Mombasa. He was a very generous person,” he said. Shekue served as a Mombasa mayor from 2005 to 2007 after taking over from Taib Ali Taib, who was the mayor, but had a case in court and he took over, having been his deputy until elections were done and he won. Shekue's classmate at Serani Primary School, Salim Abubakar, said he lost a friend and a brother. They were classmates between 1964 and 1970. A special prayer will be conducted at the Shibu Mosque and he will be buried at Kikowani Cemetry in Mombasa.
