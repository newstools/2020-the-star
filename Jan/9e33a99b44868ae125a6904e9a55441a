Invasion of the desert locust in Mandera, Wajir, Marsabit, Garissa, Isiolo, Samburu, Meru, Laikipia and Kirinyaga counties has left farmers and pastoralists counting huge losses. Since Mwangi Kiunjuri, the immediate former Agriculture Cabinet Secretary took over the docket in 2015, the farmers and pastoralists have been subjected to abject poverty due to mismanagement and corruption. The sacking of Kiunjuri came as a big relief to them. Many are now associating the invasion of desert locusts with The plague that has freed them from 'economic slavery' by Kiunjuri and his cohorts and are hopeful that the newly appointed CS Peter Munya will lead them to 'the promised land'. This move by President Uhuru Kenyatta together with the charging of governors with economic crimes is bound to restore even a little sanity among our leadership. It passes a message to corrupt leaders that they are not above the law and reminds them that they are leaders to serve the masses and not their own interests.  Nairobi.
