Security agencies have repulsed al Shabaab militants who attempted to attack Pandanguo village in Lamu on Saturday. The militants held the village ransom in a fiery siege that lasted for about seven hours from about 10pm to 3.30am. Security officers however responded promptly on the attack and managed to successfully repulse a group of at least 60 heavily armed militants. Villagers reported that the militants attempted to gain entry into the village but gunshots from the NPR officers stationed in the village attracted security officers in nearby camps including the GSU,KDF and ATPU. A local farmer only identified as Hashim who was guarding his farm, was temporarily taken hostage by the militants who inquired from him about the security situation of the village. "I didn't mince words,I told them that the village was under heavy security from all security agencies.They told me they wanted no trouble and that all they wanted was food,"Hashim said. In a show of defiance,the militants proceeded to Hashim's farm where they harvested bags of green maize and left. Lamu county commissioner Irungu Macharia told journalists that the situation has since been put under control. He urged locals to be vigilant at all times and report any suspicious persons that could pose a threat to security. There is tension in the village with locals preparing to flee. This comes barely a month after two separate terror attacks in the region that left six people and nine militants dead.
