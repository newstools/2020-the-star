The bid by the Football Kenya Federation to have the next chairman of the Kenyan Premier League elected has met opposition from one of the influential members of the KPL Governing Council. AFC Leopards' chairman Dan Shikanda was adamant that he would oppose any attempt to have the KPL chairman elected. “For sure, any election of the KPL chairman will bring in divisions in the group. You know elections are normally emotional affair and losers might not take it lightly,'”opined Shikanda “I would prefer that the current system where the chairman of the club that wins the KPL takes a similar mantle at the league body,” suggested Shikanda. The proposal is the brainchild of the FKF National Executive Committee through President Nick Mwendwa. With the KPL contract to run the topflight league set to end at the conclusion of the 2019-2020 season, the federation is likely to take over the management of the league. Mwendwa has voiced his preference for the election of the KPL chairman and said that he wants the management of the league to be housed at the federation headquarters at Goal Project, Kasarani. He has equally maintained that he would prefer if the league is managed by the club themselves like it is currently being done.
