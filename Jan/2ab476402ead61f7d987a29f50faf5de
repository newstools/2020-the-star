Uasin Gishu Woman Representative Gladys Shollei held meetings and attended church functions in the county two days after battling a social media storm. Shollei's photos with another man had emerged on social networking sites soon after she divorced her husband Sam Shollei. She had on Friday addressed a five-minute press conference in Eldoret where she denied improper conduct over the photos. The lawmaker rejected questions from the media over the matter and said she would never respond to accusations against her. Shollei insists she will not be distracted from her work by someone she says is known to her and who had threatened to destroy her character and image. “I will never respond to them or do the same to them because I was never raised to be an evil person,” Shollei said. She appeared hurt as she addressed the media and made the request not to take any questions. “Those photos out there reveal no improper conduct on my part. And in terms of using them to destroy me, I believe that no human being can destroy me unless my God wills it or if they are God which they are not,” Shollei said. She said no smear campaign would deter her from serving the people of Uasin Gishu and the country. “I thank God that I attended the ‘walking on fire training’ which require me to stay focused and never look at the fire which can consume me and therefore I shall not be consumed,” she said. The lawmaker said she would never again address the matter and would remain focused on her work. “I shall remain true to the work I'm supposed to do and that is why I would never again make any other comments on this matter again,” Shollei said. Shollei said her current challenges were not the first and would not be last but she would remain focused to take care of her children and work for her electorate.
