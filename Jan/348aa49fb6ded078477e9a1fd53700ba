Former world military 1,500m bronze medalist Emmanuel Kipsang is seeking to recapture the men's 10km Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) cross country title this  Friday. Kipsang, who last won the title  in 2017, will be representing Kenya Navy. He said he has recovered from a knee injury and was ready for the challenge as he prepares to represent the country at the Africa Cross Country Championships in Lome, Togo. “I want to return and take my position . I want to redeem my image not just at the KDF cross country but also at the nationals because I want to make the team for Africa Championships,” said Kipsang who trains in Iten. He said his training has been going on well and was keen to post good results. “The injury kept me off action for the entire 2019 and partially 2018 but that is behind me and I am focusing on a successful 2020,” he added. This is the first time he will be competing at the KDF  race in three years as he seeks to make the Kenyan squad.  He will be up against the likes of Kennedy Njiru, Victor Kiplimo, Peter Matelong, Cyrus Rutto, Mark Kiptoo and Isaac Kurga among others. In women's category, reigning world cross country champion Hellen Obiri is expected to lead her counterparts in search of places at the nationals. Obiri, the two time world 5,000m champion, surprised the world when she won the world title in Aarhus, Denmark.
