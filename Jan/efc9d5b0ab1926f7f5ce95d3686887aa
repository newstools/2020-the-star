Depression, anxiety and bipolar disorders are coming up as some of the fundamental drawbacks to the prevention of mental illness. Mental illness cuts across all age groups including young people. A surprising factor is that delay in early screening contributes to an increased prevalence of mental illness. In developing nations such as ours, there are many cases of mental illness, key among them depression that is taking a toll on the youth and adolescents. Financial difficulties, drug and substance abuse and stigma associated with unintended pregnancy are some of the causes of depression. According to the World Health Organization, one in four people in Kenya probably suffers from depression and mental illness, whereas four in five Kenyans who commit suicide are depressed at the time of their death. In addition, Kenya only has 62 psychiatrists against a population of 47 million. Improved financing of the Health sector, clear policies that integrate universal healthcare and treatment of mental illness as well as creating awareness on mental health will further reduce deaths associated with depression and other mental illness.
