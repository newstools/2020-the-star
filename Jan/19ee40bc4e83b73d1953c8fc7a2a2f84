When acting Registrar of Political Parties Ann Nderitu dispatched teams to inspect 12 new parties that have applied for full registration last week, most of them were caught unawares. One officer who was among those sent to eight regions to confirm the physical presence of offices told Corridors of Power that most of the parties rushed to comply. He said the offices they have visited so far have very fresh paint, new furniture and staff who could have been employed only a few days back. He said some of these offices appeared like shops or other business premises just a few days back. One can only hope that these parties will maintain their offices after they are fully registered. Insecurity in a county in Western has deteriorated so much that even senior police officers in the region are falling victims. A county police commander recently lost valuable electronics at his home after thieves broke in while he was away at work. The police boss was shocked when he arrived back and found the door half-open. The theft put him in an awkward situation when he reported the matter and joined a long list of people who have lost valuables to marauding criminals in the area. The situation perhaps calls for the intervention of Inspector General of Police Hilary Mutyambai since everybody in the county appears to be at the mercy of these criminals. A female national of Somali origin who has in the recent past been a subject of land grabbing accusations along Juja Road and Parklands byÂ  Eastleigh residents is at it again. She reportedly built three high rise blocks of flats now on sale. With her team, she has allegedly grabbed another piece of land in Highridge where excavation is undergoing for another building. It is said that the county governments of Nairobi and Kiambu, as well as some officials at the National Lands Commission, are aware of the fraudulent and illegal transactions yet have done nothing due to her immense and powerful connections within the corridors of power.
