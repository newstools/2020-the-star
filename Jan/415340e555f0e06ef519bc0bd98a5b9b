Embattled Kiambu Governor Ferdinand Waititu on Tuesday put up a spirited fight in the Senate to reverse his impeachment. Waititu dismissed as propaganda, the gross misconduct, abuse of office, conflict of interest and violation of the Constitution grounds that the MCAs cited to remove him from office in December last year. Here are the possible outcomes of the impeachment hearing. On Wednesday, the trial, which started on Tuesday, continues. Waititu, through his team of lawyers, will defend himself before all the 67 senators. Later in the afternoon, the lawmakers will hold a closed-door session where they will discuss the submission before returning to an open session to take a vote. If senators vote in support of his impeachment, Waititu stands impeached. On the other hand, if they reject the charges, Waititu will survive the impeachment. Waititu is accused of lacking accountability in managing county resources hence plunging it into a Sh4 billion debt. MCAs also accused Waititu of awarding tenders worth billions of shillings to his family and relatives, including wife and children. Waititu is the sixth governor to be impeached. All those before him have survived. Other governors who have been impeached and survived are Martin Wambora (Embu), Paul Chepkwony (Kericho), Mwangi wa Iria (Murang'a), now deceased Nderitu Gachagua (Nyeri) and Granton Samboja (Taita Taveta).
