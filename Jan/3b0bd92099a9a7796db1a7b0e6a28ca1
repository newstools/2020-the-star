Nondies coach Willis Ojal has set his sights on the playoffs after an improved run of form in the Kenya Cup. Ojal's charges lie eighth on the log on 21 points—just four away from the final playoff positions and the tactician believes they have mindset to take the season ending playoffs after an inconsistent start to the season. Nondies had a bright start last season before fading in the second half of the campaign to finish seventh and miss out on a playoff spot. This time round, Ojal said they have tweaked a few things in the squad and they are good to go. "We have done a couple of changes to our squad including adding more depth. We have also paced ourselves this year and we expect the next six weeks to be crucial,” noted Ojal. Following a 38-12 defeat to champions KCB before the Christmas and New Year holidays, the White Shirts bounced back, thrashing Western Bulls 41-10 in Kakamega over the weekend. "Playing away in Kakamega was tough  but the boys settled well into the game  and took their chance to open a big lead and win the game," said Ojal. He expressed optimism that his side will move higher on the table. "Our belief and confidence is high and we believe we are headed in the right direction,” noted Ojal Nondies have tricky set of fixtures coming up with fast-rising Homeboyz next in line in the Jamhuri Park derby on Saturday. They then face Impala, Kisumu, Blak Blad, Kabras and Mwamba . Ojal said they will take one game a time. “I believe our team is competitive. We are in the right frame of mind and we will be going all out,” he added.  Ojal expects a frenetic end to the season especially for the final two playoff positions. “It's wide open. If you look at Menengai Oilers, Mwamba, Nakuru and ourselves;  we are fighting for those final two positions and it will boil down to who can make fewer errors and execute their chances," he noted.
