The government encourages high school students to take science subjects so that they easily fit into the competitive job market. No country can grow without science and technology, noted Technical and Vocational Education Training Principal Secretary Kevit Desai during the launch Youth Scientists Kenya Exhibition 2020 at Ngarariga Secondary School in Limuru. Desa blamed poor performance in science subjects on the notion that the subjects are difficult. He urged science tutors to change teaching methods and be creative for easier understanding. “For a country to thrive economically, science has to be there. It makes people creative and innovative. The innovations offer solutions to challenges facing a country or community." “Therefore, our students will secure jobs in the government and within the country,” the PS said. The exhibition was attended by the Irish ambassador to Kenya Fionnuala Quinlan and National Science and Innovation director Moses Rugut. Students from 25 secondary schools took part in the fair held on Saturday. Desai noted that the Competency-Based Curriculum will boost science as it was about what learners can see and touch. YSK coordinator Mike Waiyaki said the exhibition is aimed at encouraging learners to work hard on science subjects. “We shall be holding exhibitions to showcase how students are doing, their innovations and those participating will learn. This is aimed at developing science courses taught in our curriculum,” he said. Quinlan applauded President Uhuru Kenyatta for his support for education that touches people’s lives. This, the envoy noted, will impact economic and social lives in all communities across the country. She encouraged students to obey teachers, parents and the church. Edited by R.Wamochie
