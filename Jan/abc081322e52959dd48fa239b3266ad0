In the recent instalment of the new leadership for the Africa Inland Church, the head of statement applauded the faith movements for the role they have played in the transformation of critical services such as education, healthcare and counselling support while focusing on mission and evangelism. The church has immersed itself in the sociopolitical process of this nation since the introduction of the multiparty era. What is striking is the call by the President for the clergy to continue offering prayers for the nation and more importantly, at these defining moments when BBI conversations are gaining momentum. As representatives of millions of members drawn from mainstream and ecumenical congregation in promotion of Christian unity among all faiths, the clergy have fought for equality, economic justice, peace and environmental stewardship in Kenya. Whenever the political class has been at a crisis, the church has been a source of light and wisdom, often the political class consulting religious leaders. While we recognise the prophet role of the church and its cardinal role spreading the good news, unfortunate churches in Kenya have become – for all practical purposes – sanctuaries for politicians and continuation of tribalism, dragging the church's reputation in the mud. Detailed scrutiny of the churches shows leadership-governance cracks that trace their origin to the first formation and establishment. A good example is the concentration of the Adventist church in Nyanza, PCEA and ACK which for years have had huge followers from the central region. Due to these connections, the leadership has often been drawn from the tribe where the churches first began against the teaching of the church itself. There should be a balance of leadership positions in the church to enhance inclusivity and cohesion. This will set a good precedent for the government itself which is in a spirited drive to achieve this through the BBI.  Samburu county
