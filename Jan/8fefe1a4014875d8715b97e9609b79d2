The 2019 Corruption Perception Index (CPI) report published by Transparency International on Thursday ranks Kenya at 28 out of 100, same as neighbouring Uganda. In 2018, Kenya was ranked at 27, pointing to a sluggish headway in the fight against corruption. According to Transparency International website, the 2019 CPI report highlights the relationship between politics, money and corruption, with comparisons to data on political campaign finance transparency and the public’s access to decision-making. The move by Parliament to defer the implementation of the Election Campaign Financing Act in 2013, according to TI, is among the contributing factors to Kenya’s current position on the CPI. The Act, if implemented, could allow the IEBC to monitor and regulate money used in campaigns. Kenya’s elections have been ranked among the highest expenditures in the world. The Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions under the lead of Noordin Haji recently promised Kenyans convictions and recovery of assets and monies acquired through corrupt means. Kenya is said to be losing up to 30 per cent of its annual budget to corruption. The Judiciary needs to keep tightening the noose around the necks of corrupt leaders. The state needs to go as far as withdrawing security details and even firearms from elected leaders facing graft charges. Leaders facing corruption allegations should also step aside unconditionally, to pave way for thorough investigations and avoid tampering with witnesses and potential evidence against them. These, among other measures would be great deterrents to other leaders and individuals who might think of engaging in graft. The night is still young, and Kenya stands a good chance eventually rid itself of the cancer of corruption and clinch a better CPI score for 2020, if all the promises on an all-out war on corruption from  President Uhuru Kenyatta, Haji and all the leaders are kept, with support from the citizens are implemented.
