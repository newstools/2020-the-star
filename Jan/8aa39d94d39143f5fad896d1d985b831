Sports Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohammed wants all federations work closely with the Anti-Doping Agency of Kenya officials as they seek to send a clean team to the 2020 Tokyo Olympics Games. Amina reiterated her commitment to oversee the flagging off of a clean team to Tokyo, Japan and to achieve this, she challenged stakeholders to work closely with Adak to sideline cheats from making their way into the team. Amina said this yesterday while opening a three-day National Olympic Committee of Kenya (NOCK) marketing workshop which brought together senior federation officials and stakeholders to the games. She said plans are at an advanced stage to criminalise the doping. The CS, who was flanked by his Principal Secretary Joe Okudo, stressed on the significance of protecting the Kenyan brand and put all athletes on notice over an impending mandatory tests devoid of exceptions. “No one will wear the Kenyan kit if he/she is suspected to associate with doping. We will not allow the Kenyan brand to be soiled and we have put every athlete on notice that they will be tested anywhere and anytime. I urge all officials to cooperate with Adak in ensuring the whereabouts of the athletes and any necessary information,” she said. Amina added: “We are working to criminalise doping and soon all loopholes will be completely sealed. We will not risk the future of our clean athletes by resting on our laurels,” The CS acknowledged receipt of funding proposals from federations but emphasized on the need to rationalise funds meant for preparations due to the tight budget at the ministry. She further revealed that kit meant for the Kenyan team will be shipped in and disbursed to the teams on time. “We have received proposals from the federations but we will rationalise to ensure teveryone gets what is needed and not what they request. The kit and other attires will be distributed to the teams on time. I believe with proper preparation and training, the medal harvest will be high,” she added.
