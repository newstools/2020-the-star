Lugari MP Ayub Savula has urged President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga to involve ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi and Ford Kenya's Moses Wetang'ula in the BBI plans. Savula said that involving the two and other leaders in the process will end the current perception that the BBI is an ODM affair. The lawmaker's remarks came as the Western region leadership pulled in different directions over a planned meeting to discuss the report. The meeting is coordinated by Cotu boss Francis Atwoli and Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya, both allies of Raila. Mudavadi and Wetang'ula on Saturday said the BBI rallies were meant by some people to position themselves for 2022, instead of uniting the country. "All leaders must be involved in this BBI business rather than making the initiative look like a personal property because there is no one opposing the report," he said. Savula said that the feeling that some people have been sidelined would breed divisions that undermine the unity envisioned by the report. The lawmaker said that there was enough time to address issues that have caused divisions among the country's leaders. "We are trying to fix the errors in the Constitution that is supposed to serve all Kenyans and it is only fair that everyone feels part of the process," he said. Kakamega county assembly Minority leader David Ndakwa said that Raila was pushing some people into opposing the report so that a referendum can be held to give him a chance to form another party for 2022. “We have seen all these games by Raila and we are all in BBI. We’re wondering why popularise a document that no one has opposed? Some people just like divisive competitions,” he said.
