The President's decision was based on his constitutional mandate as the appointing authority. The President is the appointing authority of the Cabinet Secretaries and he has the authority to make reshuffles or even sack others. It is important to note that the President, in discharging such duties, does not need to consult or talk to anyone. The discretion as to who serves or doesn't serve in his cabinet is his. We don't want to read a lot of politics into the whole issue when Uhuru Kenyatta reorganises his government to deliver on his promises to Kenyans. Actually Kenyatta doesn't need to please anyone when making government or cabinet appointments. Regarding the claims that William Ruto is losing out in the running and management of government, I want to state that Kenyatta is the one with the mandate from Kenyans to manage the affairs of this country until the next election. It is Kenyatta who makes the decision on the kind of people whom he wants to work with to deliver on his promises. When Ruto's turn comes, he will also have the discretion to choose the members of his cabinet and by extension his government without any undue influence. For us, we want to accord Kenyatta the respect he deserves to lead Kenya and to bring on board the people he feels fits the bill to work with him at all levels of government. Ruto is Kenyatta's principal assistant and cannot, therefore, challenge his boss. Ruto should respect Kenyatta's decisions and choices of the people he wants to work with to fulfil his mandate before his term ends in 2022. As a matter of fact, Ruto is focused on his responsibilities which are bestowed on him by the constitution and in no way do those duties conflict with Kenyatta's duties. Kenyans should understand that Kenyatta is the boss. He has the right to hire and fire the ministers working in government the way he pleases. This can happen anytime he is convinced that he needs to rejuvenate his team. The Bomachoge Chache MP spoke to the Star
