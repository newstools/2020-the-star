Fuel shortage hit Kisii on Tuesday, with some travellers cancelling their journeys after matatu operators hiked fares. Motorists using petrol were the hard hit by the fuel shortage. Petrol attendants told the Star the Christmas fuel supplies ran out due to huge demand. "We experienced a surge in demand as most people this time travelled upcountry with personal or hired cars," said Ali Abdi at Total Oil in Kisii. He said there was no significant rise in pump prices despite the shortage. "The prices have largely remained the same, the problem was this shortage which is momentary. The management has since ordered fresh supplies which are on the way," said Abdi. Eric Mokogoti, a motorist, said he visitedÂ  more than five stations in the town to check on petrol in vain. " I begun at Gesonso, Bonchari, and I have been going round for hours now checking on the commodity. At some point I thought my car would stall," he told the Star at Kenol where he finally found the last pints. Matatus operating to various outlying towns in the county also capitalised on the shortage to hike fares. Passengers going to Keroka from Kisii, for instance, were told to pay Sh150, up from Sh70. Those travelling to Kilgoris, Transmara coughed Sh300. Some travellers said they would have to postpone going upcountry to join their kin to usher in the New Year. "I worked through Christmas and wanted to share a meal on this day (January 1, 2020) but the fares have held me back," said John Omboto, who was due to go to Etago, 70km away.
