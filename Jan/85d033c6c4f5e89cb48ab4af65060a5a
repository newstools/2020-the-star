Administration Police head coach Samson Gitau has blamed their dismal run in the National Super League to the massive player exodus to Kenya Police before the new season began. AP are currently flirting with relegation in the second tier as they have bagged maximum points twice in 20 matches and are placed 18 with 15 points.  Gitau said they lost five players to Kenya Police in line with President Uhuru Kenyatta’s September 2018 directive to have two units merged. AP lost their priced stars among them wing wizard Abdul Karim, Brian Makokha, Chris Barasa, James Ngumbau and Kevin Aimo. Besides the five joining the law enforcers camp, the duo of Hillary Otieno and Kevin Omondi decamped to league returnees Vihiga United who were axed from the top flight after finishing second from bottom. Gitau noted that the departure of the seven players had been felt throughout the season as he was forced to settle for inexperienced players. He, however, exonerated the new recruits from blame but challenged them to put up a brave fight in the remaining matches to keep their status in the league. “The exit of five senior players messed my plans. Two more players joined Vihiga United, making it difficult to replace them. I could not stand in their way and this has forced me and the entire technical bench to go back to the drawing board. I went for inexperienced players both from the police force and civilians and I can't fault them for the poor run,” said Gitau In the meantime, the tactician is hopeful of escaping relegation from the remaining matches. The former AFC Leopards player says the team has gelled well  and the hunger for success is rife within the playing unit. “The team had not gelled in the first leg but the chemistry between players has grown tremendously and I am looking forward to positive results in the remaining matches. We have not lost our past two matches and if we build on that, we will beat the drop,” he added.
