The January 18 meeting at Bukhungu Stadium is set to discuss the BBI report, not the Luhya unity, Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya has said. Oparanya said the community wants to make a clear stand on the BBI and what is in it for the Mulembe nation. “When we meet the BBI team for the second round, we need to make our stand as the Luhya community. We want to know what the BBI entails for Western region at large,” he said. Oparanya spoke at Emusire High School during the Anyole Super Cup tournament organised by Emuhaya MP Omboko Millemba and his Luanda counterpart MP Chris Omulele. “The BBI meeting will go on with or without them. We shall work with grassroots leaders and those who will be selected to come. I welcome you all to join us at Bukhungu,” he added Oparanya's remarks comes after Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang'ula rubbished the meeting, saying it has no importance to the Luhya community.  The meeting is being organised by Cotu general secretary Francis Atwoli. Wetang'ula had accused Atwoli of allegedly "hawking the community for his selfish interests." Vihiga Woman Rep Beatrice Adagala said the BBI should include all elected leaders from Western who are representing the local community. Vihiga Governor Wilber Ottichilo, his deputy Patrick Saisi, MP Omulele and Emuhaya MP Omboko Millemba said they will fully support the BBI for the benefit of the community and the nation at large.
