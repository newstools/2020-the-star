The US has pledged to continue supporting Kenya in the war against al Shabaab terrorists. The American ambassador to Kenya, Kyle McCarter, said during a courtesy call to Narok Governor Samuel Tunai that security was vital for the growth of tourism. “We will continue working closely with Kenya Defence Forces in flushing out the terror group,” McCarter, who was accompanied by his wife Victoria, said. He said security is vital in Narok due to the interest visitors – especially from the US – have in the world-famous Maasai Mara Game Reserve. A secure Maasai Mara will boost confidence and result in more arrivals. The two leaders also agreed to jointly promote the Maasai Mara to American tourists. The US was the largest source of tourists in Kenya last year.
