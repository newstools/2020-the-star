Kabras RFC have finally signed Walter Okoth from Nakuru following protracted transfer saga between the two clubs. Kenya Rugby Union gave the Kakamega-based side the go-ahead after receiving signing fee from the sugar millers and registering the player. Nakuru and Kabras were at loggerheads over the player's signature with Okoth saying he wanted out of Nakuru following overtures from Kabras during the mid-season transfer window in December. Nakuru had wanted Sh1 million  for the services after developing him from the age of 17. On their part, Kabras felt the transfer fee was excessive and they had followed due procedure in signing the player.  Kabras head coach Henley Du Plessis welcomed the arrival of Okoth who he termed a player of the future. “ He has a great future ahead of him and has expressed his desire to win the Kenya and Enterprise cups with the club and I  am confident he will add value to the team,” added Du Plessis. Okoth will be a replacement for Nick Barasa who is out injured for the rest of the season.  Kabras face Mwamba this weekend in a return leg fixture at the Kakamega show ground, having won the first leg 47-12 in Nairobi. "Mwamba are a very experienced club and are currently chasing  a playoff position. We must therefore be ready for them in the encounter,” added Du Plessis. Du Plessis said his fixtures against Impala, Nondies and Blak Blad are tricky and "We are at critical time and we must engage the top gear and be in peak conditions for the next six weeks to ensure  we finish first in the pool phase,” he added. Kabras have lost three consecutive Kenya Cup finals to the bankers and have vowed to win the title this year for the second time in their history.
