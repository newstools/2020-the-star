Police have directed club owners in Diani and Ukunda to adhere to the rules and regulations of playing music at night. Msambweni subcounty police commander Nehemiah Bitok said clubs should play music at the right time to promote calm. His sentiments come a month after Msambweni MP Suleiman Dori complained that nightclubs have become a nuisance. “We are aiming at minimising noise, especially in the late evenings where loud music is heard everywhere from liquor parlours and nightclubs,” Bitok said. He said playing unregulated volume is against the law and pollutes the environment, and stern actions will be taken against culprits. He spoke to the press in Kwale. He said people must care about the wellbeing of their neighbours by doing things that do not breach the peace. “You can’t be playing high music in the entire neighbourhood because there are people who are sick, some want to relax after a long day, so don’t cause a disturbance,” Bitok said. The Msambweni police boss advised pubs and individuals to play soft music if there is a need to entertain clients. He said most culprits operate illegally. “The unlicensed businesses will be in for a rude shock while the licensed shall work as per the Constitution,” Bitok said. He also cautioned drivers to be careful on the roads. Last year, the county recorded a ‘bigger’ number of road accidents compared to 2018. Bitok blamed most accidents on reckless driving and the bad state of roads following heavy rains.
