ANC party leader Musalia Mudavadi and Bungoma senator Moses Wetangula on Saturday arrived at the Bukhungu stadium ahead of the BBI forum. The two leaders had vowed not to attend the forum saying that they were not consulted. But on Saturday, the two were spotted going to the stadium where other leaders were seated. Last week, Mudavadi and Wetang'ula said the BBI rallies were meant by some people to position themselves for 2022, instead of uniting the country. They were scheduled to hold a parallel meeting on January 18 when the BBI gathering will be taking place. But the police canceled their permits. The Building Bridges Initiative is expected to alter the BBI proposals with an emphasis on the Executive structure, which many quarters have dismissed as weak. Already, two meetings have been planned this month in Nyanza and Western to not only drum up support for the document but also to suggest new changes to be effected in the second round of engagement.
