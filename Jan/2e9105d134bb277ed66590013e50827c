Setting up of  Karate Academy and incorporating the sport into the schools programs are part of  Kenya Karate Federation  (KKF) long term strategic development plans. KKF secretary general, Gabriel Mutuku, said the academy will help harness and nurture the untapped talent. He said they have engaged the Sports and Education ministries as they seek to realise their dreams. He said the federation is already training referees, coaches and judges in readiness for the program to be rolled out in 2021. Mutuku maintained they have contacted Japan for sponsorship in terms of building the stadium and remains optimistic that the East Asia partners will honour the request. The federation will take seven judges (six men and a woman) for a course in Dubai from February 10-18, just a day after the conclusion of the African Karate Championship in Morocco, where Kenya will field a team. The continental assignment also acts as Olympic qualifiers. "The construction of the academy at Kasarani will help develop the sport which largely remains unknown among the masses. We have done our research, talked to stakeholders and settled on Japan to bankroll the project since it is the mother country of Karate in the world. We are eagerly waiting on their response, " remarked the KKF supremo. "If the juniors can be taught about self-defence and discipline at the academy, it will be a big boost to the country," he noted .
