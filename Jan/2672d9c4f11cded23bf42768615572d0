Hours to the end of the January transfer window AFC Leopards were hard at work to bring in new faces to beef up their squad head of the second leg of the football season. Ingwe reported on the clubs official social media pages that they had acquired three new youthful players all of whom will be at the ‘Den’ on four-year contracts. “We would like to confirm the signing of Omar Somobwana, a right-back from St.Peters High School, Mumias. He has signed a contract for four years. Winger Dan Sunguti from Mount Kenya University FC in Nakuru has signed a contract for four years and Dan Musamali, a defensive midfielder from St. Anthony High School, Kitale. He has signed a contract also for four years,” read statements by the club. Also, joining the club is Luis Misiko from Tusker. Leopards, still grappling with difficult financial times, were among the hardest hit sides in the top flight with key players among them Whyvonne Isuza, Dennis Shikayi and on Friday, John Makwata all departing. Makwata has, reportedly, joined Zambian champions Zesco United. He was the KPL top scorer with 13 goals after 18 matches. Ingwe face a tricky task on Sunday when they travel to Nakuru to take on Ulinzi Stars at the Afraha stadium. Leopards are sixth on the table with 31 points, 10 off league leaders and traditional rivals Gor Mahia.
