Consumer goods company  Unilever East Africa has launched its first fully recyclable plastic packaging for Sunlight Scouring powder. Developed as part of a partnership with waste management service provider Mr. Green Africa Trading Limited, the new 500grams, and one-kilogram packs will be on sale in Kenya and the rest of the region. According to Unilever, the move will mitigate the use of thousands of tonnes of virgin plastic each year, once the switch is completed, thereby eliminating environmental pollution associated with plastics. Speaking at the launch, Unilever Africa president Bruno Witvoet said the move is a pioneer example in creating a fully circular plastic economy for Kenyan industry. “At Unilever, we want to decouple our growth from our environmental footprint. Today marks a great milestone in our circular economy journey. The launch of the first truly circular plastic packaging for Sunlight scouring powder in Kenya is a great win for the environment,'' Witvoet said. Unilever targets reducing by half its use of virgin plastic, by reducing its absolute use of plastic packaging by more than 100,000 tonnes while accelerating the use of recycled plastic.
