With the current rainy conditions in Ruiru, this year’s event promises a more explosive fight for top honours with the backdrop of a challenging navigation circuit, which includes a new bike pit and cycling track. The dreaded mud gauntlet at the penultimate stage of the race is expected to offer a befitting challenge and excitement to both riders and spectators. Apart from the competition, Hog Charge is also a charity event whose proceeds are channeled towards supporting the Rhino Ark which is involved in conservation project focusing on the Mt. Kenya water towers.
