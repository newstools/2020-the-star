Ryan Randiek is targeting a place in the final of the International Tennis Federation(ITF) East Africa Junior circuit second leg which starts at the Nairobi Club today. Randiek, who is pursuing his first junior title had a poor display in the first leg, where he crashed out in the third round, but he is keen to atone for his dismal performance this time round. Randiek conceded that he faired dismally in the first leg and vowed to fire from all cylinders in a bid to redeem himself and gather more points. "I did not do well in the first leg but I will be seeking to make it to the final in the second leg. It was disappointing to start the circuits with an early elimination but I picked my lessons. Should I fail to advance to the final, a quarter-final berth then is a must," said Randiek. Randiek, who is in the final year in the junior category is targetingÂ  20 points, which will go a long way in boosting his global ranking. "I am focused on playing well but at the same time, I have to boost my rankings by collecting more than 20 points. It's my final year in the circuits and the aim remains to win at least a title," he observed. Among the costly errors which Randiek revealed to have been his major undoing were lack of patience and inaccurate returns. However, he said he has polished his game by playing a senior Madagascan player. "I was not consistent and made avoidable errors in the first leg. I was impatient in my returns and my game was generally scrappy. I have been training with (Derrick) Ominde and a senior player from Madagascar and I am raring to go," he said.
