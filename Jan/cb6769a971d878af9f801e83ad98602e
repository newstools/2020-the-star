Former world Youth 1,500m champion Sammary Cherotich is already dreaming of a slot in Team Kenya to the 2020 Olym,pic Games following her return to the sport last year. Family commitments and related challenges had ruled the talented runner off the track for lengthy spells but after competing in four races in the North Rift at the close of last season has the 2007 Youth champion bubbling with confidence. Last Saturday, she finished fifth at the 4th and penultimate leg of Athletics Kenya Cross Country series in Kapsokwony, timing 39:20.02. “I have decided to return to athletics because that is my talent. It showed me the way and opened doors of prosperity for me as a young girl. Now my focus is on the 2020 Olympic Games,” she said. “I have been out for long but that will not matter a lot because winning is an attitude. I did not return to lose but to win. If it was for losing then I have no reason to come and waste time." She said seeing the likes of world and Olympic champion Faith Kipyegon and former Commonwealth Games champion Mercy Cherono making still active have given her the motivation since they were her opponents in the junior ranks. “Faith has the energy and it is the same skills I used during then days. I feel bad for myself when I see them run while I am just in the house doing nothing. However, talent doesn't die, you only mute and once you press it, it works miracles automatically,” she said. Cherotich started training early last year and competed at the inaugural Tuskys 10k Great Run where she finished in 30th but made a remarkable improved to finish 14th at the Kalya Half Marathon. When she won the 1,500m title at the 2007 World U18 Championships in Ostrava, Czech Republic, Kenya finished second on the table behind the USA with six gold, four silver and a bronze. During the final, Cherotich set a personal best of 4:15.47 to join other gold medalists like Mercy Cherono in 3,000m, Caroline Tuigong (2,000m steeplechase), Geoffrey Kibet (800m), Fredrick Musyoki (1,500m) and Daniel Lemashon in 3,000m. Silver medals were won through Josephat Mitunga (1,500m), Lucas Rotich (3,000m), Silas Kosgei (2,000m steeplechase) and Christine Mayanga in 2,000m steeplechase while Sheila Kiprotich was the only bronze medalist in women's1,500m.
