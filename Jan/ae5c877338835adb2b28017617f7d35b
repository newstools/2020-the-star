 Twittter:@githinjireuben Former Transport PS Cyrus Njiru has supported the rallies to popularise BBI, Njiru said on Tuesday there have always been meetings to mobilise people for cause, even when there is no opposition. There were meetings in villages to drum up support among young men to move into the forest to become Mau Mau fighters. He told the Star although no one publicly opposed Mau Mau, the meetings persisted. “Similarly, if there is a good idea like the BBI, I see no problem in drumming up support for it, sharing the excitement, singing and dancing. But it should be peaceful. Let us support it." He said nobody is forced to join in and those who want to go have a democratic right to do so. Njiru s[poke with the Star after meeting several leaders from Embu County to deliberate on the BBI. Meeting shave been held in Kakamega, Kisii and Bungoma and have been backed b ODM leader Raila Odinga. DP Ruto says the meetings are a waste of resources and are intended to popularise Raila and ODM for the 2022 General Election. He says ODM has hijacked BBI. He says when the BBI report was released, leaders agreed to give enough copies to the people so they can read it by themselves and decide for themselves. But when did leaders decide they needed to organise political meetings to explain the report to the people, he asked. Njiru said, however, the leaders recommended creating two deputy two prime minister seats to help entrench inclusivity in the executive and the legislature. The county would have the president, deputy president, a pine minister and two deputy prime ministers, and the speakers of the National Assembly and Senate. Njiru said they supported President Uhruru Kenyatta'a call to improve the welfare of coffee, tea and dairy farmers, saying it would put money in people’s pockets, as in Embu where most people were depending on agriculture (Edited by V.
