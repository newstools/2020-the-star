After recovering from a knee injury that kept him away from defending his world 1,500m title, Elijah Manangoi has set his sight on winning his first Olympic Games medal in Tokyo, Japan later this year. The 2018 Commonwealth Games 1,500m champion described the nagging injury as a monster in his career and which he has to quickly forget about. “Last season was too bad for me after missing the world championships due to a knee injury. But now I am back, ready to contest for the Olympic Games title,” said the former world 1,500m silver medalist. “It was a really tough season for me. I could have gone to Doha to defend my title, represent my people and my country but this never came to be. But I have to be strong, forget and leave those misfortunes behind and focus on Tokyo 2020 in Japan,” said Manangoi. He also regretted his performances at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where he finished a disappointing  12th position in a sluggish time of 3:45.47. “In Rio, it was a big blow though I went on to win gold in London the following year. Actually, Rio turned out to be a good learning curve. It was a morale booster, to be stronger and know that everything is possible if you fail and return stronger,” said Manangoi, who runs alongside his young brother George. He added that failing to run in Doha has given him enough time to recover and prepare thoroughly for Tokyo. “Injuries are part of the sport and we have to accept them once they come though they should not pin you down,” added Manangoi. With lack of training facilities across the country, he added: “We have small challenges but we have to remain focused.”
