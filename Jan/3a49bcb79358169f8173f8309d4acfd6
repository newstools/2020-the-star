ODM party leader Raila Odinga and President Uhuru Kenyatta should not allow politicians to hijack the BBI report, Central Alego MCA Leonard Oriaro has said. Oriaro said the two leaders should stick to their initial plan of only engaging technocrats and the people on what the BBI report should look like. “It was very clear that Raila and President Kenyatta said that they don’t want the hands of politicians in it,” Oriaro said. The MCA said he is shocked that the two leaders have allowed governors, senators and MPs to run the show when the document is supposed to be people-driven. Oriaro said he takes issue with the Nyanza politicians who on Friday will give their views on behalf of Nyanza people on the BBI report. “In Siaya only a few leaders and many busybodies met in a Bondo Hotel on Monday purporting to represent the views of residents in Kisii on Friday,” Oriaro wondered when Siaya Senator James Orengo, MP Atandi and Ombaka spoke to residents of Central Alego ward when no one from there attended the Bondo meeting. “Let the Siaya politicians be sincere with the BBI report and use the platform of the county assembly to hold an office sitting for each MCA to traverse his ward and make a position for the county,” Oriaro said. He said Kenyans will not get good results from the report because of the way it is being handled by politicians. Earlier, Siaya Senator James Orengo, Alego Usonga MP Samuel Atandi, Siaya woman rep Christine Ombaka had converged in Bondo to forge a common position on the report. Orengo said the meeting was a public participation forum to allow residents and leaders to distil and put the issues in implementable form. Orengo said some of the issues to go with in Kisii are that they fully support the handshake for unity and political tolerance. “I’m aware it’s from the meeting that they have identified 300 Siaya residents that will be facilitated with Sh5,000 by Siaya county government to Kisii,” Oriaro said.
