President Uhuru Kenyatta has confirmed Ukur Yattani as the National Treasury CS in his latest Cabinet reshuffle. Yattani has been acting as the Treasury CS since July after the arrest of his predecessor Henry Rotich over graft claims. Yattani is a former lawmaker who served as ambassador to Austria and Marsabit governor before his appointment to the Cabinet last year. He holds a degree in economics and sociology. Since his appointment as Treasury CS, the locals had been asking the President to confirm him as the Treasury CS. In the latest cabinet reshuffle made by the President on Monday, Simon Chelugui was moved from the Water docket to Labour, which had also been Yattani's post. Legislators drawn from the North Eastern region had applauded the President for appointing Ukuru Yatani as the acting Treasury CS. Isiolo Senator Fatuma Dullo had said that the President did the right thing, asking that he be confirmed. His comments were echoed by Samburu North MP Alois Lentoimaga. Suna East MP Junet Mohammed said his appointment has sent a clear message that pastoral communities are part and parcel of the country.
