A street boy is one of the eight Laikipia pupils who are to benefit from scholarships under Equity Bank's Wings to Fly programme. The eight, four girls and four boys from Laikipia East and North, will have their secondary education fully paid for. Fourteen-year-old Nahashon Njuguna scored 361 marks and is to be admitted to Thome Boys Secondary School in the county. An elated Njuguna said he hopes to pursue a career in medicine so he can also give back to society and inspire other less-fortunate children. “It was hard growing up without parents. They died while I was young. Before I was 10, I was already fending for myself in the streets. Later on, I was rescued by a charitable home that took me to school. I will forever be grateful to them,” he said. Nanyuki Equity Bank branch manager Benson Kinyua on Monday said their selection team received 117 applications and the eight were the neediest. "The selection committee had to visit their homes and ascertain the state of their backgrounds and ensure we award the sponsorship to the most deserving cases. Most of them come from extremely poor homes,” he said as he flagged off the programme. Other beneficiaries included orphans and those with sickly and elderly parents and guardians. County Director of Education Susan Murerwa attended the event. She urged the beneficiaries to work hard so they can free their families from the bondage of poverty. Some 128 learners from the county have benefitted from the programme since it was introduced 11 years ago to assist those faced with financial constraints. (Edited by F'Orieny)
