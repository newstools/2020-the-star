The Kakamega county government will spend Sh553 million to upgrade two roads to bitumen standards in Ikolomani and Butere subcounties. The 9.2km Bushiangala-Eregi-Lusiola stretch in Ikolomani subcounty has been allocated Sh337 million. It connects the county to neighbouring Vihiga at Chavakali. Governor Wycliffe Oparanya, who commissioned the construction on Monday, said the 5.5km Tsalwa-Ombwaro-Manyulia road will be upgraded at Sh216 million. "The contractors on Bushiangala and Tsalwa roads have been given nine and eight months respectively to complete the works,” he said, adding that any excuses would not be entertained. The governor stated that he had prioritized improvement of the roads network across the county to enable easy movement of people and goods. He said works had been completed on the Likuyani-Soyi-Kogo road in Likuyani subcounty, Lumakanda-Town road in Lugari and Khayega-Shinyalu road in Shinyalu. Others are Shibuli-Bukura road in Lurambi and Akatsa-Matioli-Khwisero road in Lurambi and Khwisero. He said the programme is being implemented in phases due to insufficient funds but ultimately all wards will be covered. At the same time, the Acacia Mining Company handed over a Sh7.8 million Shibuname community water project at Isulu area in Ikolomani subcounty to the county government.
