A stolen pistol and 40 bullets recovered from the luggage rack of a Thika supermarket on Thursday were left there by two women, according to the store's management. The women, who the police identified from CCTV footage, left the gun and the ammunition in a backpack at the Thika branch of Naivas Supermarket. The management became suspicious after the bag was uncollected for days and reported to the police station yesterday morning. Manager Daniel Mukuha said the women had covered their faces in scarfs. One wore a pair of trousers and the other was in a dress. Mukuha said it was the policy of the company not to interfere with a customer's property. Thika police boss Beatrice Kiraguri said the pistol was stolen from a licensed gun holder in Kandara, Murang’a, on December, 30 last year. “The owner of the gun was attending a burial in Kandara when his car was broken into and the items stolen,” Kiraguri said. The theft was reported to Kandara police station. The police have since then been searching for the weapon. The incident has raised concern on the professionalism of security guards manning the entrances of shopping malls and supermarkets. Kiraguri said security guards manning busy premises should be properly trained on how to conduct thorough checks and searches. She also called on supermarkets to ensure that bags and luggage do not remain uncollected for more than a day. A bag with a laptop was among other items taken away by the police. .
