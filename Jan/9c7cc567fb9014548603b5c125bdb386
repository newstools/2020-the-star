Some one million cash transfer beneficiaries will from tomorrow January 20 receive their cash in monthly stipend arrears. The government released Sh4.4 billion last week. Newly appointed Labour and Social Protection CS Simon Chelugui said each of the 1,094,045 beneficiaries will receive Sh.4000 each. The money will only be channeled out to beneficiaries who opened bank accounts for three programmes under the Consolidated Cash Transfer Programme by December 31 2019. Chelugui said the money will cover six months and beneficiaries have access to their money during that period. "Beneficiaries will receive their payments through contracted payment providers including Co-operative Bank, Equity Bank Ltd, Kenya Commercial Bank and Post Bank," he said. Social Protection PS Nelson Marwa said, that the ministry has made cleanup on the payroll to ensure only genuine members are benefiting under the scheme. He said, the new system will ensure that bogus people will be weeded out. Marwa also noted that the account based model adapted, allows beneficiaries to make their own savings into their account and are entitled to two free withdrawals per payment cycle. "Recently, Inua Jamii clinics were conducted country wide to ensure proof of life and 14,262 deceased beneficiaries were exited from the payroll," he said. Some 295,307 beneficiaries will benefit under the orphans and vulnerable children cash transfer programme while 764,644 older persons will be covered. Some 34,094 persons with severe disability are covered under the programme. Beneficiaries or caregivers Marwa said are required to produce their Inua Jamii payment and identity cards to receive payments. However those going for first time payment must transact biometrically. Beneficiaries have the opportunity after one year to change from one PSP to another if they wish. In June last year, the government released  Sh8.56 billion to be wired to   1,070,238 beneficiaries. They were to receive Sh8,000 each.
