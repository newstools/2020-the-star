The two recent incidents of patients committing suicide in Murang’a and Kirinyaga hospitals raises concern on the security of patients in the hospital. The duration that a patient takes to plan a suicide and even proceed to do so in an environment that one is not very familiar with will leave one with the natural conclusion that close monitoring of patients at the hospital has not been put into consideration. Hospital administrations should work to ensure that they equip enough personnel to monitor admitted patients at a close range to avert future cases. Installation of CCTV cameras with a person in charge to keep watch will probably work best where the budget won’t allow recruiting of more staff. This will save the lives of patients who have given up.  Nairobi
