Police in Nyahururu are holding a woman in connection with last Friday's killing of a man during a cattle raid in Matuiku village in Laikipia West subcounty. Nyahururu subcounty police boss Geoffrey Mayek said the woman, 45, was arrested after a firearm was recovered from her Kaserian village home in Marigat, Baringo county Police suspect the firearm was used in the killing of James Kinyogoro, 96. Two cows that were stolen during the incident and four bullets were also recovered from the suspect’s home. The police boss said that officers were in hot pursuit of her 15-year old son who is believed to have been involved in the raid. “We have arrested the woman not because she took part in the raid but because the stolen animals, the gun and the rounds of ammunition were found at her home,” Mayek said. He said that his team was partnering with their colleagues in Baringo to establish the whereabouts of the teenager. Mayek said the woman was being questioned and would be arraigned after investigations are completed. “The recovered firearm will be subjected to ballistic investigation to identify whether it was the one that was used during the Friday killing." Kinyogoro was shot on the head after he reportedly resisted the raiders' order to open the cowshed for them to take away the animals. His body was moved to Nyahururu County Referral Hospital mortuary. Githiga MCA Peter Thomi decried rising cases of insecurity in the area. “Six police officers were killed including other numerous residents on different occasions for resisting cattle rustling. Something serious on security matters needs to be done,” Thomi said Monday. Edited by R.Wamochie
