Muthaiga Golf Club’s Nelson Mudanyi and Vet Lab’s Mathew Omondi, played rounds of 7-under par, 65 and 2-under par, 70 respectively, to join overnight leader Greg Snow at the summit of the Thika Greens Leaderboard, on a gross score of 4-under par, 140 after yesterday’s round two action. Mudanyi, who started the round T19, with a score of 3-over par from round one, turned around his fortunes on the day to shoot a tournament-leading score of 7-under par, earning him a share of the lead heading into the penultimate round. Omondi started the day T3 on 2-under par, a score that he matched in the second round to see him climb two places. Mudanyi returned a blemish-free scorecard, hitting an impressive seven birdies on the first, fourth, fifth, 13th, 14th, 16th and 17th. Omondi almost matched Mudanyi’s form with five birdies but dropped three shots on the third, fourth and 18th. Overnight leader Snow failed to match his opening blistering pace, managing a round score of 1-over par off four birdies, four bogeys and one double bogey, to take his gross score to 4-over par, 140 and open up the race to the title. Snow’s story was one that was replicated across the field, with a drop in scores, a total of five players managed scores of under par, from yesterday’s eight, including Nigeria’s Andrew Oche (1-under par), Muthaiga’s Kopan Timbe (4-under par) and Windsor Golf club’s Rizwan Charania (3-under par). The cut was set at 8-over par, with a total of 22 players progressing to play in the third and fourth rounds. Among the players to miss the cut include Dismas Indiza, who returned a score of 5-over par to take his total to 9-over par, 153. Others are Mohit Mediratta, Hesbon Kutwa, Jacob Okello and Philip Kasozi of Uganda. Round Three action will tee off at 11 am with the field now focused on a stake of the Sh1 m prize kitty and the valuable ‘Road to the 2020 Magical Kenya open’ points.
