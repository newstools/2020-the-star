 Public health centres in Taita Taveta county are in a pathetic condition after 300 cleaners were sacked a month ago. The poor state of affairs has adversely affected service delivery, Kenya National Union of Nurses Taita Taveta branch organising secretary Synnette Ogolla said on Wednesday and called for the reinstatement of the workers. “Filth is everywhere - in the wards and dispensaries,” Ogolla said. Richard Nyambu, the county inter-union communications officer said the layoffs will result in the spread of infections. Last week, the County Assembly stopped the deployment of staff to the Health Department, citing illegality in the process. Wumingu/Kishushe MCA Newton Kifuso said drivers and messengers from other departments should not be transferred to the health department to do cleaning jobs. He said those responsible for the layoffs should be held responsible.
