 Nairobi City Stars hope to have former AFC Leopards and Gor Mahia midfielder Peter Opiyo will be available for Sunday's game against Vihiga Bullets. City Stars CEO Patrick Korir said they have completed the signing but they are waiting for his International Transfer Certificate from Turkmenistan, where he was plying his trade for FK Altyn Asyr. “We hope to get the ITC by Friday 9today). If we get it, he will be available on Sunday,” he Korir. Opiyo, popularly known as Pinchez, is among four players signed by the NSL log leaders. Others include winger Aziz Okaka formerly of defunct Sony and veteran striker Ezekiel Odera from KCB.  The Jonathan Jackson-sponsored side also raided fellow promotion chasing rivals Nairobi Stima for goalkeeper Jacob Osano. Coach Sanjin Alagic last week praised Opiyo, saying he will play a key role in his side's promotion hopes. “He is a complete midfielder who is very professional,” said the Bosnian. Fourth-placed Nairobi Stima, who have a game in hand, will tomorrow (Saturday) be in action against Kenya Police at Karuturi Sports ground while St Joseph's Youth will welcome Administration Police at Afraha Stadium in Nakuru. Modern Coast Rangers and Kibera Black Stars will clash at Serani Sports ground while Muranga Seal host Shabana FC in Murang'a. On Sunday, second-placed Bidco United will play fifth-placed Migori Youth at at Thika Stadium. Migori Youth will be without NSL top scorer Clinton Okoth who joined KPL champions Gor Mahia and Antonio Abwao who joined Kenya Commercial Bank. Migori Youth coach Robert Ojienda admitted that the duo's absence was felt in their barren draw against Vihiga United in Migori. “I'm shopping for an experienced striker. The departure of Okoth is a big blow to us but we wish him well,” said Ojienda. Vihiga United will hope to return to winning ways when they tackle FC Talanta at Camp Toyoyo as Coast Stima hosts Mt Kenya United at Mbaraki Sports Club. Ushuru will be up against APS Bomet at Ruaraka grounds.
