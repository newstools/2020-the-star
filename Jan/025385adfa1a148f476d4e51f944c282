A total of 43 people have been arrested after detectives raided two unregistered colleges in Eastleigh. In a tweet on Tuesdya, the DCI said, "The colleges have been operating without the requisite licences from TVETA and also enroll Somali refugees for language classes after which terror agents recruit students from the colleges for information gathering once they attain fluency in English and Kiswahili." Atlas college was found registered with TVETA but has been offering courses that it has not been licensed to train such as English and Kiswahili. On the other hand, Alison community college was found not registered with TVETA. Both colleges have been operating with unregistered staff. During the operation, 43 individuals without requisite documentations were arrested - two are managers, one secretary, two teachers and 38 students. All who were arrested without the required documentation will be arraigned on Wednesday for residing outside designated areas as further investigations to establish the cartels behind the human trafficking syndicate continue.
