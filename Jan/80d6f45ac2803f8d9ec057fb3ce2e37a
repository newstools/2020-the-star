The national government will construct more border control points at the coastline to improve security and ensure the safety of the fishermen and residents at the seashores. Speaking during a two-day county stakeholder consultation on draft Marine and Inland Fisheries Regulations at Pride Inn in Ukunda, Fisheries Principal Secretary Prof Micheni Ntiba said there is need to have maximum control at the coast because they are vulnerable to attacks. “We have to monitor everyone coming in and out of the sea landing site because terrorists among other people might take advantage of the openness and intrude, causing a disaster,” he said. He said the check units will help protect the seas and heighten the fight against terrorism in the country. The PS said a proper record must be kept of people using the sea which will ease tracking and rescuing exercises when emergencies arise. “We have to know the exact figure of people who went aboard, which boat and under whose registration so that when they don’t make it back we can easily do a follow-up and send help,” Ntiba said. He said discipline at the coast should be the top priority as the movement of individuals would be directed through legal, secured and recognised channels. Ntiba said there have been numerous threats and challenges at the beaches which have to be permanently addressed. He said the move will also prevent theft of fish by foreign fishermen and guard illegal commodities against being sneaked in through the sea. He added that all harvested fish will be offloaded at the known landing sites so that the government can inspect and make records. “By doing the counting the ministry will be able to determine if the fishing industry is experiencing a loss or a positive output,” he said.
