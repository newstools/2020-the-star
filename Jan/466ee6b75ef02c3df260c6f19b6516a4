The family of Athman Mohamed, a small-scale fish trader,Â  has urged the government to help find him after he allegedly was kidnapped. Mohamed, 44, the father of five, he disappeared on Thursday last week in Mombasa. He was returning from Qubaa Mosque in Majengo from prayers at 7.45pm when he was allegedly approached by four armed assailants. His family said he was dragged into a double-cabin truck. "My brother was kidnapped on his way from the mosque. According to information we got from the witness, when my brother got out of the mosque, on arrival at Super Loaf shop, four armed men dragged him into the car," his brother Rizaq Mohammed said. His wife, Mariam Ali, described him as a humble person who has never committed any crime. "I am praying for my husband to come back alive. He did not commit any crime and he has never argued with anyone. He was a kind-hearted person," she said. Edited by R.Wamochie
