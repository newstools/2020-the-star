If elderly people are neglected or ill-treated, they can curse you. That's what former Kitui Trade chief officer Gladys Kivoto said on Tuesday when she threw a party for 800 people aged 80 and above. They partied at her Muthue village home in Kitui South with her husband Michael Kivoto. “The elderly in our society have the power to bless if they are treated well. However, they can curse future generations if they are neglected or are ill-treated," Kivoto said. Those who neglect the elderly do so at their peril, she warned Taking care of the elderly amounts to service to God, she said. Since 2016, Kivoto has been hosting the elderly on New Year's Eve since 2016. She not only serves generals meals but also gives them clothing and food. During the festive season, it's essential to include the elderly in celebrations, she said. “It is important to always ensure they also feel appreciated during the annual celebration for Christmas and the ushering in of the new year. They too should enjoy festivities." Edited by R.Wamochie
