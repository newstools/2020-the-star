Riara University Scarlets have beefed up their squad ahead of their Premier League debut this year. Riara coach Shem Otieno yesterday said he is aware of the task ahead but exuded confidence that they are ready for the season. “I already have five players in my team and I am still chasing more. I want to put together a formidable side that will not be pushovers,” he said. The tactician added: “I want to make the play offs in only our first year at the top. This will be a big step forward.” Otieno, who guided Riara to the Nairobi Basketball Association (NBA) provincial title in 2018, said he will take one game at a time. “Taking a team from the lower tier to the top in just one year is no mean achievement and I will continue scaling new heights,” he observed. He said Caroline Njeri who was key in the team’s promotion but left for Africa Nazarene University (ANU) last year is back. “Caro is back at Riara. The experience she gained playing for ANU in the Premier League last year will be valuable to us,” noted Otieno. Njeri has been joined by her team-mate Ayoma Atieno at ANU while Stacey Ongwae has also moved in from Eldonets. Otieno also revealed that he has lured Maureen Nyanganyi and Shantal Kiyobe from Buruburu Girls to the team. “The Premier League is tough but we will take one game at a time. We have no pressure and moreover, we have nothing to lose,” he said.
