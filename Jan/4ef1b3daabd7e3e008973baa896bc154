The High Court has declined to issue orders stopping the Nairobi county assembly from vetting Anne Mwenda for the position of deputy governor. Justice Mumbi Ngugi directed that Sonko and the assembly file their responses in the case ahead of next mentioning on February 17. In the suit papers, Peter Agoro says the nomination of Mwenda amounts to a direct affront to the orders issued against Governor Mike Sonko. In December last year, Anti-Corruption Court magistrate Douglas Ogoti barred Sonko from accessing county offices unless accompanied by an investigating officer or any other authorised person. The court, while laying out his bail terms, also barred Sonko from approaching any witnesses. The orders came after the county chief denied charges of money laundering and unlawful acquisition of public property at City Hall amounting to Sh357 million. Agoro says the nomination of Mwenda poses a real likelihood of interfering with prosecution witnesses as she is under the direct control of Sonko. “Sonko after being charged was ordered not to go to the office or interfere with witnesses which order was given to ensure that the integrity of the prosecution process is insulated from any interference,” Agoro says. Also sought in the case is an order stopping Sonko from nominating any other person for the position of the deputy governor until the conclusion of the criminal case he is facing. Sonko nominated Mwenda for the position of the DG in a letter dated January 6. The letter has already been forwarded to the office of the speaker of the county assembly for the purposes of vetting Mwenda. Agoro says the timing of the nomination of Mwenda for the position of the DG is an act of self-preservation by Sonko and goes against the public interest in the fight against corruption as it’s aimed at defeating the cause of justice in the corruption case he is facing.
