 President Uhuru Kenyatta on Tuesday plucked Nadia Ahmed Abdalla from her PR practice and made her Chief Administrative Secretary in the ICT ministry. Nadia was a familiar face on local screens during the Miss President reality TV show last year. She was the Mombasa representative in the show that brought together women from 47 counties. The 28-year-old and firstborn was the only appointee from the Coast region. She holds a master's degree in international relations and cultural affairs from a German university. She is a specialist in global communication, lifestyle and inspirational blogging. “My father was hesitant to accept that I want to do vlogging and blogging. It took almost a month and doing videos dedicating them to him for him to come to terms with it,” she said. “Last night, he asked me to promise him that I was going to deliver and perform. I am going to perform to make my family and people who believed in me proud,” she added.
