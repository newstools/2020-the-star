Gem MP Elisha Odhiambo has urged DP William Ruto to stop using sideshows to engage the President on the BBI report. He said Ruto should resign and end his political association with President Uhuru Kenyatta if he feels uncomfortable with the BBI report. Odhiambo said the report is a product of the handshake which has ensured peace across the country. The lawmaker accused Tantanga politicians of undermining development and the unity of the nation and urged the President to be firm in his decision. "It's now time for the President to use [Kiharu MP Ndindi] Nyoro's sentiments on the Tangatanga team just like they wished the phrase to be used against ODM during a peaceful demonstration," Odhiambo said. The Gem MP said all the sideshows being displayed by the DP will not help the county to develop. The country needs peace and enterprise development, he said.Â "I want to ask DP Ruto to support his boss on development." The MP said one individual cannot hinder the entire country with more than 45 million people from embrace unity because of his selfish gain. "Youths have no employment and the BBI report that the DP is against provides a fertile ground for enterprise for youths as they will be given a tax-free, eight-year window in their businesses," Odhiambo said. He also asked Siaya leaders, including those who lost in the last election, to come together and drive the agenda of development for the benefit of residents. "When the time for politics comes, we will deal with it as everyone will be voted for based on his or her brand name."
