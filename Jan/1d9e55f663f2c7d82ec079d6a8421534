Mt Kenya MPs allied to Deputy President William Ruto said on Friday the "noise" they have been making prompted President Uhuru Kenyatta make wide-ranging reforms to help farmers. Led by Mathira MP Rigathi Gachagua, the legislators welcome the raft of measures announced by the President on Monday, saying they will fix farmers' problems in the region. "Those people who have been saying we are disrespectful — the Kieleweke and others — the President himself admitted there was a problem and he has moved to fix it," he said.  The leaders said the economy of the region was fast collapsing and praised the President's "bold actions" to revive farmer's hopes. "Had we not raised these issues, probably they would have not been addressed. Those people around the President are misguided. We will not keep quiet. We will continue making noise. The end justifies the means. We will not stop there," he said. They said they will continue pushing government officials to implement the President's directives.  The MP said they will continue preparing themselves for 2022, saying politics is their business. The President made changes in his Cabinet on Monday, kicking out former Agriculture CS Mwangi Kiunjuri and replacing him with Peter Munya, who is the immediate former Trade CS. (Edited by V. Graham)
