The suspension of 17 students who refused to sit an examination on Saturday at Kabianga High School citing their Adventist belief has been revoked. Kericho Education director Zachary Mutwiri said on Wednesday that the suspension "was contrary to the Constitution, the supreme law of the country." The learners were sent home on Monday after refusing to sit the exam on Saturday. Atheists in Kenya Society boss on Tuesday wrote to the school principal giving him seven days to revoke the suspension lest they take legal action. Through its president Harrison Mumia, the society said it was unfair to punish the boys for observing and respecting their culture of worship in line with SDA Church doctrines. “We have learnt of the suspension of 17 Form 4 students who were adherent to Seventh Day Adventist of Kabianga Boys High School who have been suspended after they refused to sit their exams on Sabbath,” the letter reads. The 2010 Constitution spells that every person has the right to freedom of conscience, religion, thought, belief and opinion. "The constitutional allows freedom of worship. Even the Education Act recognises the fact that each and every student must be allowed a day for worship and it must be respected," he said. In 2013, the church lost a petition seeking to stop Saturday classes. High Court judge Isaac Lenaola dismissed the case noting it would be a bad precedent should SDA students be exempted from attending classes. However, the church through lawyer Jackson Awele appealed the judgment and a three-judge bench later ruled in Adventist' favour in 2017. Edited by R.Wamochie
