The University of Nairobi Council has announced the appointment of Prof. Stephen Gitahi Kiama as the varsity's new Vice-Chancellor for a period of five-year term. Kiama will replace the outgoing Peter Mbithi whose term came to an end last year. He will also take over from Isaac Mbeche who has been discharging the duties of the office of the Vice-Chancellor in the acting capacity. The new VC had served the varsity before as the Deputy Vice-Chancellor in charge of Human Resource and Administration. His term will start on January 6, 2020. The University of Nairobi Council chairperson Professor Julia Ojiambo has congratulated Kiama for the appointment and has called upon the university fraternity to support him. The recruitment process was carried out at the Public Service Commission before the university council. The Public Service Commission had shortlisted eight out of the 14 shortlisted candidates for the post. The candidates included the acting Vice-Chancellor Isaac Meroka Mbeche, Bernard Njoroge, Madara Ogot, Patricia Kameri, Kareithi Ruth, Solomon Shibairo and Elija Omwenga. The University Council had rejected Mbithi's bid for a direct appointment for a second term. The council, chaired by Julia Ojiambo, urged Mbithi to go on leave effective July 6 as the recruitment process gets started.
