The DJ Fraternity of Kenya has warned Embakasi East MP Babu Owino from putting any blame on the B club DJ he shot on Friday morning. Through a statement to the press, the organisation said the victim is a humble hardworking and jovial individual who could not have done anything to provoke Owino. "We want to refute any attempt to change the narrative to portray DJ Evolve as the aggressor, going by the claims on Hon Babu Owino's social media pages,"  read part of the statement. "We as the DJ fraternity strongly condemn the attack against one of our own that was meted in a most brutal and despicable way," the NGO said. The statement further read that his act is a tantamount attempt of murder against an unarmed and innocent hardworking Kenyan by an ostentatious youth leader who cast shame to the current leaders. The organisation has vowed to keenly  follow up on the case to ensure Babu Owino is charged. On Friday, a CCTV footage from B-Club showed Babu Owino drawing his gun and shooting a man in Kilimani. Babu was arrested over the incident and was held at the Kilimani police station. The MP, wearing an orange T-shirt is captured brandishing his gun before shooting the man who was standing next to him. According to the CCTV footage shared by K24 on Twitter, the gun shot made those around Babu to run helter skelter as others looked by. The footage also showed Babu smoking shisha before and after shooting the man. Two men are then seen dragging the man outside the facility in the incident that happened at around 7.16 am.
