Kenyan star Tanasha Donna has explained why she postponed the launch of her EP DonnaTella. She was advised it would not win any awards in 2020 if launched in 2019. The launch was to go down at a popular restaurant in Nairobi and press invites had already been sent out when the postponement was announced. The event was to take place on December 12. The singer has said the EP will officially be launched in January 202o. She told The Times TV, “Expect it in January 2020. I was supposed to release in December but I got advice that if I released it in 2019 it won’t win awards because it won’t count as a 2020  project. That’s why I pushed it.” The project will be carried out in Kenya and Tanzania. A source told Word Is that Diamond Platnumz and WCB crew will be among the performers at the launch.
