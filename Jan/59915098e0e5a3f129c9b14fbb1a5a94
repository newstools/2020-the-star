Chief Justice David Maraga has vented out his frustrations to President Uhuru Kenyatta over the Judiciary's budget cuts. Maraga said all they need is facilitation and they would do their best. "Last year, we had abrupt budget cuts. I made calls and the calls were not responded to. We live in this country and we understand. Even if there will be budget cuts, at least consult with us. Our major problem is finances. We have huge case backlogs,‚Äù he added. The CJ spoke on Thursday at the Supreme court during the official release of the State of the Judiciary and Administrative of Justice Report. "We are not asking for too much money. Let us be considered as an arm of government. We cannot get to a quarter of ministries such as Health and Education," he said. Maraga pleaded for a 2.5 per cent or even 1.5 per cent of the funds. "Give us a percentage like 2.5 per cent with even 1.5 per cent and we will be able to work smoothly for Kenya," he said in the presence of President Uhuru Kenyatta. The Chief Justice said the Nairobi Land and Environment Courts is booked until March 2021 adding that 17,833 cases are still pending amid acute staffing gap. "Through mediation, we heard cases and released Sh7.2 billion to the economy that was stuck in litigation," he said. Two months ago, Treasury CS Ukur Yatani moved to slash the Judiciary's budget by Sh2.9 billion in supplementary estimates tabled in Parliament. The Judicial Service Commission also suffered funding cuts amounting to Sh136 million in deductions which Yattani grounded on the need to free more money for the Big Four projects. In the cuts, the Treasury has reduced recurrent expenses by Sh5.6 billion.
