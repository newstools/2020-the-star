Kenya Hockey Union has announced a change in timings for Premier League matches next season. As opposed to last season where majority of the matches were played at 4 pm and 6 pm in the evening on Saturdays, the matches now be at 2 pm and 4pm. On Sundays, the last match will be played at 3 pm, two hours earlier than in last seasons set up. Masters League, whose inaugural season saw five teams participate will be played late on Sundays. Match and fixture deputy secretary Moses Majiwa said the move was necessitated for purposes of media coverage and to enhance competition. The devolved National Men's League will be played on a home and away basis. Previously, it was just one-legged. The decision to devolve the lowest tier was to decongest the City Park Stadium and to incorporate county associations into running the sport. Majiwa said: "The changes will go along in publicising the sport as we aim to restructure the league in general. In 2018 we focused on the Premier League, this year it was the Super League and next year, the Veterans League will be a big hit for sure." "More Masters teams will join as we plan for an international Masters tournament in Easter." Majiwa further confirmed that Nairobi Chapel are certain of fielding a team to the men's national league next season while there is 50-50 chance for the same outfit to have participants in the women's Super League. He left the door open for more team to join the league."Any team is welcome to the league. Daystar withdrew last season because of lack of funds and if they decide to return it would be for the good of the league." The promotion/relegation criteria will be reviewed depending on the number of teams joining the league but due diligence will be done in any scenario. Women's side Kenyatta University are yet to know their fate having finished second last in the Premier League.
