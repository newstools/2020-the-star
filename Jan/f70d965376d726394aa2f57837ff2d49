Bomet Governor Hillary Barchok has warned county employees engaging in politics while on duty that they will be fired. He told a staff meeting on Tuesday that he was well aware of individuals engaging in petty politics on social media platforms "at the expense of service to their people". “Let this year be a year of service delivery to the residents … if we're silent, don't think it means we don't' hear or see what is going on on the social media,” he said. “I am not going to tolerate that, I will make sure  you are removed from the system the moment I find you doing politics instead of serving the people.” Reading the riot act to the staff, the county chief further warned officers in charge of departments against engaging in business with the government, saying it was a conflict of interest. Barchok said anyone who wants to do business with the county should first quit, saying civil servants found using proxy companies to procure services will be punished. “I will not take it kindly… Civil servants should not do business with the government. Remember, you are not my employees but employees of the county government and therefore what you are doing is to serve the people," the visibly angry governor said.  The governor told chief officers and the county executives to minimise out-of-county seminars to reduce funds that could be spent on improving roads and health services. He said t is not necessary to leave the county to write special reports, saying the money saved on travel could be spent on services to the public. On absenteeism, the governor put on notice the officers who on regularly abscond duty, saying he will soon expunge them from the payroll. “My team is now analysing who has not been there so we get to know you. If at the end of the month you find nothing in your account, know that I have taken action. Let no one find my other side which I normally do not like to show,” Barchok said. (Edited by V. Graham)
