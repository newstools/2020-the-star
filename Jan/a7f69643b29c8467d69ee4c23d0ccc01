Deputy President William Ruto's allies are scheming new political strategies to counter the wave being created by the BBI ahead of the 2022 polls. At the same time, Cheranganyi MP Joshua Kuttuny along with Kanu leaders led by Secretary General Nick Salat are among those lined up to play a key role in the pro-BBI rallies in Rift Valley. They will host ODM chief Raila Odinga and other leaders at a major BBI rally in Eldoret scheduled for February 16. Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi said Ruto and his team have their own new political plans which they will launch soon because of the problems he is facing within Jubilee. Sudi said although they fully support the recent changes made by President Uhuru Kenyatta in government, no one should underrate Ruto and think he has no plans. His allies will not be intimidated or forced to abandon him come what may, the MP said. “Everyone knows we have some problems in Jubilee and the source of those problems is well known. I want to tell those who are causing these problems not to think Ruto and those who support him are fools,” Sudi said. He said time was coming when Ruto and his allies would move to announce to Kenyans their next course of action considering the problems in the party. Sources say Ruto's allies have two options including quitting Jubilee or taking over the party during the scheduled March party elections. Sudi, who spoke at Ngeria in his constituency, did not, however, go into the details of their new plans but sources said the DP's allies have been meeting frequently to scheme afresh in the wake of ongoing pro-BBI rallies led by Raila's team. The allies fear the BBI campaigns will wipe out the political gains the DP had made in some areas like Western. Sudi said they were not angered by the recent changes made by Uhuru in government in which Mwangi Kiunjuri was axed from the Agriculture ministry. Kiunjuri is a close ally of the DP.
