Kenya Lionesses will grace the Langford Sevens slated for May in Canada as part of their preparations for the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games. The event is one of the eight legs of the women's World Sevens Series. The Lionesses received the invite from World Rugby as it is going to play a huge role in their preparation for the Olympic Games. The Lionesses were runners-up in the Africa Women 7s tournament but they earned their Olympics slot for the second time running following the withdrawal of South Africa from the Olympics. The Lionesses are scheduled to play at the World Seven Series qualifier in April in Hong Kong where the winner qualifies for the World Series next season. Kenya have also been invited to play in the Malaysia Sevens in late March as preparations for the qualifier. Head coach Felix Oloo was delighted with the invite for the Langford show since Lionesses will test their skills against powerhouses New Zealand, Australia, Canada, USA and England. "It's a step in the right direction. When we play the core teams, it helps us raise our game and as well show us where we are in our preparations for the Olympics,” said Oloo The team started training three weeks ago and Oloo said competition for places will be intense for the qualifier in Hong Kong and tournament in Langford. "We have a large pool of players to choose from and all the players have stepped up so we will see who will make the squad,” added Oloo.
