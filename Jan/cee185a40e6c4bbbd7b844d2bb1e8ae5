The Ministry of Interior will not rest easy until operations at the Immigration Department and the Civil Registration Bureau flow seamlessly, CS Fred Matiang'i has said. During his visit to the two departments on Wednesday, Matiang'i sought to make certain that the reforms initiated in the delivery of citizen services towards the end of last year were bearing fruits. "So far, our efforts have yielded a significant improvement in the processing time of passports, birth certificates, and death certificates. We aim to improve and synchronize our processes to achieve full automation. This will hasten the production process," he said. He also interacted with service-seekers at the two facilities and listened first-hand to their compliments, complaints and suggestions, which he undertook to factor into the ongoing capacity adjustment measures to ensure first-class service delivery. Integrity among members of staff, installation of efficient hardware and software, and refurbishment of office infrastructure are among the reforms being pursued. The CS advised members of the public to consider seeking citizen services from other offices and field registries, including Huduma Centres, since the government has decentralized the provision of citizen services to ease the pressure from the Headquarters in Nairobi.
