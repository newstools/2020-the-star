Muthaiga Golf Club’s Greg Snow returned a round score of par, 72, to keep his top spot at the Sigona Golf Club Safari Tour leaderboard, on a gross score of 2-under par, 142, heading into the penultimate round. Snow, who started the round as joint leader, alongside Thika Golf Club’s Simon Ngige, went about his round cautiously owing to the windy conditions, dropping three shots; at the seventh, eighth and 17th, while hitting birdies at the fifth, ninth and 15th for a round score of par. Snow sits one shot ahead of Zimbabwe’s Robson Chinhoi, who also returned a score of par, to take his total to 1-under par, 143. Meanwhile, Ngige returned a score of 2-over par, 74 to see him drop to third on a gross score of par, 144. The day’s leading score came from home pro Sujan Shah, who carded a round of 2-under par, 70, courtesy of three birdies, that came in quick succession at the 11th, 12th and 13th coupled with one dropped shot, at the fourth, to see him climb to ninth. Another home player, Professional Golfers of Kenya captain, CJ Wangai, returned a round score of 1-under, 71, to ascend to T11, on a gross score of 5-over par, 149. The other big mover after the round two was hard-hitting Dismas Indiza, who returned a 1-under par score, to land at fifth place, on 2-under, 146. A total of 21 golfers including one amateur, made the cut, which was set at 8-over par and will consequently play in the third and fourth rounds. Jacob Okello, Alfred Nandwa, Nelson Mudanyi and Kennedy Abuto are among those who missed out. Round three tees off at 8am today, with the field now focused on a stake of the prize money and Road to 2020 Magical Kenya Open points.
