A legislator has blamed Kenya's economic stagnation on dysfunctional resources allocation. Kenya, Busia Woman Representative Florence Mutua said at the weekend, has adequate resources which it can use to enjoy fast economic development. However, this can only happen when leaders proactively address resources allocation, she said. Mutua said rapid growth cannot be achieved if some regions continue receiving more resources than others. She called on leaders to put political differences aside after elections and collectively serve the electorate irrespective of their voting patterns. “We have enough resources as a country to attain high rates of growth if the resources are equitably distributed,” she said. The second term woman rep spoke during the thanksgiving day of Kakoli Primary School in Teso North. The occasion was an appreciation of the good performance in last year's KCPE examination. Mutua called for leaders' appreciation of the underprivileged especially children who perform well academically but whose parents are unable to raise school fees. The greatest way to appreciate such children is for leaders to support their education, she added. Teso North director of Education Naftali Ombati asked parents to invest in their children’s studies. The function was also attended by the chairman of Kenya Primary School Heads Association Teso North Jared Olubayi, Malaba North Ward MCA Patrick Omanyala and local Kenya National Union of Teachers assistant executive secretary Olunga Ekweny.
