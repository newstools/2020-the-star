 Samburu residents and their leaders have resolved to support the BBI, saying it will unite communities and end insecurity. The decision follows a sensitisation meeting held at Allamano Hall in Maralal town on Saturday. More than 600 people attended. The residents said the report should be amended to include the interests of the region including fighting insecurity and improving livestock farming. Samburu West MP Naisula Lesuuda proposed that ways of dealing with insecurity resulting from cattle rustling be captured in the BBI report. “Security has been categorised but we have realised that cattle rustling which is our main challenge has not been captured in the BBI report yet we would also like to have solutions to the problem,” Lesuuda said. She proposed that ways of enhancing livestock keeping to make it beneficial to farmers be included in the BBI report. “We are not satisfied on how livestock which is our main economic pillar has been captured in the report. We want livestock to be considered just like how tea, milk and maize are being looked into in Kenya,” Lesuuda said. Daniel Lemarkat said youth representation in elective offices has been overlooked in the BBI report. “This BBI is only looking at women because they have said that if a governor is a man his deputy should be a woman and if a woman is the governor her deputy should be a man. As youth, we have been left out. We need the BBI to be amended to have an elective position for youth just like there is a Woman Rep seat for women,” Lemarkat said.
