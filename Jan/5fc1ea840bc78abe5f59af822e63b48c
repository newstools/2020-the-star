Struggling Kenya Premier League outfit Nzoia FC are up in arms over poor management of fixtures by KPL. The club maintains that KPL are to blame for the walkover dished to Bandari last month and their dismal run in the league. The Sugar millers, who are currently a place above the red line with ten points, argue that the move by KPL to plan three fixtures for them within a space of seven days was done in bad faith.  The Collins Omondi -coached club said the decision to congest fixtures for them had hit them hard financially. Nzoia were forced to play three matches in a span of a week including a long trip to Mombasa. They returned home to host Chemelil before hitting the road again for the match against Sofapaka in Nairobi. He said this move worked against their budget and were left with no option but to give free points. “KPL should be fair . You can imagine we are being made to play in Mombasa against Bandari then travel back to Sudi in Bungoma to host Chemelil before hitting the road again for our Sofapaka match. This is quite uneconomical and not good for our players’ fitness," he added. "We should have played in Mombasa then Nairobi as we proceed back home. This has left us wondering if KPL is ready to serve us well and take the league to the next level,” lamented Mokua. He added: “Our match against Mathare was also postponed at the eleventh hour without our knowledge. I wonder how difficult it is to consult the teams before making any changes on the fixtures. This is unprofessional. KPL was supposed to call both parties and explain reasons behind the postponement,” said Mokua. Meanwhile, Mokua believes  Nzoia will not be in a position to compete with the best teams in the country for the titles, owing to their meagre finances.
