Gatundu MP Moses Kuria has been arrested for allegedly assaulting a woman at the Royal Media Services premises. The MP was taken to Kilimani police station on Friday. Joyce Wanja said she was assaulted on December 8 last year at the RMS premises during a show she and the MP were invited to to discuss BBI. Speaking to Wanjiku TV, Wanja said the MP attacked her when she confronted him over his remarks during a fundraiser for orphans in Kiambu. "I told him he was talking about matters which were irrelevant to the event at hand and more so, inappropriate for children and faithful," she said. Wanja accused Kuria of abusing women in Kiambu during the event by allegedly commenting about their underwear. She said she hit back at the MP and her comments irked Kuria, making him rise up from his seat and beat her on her left arm. She said she fell to the ground and had to be helped get up by people around. Wanja said she recorded a statement on December 10 last year, as did four witnesses. More follows
