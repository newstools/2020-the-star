Anti-terrorism police want to detain two people for 10 days over surveillance on a GSU company for purposes of a terrorist attack. James Mburu Ikaba and Miriam Njoki will be detained for 10 days if the prosecution is granted its request pending investigations by the Anti-Terrorism Police Unit. “The respondents are being investigated for several terrorism-related offences, which include the collection of information contrary to the Anti-Terrorism Act 2012,” according to the court papers. The two were arrested on January 4 at the GSU Recce Company in Ruiru and the reason for their arrest duly explained to them. The suspects were in a Land Cruiser parked outside the GSU Recce Company. They were allegedly taking photos of the premises and upon intervention by the GSU officers on duty they sped off. “The GSU officers tried to stop the respondents but they refused to stop prompting the officers to shoot and deflate a left rear tyre of their motor vehicle," the prosecution said. Ikaba is said to have been the driver and suspected owner of the motor vehicle while Njoki was a passenger. A quick search of the motor vehicle came up with seven rounds of 9mm ammunition. At Ikaba’s house in Marurui Estate, Kiambu, the officers recovered several items including a pistol, a shotgun and 45 bullets. Milimani senior principal magistrate Kennedy Cheruiyot will today decide whether to grant the prosecution its request or conditionally free the suspects. The defence had objected the application to detain the two claiming that Ikaba is a licensed firearm owner. Further, the court heard that the suspects had already spent two days in custody. “I have noted that a gun and ammunition were recovered from the suspects and what transpired on the material day. The suspects should remain in custody at any police station in Kenya pending my ruling tomorrow morning (Tuesday),”  Cheruiyot ruled.
