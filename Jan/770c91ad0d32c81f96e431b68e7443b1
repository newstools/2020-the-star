The newly posted Lamu county police commander Issa Mohamud has been recalled and transferred less than a week after he reported to his duty post. He reported to work on January 19 and was transferred on January 25. It is not clear where he was moved to. His place has since been taken by Moses Murithi, who has been brought in from the General Service Unit headquarters in Nairobi. Mohamud was to replace Muchangi Kioi, who was transferred this month after serving in that capacity since 2017. The sudden transfer of the new police boss has been confirmed by Lamu county commissioner Irungu Macharia who said his replacement has reported to his new office. Macharia said the sudden transfer of the police boss was a "routine decision" taken by the National Police Service Commission. “It is true the newly posted county police commander Issa Mohamud has been recalled and moved to serve elsewhere. He has been replaced by Moses Murithi. People shouldn’t speculate much because it’s a normal decision by the employer. If an employer asks you to go somewhere, you do just that,” he said. Lamu elders, activists and religious leaders now want the NPSC to explain why it replaced the new police boss even before he got the chance to serve. Lamu Council of Elders deputy chairperson Mohamed Mbwana said the decision raises more questions than answers and they want to understand why the commission transferred Mohamud in the first place. “We had just met him, and we were looking forward to working with him. Then we were told he had been moved. He wasn’t even a week old since he reported. There is more to this, and we want to know,” Mbwana said. Muslims for Human Rights Lamu officer Habib Ali said the community is predominantly Muslim and Mohamud would have been the first Muslim county police commander. “We don’t want the new replacement, we just want them to bring back Mohamud unless of course there are better and truthful reasons why they had to move him,” he said.
