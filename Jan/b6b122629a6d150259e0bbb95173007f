Public university lecturers on Friday said they will proceed on strike in February to protest against a delayed pay deal. University Academic Staff Union secretary general Constantine Wasonga said they will give a two-week strike notice on February 4. In contention is the delayed implementation of the five-year collective bargaining agreement 2017-2021. Unless there is an eleventh-hour resolution, Uasu members at the 35 public universities will paralyse studies and affect some 1 million students. Wasonga said the government could have altered the original document agreed upon, leaving out crucial clauses. "At the moment we have asked our university chapters to mobilise their members to be ready for the strike," he said. UASU represents at least 9,000 lecturers. In the deal, academic staff were to get a 5.4 per cent increase on their basic salary and an extra Sh1.8 billion to cover their pension. The deal was signed on October 28 and implementation was to begin on November 30, Wasonga said. The CBA covers five years from 2017, meaning the lecturers are left with only 18 months before its expiry. Wasonga was addressing the media after a meeting with the National Executive Council, the union's supreme authority. The strike notice comes as universities struggle to balance their finances against a backdrop of funding uncertainty. On Monday, Education Cabinet Secretary George Magoha warned lecturers that the government will not negotiate with them if they go on strike next week. Edited by Josephine M. Mayuya
