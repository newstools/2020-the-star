A trailer driver and a pedestrian on Tuesday were killed in separate accidents in Naivasha. Four other people were seriously injured and were admitted at Kijabe Mission Hospital. In the first accident, a motorist died on the spot when a canter rammed into his trailer along Naivasha-Mai Mahiu road, near Governor’s Camp. His passenger's limbs were fractured. Witness Felix Mwangi said three occupants of the canter, including a child, were seriously injured and rushed to Mai Mahiu Health Centre. Mwangi said the driver of the canter was overtaking a number of vehicles when he hit the oncoming trailer. “The accident happened very fast, with the driver of the trailer dying on the spot while four other people were seriously injured,” he said. In the same morning, an unidentified pedestrian was hit and killed by a motorist along Moi South Lake Road in Naivasha. The driver, who was evading a pothole, fled. His victim was confirmed dead on arrival at Naivasha Subcounty Hospital. “The man does not have any identification documents and was walking along the dilapidated road when the accident occurred,” witness Abel Mwangi said. Naivasha police boss Samuel Waweru confirmed both incidents accidents and said the bodies had been taken to the area mortuary. In yet another accident, tens of residents of Kikopey, Gilgil, carted away bags of millet after a trailer crashed on the Nairobi-Nakuru highway, spilling its cargo. Police, however, moved in to contain the situation. Witness Alfred Kanji said the driver of the lorry, headed for Juba in South Sudan, lost control while going downhill before crashing on the roadside. “The driver and his conductor escaped unhurt but residents managed to steal nearly all the millet," he said.
