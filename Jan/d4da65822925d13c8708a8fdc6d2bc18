Kenya and Nigeria are among countries where people have great faith in US President Donald Trump,Â  a new poll has shown. The poll by the Pew Research Centre aimed at finding out what the world thinks about Trump. According to the research, some 65% of Kenyans surveyed have faith in the US leader, with the rating dipping slightly to 58% among Nigerians polled. This is despite Trump's past missteps - including reportedly calling African states "shit-hole countries". The two African countries were among 33 others polled outside the US between May and October 2019. Pew also notes that sub-Saharan African nations have typically expressed favorable opinions of the US. Kenya and Nigeria are both among the top recipients of US economic aid, according to the Washington-based Security Assistance Monitor. Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari was the first sub-Saharan African leader invited to the White House in 2018. The Trump administration also sold 12 US military aircraft to Nigeria in a reversal of an Obama-era policy. President Uhuru on his hand first met with Trump in 2017 during the G7 Summit in Italy. Photos of Uhuru meeting Trump caused abuzz on social media. The two were photographed shaking hands before the performance by the La Scala Philharmonic Orchestra in the ancient Greek theatre as part of the G7 Summit. Uhuru later left Kenya in August last year where he officially met with Trump at the White House. During the visit to the US, Uhuru visited the White House at the invitation of the Trump with whom they held talks on a wide array of subjects among them trade and regional security.
