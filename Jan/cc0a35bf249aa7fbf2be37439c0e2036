Three people were yesterday charged in a Milimani court with conspiring to steal Sh35 million from Faulu Bank. Isaiah Njuguna, Ken Wairimu and Dorcas Wanjugu are said to have conspired to steal Sh35,293,244 between October 26, 2018 and December 24, 2019 at an unknown place with others at large. In a different count, the trio is charged with stealing Sh25 million at Faulu Microfinance Bank OTC branch in Nairobi on June 29,2019. The suspects appeared before magistrate Nzibe Muthoni. They denied all the charges preferred against them and sought lenient cash bail and bond terms. Through their lawyers, the accused persons indicated that they were poor and could not afford huge amounts of money for bail. Nzibe released the accused persons on a Sh10 million bond with one surety of a similar amount or a Sh5 million cash bail. The case will be mentioned on February 24.
