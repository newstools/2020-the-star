Tanzanian singer Harmonize will be releasing his album 'Afro East' this year. "I'm bringing all my friends. Trust me this is AfroEast Album. I'm Ready 2020," he announced on social media. This is after he left Diamond Platnumz's record label WCB over irreconcilable differences. Since then, Harmonize has released solo projects, among them 'Uno', 'Kushoto Kulia' and 'Hamnistui'.
