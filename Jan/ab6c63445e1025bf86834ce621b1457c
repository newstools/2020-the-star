THE Muhoroni National Government Constituency Development Fund has allocated Sh12 million for secondary students' bursaries. An additional Sh4 million has also been set aside for 79 university students undertaking architecture, medicine, law and engineering courses. MP Onyango Koyoo said 224 students including 50 selected to Join Form 1 have benefited under the school bursary scheme started in 2014. Koyoo said 50 students who scored 400 marks and were admitted to national schools will have their school fees fully paid by CDF. He spoke during the annual education retreat for national secondary schools and university students sponsored by the NGCDF at Chemelil Academy on Saturday. It was presided over by Education CS George Magoha. The MP said the students must learn in a public school and parents prove they are voters in the constituency for their children to qualify for the bursary. He said his administration has been tracking the performance of the students under the bursary programme. Koyoo, who started the programme, said he will continue paying school fees to the needy students. So far, 292 students have benefited from the scheme for the last six years. “The statistics in the CDF office indicates that most of the sponsored students have joined universities and undertaking various courses." Koyoo said the fund is disbursed in five categories; national schools, special course universities, vulnerable students, college and university and secondary schools. He said  education will remain his legacy when he retires from politics and promised that students who will in university will still be supported. Muhoroni will produce top lawyers, doctors, engineers and other professionals due to the sponsorships he has initiated, the lawmaker said. He said he was pleased with a student who was admitted at a national school after scoring 350 marks in her KCPE exam. She had an A-minus in her KCSE examinations.
