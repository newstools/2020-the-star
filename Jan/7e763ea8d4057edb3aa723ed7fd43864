Five people died on Wednesday morning in a road accident at Kabunyony junction along Poror-Eldama-Ravine road in Baringo county. Eldama-Ravine police boss Rashid Hassan said none of the occupants of the private Nissan Wingroad – three men and two women– survived during the 5.30am crash. “Three died on the spot while two succumbed to injuries on their way to Eldama-Ravine Subcounty Hospital,” Hassan said. He said the driver may have been speeding when he lost control of the vehicle and veered off the road. “It was a sharp corner, so he may have lost control before it plunged into the ditch causing the sudden fatalities,” he said. The police boss said the victims may have been heading home from the New Year celebrations. “We all celebrated the New Year well, but we unfortunately lost our brothers and sisters in a road accident,” he said. Hassan cautioned road users, especially matatu drivers and boda boda riders to be careful and follow traffic rules, especially during this festive season. “When celebrating we should be cautious about our lives because they are more important,” he said. The police boss said three people perished last year at the same blackspot – corner of Kabunyony junction. “Something needs to be done urgently to restructure and repair this dangerous road point to avert more deaths in future,” Hassan said. The damaged vehicle was towed to Eldama Ravine police station while the bodies were taken to Eldama Ravine Hospital mortuary.
