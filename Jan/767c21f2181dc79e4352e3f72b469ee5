A legislator has urged the government to consider increasing the allocation of Presidential Bursary in each constituency. Limuru MP Peter Mwathi said a lot of people still need school fees support, saying CDF bursary has never been enough. Mwathi said the Presidential Bursary covers the whole schools fees for the needy students, saying if the allocation was added, it would reduce cases of bright students missing the schools of their dreams and at times missing joining secondary schools. He spoke during the Wings to Fly beneficiaries flagging off at Limuru Equity Bank branch. He was accompanied by retail manager Joseph Weru, and Limuru TSC officer Ann Benson among other officials. Weru said 97 needy students had applied for the Kitty, but the bank had instructed them to only pick eight most needy students. "We only picked four boys and four girls. It was an instruction. Out of the 97 forms we received, we realised that so many people are in dire need of assistance," Weru added. Mwathi applauded Equity Bank and other institutions which offers such Kitty which covers the whole school fees for a needy student from form one up to form four since they help in reducing poverty. He urged the government to consider allocating more funds to the Presidential Bursary so that many needy students who go noticed get help.
