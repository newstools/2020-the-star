From July 1,2020 , the issuance of Identity Cards, passports, Birth and Death Certificates will be released on the same day. This announcement was made by Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiangi in Mombasa on Wednesday. But Matiangi noted that applications originating from outside Nairobi and abroad will take some days. Matiang'i said Kenyans cannot be allowed to go through hell while seeking for these documents. “We interact with our citizens at their most vulnerable moments and the pain and misery I saw them go through last year is unacceptable in Public Service,” he said. “We cannot be expected to be the provider of solutions yet be deemed to be the greatest source of pain. This must and shall stop! Change in our processes, procedures and attitude cannot be overemphasized.” The CS directed the Principal Secretary responsible for Citizen Services to ensure strict and un-compromised adherence to the Service Charters of government departments. Matiangi also directed County Commissioners to conduct impromptu checks at service centers, report and take action on lack of efficient service delivery. “I shall hold the County Commissioners responsible for in particular, immigration services, registration of persons and issuance of birth and death certificates in their counties,” he said.
