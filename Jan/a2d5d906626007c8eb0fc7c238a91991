Kenyan international midfielder Willis Okeyo has left the door open for a coaching role in the national team. Okeyo is currently contracted by Police as a player and is also doubling up as the United States International University USIU-A Spartans coach. However, his future with the national team remains unclear after he expressed his interest in coaching any of the national teams even though he remains committed to playing for the law enforcers. The much-travelled midfield anchor, who has over 35 caps under his belt, guided the Spartans to a second-place finish last season. "I am not quitting playing. I have not hung my boots at Police. However, I am contemplating my future with the national team. I am still consulting my gods," said the 2017 Premier League title-winning midfielder with the law enforcers. "If my body allows me and the technical bench feel they need my services, I will be glad to join the national team. I can also get other roles." "I think I have coached long enough and have something I can offer in terms of coaching and managing the team. Not necessarily the national team but we have the under-21, the U-18 and even the development side," he observed. Okeyo, who was one of the six Kenyan players to accept the one-month offer to train with German clubs in SeptemberÂ  2019, also wants Police to sign new players if they are to compete for the title this season. Police finished third last season. His sentiments, however, come amidst concerns that the 2018 runners up will not strengthen as coach Patrick Mugambi had earlier indicated. "It is high time Police inject new blood if we are to match teams that have massively recruited. You cannot depend on the players that have been there for years," said Okeyo. "We don't now have quality at Police. I hear we are signing but I don't know who. We need to spice it up with young and experienced players so that we can be able to match the likes of Butali, who have recruited quality players.
