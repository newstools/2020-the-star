National Under 17 team manager Nick Yakhama has decried the pathetic state in which some of the community sports grounds in Kakamega County have been left saying this is killing the industry in the region. The former national team mainstay called upon the county government to rehabilitate the grounds, including Khayega and Solyo, in order to nurture talent among the many gifted youths. Speaking in Sigalagala during the Hon. Farouk Machanje Cup finals, Yakhama questioned how the community playgrounds have been left in a dilapidated state even though the county government has enough resources to salvage the situation. “As we request the county governments to invest in sporting activities I urge and encouraged players to continue working hard and remain focused on their agenda and desist from engaging in immoral activities that can ruin their sporting careers and lives in general,” said Yakhama. Yakhama is the current technical director of Vihiga United, who feature in the National Super League. “I urge our leaders to give the youth priority by heavily investing in sports, a great source of employment,” Yakhama added. Maendeleo Initiative CBO patron Fred Ikana, who graced the finals challenged stakeholders in the sports industry to encourage youths to utilise sports as an alternative source of employment to minimise societal vices. “If we pull together we can make the region a powerhouse making it violence-free by investing in a range of sports and tapping talents for job creation,” Ikana said Harambee Starlets attacker Gentrix Shikangwa scored four goals as Shitochi hammered Shirulu 6-0 one in a one-sided match, while Shitochi B clinched the men's title after edging Shidodo 1-0 in an evenly contested, fast-paced encounter. The winners from both categories received a cash prize of Sh25, 000, a trophy, playing kit and balls from Machanje and Ikana.
