Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen has refuted claims that he is a defender of corruption. Murkomen said he does not defend corruption or corrupt officials but only wants the law to be followed. “I am not against the fight against corruption but what I am against is  the weaponisation of a good cause. We should not fight corruption using corrupt means,” Murkomen said. He was responding to a question by morning presenter Kamene Goro during an interview on KISS FM on Thursday. Murkomen has been in the spotlight for his spirited defence of immediate former Kiambu Governor Ferdinand Waititu during a Senate session to deliberate on his impeachment. In December, he was also accused of representing embattled Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko in his battle against graft charges facing the governor. Murkomen mentioned the defence of Taita Taveta Governor Granton Samboja as evidence that the fight against corruption is subjective. “When it was the case of Samboja, we saw a very spirited or as I would say violent defence of the governor by the other political divide. Why am I not given credit for being the vice-chair of the committee that voted for the impeachment of Governor Wambora,” Murkomen posed. Murkomen added that Kenyans should judge him in a year or so to see that he has been right all along insofar as the fight against corruption is concerned.
