TV presenter Kambua says she did not have a baby shower because her baby came earlier than expected. The mother of one shared a photo revealing that her family and friends threw a party to celebrate her bundle of joy. "This past weekend, my family came together and put up a most precious celebration for my little bub, Nathaniel Muhoro," she wrote. "Last year, a baby shower was planned and it backfired because baby decided to come early! I’ll talk more about this someday. I’ve learned to unpack all my experiences slowly. "He came early, but still right on time. I am eternally grateful for a healthy baby. God’s ways are perfect, and they are good," she said. Kambua welcomed her first child Nathaniel Muhoro late last year, after seven years in marriage.
