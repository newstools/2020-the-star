The government expects 350,000 learners to have been enrolled in technical and vocational training institutions by May 2020. To handle this number of learners, it will employ 5,000 trainers before the end of the year, Technical and Vocational Training PS Kevit Desai told community and stakeholders of Meru National Polytechnic, Ntima West Youth Centre, Karumo Technical and Kaero TTI on Monday. Desai assured the youth that the government is committed to creating a conducive learning environment for them and to equip the institutions for competent training and skill acquisition. “The government is spending every effort to grow enrolment that currently stands at 270,000 learners in TVETs,” he said. The PS said education has no age limit and urged farmers and even those above 50 to join TVETs to enhance their skills on value addition. “Even those aged 50 years can join the institutions to perfect their skills in their areas of specialisation. This promotes technical transfer. The Big Four Agenda is part of TVETs transmission for social and economic growth,” he said. He challenged elected leaders to give bursaries to youths from poor backgrounds. He at the same time urged parents, local communities and stakeholders to build social welfare centres and hostels near institutions to accommodate learners. The PS declined low enrolment in some TVETs citing the Sh160 million Kaelo Technical Training Institute in Igembe North that has only 20 students yet it has a capacity of 2,000 trainees. The Karumo TTI principal Mutembei Kigige said the main challenge in the semi-arid area is lack of accommodation. This, he added, was the reason for poor enrolment.
