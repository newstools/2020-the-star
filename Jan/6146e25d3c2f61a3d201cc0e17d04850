Kiambu MP Jude Njomo has started a drive to ensure Standard 7 and 8 pupils in public primary schools in his constituency get lockers. This is to ensure pupils acquaint themselves with secondary school life. So far, he has distributed lockers to 10 primary schools. There are 20 public primary schools in the constituency. Njomo, through the National Government constituency development fund (NG-CDF), has replaced the desks which have been used over the years and equipped the classrooms with lockers – which are safer to store books. “We are replacing the old desks with lockers so that the pupils can have a feel of what secondary and high schools classrooms looks like,” the MP said on Thursday while donating the lockers to Kiambu Township Primary School in Kiambu town. The legislator said school infrastructure should be improved to create a good learning environment. “The NG-CDF has prioritised schools, and we have renovated all public primary and secondary schools within Kiambu constituency by repainting them, tiling classrooms, reconstructing dilapidated classrooms, installing electricity, Wi-Fi, electronic bells, and building better staffrooms,” Njomo said. A check by the Star confirmed that the Kiambu NG-DCF has indeed rehabilitated the public primary schools. Last year, President Uhuru Kenyatta during a visit to Kiambu hailed Njomo’s efforts to improve schools in the constituency.
