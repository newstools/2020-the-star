The proprietor of a private school in Mukuru kwa Njenga has challenged the decision by the Ministry of Lands to transfer her land to a third party in court. Anne Wesonga, the owner of Young Achievers Primary School, has accused the Chief Lands Registrar and the Registrar of Titles of taking what rightfully belongs to her and giving it to Kware Mukuru kwa Njenga Jua Kali Association. She wants the court to stop all transactions, transfers, leasing, mortgaging, constructing, and subleasing on her property by the ministry. Wesonga argues that she is a beneficiary of a presidential directive issued on January 19, 2015, to the PS Ministry of Lands Housing and Urban Development. She said the ministry was directed to issue title deeds to slum residents to regularise land ownership. She says her late husband acquired the land in 2001 at Kware Mukuru kwa Njenga Jua Kali Association and she has been managing the land since he died. Wesonga says her husband was the true owner of the school. She claims that on August 27 last year, due to threats from the invaders, she reported the matter to the CID in Embakasi. “On or about December 4, 2019, I was granted limited grant of letters of administration, but I was shocked to learn that the Chief Land Registrar and the Registrar of Titles have issued titles to Boniface Muindi, which is fraudulent,” court papers read. “The action by the ministry has attracted invaders on our land who have encroached, damaged and are likely to lease, sublease or sell our property,” she argues. She says that the Chief Land Registrar and the Registrar of Titles acted in breach of the law.
