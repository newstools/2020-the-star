In the boys' category, Ryan Randiek, Derrick Ominde, Wycliff Okenye, and Kennedy Musembi will battle for honours in the three-week event. 29 countries are expected for the event including Madagascar, Congo, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Tunisia, South Africa, Mauritius, Morocco and Egypt. Others are Lithuania, Ireland, Slovenia, Nepal, Serbia, India, USA, Germany, France, Ukraine, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Malta, Great Britain, Belgium, and Switzerland. Okutoyi was bullish about her chances, saying: "I am in good form and am looking forward to the competition as I seek to improve my ranking on the ITF circuit." She expects tough competition owing to the calibre of nations enlisted, insisting that Kenyan players will have to be at their best. "We will face stiff competition but I must say that our play has improved and we will do our best,‚Äù she added
