The government has started aerial spraying of desert locusts that have invaded parts of Meru. Igembe North deputy county commissioner Charles Lang’at said the county disaster monitoring team has elaborate efforts aimed at containing the situation before it gets out of hand. “We have intensified our surveillance and are doing monitoring to contain these swarms of insects. They have now migrated to Igembe Central. Aerial spray is ongoing but early in the morning because experts say they sleep at night and migrate during the day,” Lang’at told the Star on Sunday. The pests had migrated to parts of Garbatulla and Merti subcounties in Isiolo on Wednesday after causing destruction in Wajir, Garissa and Marsabit counties. Igembe North MP Maoka Maore urged the government to intervene and spray the destructive locusts that invaded Kachiuru and Kinolu. He warned that they might cause a food crisis.
