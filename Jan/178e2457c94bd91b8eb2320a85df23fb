Sheil Kotecha and Albert Njogu will play at the Egypt Futures tournament next week. The duo will join Ishamel Changawa and Kevin Cheruiyot who confirmed participation last month. Tennis Kenya shifted training to Mombasa to help the players acclimatise to conditions expected in Asia. "We have been in Mombasa for three weeks and so far, the training has been good. We have worked on several facets of play and the boys are in good shape,” said head coach Rosemary Owino, who was delighted with the move to train in Mombasa. Owino said the upcoming event in Egypt will be ideal preparation for the team. “The Futures event in Egypt will test the players accordingly and it will be good preparation for what to expect in Asia,” added Owino. She said they will take one game at a time against Indonesia. “We know they are a good team and  playing them at home will be an advantage,” she added. The tactician said the Kenya team will play three tournaments in Egypt before heading to Indonesia at the end of February for the encounter. Kenya stormed the Group3 Africa Zone tournament in September after ousting Madagascar 2-0 to qualify as one of the two nations for the Euro/Africa Group Two play-offs. The winner of the Kenya vs Indonesia encounter will go on to compete in World Group II ties in September 2020 alongside losing nations from the World Group I play-offs.
