Budalang'i NG-CDF has allocated Sh70 million for the construction of a new secondary school in Ruambwa, Bunyala North ward. Budalang'i National Government-Constituency Development Fund committee chairman John Omumi told the Star on Saturday that funds have been set aside for buying land for the construction of the proposed school. He spoke after leading a team of NG-CDF committee during the inspection of the site at Nadero village. He said the school will be a great relief to students from Budalang'i constituency, who had been trekking for long distances to seek admission from schools in Siaya county. "The majority of students from Budalang'iÂ  have been seeking admission to schools in Siaya county due to lack of adequate secondary schools in Ruambwa sub-location. That is why Budalang'i NG-CDF committee has earmarked Sh70m for the construction of a new secondary school here," Omumi said. He also said they will also allocate funds for the construction of additional secondary schools in Mudembi and Sisenye sub-locations, and a new primary school at Munani. Omumi was accompanied by constituency deputy manager Omondi Lukuku, Bunyala North ward Bernard chairman Kayamba and NG-CDF committee secretary Jackton Onyango.
