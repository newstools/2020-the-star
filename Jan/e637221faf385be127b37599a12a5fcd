DJ Evolve’s family is requesting your prayers. His condition is not good. Evolve, real name Felix Orinda, was shot on the neck last Friday by Embakasi East MP Babu Owino and is hospitalised at Nairobi Hospital’s ICU wing. The deejay underwent two successful surgeries, where a bullet that was lodged in his neck was removed. In the second surgery, a blood clot was removed from the affected area. He was scheduled for a third surgery on January 20 but it didn’t happen. Mike Lukulu, a close friend of DJ Evolve, wrote on Instagram, "The surgery to realign his upper spine that was scheduled to take place on Monday was put on hold after Felix suddenly developed tracheostomy (trachea) complications." He said surgeons have been forced to perform tracheal surgery before the chiropractic one. "Jesus is at the wheel. All will be well."
