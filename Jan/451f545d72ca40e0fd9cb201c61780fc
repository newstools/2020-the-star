Atletico Madrid’s Portugal forward Joao Felix is likely to miss thos weekend’s derby clash at Real Madrid after being diagnosed with a muscle injury on Wednesday. The 126 million euros ($139.78 million) club-record signing suffered the problem in Sunday’s 0-0 draw with Leganes and did not train ahead of Saturday’s match at the Santiago Bernabeu. “Given the ongoing pain after a rest day, the club’s medical services performed tests to diagnose the injury,” Atletico said in a statement, without saying how long he would be sidelined. The 20-year-old Felix has struggled to make an impact with Atletico as Diego Simeone’s side languish fifth in La Liga, 10 points adrift of leaders Real Madrid after 21 games. Elsewhere, Real Madrid thrashed a depleted Real Zaragoza side 4-0 on Wednesday to reach the Copa del Rey quarter-finals. The second division team made eight changes as they rested players for their clash with leaders Cadiz on Sunday and the 13-times European Cup winners took full advantage. Real moved ahead in the sixth minute when defender Raphael Varane finished from close range after a clever corner routine. Lucas Vazquez doubled Madrid’s advantage with a drive into the top corner after being set up by Toni Kroos. Japanese playmaker Shinji Kagawa caused problems for the illustrious visitors at La Romareda, with Alphonse Areola making a fine save to deny him. Vinicius Jr. struck after 72 minutes with Karim Benzema wrapping up the win from close range for Zinedine Zidane’s rampant side. Third-tier Cultural Leonesa nearly took another scalp after eliminating Atletico Madrid in the previous round, with Valencia needing a 4-2 penalty shootout victory to beat them following a 0-0 draw.
