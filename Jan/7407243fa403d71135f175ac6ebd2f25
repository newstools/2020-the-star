With just under a dozen assists to his name in the National Super League, Anthony Abwao is exactly what the doctors ordered for title-chasing top tier side Tusker. The Migori Youth attacker was the Brewers' first incoming player in the mid-season transfer window as coach Robert Matano bolsters his side for a title fight against domineering league leaders Gor Mahia. "He is the kind of player who will add a new dimension to our squad. If you have seen the number of assists and influence in attack he has had, you will recognise that he has a bright future ahead of him," said a Tusker team official. Abwao, who is now in line to make bis debut away at Chemelil Sugar this weekend will find ample takers of the chances he creates with club leading marksman Timothy Otieno keen to start the new year the way he ended the last, scoring five Kenyan Premier League goals. All season Tusker have looked the team most capable of ending Gor's three-year reign as Kenyan champions. The 2016 winners trail the table-toppers by just one point albeit with a cloud of games in hand. "When the season started we had our objectives and that remains our focus. The club has won the league in the past and that has to be the ambition but as it stands, I am confident that the targets we set at the beginning of the season are still within reach," added the Tusker man. The brewers resumed training earlier this week as they look to hit the ground running when their league fixtures resume this weekend.
