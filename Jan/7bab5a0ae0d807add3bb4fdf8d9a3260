The family of a man who was buried in Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania has sought court orders to have his remains brought to Kenya. A widow of the former boss of the defunct Kenya Sugar Board (KSB) Andrew Otieno,  says he was buried against the family's wishes. Alice Anyango filed the case in a Tanzania court after her husband was buried on Wednesday. Otieno, a chemical engineer who ran the Crest Group of Companies in Tanzania died on January 1 in a hotel room in Arusha. He had gone there on a business trip. He was buried in Dar-es-Salaam where he stayed with his second wife Levina Mukandala, a Tanzanian. The ceremony was boycotted by his Kenyan family members. His brother George Otieno said they were making arrangements to lay him to rest at his home in Ndhiwa, Homa Bay when they learnt that their kin had been buried. Otieno’s family had initially sought to stop the burial but when they got orders, the body had been interred, prompting the new application. Fred Athuok, his lawyer, said a post-mortem was conducted at Mt Meru Hospital in Arusha on January 3. The report showed Otieno died of breathing problems and multiple organ failure. “I am saddened that we have lost one of Kenya’s finest brains in chemical engineering,” Athuok said. Otieno was serving a second term at the sugar board when he was summarily dismissed for gross misconduct in 2008 after EACC investigations into allegation of abuse of office. He was accused of ignoring a directive by the Agriculture PS to stop negotiations on a matter in court involving Genetic Technologies International. The board passed a resolution authorising payment of sums amounting to over Sh142 million. The EACC found that due to his tardiness the firm of Rachier and Amollo taxed their bill without any representation of the respondent under the watch of the claimant. The taxation led to attachment of the KSB assets forcing them to spend over Sh1 million as auctioneer’s fees to salvage them.
