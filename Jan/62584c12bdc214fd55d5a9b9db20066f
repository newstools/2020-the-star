One man's loss is another's gain. That was the case after a truck full of beer rolled over on the busy Westlands roundabout on Sunday, giving several witnesses a chance to take the spoils and make merry. Commuters, hawkers and matatu crew were among the group which rushed to the accident scene to grab “free” beer during a month when many residents are too broke to afford the luxury of alcohol, following the heavy expenditure on the long Christmas festive season. “I was alone and trying to give way to another road user -a private car-after which I lost control of the fully packed truck,” the driver of the truck, who only went by the name Dickson, said. No one was injured. A hawker who chose to remain anonymous said the accident happened on a "good day". "There were not many people and we are wondering why the police have refused to allow us to drink," she said. Police officers were able to secure a few crates of beer once they arrived at the scene. “We don’t have the details of the where the lorry was coming from, taking alcohol or any other details,” the police said.
