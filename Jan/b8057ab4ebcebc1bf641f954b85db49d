ODM party leader Raila Odinga on Sunday 'taught' his wife Ida how to scale a fish. Raila who wore a black apron was seen scaling a huge fish accompanied by his wife who was also busy doing the same. The two seemed to be in some kind of competition to see who has done the better job. Raila who is also the AU envoy was seen holding the tail of the fish as he used the knife to scale it as Ida appeared busy doing the same on her end. They were accompanied by two friends who were helping them during the scaling. "Ida thinks she was teaching me but really I was teaching her. Happy Sunday from the Odinga's! #ChefBaba," Raila tweeted. When scaling a fish, one is supposed to use a fish scaler or the back of a knife After that, one is meant to hold the fish firmly by the tail and scrape the knife from the tail to the head of the fish removing the scales in a stroking motion â€“ they should flake off quite easily. One then finished by washing the fish thoroughly. His post drew a lot of reaction from Kenyans online. Here are some of the posts;
