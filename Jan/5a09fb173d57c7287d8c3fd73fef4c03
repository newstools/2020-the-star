President Uhuru Kenyatta has directed changes to the collection structures to the Content Service Providers - Skiza and Viusasa. Uhuru said it was in his discretion to have all right holders registered to receive royalties. "The current sector structure which comprises content service providers who work with digital platforms such as Skiza and Viusasa will be eliminated. And this is because they sit outside the collection management organisation," Uhuru said. Uhuru's practical direction on this is to have all right holders register on the national rights registry. The President spoke on Tuesday when he addressed the nation from State House, Mombasa. To receive royalties, content service providers will be required to channel all payment of royalties through a single centrally-managed account at the Kenya Copyright Board, and this will enable oversight by the regulator and ensure that the collection distribution accounts are easily auditable. The Kenya Copyright Board with the assistance of the Ministry of ICT, has already reviewed and agreed on the tariffs for 2020. These tariffs are to be gazetted and will form the basis on which compliance will be monitored. "Therefore in this regard, I direct the Ministry of ICT, in consultation with the AG to ensure that this new tariff structure is gazetted within the next 30 days," he said. The President further directed the Ministry of ICT to remove conditions requiring digital platforms to only work through licensed content providers. "This will enable musicians to work directly with platforms such as Skiza," he said.
