Stealing relief food or hungry schoolchildren is pretty low but that doesn't bother some people. Seven suspects have been arrested in connection with the theft of government relief food supplies for schools in Kipkomo subcounty in West Pokot. The storehouse was guarded by security officers. The theft is believed to have occurred over the Christmas holidays. Kapenguria area subcounty director of education Julus Ngoneshi said on Wednesday that 182 bags of 50kg rice were missing. He said a headteacher called him last week about an allegation that some security officers were selling rice suspected to be for the school feeding programme at the Chepreria market. The deputy county commissioner, chiefs and their assistants were mobilised for a search, assisted by residents. They raided a house and found 13 bags repackaged in a 100kg bag, Ngoneshi said, crediting a tip-off from a boda boda rider. "One bag can take three bags. So far we have recovered about 80 bags," he said. Speaking to the Star, deputy county commissioner Michael Wanyonge said seven suspects have been arrested and will record statements. Security officers were mentioned he said. He said the DCI has been investigating and implicated officers will be arrested. â€œOne of the officers has been recalled," Wanyonge said. "The suspects will also assist in identifying the sellers of the relief food. Three Administration Police officers have been mentioned." He said the storehouse is near his office "and we don't expect a common resident to come and steal in a placed well-guarded by armed officers." (Edited by V. Graham)
