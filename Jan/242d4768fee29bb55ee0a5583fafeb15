Controversial blogger Cyprian Nyakundi and his co accused Emmanuel Nyamweya will appear in court on Friday 24. The two suspects are alleged to have intended to extort Sh17 million from a victim. They were arrested on Monday by DCI detectives who recovered Sh1 million from them. They had demanded the cash as a down payment from the victim as a bribe in order not to publish an article alleged to be concerning the victim. Police detectives have been carrying out more investigations on the suspect touching on extortion, blackmail, and false accusations. His fellow blogger Robbert Alai had claimed that Nyakundi was released on free bond following court orders on Tuesday. Nyakundi has found himself in trouble on several occasions over defamatory articles.
