  Nairobi Jubilee MCAs have said they support the Building Bridges Initiative because it will end chaos that often rock the city after every general election. Led by Matopeni/Spring Valley MCA Abdi Guyo, the ward representatives said they will back the BBI and the handshake between President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga. They said the BBI will end ethnicity and divisions that exist among Kenyans. “We are fully behind BBI because it has become apparent that it is the only way Kenyans can be united,” Guyo said. The former Majority leader spoke on Wednesday when the MCAs addressed a press conference at a city hotel. They said they will soon launch grass-root engagements in all the 85 wards to sensitise residents. “We are organising ourselves and very soon you will see us on the ground. We will traverse the entire city and tell our people to support this initiative because it is good of all of us,” Guyo said. He added, “We want to supplement what our leaders have started at the national level. We will go around Nairobi.” The ward representatives said unity and inclusivity were key for development. They urged those opposed to the unity drive initiated by Uhuru and Raila to reconsider their stand, adding BBI has brought stability and peace in the country. “Some people may think BBI is about the 2022 presidential race but that is not the case. We now have peace and that is more important,” Guyo said. He criticised those calling for the removal of Garissa Township MP Aden Duale from his position as National Assembly Majority leader for allegedly opposing the BBI. “Duale has been on record calling for a parliamentary system so that marginalised regions like northeastern can also lead this country. That is the inclusivity we are talking about,” Guyo said. There have been claims the Jubilee Party was targeting the removal of its parliamentary leaders who are opposed to the BBI.  edited by p.obuya
