Former Kleptomaniacs member Collo says his biggest regret is masturbating. Speaking during an interview with Radio Maisha, Collo said people are getting lost in masturbation. "There is no way you can become addicted to masturbation without being addicted to pornography, and pornography messes you," he said. The gospel singer said once you are addicted to it, you stop looking at women as women and start looking at them as objects. "Every time you jerk off, you give birth to spiritual babies, and that blocks you from getting kids. When you are ready to get kids, you start wondering what happened," he said. Collo said being saved has helped him overcome the addiction. “When you are filled with the holy spirit, you become strong," he said. "Masturbation is horrible, pornography is horrible. I can never wish for anyone to be in that form of bondage.” Collo is not the only celebrity who has ever talked about battling masturbation. Former Citizen TV reporter Johnson Mwakazi also did. Mwakazi said his confession helped him get over a situation he had battled with, for so long.
