Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Majority Leader Kipchumba Murkomen has revealed that in his younger days, he was a pastor and had a church in Ngara. Speaking with Kibe and Kamene on the 'Morning Kiss' show, he said, “I was a mini pastor. At first, many people would come and because of my accent, people left, which meant we couldn’t collect much. I hadn’t learned how to speak in tongues," he said. "I was a real preacher and I still believe in it. I was not in the church just for money. There was content but I also needed the money to pay for university.” Kamene Goro laughed about this because she was in the presence of ex-pastors Kibe and now Murkomen. Murkomen also said when he was in high school, he was the only one who was not speaking in tongues when the pastor was preaching.
