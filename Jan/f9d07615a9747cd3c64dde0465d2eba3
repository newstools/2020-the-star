Ulinzi Warriors’ Victor Bosire has been included in the Kenya Morans team for the Afrobasket pre-qualifiers which throws off today at the Nyayo Stadium gymnasium. The indefatigable guard made the team after missing out on the continental event in Mali last year. Coach Cliff Owuor named a strong team, including Tunisia-based Bush Wamukota, who was expected in the country last evening. Owuor said Wamukota and France-based Robert Nyakundi will play key roles in the championship, where they will link up with other top stars including captain and playmaker Griffin Ligare, Eric Mutoro and Valentine Nyakinda. “I will name my starting five after the arrival of Bush since I must assess how fit he is and how he relates with the rest of the players,” said Owuor. “The players in camp look much sharper after this mornings (yesterday) training session.” Owuor asked fans to turn up in large numbers to give the national side the final push to the next phase of the event. “I know Somalia and South Sudan will have many supporters rooting for them. We must equally have a good following,” he noted. The team has been going through their paces at Nyayo Stadium. The draws for the championship will be conducted this morning during the technical meeting. A win at the Nairobi tournament will see Morans inch closer to a continental showdown, joining Senegal, Angola and Mozambique in the next round. Meanwhile, Burundi are the latest team to confirm participation at the tournament after arriving late, alongside neighbours Tanzania. South Sudan, Somalia and Eritrea are the other teams enlisted for the tournament officials, whose officials are drawn from Egypt, Rwanda and DR Congo.
