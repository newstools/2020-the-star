A manager and his two co-accused have denied defrauding Barclays Bank of Sh10,235,000. Meru branch manager Kennedy Munene, Kuria Mwangi and Lucy Marigu appeared before the chief magistrate Hannah Ndung’u. The court heard that Munene and Marigu, between June 12 last year and January 13, conspired to commit the offence. Munene faced another charge of stealing Sh10.2 million from the bank. The 36-year old manager reportedly withdrew cash from several clients’ accounts, wiring to his co-accused who deposited the money into his accounts in a different bank. Marigu separately denied stealing Sh5.6 million property of Barclays Bank between June 18 last year and January 13. She denied stealing, handling or receiving the money or having reason to believe it was stolen. Ndung’u ordered each of the accused freed on Sh5 million bond with one surety of a similar amount. The case will be heard on March 30 after its mention on February 6. Mwangi, 56, a Murang’a-based trader is the third accused. He was charged with conspiracy to defraud the multinational lender of Sh10.235 million, stealing and handling stolen goods. The suspect is alleged to have committed the crime on diverse dates between June 12 last year and January with the two others. In the second count, Mwangi was charged with stealing Sh3.7 million at an unknown place in the country. He was also accused of handling stolen goods by dishonestly receiving Sh3.7 million. Detectives from the Banking Fraud Unit based in Nairobi arrested Mwangi in Thika. Through his lawyer Hiram Kirimi, Mwangi requested for lenient bail terms saying he was not a flight risk. He was released on Sh6 million bond and one surety of a similar amount. Edited by R.Wamochie
