Bidco United coach Anthony Akhulia has revealed that his team is not immune to financial struggles akin to those suffered by most National super League sides despite them being sponsored by one of the leading corporates in the country. Akhulia, whose side remains firmly in contention for promotion after securing a second successive league win after beating Migori Youth 2-1 on Sunday and Mt. Kenya United 5-2 in their first match of the second leg, said it is the efforts of his players that they are in their current position. “We are lucky we have sponsorship but I know things will improve if we manage to secure promotion. That is our main target and is something we are working on very seriously this time round,” he said. Akhulia added: “This team has been fighting for promotion for such a long time but we hope this is the year that we will finally make the breakthrough.” After 20 games, Bidco have 42 points —seven shy of league leaders Nairobi City Stars. More importantly, they are six points ahead of Vihiga United, who follow them in third place. Bidco will be away to Talanta in the next round of matches as they look to keep their one hundred percent second leg record intactin pursuit of their holy grail-promotion.
