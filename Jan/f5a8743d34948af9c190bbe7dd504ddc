Deputy President William Ruto has expressed his reservations about the upcoming BBI forums, saying politicians have hijacked the process. The DP on Thursday said he would be attending the forums, but added that the BBI taskf orce should take charge of the meetings. "Rallies may continue with all the drama but we must have in place a structure where ordinary people will have an opportunity to present their views, " he said. He spoke during an interview with NTV. Ruto said he will fight schemes to create an 'us versus them' situation. "There is a scheme to adulterate and hijack the process to end up with a report Kenyans did not propose," he added. Ruto further added that 90 per cent of people who have been attending the forums so far are ODM supporters. Senate Majority Leader Kipchumba Murkomen, one of Ruto's strongest allies, on Tuesday accused the BBI brigade of having a clandestine committee with an underground draft report. He said during the recent public rallies in Kisii and Kakamega, leaders resorted to 'callous tactics' rejected by the BBI report. "We are concerned with reports of existence of a clandestine BBI steering committee. We demand that the entire BBI process be driven in an open and transparent manner," he said. Murkomen was speaking alongside Susan Kihika (Nakuru), Moses Kuria (Gatundu South MP) Alice Wahome (Kandara MP) and other lawmakers. "Instead of focusing on issues affecting the people, the two rallies focused more on discussing and demonising one individual," he said. Murkomen said the approach has caused 'immense confusion and anxiety' in the public. "It creates the unfortunate impression that there is a sinister and clandestine plan to deny other regions of the country proper representation," he said. "We are opposed to the use of public funds in the organised BBI rallies unless appropriated by Parliament or county assemblies."
