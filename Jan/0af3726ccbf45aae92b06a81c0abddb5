Kisumu RFC charges impressed coach Brian Makalama  with their play despite going down 55-7 against seven-time Kenya Cup champions Kenya Commercial Bank at Kisumu Polytechnic on Saturday. “The scores are not a true reflection of the game. We played well against the champions and a team with very good players,” said Makalama in his post-match interview. Makalama said: “We now have the depth and we need to continue working hard to meet our target of remaining in Kenya Cup. That target is still alive.” “We play Kabras Sugar next week at home. It's another big game for the boys. I hope they will pick some lessons from the game. Playing KCB and Kabras in two consecutive weeks is good for them,” said the Kenyan-born Ugandan coach. KCB's assistant coach Dennis Mwanja equally admitted  that Kisumu RFC have improved. “They were physical and confident in today's game. They have improved a lot,” said Mwanja. He said KCB will take one game at a time in their bid to retain Kenya Cup for the fourth straight year. “I'm not a prophet to predict if we will retain Kenya Cup but we are working towards that,” he added. On the game against Kisumu, Mwanja admitted that they did not play their best game. “I don't want to give excuses but the players took long to get into the game. However, a win is win,” he said. Following the win against Kisumu, KCB maintained second place with 50 points one behind leaders Kabras Sugar. The Kakamega-based side beat Kenya Harlequins 34-4 to record their 10th win of the season. Western Bulls dropped to the relegation zone after being thumped 44-0 by fellow strugglers Blak Blad at Kenyatta University. Bulls have 13 points same as 10th placed Blak Blad.
