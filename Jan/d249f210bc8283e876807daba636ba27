Most North Rift farmers have already harvested their maize while some are yet to do so owing to heavy rains for the past two weeks. NCPB North Rift branch manager Gilbert Rotich told farmers they won't be ab le to access storage depots soon as no arrangements have been made to allow for delivery. “We are still waiting for instructions from the head office in Nairobi in regards to opening depots," he told a press conference at the regional head office in Eldoret. He told farmers to be patient. Rotich was responding to complaints by the farmers from Uasin  Gishu, Elgeyo Marakwet and Trans Nzoia counties over the delay in opening silos. They said maze has started to spoil due to lack of proper drying and storage. Grain farmers Kimutai Kolum and Gilbert Korgoret urged the government to build additional silos to limit post-harvest losses. Post-harvest losses due to moisture and contamination are a major problem. They asked the government to speed up the construction of more depots to reduce transport and operation costs if farmers are to earn maximum returns on the produce delivered “It's urgent for the government to build more depots so farmers can access the CPB stores in far-flung areas where maize is produced on a large scale to cut down on transport costs,” Kolum said. Korgoret said at least two deports are urgently needed in each county to address problems every harvest season..  (Edited by V. Graham)
