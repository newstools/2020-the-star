Western Stima tactician Salim Babu was yesterday named the Fidelity Insurance Coach of the Month Award, his second this season. Babu beat Tusker's Robert Matano for the December award. Both coaches won three games and drew once last month but Western Stima's goal haul propped him above Matano. Stima scored 10 goals and conceded four in their encounters against Nzoia Sugar, Zoo, Chemelil Sugar and Sofapaka while Tusker scored half of Stima's tally but conceded just two. The Stima coach received Sh75, 000 courtesy of the event sponsors Fidelity Insurance to become just the third tactician to win multiple monthly gongs since its inception five years ago. “I’m glad this is happening again this season and I want to thank my family and my team for this win. December was very competitive and I must say we really did our best to win the games that we played,” Babu said during his coronation at Moi Stadium, Kisumu. Babu feels frustrated that Stima are not among the title chasers and he will only celebrate his title if they get off their current mid-table placing. “We are trying hard to make the entire team develop and compete for the trophy. We had good pre-season training and started the season really well but results have not been as consistent,” he added. Babu won the first award of the 2019/2020 season and hopes the December performances will give inspire his team to continue fighting. “We will take our chances in the remaining games as we hope to finish in the best position possible. We still have a good team and just need to keep our focus in our remaining matches,” the former Kenyan international defender said.
