Machakos police have arrested a man accused of killing his mother and niece over eggs on Tuesday in Malindi village, Kalama subcounty. Mwanzia Kaloki, 30, was found hiding in a store at his in-laws' homestead. Chief Jennifer Muinde said Kaloki was caught in his sister-in-law's store, a few metres from his mother's home. Police fired teargas at a mob baying for his blood as they took him away. Kaloki is said to have arrived at his mother's home on Tuesday and started arguing with family members over eggs. Police said he then attacked his mother Ndinda Mutua, 74, with a sharp object before turning to his niece Faith Mutheu, six. Both died instantly. Machakos subcounty police commander Moss Ndhiwa said Kaloki was reportedly demanding his share of land from his mother and that could have been the motive for the murders. He said police received a call on Friday morning from wananchi after they spotted him at the relative's place. "We have arrested a suspect who killed his mother and a young girl. We had appealed to the public to help us in searching for him, so today morning we received a call and we have arrested him as investigations continue," Ndhiwa said. He urged the youth to work hard to acquire their own property. The suspect is being held at Machakos police station and will be taken to court on Monday. Edited by Josephine M. Mayuya
