Some 200 cows have been rounded up in Narok town and its environs. County enforcement officer Rabiko Longo said no one was watching over the animals. He said they were destroying the goods of businesspeople. “We are asking the residents to withdraw their animals from the town and look after them at their homes, where they can graze comfortably without disturbing anyone,” he said. Rabiko addressed the media in Narok town on Tuesday. But Benjamin ole Sankok, whose two animals were seized, criticised the move. He said his cows have been grazing in the town for decades and he has never received any report of destruction. Sankok said farmers were not given any notice to withdraw their animals. “I have never received any report from anyone that my cows have caused any damage in the town. Why would the county government seize the animals without any notice?” he said. Livestock owners are moving their animals from drier parts of the county to lower areas in search of water and pasture. Farmer Jackson ole Taga said the county government should have called for a meeting first. He said animals have been grazing in the town since his grandparents' days. “Why do they arrest our cows instead of arresting the owners? They should let the cows go to graze and drink water freely because no one gave us a notice of arrest,” Taga said. But other residents praised the county government, saying the animals cause a commotion. “The cows mainly survive on our goods. Last week they ate 10kg of tomatoes that I had just bought to sell,” said a trader who wished not to be named. Edited by Josephine M. Mayuya
