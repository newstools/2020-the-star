Sarah Kabu says her hubby Simon Kabu was a conductor and did many other odd jobs before they became rich. She told Radio Jambo's Massawe on Wednesday, "I never told [my family] my husband was a conductor at the time we went home for introductions. I did not know, I found out later." Adding, "My mum valued family a lot and by the time I was 30, she had started getting worried, she always advised me not to be so focused on finding a rich man. "During our first date, Simon wanted to drop me home with the vehicle but I told him I had mine. He was not intimidated like other guys I had dated before and I was impressed."
