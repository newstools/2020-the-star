Human rights defenders have faulted Garissa for reviving the Pending Bills committee to verify projects before contractors are paid. Speaking to the press in Garissa town on Thursday, chairman Mukhtar Osman called the move by Governor Ali Korane "a waste of time and resources". The committee formed by a Gazette notice by Finance CEC Roble Nunow last year was to operate for 30 days, Osman said. "The committee's term expired a long time ago and trying to revive it was illegal and meant to buy time," he said. "The committee came up with recommendations that were never acted upon," he added. He said the National Treasury had ordered that contractors whose projects were genuine be paid "but the governor ignored the directive". As a result, the county landed on the list of those whose funds were frozen last year. AactingTreasury CS Ukur Yatani gave 15 counties up to December 1 to pay contractors and suppliers or risk losing regular funds transfer from the government. Korane faulted the National Treasury for withholding the county funds despite his administration having paid more than 60 per cent of its pending bills verified by theÂ  Auditor General. The activist told Korane to stop buying time on a futile exercise and instead pay contractors "who have suffered despite rendering services". The governor, Osman said, simply does not want to pay contractors who worked for the previous regime. "Some of these contractors took bank loans with the hope they will be paid for services they rendered to the county government but only to be frustrated by officials demanding kickbacks." Korane said, "They told us to write the proposals which we did. Despite the illegality of withholding the funds, we are still complying to their demands." He spoke during the swearing-in of three County Public Service Board members last year. Edited by R.Wamochie
