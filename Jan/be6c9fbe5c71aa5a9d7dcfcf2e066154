Mara Leisure camp and ilkeliani camp in Narok have been submerged after heavy rainfall that hit the region on Wednesday and Thursday. According to the pictures and video seen by the Star, the heavy rainfall rendered the place impassible. This was after Talek River broke its banks in Wednesday night amid heavy rains in the County. Water was seen splooshing and making bubble like sounds as tourists became stranded in the camps. Several land cruisers could also be seen submerged at the Mara, with owners not knowing what to do about the situation. "...these are not boats, this was the driest spot that we parked our land cruisers but now they are submerged ... the water has reached the bridge level," one of the tourists was heard saying. Tourists were also carried by hotel staff to their rooms after the water became impassable. According to the weatherman, rainfall will hit most parts of the country. " Don't forget to plan well in advance  for your daily activities and you might still need your umbrella," they noted.
