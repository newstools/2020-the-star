Following complaints from residents living in areas affected by the locust invasion on the chemical sprayed, the government has promised to change the pesticide to a more effective one. Several swarms of locusts invaded Kenya through Mandera, spread to Wajir, Marsabit and now the swarms have been seen in most parts of the country including Kitui, Machakos, Murang’a among other counties. The government has been conducting aerial spraying in the most affected areas , however residents of Mwingi and Masinga said the chemical sprayed does not kill the locusts in three days as earlier indicated. Government spokesman Cyrus Oguna assured Kenyans the national government has put in place swift measures to deal with the locusts which have been destroying crops and vegetation. “From tomorrow, the chemical used to spray the locusts will be changed to a more effective one, killing the insects instantly,” Oguna said. Speaking at Masinga Airstrip where he toured the affected areas of Masinga in Machakos and Mbeere in Embu county on Thursday, Oguna said that spraying of the locusts is ongoing. “The government has so far dispatched nine helicopeters which are undertaking the exercise,” stated Oguna Oguna disputed claims that the pesticide being used might be harmful to humans, saying that thorough testing has been done. The locusts entered the country from Northerneastern December 27 last year.
