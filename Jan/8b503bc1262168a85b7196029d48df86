 More than 20 residents of a Mikinduri village in Meru have lost property worth millions of shillings in a fire that lasted hours to put out. The residents are up in arms against Governor Kiraitu Murungiâ€™s administration for its inability to promptly respond to fire outbreaks. Peter Mwiti is counting Sh1 million loss after his shop, an eatery and a salon were reduced to ashes at Athwana village. The sole breadwinner said on Monday that the loss would have been minimal had firemen responded in time. He appealed for assistance from the governor, MP Gichunge Kabeabea and well-wishers to restart his life. Many other people were rendered homeless after the Friday night blaze. Tigania West MP John Mutunga is on record agitating for the purchase of more fire engines and the building of a fire station for Tigania region. Only one out of the three engines stationed at Meru town was functional. The only functional fire engine was at Maraa Secondary School where a dormitory was burning. Two others based at Maua and Nkubu are grounded due to mechanical problems. Last year MCAs demanded that four grounded fire engines be repaired. That is yet to happen.
