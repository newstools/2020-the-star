Counties are experiencing challenges including bad roads, lack of jobs, lack of fees among other challenges facing citizens. Therefore, it was insensitive for Embu MCAâ€™s to increase official alcohol consumption hours to start at 3pm instead of Mututho law 5pm. Their proposed Bill also allows the sale and drinking of alcohol from 11am on weekends to 11pm. This will lead to laxity as some staff will be downing a few beers at lunch. It will also encourage alcoholism against the spirited fight against the vice. The national government should intervene before it is too late.  Mombasa
