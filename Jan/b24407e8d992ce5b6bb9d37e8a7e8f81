The national government has been asked to investigate alleged corrupt governors without favour or witch-hunt as recommended by the Senate. Bomet Senator Christopher Langat said the decision by the investigative arm of the government to "only investigate governors aligned to certain political groups was unfair". Governors have been asked to stop complaining when senators exercise their oversight roles, but instead should be accountable. Samburu Woman Representative Maison Leshoomo asked the Senate to be careful while acting on corruption reports against governors. “Anti-corruption wars should not be used as a tool to fight governors to bringing down county governments, I appeal to you [senators], that when you get a report, investigate it first to know its direction before making a decision,” she said. Senate Speaker Ken Lusaka supported Leshoomo, saying the oversight role of the members of county assemblies and senators should be objective and devoid of witch-hunt. “As senators and members of county assemblies, that is our role but it should never be used to witch- hunt or bring down anybody because the moment county assembly and executive doesn’t work together there will be no development,” Lusaka said. They spoke at Maralal Safari Lodge in Samburu Central subcounty during the launch of Samburu County Assembly Strategic Plan. Samburu West MP Naisula Lesuuda urged the county assembly to fast-track pending bills to enhance service delivery to improve the lives of residents. “Let us fast-track the bills that we really have to make to ensure people are enjoying the fruit of devolution,” she said.
