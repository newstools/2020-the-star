Reigning Women's Premier League champions Vihiga Queens will not replace star midfielder Cynthia Shilwatso should her rumoured move to Europe materialise. Even though coach Alex Alumira reiterated that the club is unaware of the development, he said they will not stand in her way should overseas club come with hard-to-turn-down offers. Social media has been rife with cues that the Harambee Starlets' combative midfielder is all set for greener pastures abroad. "I have seen it all over social media that Shilwatso is headed for Sweden, some say Spain but as a club, we have no idea.  Incase she goes, we do not need to sign a new player to fill the void," Alumira reckoned before adding: "The squad we have can cope with her absentia like the team did last season when she missed most of our second leg matches through injury. The team's performance was not affected. We have quality and depth in our squad and the team is raring to go." Meanwhile,  Alumira believes the Vihiga County-based side will not rest on their laurels since they still have a point to prove in the new season. The 2020 season will kick off on February 22 and Queens, who start as favourites against Trans Falcons at Manour Sports ground in Kitale, are ambitious of retaining the Premier League crown. "It's less than a month before the season kicks off and things won't get easier because of our champion status. Every team will try to make life difficult for us but the girls are motivated and mentally prepared for a gruelling title defence," said Alumira. The team won the Women Premier League title for the third time in a row and is among the nominees for the SOYA Women Team of the Year Award in tonight's gala ceremony at the Mombasa Sports Club.
