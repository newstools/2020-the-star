Fresh from winning the Eregi Open tournament over the weekend, Lakers will take part in two more contests as part of their build-up ahead of the new season. Coach Austin Tuju said the Bondo (February 8-9) and Maseno (February 22-23) tournaments will be ideal for the new signings to step up  and fight for a place in the team. Lakers maintained clean run in Eregi and resolute defending saw them concede no goal despite fielding two teams in the competition. With the players yet to hit the required competitive standards, more general training sessions and team building programs will aid the self-sponsored outfit to polish up on their weaknesses. "The girls are still operating at 40-45 percent. We expect them to build it up to about 75 by the time the league commences. "They need to train harder and polish key technical areas before our first league match," remarked Tuju, who took over the reigns from Brian Aduda mid last season.  Tuju was thrilled with the new additions, saying they can only get better if they remain focused. "The new players have been impressive and the technical bench will find it tough to select a team. What we have done in a span of three years is laudable despite lack of funds. We call for patience as we continue our search for a sponsor," he added. The Kisumu-based side boasts of a young squad with players drawn mostly from universities such as Masinde Muliro, Bondo and Jaramogi Oginga Odinga. Lakers are one of the teams tipped to fight for the title as long as they work on their poor away record. The side, captained by Lina Barasa, finished fourth last season on their debut in the top flight.
