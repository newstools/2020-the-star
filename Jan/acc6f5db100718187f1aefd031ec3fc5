West Pokot Governor Prof John Lonyangapuo has warned secondary school heads against doing their private business in schools. Speaking on Tuesday in Kapenguria,  Lonyangapuo said that he had received complaints from parents that some schools had forced them to buy certain commodities from the school. He said that the heads have forced parents of children joining Form 1 purchase certain commodities at the prices higher than market costs. “The heads have turned learning institutions into business premises where they charge parents high prices for commodities that children need to use in school,” he said. The county boss said heads that were posted to the county after delocalisation are at the forefront in dictating that parents to buy everything at school at a fixed price. “They are dictating parents to buy school uniforms, soap, metal boxes, socks, basins, toothpaste, slippers, shoes, text and exercise books," he said. Lonyangapuo said he will not allow school heads to kill the economy of the county by engaging in business instead of focusing on their core mandate. “Where do you expect business people who have taken loans to stock their business to get money to repay their loans? Let’s learn to accommodate everyone in this society,” he said. He said the functions of the heads are clearly stipulated and they are not allowed to engage in business. “Focus on teaching and mentoring our children and leave business to parents so that they can earn income and be able to pay school fees on time,” he said, instead of engaging in business since it amounts to professional misconduct.
