The EACC has taken to court five senior Kitui county government officers who served under former Governor Julius Malombe over alleged tendering irregularities. On Wednesday, former Land chief officer Shadrack Munyithya and county head of procurement Joshua Munyaka denied irregularly awarding Sh891 million road and culverts construction contracts. They were absent on Thursday last week when former Treasury chief officer June Munyao, current acting Land chief officer Jeremiah Kisilu and senior procurement officer Roggers Makau denied the same charges. They appeared before Kitui chief magistrate Stephen Mbungi. Prosecutor Bonny Okemwa said anti-graft detectives were unable to find the two. Mbungi consequently issued a summons to them to appear before the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission. They were arraigned before Mbungi on Wednesday alongside the three co-accused. The magistrate ordered their release on bond. He ordered them to return to court on March 16, 18 and 23 to face trial. Mbungi declined to grant a plea by defence counsel Morris Kimuli and Joan Mati for the trial to start next week. Prosecutor Christine Kavaale had asked for at least a week to serve the accused persons with witness statements and other documents before the hearing starts. Munyithya was released on Sh5 million bond with a surety of a similar amount and Munyaka on Sh3 million bond and a surety of the same amount. On Thursday, Kisilu was freed on Sh5 million bond while Sande and June were each ordered to deposit Sh2 million bond each, all with a surety of similar amounts. The five are facing diverse counts related to irregular Sh891 million contracts awarded in 2016. They include failure to comply with procurement laws, fraudulent procurement practices and abuse of office. Edited by R.Wamochie
