Kenya team have shifted training base to Mombasa in preparation for the Davis Cup play-off match against Indonesia in March. The team has set up camp at the Mombasa Sports Club and will be there for the next one month as they seek to acclimatise to the hot and humid conditions expected in Indonesia. The team in Mombasa has three-time Kenya Open champion and the country's best player Ismael Changawa, Kevin Cheruiyot, Ibrahim Kibet and Albert Njogu. The four played build matches towards the end of the year and Changawa is expected to play two more build-up tournaments in Egypt in readiness for the Davis Cup clash against the Asian nation. Tennis Kenya (TK) administrator Nancy Nduku termed the camp in Mombasa as key to Kenya's hopes of upsetting the form book against the higher-ranked opposition. "The camp will be intense. The boys have to adapt to the conditions which they will expect in Indonesia,” noted Nduku. Changawa, back from a nagging shoulder injury, said the training camp will be a big boost. “Our preparations have to be spot on and the next one month will be key. We will work on several aspects of our game to give ourselves the best possible attempt to win the tie,” added Changawa. The  Kenya vs Indonesia duel will take place on  March 6-7 and the winner will go on to compete in World Group II ties in September together with  losing nations from the World Group I Play-offs. The players are expected to leave the country in late February for Indonesia. Elsewhere, Kenya will host the African Wheelchair qualifiers next month at the Nairobi Club. The winner will advance to the World Team Cup in Portugal in May. Countries expected for the qualifier include Uganda, Tanzania, Burundi, Rwanda , Nigeria, Egypt and Algeria. The Kenya team started their training in mid December and will hope to qualify for the global event for the second time.
