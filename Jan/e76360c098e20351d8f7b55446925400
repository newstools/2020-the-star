Media personality Janet Mbugua says she grappled with sexual harassment in the media and had to choose between her job and her child. Speaking on Radio Maisha last week, she said she faced a motherhood penalty. This is a situation where the company makes you decide whether to lose your job or take care of your child. Janet explained how tough that is, especially when the job is your only source of income. "Instead of creating an environment that says, someone will work on your shift," she said. Janet also discussed sexual harassment in the workplace. She said during her days in media, interns approached her, saying how traumatised they were because of sexual harassment. She had to challenge the HR department. Regarding media girls who get into relationships with their bosses and rich politicians for favours, Janet said women should not be treated with contempt but rather advised accordingly. “I don’t want to sit here and pass judgement, but I do believe this is wrong, especially if it is somebody who has a family. On principle, it's wrong but at the same time, it doesn’t mean that that woman should be abused or harassed or bullied,” she said. She added that it’s a human rights violation. Speaking from her own experience, Janet said she was approached by politicians and colleagues even after she settled down and had children. “How many politicians, how many colleagues in the media have approached me? So many. Did I say yes? No. Even when I got married and had kids. I just used to say point-black that, don't you know I have a family. Don’t you think what you are saying and doing is wrong?" she said. Janet went on saying, “It’s a choice. I just said even though this person can give me all the money in the world, what will happen to me? The man will be praised but I’ll lose my credibility.”
