Title-chasing KCB are set to axe more than eight players in the mid-season transfer window which opened last night. The bankers in their ambitions to win their maiden Kenyan Premier League title recruited heavily before the season but they are still struggling to challenge runaway leaders and champions Gor Mahia. After 13 matches, KCB are sixth on the log with 125 points, four adrift of K'Ogalo, who have a match in hand. Among the big names the club went for in the run-up to the current campaign are Dennis Odhiambo, Steven Waruru and Enoch Agwanda. In addition, the Ruaraka-based club lured in decorated members of the technical bench including Harambee Stars assistant coach Zedekiah 'Zico' Otieno as their head coach. Assistant coach Godfrey Oduor said that they will part ways with more than eight players and beef each department with a player. The former Kibera Black Stars tactician, however, failed to disclose the identities of players deemed surplus to requirement but insisted this in line with their ambitions of dethroning Gor Mahia. "We will release more than eight players in the transfer window for us to have the number of players recommended by the management. At the moment I cannot reveal the names but we will make an official announcement soon," said Oduor. "We will then add a player in each department. So far so good for us and I am looking forward to the new year, in which I hope to perform even better." KCB open the new year with a clash against Mathare United this weekend and the national U-17 assistant coach said they are ready for the Slum Boys even after watching Salim Ali's charges demolish Nzoia Sugar in their previous outing. "I learnt something from the match even though it was one-sided. They (Mathare) played short passes and involved their goalkeeper in their build-ups, which gives them a numerical advantage. We will plot how to stop them. We have in the last two days been focusing on fitness levels of the players," revealed Oduor.
