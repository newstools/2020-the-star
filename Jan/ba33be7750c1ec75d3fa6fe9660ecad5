President Uhuru Kenyatta has called on the church to pray for the unity of the country. Speaking on Sunday during the installation of Africa Inland Church's presiding Bishop Abraham Mulwa, the President urged the church to ensure Kenya remains united and peaceful. "We seek your support to bring peace, unity among our people," Uhuru said. The service was also attended by Deputy President William Ruto, Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka and a host of Cabinet Secretaries and MPs. Uhuru pledged his support for Mulwa as he serves the church and helps leaders bring unity, health and prosperity for all. The President urged all leaders to ask themselves why they have been called to the positions they have. "There are some who ask: How did so and so get to that position? It's only by God's grace. We can say all we want to, but it's God alone who decides. We are put in leadership to serve others," Uhuru said.
