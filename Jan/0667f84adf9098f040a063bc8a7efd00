HMD Global, the home of Nokia phones, is targeting a 10 per cent growth in Kenya this year, as it eyes to increase its share of the smartphone market. This comes after successfully unveiling the Nokia C1 and Nokia 2.3 in the  Kenyan market in December, which came a week after the global launch in Cairo on December 5. The company which has a variety of feature phones is planning a major expansion on the smartphones platform, in the wake of growing technology adoption and internet access in Kenya. “Kenya is our key market which we want to strengthen as we further grow to other markets in the region. Our growth is focused on smartphone,” HMD global CEO Florian Seiche said on Tuesday. The company is counting on among others, its partnerships with service providers in the country to expand its market. “We will continue bringing products that are relevant for the African and specifically Kenyan market,” said Justin Maier, Vice President Sub Sahara Africa. The company made a comeback in the smartphone industry about two years ago, counting on the Nokia brand name to make inroads in a sector that has seen increased competition year-on-year. Hmd has cited counterfeits as among the key challenges faced by investors and companies in Kenya, calling on authorities to not only curb entry of these goods at ports and airports, but also monitor local assembling which is used by rogue players. “Today people bring parts and assembly them locally. There needs to be a lot of public awareness on counterfeit products and their effects,” Seiche said. A team from Hmd is on a tour of the Kenyan and Sub-Saharan Africa markets as the company seeks to cement its business in the region and globally.
