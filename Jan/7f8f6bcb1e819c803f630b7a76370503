Lawyer Miguna Miguna has said that the Government of Kenya is yet to cancel the red alert issued that has barred him from returning to Kenya. The lawyer was scheduled to travel back to the country on Tuesday evening but his attempt to board the flight from Germany was frustrated. Miguna posted through his Twitter handle on Tuesday afternoon that Lufthansa airline stated that it was willing to clear him only if the government will clear the red alert. "Lufthansa has stated that it is ready to transport me to Kenya when the RED ALERT has been formally cancelled or withdrawn by the illegitimate Government of Kenya. But as of now, despite lies peddled via social media and press statements, the RED ALERT has not been cancelled," Miguna said. He added that he was still exploring all options to return to Kenya and promised to update his followers. "I'm exploring all of my options. I'll communicate when and how I will travel to Kenya later today or tomorrow," Miguna said. Government Spokesperson Cyrus Oguna earlier on Tuesday said that President Uhuru Kenyatta's recent remarks allowing lawyer Miguna Miguna to return to the country still stand. Speaking on phone to The Star on Tuesday, Oguna said that the President had allowed for the lawyer's return. However, Lufthansa said it had received a red alert from the government, barring Miguna from boarding their plane. In a tweet response to a query, the airline said, "The Kenyan authorities require airlines to send passenger data to them in advance before every flight departs to Kenya. In the case of the passenger, they requested that Lufthansa deny boarding. However, we are trying to help him in whatever way we can."
