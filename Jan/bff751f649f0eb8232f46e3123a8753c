Expenditure on development in the 47 devolved units was a paltry Sh1.9 billion in three months as governors splashed tens of billions on salaries and operations – largely entertainment and travel. The total expenditure was Sh46 billion.  The Controller of Budget’s latest report on county spending in the first quarter of the current financial year shows that counties had Sh100.41 billion. Devolution was meant to spur growth in the regions, but CoB reports show that salaries continue to gobble huge chunks of money at the expense of development. The latest report shows that governors spent over Sh35 billion to pay salaries and Sh8.8 billion to run offices. Some 25 counties did not fund development projects at all. These are Baringo, Bomet, Busia, Garissa, Homa Bay, Isiolo, Kajiado, Laikipia, Lamu, Meru, Migori, Mombasa and Nandi. The others are Nyandarua, Nyeri, Samburu, Siaya, Taita Taveta, Tana River, Trans Nzoia, Turkana, Uasin Gishu and Wajir. Kisumu and Mandera did not spend a single coin on both development and recurrent vote, raising questions on how they survived in the three months. In the first quarter of the current financial year, counties faced a cash crunch due to the standoff between the National Assembly and the Senate over the Division of Revenue Bill. “The Commission on Revenue Allocation, the National Treasury, and Parliament should devise strategies to ensure the Division of Revenue Bill is approved within the legal timelines,” the report states in part. “Parliament should also develop legislation to facilitate funds flow to counties in the event of delays in the approval of the Division of Revenue Bill." The new report shows that Members of County Assemblies comfortably took home Sh475.4 million in sitting allowances in three months. This translates into each of the 2,222 taking home Sh214,000 in allowances alone. Counties, the report also shows, have continued to burn millions of shillings in luxurious spending – some of which vetoed by Treasury CS Ukur Yatani. Expenditure on tea, refreshments and accommodation for visitors to counties as well as staff while on trips continued unabated. A chunk of the expenses was on entertainment with Bungoma county leading at Sh67 million in three months since June 2019. Nairobi spent Sh56 million followed by  Mombasa at Sh36.7 million on hospitality to visitors and staff. Other high spenders in the same period were Narok (Sh29 million), Isiolo (Sh28.6 million), Nyeri (Sh21.5 million) and Wajir (Sh18.2 million). Marsabit used Sh25.9 million but did not incur expenditure on committee sitting allowances for the 30 MCAs and the Speaker. Kericho, Uasin Gishu and Nyandarua spent Sh17.9 million, Sh17.43 million and  Sh17.3 million respectively. Nandi used Sh16.35 million, Trans Nzoia Sh15 million, Kiambu, Sh13.7 million and Kwale Sh13.4 million. Laikipia utilized Sh13 million whereas Kitui spent Sh11.26 million. The figure for Nakuru was Sh11.5 million, Migori Sh11.9 million, Vihiga Sh10.9 million, Machakos Sh9.8 million, Siaya Sh9.2 million, and Murang’a Sh8.6 million. Tana River expended Sh6.2 million on hospitality. Homa Bay spent Sh5.36 million, with phone expenses being Sh3.1 million. Elgeyo Marakwet used Sh5.08 million of its allocation, slightly higher than Samburu which spent Sh3.1 million, Turkana Sh2.9 million, West Pokot Sh2.6 million, and Tharaka Nithi Sh1.1 million. Baringo, Busia, and Lamu spent the lowest amounts of Sh870,000, Sh480,000 and Sh688,000 respectively. To get out of the quagmire, the CoB has advised county governments to devise ways of improving their local revenue collection targets. Compared with their annual targets, Isiolo, Narok and Samburu achieved the highest proportions at 38.1 per cent, 35.5 per cent, and 33.8 per cent respectively. Conversely, counties that recorded the lowest proportion were Turkana at 5.0 per cent, Kitui at 4.7 per cent, and Kericho at 3.6 per cent.
