A school with over 200 pupils only has one toilet serving both learners and teachers. Tumaini Primary School headmaster Ali Gasinya in Kinango constituency has now urged the government to intervene because the situation is affecting learning and is contrary to rules and regulations set by the Ministry of Education. The school has 226 students and 11 teachers, eight from the Teachers' Service Commission and three for Early Childhood Development Education. Gasinya said the lack of toilets and dilapidated classrooms has affected the school's performance. “According to the guidelines made by the government, staff and school children — boys and girls — should use different lavatories but that is not the case for now,” Gasinya said on Tuesday. His statement comes three weeks after Kinango MP Benjamini Tayari opened a new block of four classrooms built through the constituency development fund. Gasinya said although Tayari offered to assist, the MP alone cannot solve all the problems, thus the request for help from the national government and sponsors. “We shall use the new building for ECDE and Class 1-3. What about four to eight? It means they have to remain in the old structures,” the headmaster said. He further noted that the weak mud walls and makuti-thatched roofs might collapse during heavy rains, risking the lives of the pupils. He said some times learning has to stop once it starts raining. The school head said most parents in the area depend highly on agriculture, which does poorly during the dry season. He feared the implementation of the competency based curriculum will face challenges in the school if parents will not afford textbooks. This year will be the first time for the school to have national examinations for the 16 Class 8 candidates who have so far enrolled. According to Tayari, out of 174 public primary schools in Kinango, the majority are in pathetic conditions.
