Three women have been arrested for child trafficking in Mlolongo,Machakos County. Ann Nzeli (vegetable seller ), Faith WanzaÂ  (broker) and Stacy Wanza were arrested on Friday 8:30pm while conducting the illegal business. Mlolongo Division Assistant County Commissioner Dennis Ongaga said they had laid a trap for the three women after a tip off from the public. The officers then posed as customers who wanted to buy a baby boy. The boy, whose mother is Stacy Wanza, one of the arrested woman, was retailing at Sh30,000. "Police have taken the boy to a medical facility to examine his health condition after he was rescued," Ongaga said. The women have been taken to Mlolongo Police Station for further investigations. The syndicate is alleged to be responsible for several kidnapping of children below the age of 5 years old. Last year several cases of babies missing mysteriously from health facilities were reported in Mlolongo. The DO said babies below the age of 4-5 years old are being sold at around sh.30, 000 where those above five years old are sold from sh. 70,000 and above. Ongaga said police investigations have revealed that girls below the age of 18 years are also involved in the business where their peers are said to be women above the age of 30 years.
