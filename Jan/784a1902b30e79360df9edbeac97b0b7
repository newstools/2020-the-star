Hundreds of street families and vulnerable families were treated to a New Year's party on Wednesday by a Nanyuki businesswoman. The families were treated to generous meals, music and dances. Most of them got haircuts and received clothes donated by well-wishers. The party at Nanyuki PCEA Church was organised by Susan Wanjiku, popularly known as Mama Ngotho, in Nanyuki town. She has been bringing the street families together on New Year's for 35 years. Street children said they have been getting together every January 1 and have formed bonds. They called on the government to assist them and said most have changed their behaviour. If supported, they can abandon the street life and cater for themselves and their families, they said. Most of those who are now adults have been supported to start small businesses including hawking, shoe shining and dressmaking. But Mama Ngotho said their numbers are increasing by the day, making it difficult for her to support everyone. “It has been so encouraging for me to see these people happy at the start of every year since 1984 when they also receive counselling on life skills,” she said. Mama Ngoto said if they are brought together, they can come up with ideas to generate income, which an be implemented with only a little support. Peter Macharia, an artist, said he made it to Form 4 through the support of well-wishers. He said it's necessary to nurture the talents of people who are less fortunate and "who are seen as a disgrace to the society". Susan Piche said, "Most of the street children are arrested and taken to rehabilitation homes but due to poor handling, they escape and return to the streets. She called on the government and everyone to "handle them seriously and with love, which will enable them to go back to school". Mama Ngotho called on other businesspeople to chip in and donate back to the less fortunate. Through this, she said, they can share their problems and work out solutions. Edited by R.Wamochie
