Youtuber Maureen Waititu has been seeking mental therapy for the last six months since she broke up with fitness trainer Frankie. Speaking on her Youtube channel, she said, "Get up and seek help. I went to see a psychologist and a psychiatrist, and I've been doing well." She urged viewers to trust the process. "It's not a secret that I broke up with my ex about six months ago and it was so tough. I remember not being able to know how to react. Break up or grief is a process. I trusted it and that's why I look like I have healed but I have not rushed it," she said. "You will have denial, anger, crazy, negotiation and acceptance and go back and forth until the process finishes what it started so you can be better. There are people who get broken and stay in denial forever and it comes back to haunt them." As the year began, Maureen advocated positive selfishness. "We settle because we don't know how much we are worth. Never settle, no matter how hard it is." "People suffer because they don't know how to be selfish. Learn to have boundaries. Sometimes you have to ignore a situation that won't work with you. Be selfish with your time, peace, money and everything, but not mean." She encouraged fans not to please anybody because people will always scrutinise you. "Do not expect much from people. Hope for the best but expect the worst." The mother of two says social media shouldn't be the platform to look at people's success, as no one documents their failures. "Stop comparing yourself with others. I'm a living example. All my colleagues are advocates of the High Court. I become a mother and I have a different journey," she said. Waititu has become one of the most influential people in the country that young people are looking up to.
