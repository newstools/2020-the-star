International DJ, producer and promoter Fully Focus has just released a new song titled 'Rush', in which he features Kenya’s Nyashinski, Tanzania’s Vanessa Mdee and Uganda’s Fik Fameika. He said in a statement, “I spent the last decade curating and breaking African music to the world. Now I’m spending the next decade also making it.” Adding, “It’s a numbers game and we’re far outweighed by West Africa, so we have to play it smart to win. Strength by numbers is the only way in my opinion.” Focus, who moved to Kenya a year ago, released an Afrobeats mixtape with Major Lazer and then launched his ‘Passport Experience’, a high energy monthly event and annual conference. In 2019, he headlined African Tour, with shows in Ghana, Angola, Rwanda, Ethiopia, Uganda, Tanzania and Burundi.
