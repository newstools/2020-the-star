 Terrorism adversely impacts human rights and a country's economy. It leaves in its aftermath much suffering and ruined human and financial resources. Of course, the government spares no effort to fight terrorism. Police round up suspects, their sympathisers and those who harbour them. The intention is to forestall a repeat of the crime. Sadly, not all arrests translate into convictions. To win the war against terror, the police, the Judiciary and the public must work together. The Judiciary must expeditiously handle terror cases to avoid the violation of the rights of suspects, some of may be innocent. The public should always be forthcoming in providing information on terror suspects to the police. After all, when all is said and done, members of the public end up being the collateral damage when terrorists strike. Yes, the public should perform their patriotic duty of informing the authorities and security agencies of any suspicious activities in their midst even as the police and the defence forces secure our borders. Some of the people out to harm this country live among us. They donâ€™t drop from the skies. They are known in the neighbourhood and volunteering information about their presence is not too much to ask.
