The widow of Dutchman businessman Tob Cohen has notified her in-laws that she intends to erect a tombstone on his grave. Sarah Wairimu sent the notice to Benard Cohen and Gabriele Cohen through lawyer Philip Murgor on Thursday. The letter was forwarded to the Cohens through their lawyer Cliff Ombeta. Wairimu said she did not expect any interference from the in-laws. She maintains that she is the one with the sole responsibility to do the ritual. However, she extended an olive branch to the Cohen siblings and invited them to attend the ceremony if they so wish. "While it is the sole responsibility of our client to erect an appropriate tombstone on the grave of her husband, ..if they are in the country, they will be free to attend any ceremony regarding the same...," Murgor wrote to the siblings through Ombeta. Murgor said his client's decision to preserve the grave was due to her concern that it was neglected. Cohen's decomposing body was retrieved from an underground water reservoir in his Farasi Lane home, Kitusuru, on September 13, 2019.  He had been missing since July 19. He was buried at the Jewish cemetery along Wangari Maathai road in Pangani on September 23. Wairimu was arrested and charged with killing her husband.  The hearing continues. On Friday, Murgor said the DDP's office eventually formally served them with the court order allowing Wairimu to collect her clothes, handbag and make-up kit from the matrimonial home on Monday, January 27. "It took DPP Haji's intervention to have us receive the order formally, even though we had served them earlier. Haji jetted back today from UK and got in touch. He profusely apologised," the lawyer said.
