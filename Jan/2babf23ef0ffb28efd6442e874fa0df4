 Kenya National Union of Teachers executive secretary for Msambweni Bashiri Kilalo has urged officials and members to remain united and support the union to make it strong. Kilalo said the union was facing many challenges and asked teachers to rally behind its officials saying it plays a crucial role in fighting for the welfare of members. “It is true there have been ups and downs but put it into consideration that we badly need it (the union) to run our affairs,” Kilalo said. He was speaking on Tuesday at Mkwambani Primary School during the Base Titanium Awards giving day in Mswambweni subcounty. He said Knut has been of great help to teachers and has assisted in solving many problems. Kilalo said young and newly recruited teachers have not yet realised the union’s importance and advised them to learn from senior members. He said teaching was a difficult profession with hard duties that require much sacrifice and volunteerism. “As long as you chose this kind of work, be advised that it needs more than what you acquired in training schools and always be prepared for anything,” Kilalo said. Kilalo praised the new Competency Based-Curriculum saying it will link up the missing gaps that were left out in the previous syllabus. The official asked teachers to embrace the curriculum and implement it. “The CBC is good for all of us and my friends do your level best to understand it and teach as is expected.” Msambweni Curriculum Support Officer Vincent Yawa said people should give teachers enough support while on duty saying they go through a lot of challenges. Yawa said after two years, the CBC would have been fully implemented.  edited by p.o
