The Council of Governors has acknowledged Nairobi governor Mike Sonko's nomination of Anne Mwenda to the deputy governor position. In a press statement to the media on Wednesday, chairman, Wycliffe Oparanya said Sonko was in rightful exercise of his constitutional mandate, thus the appointment is justified. He further urged the County Assembly to process the nominee. "We are glad that governor Sonko has exercised his constitutional mandate as the head of Nairobi county to nominate a deputy governor who will assist him to discharge his duties," he said. He added, "We urge the county assembly to process the nominee in accordance with their mandate as enriched in the law so as to allow normalcy in the county and continued service delivery". On Monday, DPP Noordin HajiÂ  termed the decision by Sonko to nominate a deputy unacceptable. He said the governor was in violation of his bail terms hence his action was null and void. "The court was clear on what Sonko cannot do. To purport to have power to name a deputy while his case is still on is a violation of the bail terms given to him. We will move to court," warned Haji. In a letter to assembly Speaker Beatrice Elachi on Monday, Sonko said the decision is in line with article 180(5) of the Constitution and the Supreme Court Advisory of March 2018. The embattled governor said the move further was motivated by the complexity of the situation in Nairobi following his arraignment in court last month. He said though he was granted bail terms in a case he is accused of misusing public resources, the court required him as the county chief to stay out of office until the determination of the matter. On Tuesday, the Nairobi assembly spoke in one voice, acknowledging the county was in a crisis. Speaker Beatrice Elachi said a special sitting will be held next month to discuss the way forward.
