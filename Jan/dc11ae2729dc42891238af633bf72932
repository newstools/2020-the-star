African Boxing Union (ABU) middleweight champion Rayton Okwiri is ready to relinquish his crown in a quest to win an Olympic medal for Kenya. Okwiri was a surprise inclusion in the preliminary Kenyan boxing team ‘Hit Squad’ that started preparations for the African Tokyo 2020 qualifiers last weekend. “I have been informed by World Boxing Commission (WBC) and ABU that if I feature in the Olympics, then I will be stripped off my title,” revealed Okwiri. “I am ready to give up the belt because for me, like all other sportsmen, representing my country is my ultimate goal. These opportunities do not come every day and I have decided if relinquishing the title is the price I should pay, so be it,” declared the 33-year-old Kenya Prisons fighter. The boxer was unperturbed about the possibility of losing a potential big pay-day by turning his back on pro-boxing, saying that even if he were to compete for a world title, he would still have to lay down his African belt. “Money is not everything compared to the honour of carrying your country’s flag. My promoters have struggled to find opponents to defend my ABU title and still they have told me that should a world title shot come up, I will have to relinquish my ABU crown. So it was just a matter of when not if,” explained Okwiri. Okwiri, alongside Benson Gicharu and Peter Njenga, were the only pugilists to represent the country at the last Olympics, the Rio 2016 games. The middleweight puncher added that it will not be tough for him to revert back to amateur boxing after two years as a pro-fighter. “There is no difference at all between the two with the exception that you fight bare-chested as a pro and wear a vest in amateur boxing. It will not be hard for me to make the switch,” he assured.The Hit Squad national boxing team is continuing with training ahead of next month’s African Olympics qualifiers in Dakar, Senegal.
