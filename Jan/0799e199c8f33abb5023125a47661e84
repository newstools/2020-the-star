Grandpa CEO Refigah has helped top KCPE student from Laini Saba Ward, Kibra, to get school fees. Dickens Odhiambo, 14, scored 425. Refigah told Word Is on Monday, "I want to be involved in his day-to-day life and to ensure he grows up to be a responsible young man and gives back to society. I grew up on in Kibra. My parents struggled to raise me, so I know how it feels." Refigah has committed to take responsibility of Odhiambo's studies until university. "It's not that I have a lot of money but whatever little I have, I will make sure I support him to the best that I can. He is now an elder brother to my son sultan." Odhiambo aims to be a neurosurgeon.
