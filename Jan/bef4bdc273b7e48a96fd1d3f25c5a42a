Death toll of Al Shabaab militants after an attack in KDF-US military base in Lamu is now 5. Government spokesman Cyrus Oguna said another body was recovered by soldiers at the scene. Speaking to the Star, Oguna said 1 PKM gun, 4 RPG launchers, 4 AK 47 rifles, 1 hand grenade and assorted ammunition were captured from the attackers. "Terrorists are known for propagating false and misleading information in an attempt to grab headlines and feed their egos. Their contorted plans have not and will never succeed," Oguna said on Sunday. He said that search for more bodies is ongoing. In a daring attack, Al shabaab militants attacked the Naval base in Manda area at 5.30am which hosts hundreds of Kenya and US soldiers. "Multi-agency Forces charged with defending and protecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of our Republic will continue to pursue and destroy these forces of evil until they are smoked from their caves and permanently destroyed," Oguna said. The US military acknowledged the attackÂ  by Al-Shabaab carried out on Sunday morning at Manda Bay Airfield in Lamu. A statement by the US Africa Command however noted that the airfield has been cleared and the process of securing it is going on. "The security situation at Manda Bay is fluid. Al-Shabaab is a terrorist group that has repeatedly communicated an intent to attack U.S. interests," the statement said. It added that initial reports reflect damage to infrastructure and equipment. "An accountability of personnel assessment is underway. As additional facts and details emerge, we will provide an update," the statement said. Manda Bay is an area where American forces provide training and counter-terrorism support to its East African partners including the Kenya Defence Forces.
