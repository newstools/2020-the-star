The low quality of hides and skins in the country has been blamed on poor animal husbandry and the high cost of veterinary services. Also to blame are the privatisation of veterinary services and the devolution of agriculture, the PS for Agriculture, Livestock, Fisheries and Cooperatives Harry Kimtai said in Machakos on Monday. This, however, will improve when a new programme the government has come up with is implemented. “We have strategic programmes to improve the quality of hides and skins which will be rolled out before March,” Kimtai told a hides, skins and leather development forum for stakeholders. He said farmers self-diagnose and underdose animals due to the high cost of veterinary services. Further, the branding of animals in pastoral communities leave marks on skins, Kimtai said, also citing lack of adequate manpower to supervise both the slaughterhouses and curing premises. He proposed that meat inspectors should in the interim be used to inspect hides and skins as the issue of manpower is addressed. Director of Veterinary Services Obadiah Njage said the ministry will team up with county governments to vaccinate livestock against lumpy skin diseases. He called on the devolved units to revive cattle that were countrywide before devolution.
