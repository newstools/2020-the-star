 After booking a place in the Betway Shield Cup round of 32 , Zetech University head coach Bernard Kitolo has outlined his plan to revamp his striking front ahead of the round. Zetech eliminated Uprising FC 2-0 yesterday at Ruaraka grounds to advance to the next round where they are scheduled to face National Super League side FC Talanta either on February 15 or 16 Kitolo will look to fine-tune his strikers, whom he noted wasted a basket full of clear cut chances yesterday in anticipation of a tough Talanta, who alongside the 10 Kenya Premier League and six NSL sides were handed byes. “We are anticipating for a tough match as Talanta are experienced. I will be seeking to improve our striking department which wasted a handful of scoring chances yesterday. The team is new and I am hoping by the time we play the next round, we will have gelled,” he added. His Uprising counterpart Collins Omondi also rued the missed chances by his boys but was hopeful of better tidings when they resume their Division II matches. “We played well but we were not clinical in the final third. We were creative but finishing was our major undoing. We will look to rectify the mistakes we made before we resume our league matches,” he said. Stephen Doyak and Austin Ochieng were on target for the students. Meanwhile, Balaji beat Equity 2-0 to sail to the next round where they are set to meet former holders Sofapaka. Lewis Ondieki and Kelvin Abungu scored for Balaji while Alvin Wafula netted Equity’s consolation. Balaji coach Christopher Ochieng said they are not afraid of facing Sofapaka in the next round and further revealed their target of reaching the finals. “Playing Sofapaka is big motivation to the players and we are not afraid of facing them. We will use the remaining time to polish the few areas we identified. We are targeting to reach the finals this edition,” he noted.
