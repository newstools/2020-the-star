Media personality Janet Mbugua says her children have been bringing her closer to God. Speaking on her Youtube channel, the mother of two says she has had some super rough days, and good days but she wants to get to a space of balance and start creating good content. "My children have been bringing me closer to God and I always think like Huru and Mali are in touch with my spirituality as I possibly could," she said. She went on to say that she is happy that God has granted her the responsibility of taking care of them. "I want them to have a healthy vulnerability as young men. I want them to be able to articulate how they are feeling when they are in a safe space and I kind of want to live by example," she said. Janet has been at the forefront pushing for better menstrual hygiene and the abolishment of taxes on menstrual hygiene products such as sanitary towels. In October last year, she released a new book 'My First Time'. According to Janet, the book speaks mainly about the stigma around menstruation. It has a balanced approach to the menstruation issue as it features stories from different men and women drawn from various backgrounds.
