Strathmore Leos and Masinde Murilo University of Science and Technology (MMUST) recorded routine wins to stay on course for KRU Championship semi-final qualification. Leos beat hosts Eldoret RFC 36-17 at the University of Eldoret grounds while MMUST recorded a 25-8 win over Catholic Monks in Kakamega. Leos top the log with 53 points while Ochieng Ahaya's MMUST are second with 45points. The two teams are in pole position for a home semi-final which will enhance their Kenya Cup qualification chances. University of Nairobi's Mean Machine maintained the third position with 35 points after a hard-fought 16-15 win over fellow students from the United States International University. Hosts Egerton Wasps beat Northern Suburbs 15-13 in a closely contested game at Egerton University in Njoro, Nakuru County to move to sixth place while the University of Eldoret returned to winning ways after beating visiting South Coast Pirates 20-7. Kisii won the battle of relegation-threatened teams after beating Mombasa RFC 16-11 in a tough game played at Gusii Stadium. Despite the win, Kisii remains bottom of the log with four points. The team has so far dished out four walkovers due to financial constraints. Kisii will next week welcome the University of Eldoret's Trojans at Gusii. Kisii coach Eric Bosire is hopeful his side will remain in the second-tier league.
