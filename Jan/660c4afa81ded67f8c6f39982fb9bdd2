The University of Nairobi has appointed Prof Madara Ogot as deputy vice chancellor for Finance and Planning, citing Isaac Mbeche's request to proceed on annual leave. Madara is currently the deputy vice chancellor for Research, Innovation and Enterprise. In a letter on Tuesday, vice chancellor Stephen Kiama said Mbeche had earlier requested to proceed on leave from January 6. A deputy vice chancellor is appointed by a university council in consultation with the university's senate. The announcement comes a day after the Employment court halted the selection of Mbeche as the acting VC following Education CS George Magoha's decision to revoke Kiama's appointment. The court order will remain in force until February 5 when the case will be heard. In a notice on Saturday, Magoha said the appointment of a substantive VC will be done after the completion of consultative meetings. He said Kiama would continue discharging his duties as deputy vice chancellor for Human Resource and Administration. This announcement was made after Kiama had invited the public to his installation, which failed to take place on Tuesday. On Sunday, Kiama warned stakeholders against entering into a contract with any other person besides him. "This is to inform all stakeholders and collaborators that any person or institution entering into a contract with any other person other than the legally appointed vice chancellor purporting to represent the university does so at their own peril," he said. In a notice published in a local daily, Kiama said the university will not honour or be held liable for such commitments. He said he will not back down as vice chancellor, despite the annulment of his appointment.
