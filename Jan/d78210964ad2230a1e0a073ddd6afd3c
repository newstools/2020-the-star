Relegation-threatened Kisumu All Stars will be targeting at least five wins in the remaining bit of the 2019-2020 Kenyan Premier League season in order to beat the drop. The lakeside outfit have found the going tough since making their debut in the top flight last year with just two wins and two draws while losing 10 matches. The dismal run coupled by lack of pay in the last five months have seen the club plummet to 16th, above a win-less Chemelil Sugar throwing their hopes of survival in doubt. However, assistant coach Francis Oduor reckons that five wins this year is all that they need to keep their KPL status. Oduor blamed a leaking defence and a blunt strike force for their poor start to life in the top tier but predicted new dawn this year. He also showered the players with praises for mastering the art of quick play and adapting to the demands of the top tier. "It is our first season in the elite league and the boys have really tried. They have been playing well but the results have not been forthcoming. The challenge has been our defence and striking and we are looking for a solution. We only need five wins to remain in the league," said Oduor. With the transfer window already open, Oduor remained tight-lipped on their plans to bring in new players but revealed that three players had already handed in transfer request letters. The former Kenyan international, however, admitted the current squad was in dire need of fresh legs and urged the Kisumu County Government to facilitate them in time. "The head coach is better placed to respond on transfers although we clearly need new players to strengthen the two departments (defence and striking). We can only shop once the County Government has given our list a clean bill of health and I hope they will give us the green light as soon as the coach presents it," he said. "In the meantime, three players have requested to have their release letters."
