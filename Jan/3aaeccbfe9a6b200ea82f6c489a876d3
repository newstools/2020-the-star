Sugar stakeholders want the taskforce report taken back for public validation before its implementation. The Kenya National Alliance of Sugarcane Farmers Association said the report does not reflect the actual views of farmers. Led by chairman Saulo Busolo, they asked the government to reconsider giving farmers an opportunity to corroborate the draft report. Busolo alleged that public participation in the task force report was falsified. He asked the newly elected Agriculture CS Peter Munya to meet with farmers and millers on the ground to confirm and see if the said report reflects on their collective views. "We have seen some alleged draft task force report and most of the views we gave as farmers are not captured in it for example as farmers we maintain that we don't want to zone,"  Busolo said. The Kenya Association of Sugarcane and Allied Products chairman Charles Atyang’ called for the restructuring of the sugar industry to enhance its development and economic growth. Atyang’ asked President Uhuru Kenyatta to sweep the sugar directorate and public millers boards in efforts to rescue the ailing sugar sector. He also demanded that a forensic audit be conducted in the public mills before the planned privatization takes off. The government task-force was meant to investigate the sector crisis and present recommendations to the government for action.
