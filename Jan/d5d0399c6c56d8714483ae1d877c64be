The finals of the Guinness Night Football Goal Challenge tournament took place at Greenspot Gardens in Kamakis, Ruiru, on Saturday. Edward Kamiru emerged the lucky winner after fending off stiff competition from Jeff Wachira, Enoch Kibet and Dennis Mwandikwa. The win granted him a ticket to Lagos, Nigeria, for the Guinness Pan-African championship to take place on January 31, which will be hosted by Guinness ambassador and football legend Rio Ferdinand. Ruiru residents also got to enjoy the best of deejay mixes from DJ Bash. Guinness Kenya ambassador Carol Radull was in attendance.
