Laikipia North MP Sarah Lekorere has urged the national and county governments to step up the fight against locust invasion before they deplete food crops and pastures in the region. Lekorere told journalists that the government has not changed strategy despite warnings by United Nations that the locust will continue entering the country in huge swamps. She spoke yesterday in Nanyuki town. Lekorere said although the insects have not invaded Kenya’s food basket counties, pastoralists who depend on cattle are worried their pastures might be devoured if the locusts are not fought by all means. “Herders, especially in Laikipia North, were very expectant that this would be a good year for them following dependable long rains late last year. They enabled the northern counties to have enough pasture that would see them through for about four months but the locusts have already destroyed large tracks of grazing fields,” the legislator said. The MP said the spraying of the locust by the government in collaboration with private ranchers in Laikipia, Samburu and Isiolo has crumbled due to miscommunication. This, she said, is threatening the fight and in three months animals and residents will be faced with starvation. FAO has warned that it might take up to June to control the menace. Lekorere at the same time urged the national government to declare the menace and corruption as a national disaster. The locusts have been spotted in Lentille, on the border of Laikipia and Isiolo counties, making the pastoralists get more worried.
