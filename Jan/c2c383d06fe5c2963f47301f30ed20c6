Budalang'i residents have told MP Raphael Wanjala to honour his pledge of creating a health centre to boost services. Nadero villagers in Ruambwa want the dormant Ruambwa-Mudembi grain depot turned into a health facility as was promised by the lawmaker. Led by Nyumba Kumi chairperson Agnes Kundu, they said they travel long distances to get services from facilities such as Nyambare Mission Hospital and Ruambwa health centre in the neighbouring county of Siaya. They spoke on Saturday during the distribution of relief food at the stalled rice dryer. Kundu, herself a traditional birth attendant, said the nearest health facility is Budalang'i dispensary, which is seven kilometres away. "Our MP Raphael Wanjala had pledged to turn this dormant Ruambwa-Mudembi grain depot into a health centre to save residents from trekking all the way toÂ  Siaya county to seek medical attention. We are appealing to him to honour the pledge he had made and give us a healthcare centre," she said. She said having a medical facility will save the residents from incurring high transport and treatment expenses in private outlets such as Sirimba and Nyambare mission hospitals.
