 Kisumu residents have raised concerns over the growing heap of garbage at the Kachok dumpsite that was relocated by the county government last year. Those living in the surrounding areas say they were already chocking from the stench of the garbage. The county government spent about Sh300 million to relocate the garbage last year to a new dumpsite in Chiga in Kisumu East subcounty. But the poor road leading to the dumpsite means trucks were still depositing waste at the old site in Kachok. The county government had promised the fence off the 8-acre land but that is yet to happen. Mark Omondi said the county was likely to spend more cash on relocating the emerging heap of garbage. “Even though the county government stated that they had completely evacuated the dumpsite, that is not the case because the mountain is slowly coming back. Dumping is being done at the site every day,” Omondi said. Governor Anyang' Nyong'o's press unit director Aloice Ager said the county was rehabilitating the road that leads to the new dumpsite in Chiga. Ager attributed continued dumping at Kachok to the delay in disbursing funds to the county from the National Treasury and also delays in the passing of the county budget by the assembly. “When we set out to evacuate the dumpsite in the last financial year, we knew we would have finalised the procurement of the land in Chiga by July before we were met by the challenges,” Ager said. He said there was no cause for alarm because the implementation of the planned rehabilitation of the dumpsite will go on. Nyong’o had last year said there were plans to transform the Kachok dumpsite land into a recreational park at a cost of Sh130 million.  edited by p.o
