In a bid to revive their flagging title hopes, Kenyan Premier League side Posta Rangers have delved deep into the transfer market to bolster their squad with several new signings. Midfielder Clinton Kisiavuki, defenders Collins Okumu and Humphrey Okoti as well as goalkeeper Ezekiel Okare have all joined Sammy Omollo's mailmen in anticipation of a better second part of the football season. Posta are winless in their last five matches and find themselves already 13 points adrift of league leaders Gor Mahia. Okoti, a championship-winning veteran with Tusker,  reunites with Omollo hoping that they can replicate their title-clinching combination with the brewers in 2011 for Posta. “It is all hard work, determination and focus. There is nothing beyond a team that gives their all and that informed my decision to join Posta because we want to fight hard and win titles,” said the burly defender. “I know most of the players in the team as well as the coach so settling down is not going to be a big issue for me. The most important thing for us now is to hit the ground running and help the team win as many points as possible,” added Okoti. Posta have a tough match on their hands this afternoon when they take on rejuvenated AFC Leopards in Machakos. Ingwe will come into today's encounter with their tails up having secured a morale-boosting 4-1 win over Zoo Kericho last time out. Club's top scorer John Makwata, who also scored a hat trick in the rout, revealed that he was much impressed that he has what it takes to compete for the title going by the good results they are churning out at this moment when everything seems not to be working well for the team in terms of sponsorship. The former Ulinzi striker is expected to provide Posta with problems as he battles for the Golden Boot. So far, Makwatta has scored nine times and is the joint top scorer in the division alongside Timothy Otieno of Tusker.
