Strathmore University men and women teams will hold three-day trials at the varsity's grounds beginning today. Coach Tony Ochieng said they are targeting players who did KCSE last year and attained good grades. "For the three days, we will be out there looking for good players who got B+ and above in their secondary school exams last year," said Ochieng. He said the institution is out to improve on their men and women's teams in the Premier League this year. Blades and Swords were last year knocked out in the quarter-finals of the playoffs. Ochieng said: "Our two teams did not make it past the quarter-finals. Our aim this year is to improve on that performance." Three University teams - two in the men and one in the women - defied all the odds and made it to the tough Premier League this year. University of Nairobi 'Terrorists' and Kenyatta University 'Pirates' were promoted to the premier league men category. Riara University 'Scarlets' and Kisumu Ladybucks made it to the women's category. The league tips off in March.
