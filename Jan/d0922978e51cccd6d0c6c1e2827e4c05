A Thika court on Friday allowed police to detain the suspect behind the alleged repackaging and sale of expired sanitary towels for 10 days. Stephen Kamau will be held at Juja police station during investigations, recording of witness statements and verification of undisclosed bank accounts associated with him. Investigating officer Stephen Wamba urged magistrate Valarie Ogutu on Friday to allow detention for 21 days. The suspect's lawyer objected, saying his client is a law-abiding citizen and not a flight risk. Muchoki was arrested in Thika town on Wednesday night after police seized more than 300,000 expired sanitary towels labelled Government of Kenya at his premises in  Witeithie Estate, Juja sub-county. They were being repackaged for resale, police said. Police have since established the towels belonged to the Health and Education ministries and they were being repackaged for resale in Mombasa, Kilifi and Kiambu counties. Muchoki, a businessman, has allegedly been repackaging and reselling expired sanitary towels since 2018, police said. He will enter a plea on January 27. (Edited by V. Graham)
