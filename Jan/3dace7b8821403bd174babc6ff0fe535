The government has closed down Kikunuani Primary School in Kathiani, Machakos county because it does not have toilets. More than 300 pupils have been affected by the closure by public health officials on Thursday. The management said the school's toilets sunk in October last year, leaving learners with a block of three to be shared by the hundreds of boys and girls. "The only standing facility developed huge cracks yesterday such that it was a great risk for learners," school committee chairman Peter Mwangangi said. Desperate parents have urged the Constituency Development Fund to rescue the situation and build new toilets. Mwangangi said that an application for emergency funding to the CDF has been fruitless. The shocked parents urged the government and other well-wishers to chip in and save the situation. Last term a pupil from a neighbouring Muisuni Primary School died after the toilet she was in sunk in. Meanwhile, General Mulinge Primary School in the same constituency was shut down on Thursday by agitated parents citing poor performance. The parents said the school's poor performance in last year's KCPE exams was inexcusable.  No candidate scored over 300 marks. They said that majority of the teachers have been in the school for more than 25 years hence a change was needed. "The gross mismanagement witnessed in this school cannot go on without being condemned. We are losing the future of our children in the hands of uncommitted teachers and a sleeping school management board,” a parent said. They called for an overhaul of the teaching staff and the disbandment of the school management. "We need fresh blood to inject life into this school. We demand to see action and heads rolling" they said.
