Kenya Sevens Academy will grace the Capricorn tournament slated for Namibia at the end of February. Kenya Rugby Union (KRU) director in charge of development, Kikechi Kombo, said the team will be coached by former Kenya Sevens tactician Paul Murunga. Kombo said the players have been picked from Nyanza, Western, Rift Valley, Central and Eastern regions. Kombo said the team has already started training and will train for the next three weeks before heading to Namibia.  He expressed confidence that the team will do well considering the number of talented players in the squad. Kombo said Murunga who has long coaching experience with juniors is the right man for the job. "Murunga is still part of the union and he has good track record with age-grade rugby and we believe he will do a good job,” added Kombo. He said the Under-19 programme will act as a feeder to Shujaa. He said plans are also underway to revive Under-16 and U-14 age categories. "We want to build this young teams as a pathway to the senior national teams,  which will, in turn, help us in future,” he added. The other countries that have confirmed participation in the Capricorn Sevens tourney are Australia, South Africa, Botswana and hosts Namibia. South Africa won the 2019 edition of Capricorn Sevens tournament after beating Germany 29-5 in the final. They won all  their six matches matches with 294 points scored and 17 conceded.
