A pastor in Mombasa stabbed his wife on Sunday then killed himself in a church at Chembani in Bamburi, Mombasa county. Elisha Misiko, 55, stabbed his wife Pastor Ann Mughoi on the pulpit in the middle of a service. Kisauni police boss Julius Kiragu said Misiko died on the spot while his wife died at Coast General Hospital. Misiko pastored Ground for Jesus Church, Bamburi. Police reports indicate the pastor called his wife to the pulpit as the service was going on and stabbed her in front of the congregation. He left behind a suicide note. "He claimed that his wife was moving around with other men and she wanted to divorce him and get married to another man and also that she wanted to take the church and his property, which he said belonged to him," Kiragu said. The two had a troubled marriage and at one point had reported to the police station in Bamburi. Their bodies are at Coast General Hospital mortuary. Edited by Josephine M. Mayuya
