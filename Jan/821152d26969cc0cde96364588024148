A gunman shot and killed by police during a botched robbery in Naivasha two days ago was a boda boda operator in the town. Police said that they were closing in on the other suspects who shot and seriously injured a cleric during the incident in Karati village. According to the security officers, the man operated from County Council estate. On Monday night, an unknown number of assailants attacked the pastor as he entered his house and shot him twice on the stomach before fleeing. In the process, a motorcycle operator who had responded to distress calls was also shot and seriously injured before police managed to kill the man. Naivasha police boss Samuel Waweru said they were hunting down the man's accomplices who are believed to have suffered gunshot wounds. Waweru said that the recovered pistol could have been used in various robbery incidents. “The suspect who was gunned down has been positively identified and we are not resting until we get his accomplices,” he said. The senior officer called on medics and wananchi to volunteer information on any suspect seeking treatment from gunshot wounds. Meanwhile, a man committed suicide in Longonot area of Naivasha. His body was discovered from his house by members of the public and police after he went missing for two days. The incident came barely a day after a maize trader took his life using a rope in County Council estate. Waweru said that the body had been collected and taken to the area mortuary and an inquest file opened. “We have seen an increase in cases of suicide mainly among men and this trend is worrying with depression and family dispute being the main cause,” he said.
