Police are holding three students in connection with a Sunday night dormitory fire at Awasi Boys High School in Nyando subcounty. The school lost property of unknown value following the incident at the school's  Baraka dorm. No injuries were reported during the 7pm fire which started when the students were in class for preps. Kisumu county police boss Lonson Lolmodon said they suspected arson. A student who was sick in the dormitory smelled petrol before the fire broke out, he said. Lolmodon said two of the arrested students were detained at Awasi police station and one at Ahero police station. "We have detained the three for interrogations to unearth what exactly transpired," he said. Principal Joseph Mang'uro said that about 110 students were affected and nothing was salvaged. Mang'uro said that he heard students running up and down the dorm section and went to check only to find out one of the dormitories on fire. “I managed to control some students who wanted to force themselves to rescue their properties as we waited for firefighters,” he said. The fire brigade arrived and put the fire out. The county director of education Isaac Atebe said the school will not be closed. Atebe said teachers and parents had agreed that the affected students will be accommodated in other dormitories within the school.
