Amani Ngombo, 14, from Ndugumnani village in Ganze subcounty hopes to become a pilot when he finishes his education. But the future is gloomy because his mother is unable to raise the Sh53,654 needed for Ngombo to join Form 1 at Ribe Boys’ High School in Rabai subcounty. Ngombo scored 384 marks at Dungumnani Primary School in last year’s KCPE exam, subsequently securing a position at the national school. Speaking at his Ndugumnani home on Wednesday, Ngombo said he fears that his dreams will be shattered. “I worked hard hoping I will get sponsors to pay my school fees. My father died  five years ago and my mother takes care of us single-handedly," he said. Ngombo is the third born in a family of seven. He said even completing primary school was a miracle. Going to school on an empty stomach was a normal thing to him. He said he applied for the Wings to Fly and even the Elimu Mashinani scholarships, but he was not even shortlisted. "I was told my application for the Elimu Mashinani scholarship could not be traced and was asked to reapply but still I was not successful,” Ngombo said. He said all his siblings are in school except one who has a disability. “Our firstborn is in Form 3 at Ndugumnani Secondary School, and he sometimes spends a month at home when he is sent away for school fees. My mother burns charcoal to put food on the table. Charcoal burning is not sustainable as it was banned by the government,” Ngombo said. Mother Dama Karisa said life has been tough since her husband died. “My husband left me with seven children and one of them has a disability. I have to take him to Kilifi for physiotherapy every two weeks. My children are bright in school but I have no money to educate them. I appeal to well-wishers to support my son's education,” she said. Dama said she has knocked on every door of political leaders in the area but no support has been forthcoming.
