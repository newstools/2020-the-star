Three women leaders and Ndhiwa town residents on Wednesday protested against the defilement and killing of a 12-year-old girl. Tiffany Achieng’ was defiled before she was killed last Saturday. Her body was dumped along a path in Lwanda B village, Ndhiwa constituency. Homa Bay Woman Representative Gladys Wanga, Nairobi Assembly Speaker Beatrice Elachi, and former nominated Senator Judith Sijeny joined residents in the demonstrations. MCAs Nicholas Owaka (Kanyamwa Kosewe), Richard Ogindo (Kwabwai) and Oscar Abote (South Kabuoch) were present. The demonstrations ended at Ndhiwa police station where they held a meeting with police. The protesters wanted police to expedite investigations and arrest those behind the killing of the girl. Ndhiwa police commander Evans Ombui said investigations into the murder were at an advanced stage. “We have received crucial information that would ensure suspects are arrested. The matter would be concluded after justice is rendered to the affected family,” Ombui said. Wanga said failure to arrest the perpetrators would encourage the crime. Addressing the press at Ndhiwa police station, she said they are working closely with other leaders to fight perpetrators of sexual offenses in the county. Wanga urged residents to furnish the police with any information that could lead to the arrest of the suspects. “The suspects who planned and killed the girl are within this community. They must be people known to us, and we should share information with the police to arrest them,” Wanga said. She promised to follow up on the matter with the police until justice is served. Elachi said defilement must stop. Sijeny said they will follow up on the case until it is concluded. Family members said they will not bury the body until the suspects are brought to book.
