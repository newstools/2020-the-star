The government on Friday promised to intensify the war on terror to ensure the safety of all Kenyans and foreigners living in the country. Speaking at State House, Mombasa, President Uhuru Kenyatta highlighted several measures his administration will take to defeat terrorists. “I expect more of major sponsors of terrorism to be dealt with by ensuring they are listed nationally and internationally to curtail their ability to operate,” he said. Those targeted include recruiters for terrorist groups and institutions used to promote radicalisation. “Focus on hotspot counties must be sustained. Police in hotspots to undergo continuous training to help strengthen them,” he added. Interior CS Fred Matiang'i said they have drawn lessons from the work they did last year. He said most assignments given last year have been completed, including Huduma Namba, census and exams management, adding that the country is secure and safe because of the government's hard work. "We feel well supported. We would like to get final matching borders. This is going to be a year of action and implementation,” he said, adding the newly appointed state officers, including Cabinet se3cretaries, are prepared to deliver on their mandate and other assigned roles. And while praising security agencies, Uhuru cautioned that threats to the country are dynamic, hence the need for vigilance. The actions to be taken include flushing out terrorists from sleeper cells in the Coast and Northeastern regions. The Administration Police officers will also be required to engage local politicians, clerics and opinion leaders. "There can be no longer room for silo mentality in our quest to make Kenya safer,” the head of state said. He maintained that all loopholes through which the enemies receive funds must be sealed. “Smuggling and contrabands from neighbours directly fund al-Shabaab. This must stop. We must move away from ad hoc arrangements and build long-lasting partnerships with international partners."
