Manyatta MP John Muchiri has praised Embu residents for fundraising and taking care of burial expenses of three electricians from Nyanza and Laikipia. Samuel Wahome, Kariuki Ngiri and Joseph Ogonji were electrocuted by live wire lines in Embu Town on December 23 while fixing a supermarket signboard. Muchiri said Embu residents quickly raised funds to help families of the three artisans, without minding their ethnicities. The MP urged the locals to carry on with the spirit arguing that tragedies can affect anyone. He called on Embu people to not only work together when there is a misfortune but even when there is happiness and also not allow to be divided by politicians. Muchiri spoke when he attended the burial of Wahome in Salama Village in Laikipia West Sub-county, Laikipia County, on Friday. The artisans were pronounced dead on arrival at Embu Level Five Referral Hospital after they were thrust from the second floor of Jatomy Supermarket along Embu-Kiritiri road at around 3.30pm. Ngiri’s body was buried a week ago and Ochieng’s will be interred on January 11 in Nyanza county. Embu County Police Commander Daniel Rukunga said they were hired to fix the billboard on the wall of the supermarket to attract more customers during the expected Christmas celebrations. He said the men climbed on the wall and started fixing the board, which accidentally tripped and fell on a nearby power line and suddenly electrocuted the two before the shock waves also struck the third and the fourth person. Rukunga said the three sustained fatal injuries and died before arrival at the hospital. He advised such workers to liaise with the Kenya Power company to switch off power to avoid such tragedies whenever they are erecting such items near power lines.
