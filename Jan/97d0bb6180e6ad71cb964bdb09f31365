Deputy President William Ruto has once again strongly come out to poke holes at the Building Bridges Initiative claiming it has been hijacked to serve political interests. Ruto said that the BBI and handshake are being used to craft ODM's 2022 political line-up. "Unity, inclusivity pretence and associated squander of public resources should stop. Unity? the opposition (NASA) is already dismembered/dead; now dividing Jubilee. Big 4 roll out the only way to go," Ruto tweeted on Sunday morning. The DP's strong sentiments come just days after he told President Uhuru Kenyatta that the BBI public rallies are a waste of public cash and time. Ruto - while on a tour of Vihiga and Bungoma counties - claimed no one was against the report Uhuru and opposition chief Raila Odinga unveiled in September at the Bomas of Kenya. "We agreed that we look for enough copies of the BBI report so the public can read for themselves and form an opinion on their own. When did it change? Now we are being told that political party leaders should read the report then inform the people about the proposed changes so they can decide for the people. When did it change?" he said. "Now a new game of political mobilisation has been initiated. What are all these campaigns for? Who do they want to persuade? Is it a way of misusing government resources?” Ruto said there was no need for the BBI drama as the entire country was behind it. “If there are those opposing BBI, let them not hide behind these campaigns,” he explained. “They should come out and say what they are opposed to.” He said there was a reason for Kenyans to worry as BBI report copies had not been given to them. Ruto said the report should be implemented and the cash put to better public use.
