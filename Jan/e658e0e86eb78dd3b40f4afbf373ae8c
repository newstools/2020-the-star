A 12-year-old boy is fighting for his life after he sunk in a swimming pool at Stegra Hotel in Lodwar, Turkana County. The boy was in the company of his family who were having some fun time to usher in the new year as children enjoyed in the water. The boy sneaked from the children's swimming pool and wanted to try the deep waters in the adults pool. He sunk to the bottom of the adult swimming pool before he was rescued and rushed to Lodwar County Referral Hospital. The Star Journalist Hesborn Etyang present during the incident was harassed by the management of Stegra Hotel for taking pictures of the drowning boy on claims that it could taint the image of the hotel and lead to closure. "Immediately I took the photos of people doing first aid to the drowning 12-year-old boy who was about 20 metres away from me. One of the restaurant staffs noticed and raised alarm to her colleagues that a journalist was filming the incident," journalist said. He said just after taking the pictures, immediately two people identified as bouncers of the hotel, together with one of their senior staffs working in the human resource department pounced on him demanding for the Camera and threatening him to delete the pictures. "I was not given time to express myself, was told I have been sent at the hotel  to do a negative publicity so that the hotel can be closed down and was force told to delete the photos.  When I tried to resist, one of the bouncers took the camera and threatened to beat me lest if I didn't comply," he said. Etyang  said after the scuffle he complied to delete the images and was immediately escorted  out of the premises. Etyang has reported the matter at Lodwar police station under OB No. 40/02/01/2020
