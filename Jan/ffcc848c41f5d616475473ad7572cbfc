A 35-year-old man from Mbondoni in Kangundo subcounty was arrested on Wednesday for bestiality on a dog. Boniface Mutuku chocked the dog to death. Police rescued the man from being lynched by a mob. The neighbours reported the matter to the police, who arrested him and collected 10 condoms suspected to have been used by the man during the act. Mutuku allegedly took the dog to his house on Monday and engaged in the act. Chief Bethuel Kingele said, "He was found having sex with the dog after some neighbours noticed a foul smell since the homestead which belongs to his grandmother is abandoned." Kingele added that Mutuku might have been under the influence of drugs. He is currently being held in Kangundo police station waiting to be arraigned in court on Thursday. Neighbours also alleged that the suspect was also caught two months ago engaging in bestiality with a neighbour's sheep. Kangundo deputy subcounty commander Jackson Sang said investigations are ongoing. “The man is suspected to be mentally disturbed but a mental checkup will give us the right information,” he said.
