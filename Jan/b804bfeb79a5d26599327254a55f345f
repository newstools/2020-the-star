Kenyatta University Titans are eager for the Kenya Hockey Union to address the uncertainty surrounding the promotion/relegation criteria in the women's hockey Premier League. With over a month since the season came to an end, the KHU are  yet to decide on the number of teams facing the drop to the Super League even as Titans wait in anguish on their fate. As it stands, the students are relegated but an array of hope could be given to the Richard Wandera-coached side with news that Nairobi Chapel could field a team in the Super League. Daystar's chances of joining the league in the coming season depend on player availability especially during the long holidays, an aspect that led to the team's withdrawal last season, according to Wandera. The tactician though reiterated that the situation doesn't affect his charges who return to training next week in readiness for the 2020 season. "No matter the outcome, the team is equipped to play in any division and the girls have promised to give their best. We are yet to receive communication from the union but that won't affect our preparations in any way whatsoever. The team was a work in progress last season and with new faces coming in, we can be sure of having a good season," Wandera remarked. "I talked to Daystar coach and he told me their main problem is unavailability of players especially during August long holidays making it impossible to have a complete team." Titans have prioritised strengthening the defence that shipped 24 goals and sharpening the attack that only managed to score five times in 14 matches in the entire season—finishing seventh in the eight-team league. "The team improved dramatically towards the end but we now want to work on our defending. Our ball possession was a bit better and the attack which gave us a challenge will be an assignment we hope to fix faster when we return."
