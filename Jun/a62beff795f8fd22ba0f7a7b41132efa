The border communities in Mackinnon town could soon heave a sigh of relief after Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya and his Taita Taveta counterpart Granton Samboja promised to resolve a protracted land dispute. Tensions had been high between the two counties after Samboja claimed ownership of the disputed Mackinnon Road town — formerly known to be under the Kwale administration — and sent officers to collect revenues. This prompted a clash. But in a brief talk on the phone, Mvurya and Samboja have now agreed to amicably resolve the border issues and put their differences aside for the sake of the people. Another meeting is scheduled for next week to determine how the two leaders will reach further negotiation terms. "We've had a fruitful talk with my Taita friend and we decided to address the border conflicts using peaceful approaches,” Mvurya said. They decided that both counties will stop administrative functions in the town (such as revenue collection) until a lasting solution is found. Mvurya said the boundary problems should not be the cause of animosity between them. He urged Kwale and Taita-Taveta residents to keep the peace as they wait for government agencies to intervene top serve justice. “As I've always said, let love and unity prevail. The border problem should not turn you against each other,” he said. The source of the row is believed to be the high economic status that the town has. This is attributed to booming businesses. The town is located between Mombasa and Voi. Governor Mvurya said they will speed up the peace talks to enable the border communities to get government services smoothly. Previous attempts to end conflicts proved futile, with the problem taking new turns by the day.  Edited by F'Orieny
