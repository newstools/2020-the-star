Nandi county assembly has unanimously voted to redeploy 60 officials over alleged incompetence and financial irregularities. The move was a warning to the Governor Stephen Sang that services and development were inadequate, MCA Gideon Koech of Nandi Hills told the assembly. In his inauguration in 2018, Sang said no financial irregularities would be tolerated and no one in his administration would be spared. Those targeted include six subcounty administrators, 30 ward administrators, 14 road and water technicians, engineers and their supervisors. The motion tabled by Kapsabet MCA Fred Kipkemboi gave county secretary Francis Sang one month to redeploy the staff. They warned they would seek intervention from government agencies and prove their case against the officials. In a stormy motion attended by only 20 MCAs, the lawmakers led by Osborn Komen of Terik ward alleged the administrators had approved payments for nonexistent and stalled projects. Komen told the assembly the Kambare water project in his ward was left hanging while the contractor was paid before the project was complete. He specifications of the approved bill of quantities were not met. MCA Koech of Nandi Hills said a town bus park was abandoned by a contractor after two years without explanation. â€œThe county lost enomormous resources," he told the assembly. Some projects exist only on paper, Kipkemboi said. Acting Speaker Kipkirui Chepkwony said the assembly was carrying out its oversight role and should be taken seriously. MCAs will each receive a scorecard on development in 2022, he said. (Edited by V. Graham)
