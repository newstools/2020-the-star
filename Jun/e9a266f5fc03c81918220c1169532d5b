Garissa Township residents for the second day on Wednesday took to the streets to celebrate MP Aden Duale retaining the National Assembly majority leader post. Duale was on Tuesday spared in the purge targeting Deputy President William Ruto’s allies holding parliamentary offices. The MP enjoys massive support in the constituency. Residents celebrated all over Garissa town and its outskirts. The supporters waved placards and twigs as they danced and sang Duale's praises. Prior to Tuesday's Jubilee Parliamentary Group meeting at State House there had been speculation that Duale, a strong supporter of Ruto, would face the axe. His counterpart in the Senate, Kipchumba Murkomen of Elgeyo Marakwet, was kicked out last month. Mariam Mohamed, a miraa trader, said they had been worried that Duale would lose the seat. Ambia Hussein said although Duale is a key Ruto supporter, he has diligently performed his duties as the majority leader. “Duale has developed not only residents of Garissa but the entire region. He has helped many people, especially the poor, the Somali and Muslim communities,” Ambia said. Abdi Hassan said that Duale has managed to retain his Garissa Township parliamentary seat for three consecutive terms and performed his duties as majority leader for seven years, shows he is a strong leader. “We are proud to be associated with Duale and we are not ready to see him lose that seat to any other person from a different region,”  Hassan said. Speaking to the press immediately after the State House meeting, Duale thanked the President and his colleagues for giving him the opportunity to serve the nation. “I am sure I will go down in the books of history as the first occupant of the office of the majority leader under the 2010 Constitution,” he said.
