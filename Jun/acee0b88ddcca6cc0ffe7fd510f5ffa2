Hundreds of Kericho town residents have gone without tap water for the last three days after burst of the main water pipeline from Timbilil treatment plant. Since last Friday when taps went dry Covid-19 spread fear has struck the residents, with a number of them requesting Kericho Water and Sanitation Company (KEWASCO)  management to restore supply. Speaking on condition of anonymity, an official from KEWASCO acknowledged the burst of the main water supply pipeline from Timbilil treatment plant. He said water engineers were on the site busy repairing the broken line. "By Monday normal water supply will resume after the repair of the broken pipeline,” he said. Hard hit are residents from Mjini, Nyagacho and Motobo estates in the outskirts of the town where the majority of people live. Those living in houses without reservoirs had to use untreated water from a local river for washing clothes and toilets. Edited by Henry Makori
