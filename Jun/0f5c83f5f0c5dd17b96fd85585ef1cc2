There are jitters among MPs as President Uhuru Kenyatta called another National Assembly Parliamentary Group meeting on Monday. In a text message sent to legislators, they were told to be at KICC by 9am for the meeting. "Tupatane hapa Monday Mheshimiwa (Let's meet on Monday), I wish to invite you for a Jubilee Coalition, National Assembly Parliamentary Group Meeting at Kenyatta International Conference Center, on Monday 22nd June 2020 at 9am. Please be punctual," the message read. Majority Leader Aden Duale will know whether he retains his position during the meeting. During an interview with Citizen TV on Friday, Jubilee vice chairman David Murathe hinted Duale might lose his position. "When members asked about the position of the Majority Leader, the President said 'Let's leave that for now... so it was left in abeyance... and I think it will be dealt with during the next meeting," he said. Twenty-five MPs rallied behind Duale after it emerged there was a fresh push to oust him . The Garissa Township MP is under siege from the Kieleweke wing of Jubilee, disillusioned that Uhuru had retained him as leader of Majority. The MPs were collecting signatures to oust Duale. Uhuru has been reining in leaders perceived to be disloyal. During the last National Assembly PG on June 2, National Assembly Majority Whip Benjamin Washiali and his deputy nominated MP Cecily Mbarire were kicked out. Navakholo MP Emmanuel Wangwe replaced Washiali while Igembe North MP Maoka Maore replaced Mbarire. The PG which was chaired by Uhuru at State House also resolved to effect further changes at the House committees as part of the ongoing purge to kick out all MPs not supporting the President's agenda.
