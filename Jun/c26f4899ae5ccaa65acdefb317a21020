Kakamega Senator Clephas Malala was on Wednesday selected to chair the 11-member Senate committee which will probe allegations leading to the impeachment of Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru. Nominated Senator Abshiro Halake will deputise him. The committee has 10 days to probe the allegations against Waiguru. Both parties - Waiguru and MCAs accusing her - will be heard on June 23 and 24 and the final report will be made on June 26. On Tuesday, Forty-five senators voted for the committee route, 14 for the plenary and one abstained. The Senate Business Committee last Friday recommended an 11-member committee to investigate charges levelled against Waiguru. The other committee members are: Michael Mbito, Mwangi Paul Githiomi, Beth Mugo, Anuar Liotiptip, Philip Mpaayei, Cleophas Malala, Beatrice Kwamboka, Stewart Madzayo, Judith Pareno and Moses Kajwang. The High Court last Thursday declined to nullify the impeachment of  Waiguru. Justice Weldon Korir last Thursday declined to overturn the impeachment, ruling that the county assembly had proved it did not violate any court orders. Judge Korir had barred the MCAs from tabling the motion in April because Waiguru had argued that because of Covid-19, she could not leave her home. The governor told the court that she had a pre-existing medical condition that had forced her not to leave the house so she could not go to the assembly. Justice Korir had further ruled that the court cannot interfere with the MCAs' mandate but because of Covid-19, he had to intervene for Waiguru's rights not be violated. Waiguru had challenged the impeachment motion that led to her removal from office. In an amended application filed in court on Tuesday — the day she was impeached — Waiguru wanted the court to declare the whole process illegal. “…a declaration that the proceedings commenced by the county assembly in respect of the impeachment motion during the subsistence of the order issued on April 7 are null,” court documents read.
