Local manufacturers involved in the production of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) being used in the country have met quality standards, the Covid-19 Emergency Response Fund Board has said. Board members, including Kenya Association of Manufacturers CEO Phyllis Wakiaga and representatives from Equity Group Foundation on Thursday visited Texplast in Kikuyu, and Alpha Knits, both in Kiambu county, and Manchester Outfitters in Nairobi county. During the visit, board chairperson Jane Karuku confirmed that the local PPE producers who were competitively sourced are currently working within the stipulated delivery schedules. “The board is impressed at the workmanship and production quality for the PPEs ordered, and we remain optimistic that we shall commence delivery to the Kenya Medical Supplies Authority by the end of next week,” Karuku said. She added that the Kenya Covid-19 Emergency Response Fund has released financial resources amounting to more than Sh1 billion for the local procurement of full kit PPEs, protective goggles, gowns, examination gloves, surgical and respirator masks. Karuku added that the funds have also been earmarked to purchase face shields, head covers and medical footwear. Kenya's COVID-19 Fund started its operations in April and has raised more than Sh2.65 billion to support medical facilities, welfare and social livelihood interventions such as food relief. The team will visit Kitui County Textile Centre (KICOTEC) and Shona EPZ near Athi River town on Friday.
