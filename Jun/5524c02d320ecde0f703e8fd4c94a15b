EACC has arrested a Kenya Revenue Authority Manager and his wife for failing to pay Sh38 million in taxes. Joseph Chege Gikonyo and his wife Lucy Kangai Stephen were arrested on Monday. Gikonyo is a manager at KRA and director of Giche Limited. Lucy is also a director at Giche Limited. EACC established that between 2010 and 2015, both, being directors of Giche Limited, accumulated unexplained assets amounting to Sh597 million. "They fraudulently failed to pay Sh38,692,694 taxes to the Kenya Revenue Authority," authority CEO Twalib Mubarak said In a statement on Monday, Twalib said EACC forwarded the investigation file to the DPP, who granted it consent to arrest the two. They will be arraigned in court on Tuesday. In 2018, Kenya Revenue Authority dismissed reports that Chege was its employee. KRA said Chege was interdicted on October 31, 2016 when allegations of his involvement in malpractices emerged. Gikonyoâ€™s millionaire lifestyle, which was at odds with his Sh119,000 salary, is what alarmed the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission. The EACC argued that Gikonyo had no other known sources of income to explain the massive fortune. Gikonyo had declared he had assets estimated at Sh61 million.
