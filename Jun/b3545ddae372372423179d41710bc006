FC Talanta team manager David Chweya yesterday rubbished reports that the National Super League outfit had not paid its players and members of the technical bench since February. A widely shared message on social media by a player, who sought anonymity hinted that the Kasarani-based club had not paid players despite having money in their coffers .The player further stated that the club had resorted to delaying tactics in a bid to see more than 15 players leave as free agents after the expiry of their contracts next month. However, in a rebuttal, Chweya said the club which has over the years enjoyed shirt sponsorship from the Communication Authority of Kenya, had been sending financial support to the players twice a month. He said the players and members of the technical bench were receiving at least sh 20, 000 per month from the time the first coronavirus case was reported in the country. "We have been sending our players money twice a month, contrary to the reports out there. Every player and members of the technical bench has been receiving at least Sh 20, 000 per month from the time football was suspended. The players are aware of the financial challenges the club is facingÂ  and should appreciate our commitment in making them comfortable during this time," he said Chweya in the meantime admitted that the club had not paid the players' April and May salaries but expressed confidence in clearing with them in the near future "Those reports suggesting that we haven't paid them since February are not factual.We received sponsorship money late last year and cleared their accumulated dues. However, their April and May dues are yet to reflect in their accounts but at least we have been sending them stimulus packages to keep them going during these tough times," he added.
