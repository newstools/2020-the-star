Two former worshippers at Prophet David Owuor’s Kings Outreach Church have been arraigned in Bomet and charged with incitement to violence. Gilbert Kipyegon and Pastor Paul Weronga appeared before Bomet senior principal magistrate Lilian Kiniale on Monday. They denied wrongdoing. The charge sheet said that on different dates last year, they circulated information meant to provoke residents into setting ablaze the church in Bomet town. Audio clips circulated on various platforms were aimed at portraying the church as devilish, thus causing great harm to worshippers, prosecutor George Murithi told the court. Murithi requested the two be detained for 14 more days to allow investigators to subject their phones to forensic analysis at the DCI headquarters. He argued the material presented against the two was likely to cause a breach of the peace and ignite unnecessary hatred by the public towards the church and its members. The two opposed the detention request and sought cash bail. “I am aware of the charge…but since the officers are in possession of the phone allegedly used to circulate the clips there is no reason why we should be held further,” Weronga said. Kiniale ordered the two be remanded at the Bomet police station until Tuesday [today] when she will rule on bail. Kipyegon was arrested on Friday in Bomet, while Weronga was arrested on Saturday at his Kakamega home before being transferred to Bomet. Their arrest follows a recent murder in Bomet in which a man was fatally mauled a few metres away from the church. It was the fourth such case in a year. Police suspect a cult. On Saturday, police restrained angry residents who wanted to burn the church after reports emerged the man had succumbed to his injuries. In the audio in circulation, a man is heard denouncing pastors of the church, claiming they are worshipping the devil and the church is "faking" its miracles. (Edited by V. Graham)
