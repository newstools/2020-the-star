Wasafi singer Rayvanny and his baby mama Fahyma have patched things up. Rayvanny was a single man as of the beginning of 2020. Fahyma broke up with him via a direct message on Instagram. She told him to forget about her and her son. "Count me and Jay as dead in your life. I will fight and I will win. I will not lack money for food but just consider Jay and I dead to you," the text read. This was after Rayvanny was accused of sleeping with his video vixen after fans spotted a used condom on the bed that was used on set for the song 'I love you'. Fahyma packed her bags and left. They have not been talking but from her Father's Day post, it seems like love won. Sharing a picture of herself, Rayvanny and son, she wrote, “Happy Father’s Day. We love you.”
