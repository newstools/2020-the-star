A chopper ferrying security team to Marsabit has crash-landed in Meru. The police chopper crashed at Kaithe Kithoka in Meru after developing mechanical problems on Saturday morning. On board were Eastern Regional commissioner and his security team. It is reported that they were headed for a joint security meeting with North Eastern counterparts. Police arrived at the scene, trying to control a crowd of curious onlookers, who had flocked to Kithooka Forest. The injured passengers were rushed to hospital. Police spokesman Charles Owino said the chopper had six occupants, 2 pilots and 4 passengers-all members of Eastern Security committee. They are admitted at Meru Level 5 hospital. Owino said  an Air force chopper has been dispatched to airlift them to Nairobi. The owner of the land where the chopper crashed claims the crash decimated her entire farm produce adding that the  helicopter hovered over the same spot before crashing. “The crash has destroyed my maize, my bananas and other crops, currently there will be nothing to harvest now, as you can see,” she told Citizen. The single-engine AW119 is among the new choppers recently bought for the service.
