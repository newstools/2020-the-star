 The Garissa government is working in collaboration with the United Nations High Commission for Refugees to trace contacts of six Covid-19 patients who tested positive for coronavirus within the Dadaab refugee complex. The county has so far recorded seven cases, six in Dadaab nd one in Garissa town. While receiving Personal Protective Equipment from Muslims for Human Rights, county secretary Abdi Ali acknowledged that contact tracing was an uphill task owing to the huge population of refugees at the camp. He cited unwillingness by the refugees to volunteer information. Contact tracing involves identifying anyone a confirmed case might have come into contact with from two days prior to the onset of symptoms. “Tracing the contacts of the six has proved to be very difficult. Things have been made difficult by the unwillingness of the six to cooperate. We are however optimistic that with the help of UNHCR officials, we will get them and take them to our isolation centers,” Ali said on Monday. He said the county will deploy newly recruited health workers to border towns of Hulugho, Sangailu, Galmagala and Bura to assist in the fight against Covid-19. The workers will target those who might have contracted the virus without their knowledge. The county secretary warned hotel and restaurant operators to ensure they maintain high standards of hygiene. The confirmed case in Garissa town was that of a waiter in one of the hotels within the town. The official praised the county public service board for a successful recruitment of different cadres of health workers to ensure adequate response to Covid-19. He thanked Muhuri for their donation, promising that the equipment will be put to good use. Muhuri Garissa field officer Abdishukri Jele said they will continue supplying PPEs to health workers to make sure they are protected in the fight against coronavirus.  Edited by P.O
