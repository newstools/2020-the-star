ODM party leader Raila Odinga on Sunday took a Coronavirus test at Kemri in Mbagathi hospital. He echoed Health CS Mutahi Kagwe and appealed to Kenyans to follow suit and volunteer for testing. "I took the Covid -19 test at Kemri in Mbagathi earlier today. I took the opportunity to appeal to all Kenyans to go for testing. A COVID-19 certificate is becoming an important document as we continue battling the pandemic," he said. This comes as the country's virus cases hit 3,594 after 137 more people tested positive. Raila has been on the frontline urging Kenyans to observe all control measures provided by the Ministry of Health. On June 1, he bashed Kenyans defying the governmentâ€™s directives on Covid-19, saying they were doing great disservice to the country. The opposition chief pointed out that the majority of Kenyans had complied with the measures and that only a few were flouting them. The AU Special Envoy for Infrastructure said frequent gatherings at meetings and funerals remained a great impediment to the containment of the fast-spreading respiratory virus.
