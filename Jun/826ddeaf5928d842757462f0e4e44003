Hotels in Murang’a town have been asked to keep a record of their customers for easy contact tracing in case of infection. Health executive Joseph Mbai said on Tuesday six hotels have been okayed to operate. This was after they met the government’s requirements, including having all their workers tested and spacing their sitting arrangements. Mbai said the county has three confirmed cases who are receiving treatment in Nairobi. Sixty-eight people who were in contact with the patients have been traced and quarantined. “We are working closely with the national emergency response team to efficiently manage any case that is reported,” Mbai said. He said the county government will conduct regular inspections to ensure hotels strictly adhere to guidelines. Mbai, who inspected the hotels, said only establishments that meet the Covid-19 prevention conditions will be allowed to operate. Outlets that operate without the county government’s consent risk having their licences cancelled, he said. Numerous applications have been made by hotel owners and are awaiting test results of their workers from the Kenya Medical Research Institute to be approved. The executive urged residents to observe social distancing in hotels. “Everybody should sanitise their hands before and after getting into a hotel. We have instructed the hotels to ensure they always have sufficient water for people to wash their hands outside their premises,” he said. Mbai also warned residents who are still walking around without masks, saying they will be arrested. “By wearing a mask, you protect yourself and your neighbour. Do not go to public places without one,” he said. Edited by A.N
