Carrefour has opened its eighth store in Nairobi increasing its footprint in the local retail space. The new store is located at Nairobi’s Mega Shopping Mall along Uhuru Highway previously occupied by Nakumatt. “The opening of our new store in Nairobi underscores our commitment to offering great customer experiences through high-quality retail outlets where customers can access quality products at the best prices,”said  Country Manager, Carrefour Kenya, Franck Moreau. He added that the new store will offer home deliveries services making it convenient to shop online during the ongoing COVID-19 restrictions. The store will stock food and non-food items and unique specialty offerings such as jewelry, home décor, a library, bistro area, and a milk ATM. It also offers groceries, fresh bakery, and a roastery section. The shopping centre has recruited 250 employees and over 200 part time workers. The management said 99 per cent of the stock in Carrefour stores will be sourced locally. Carrefour opened its first store in Kenya in 2016 and secured rapid growth in the country by recording sales worth Sh13.87 billion from its Kenyan outlets last year according to its annual financial report. As of 2020, Carrefour has seven hypermarkets in Kenya which are rapidly bridging the gaps left by struggling supermarket chains such as Nakumatt and Uchumi. Carrefour is operated by Majid Al Futtaim in Kenya.
