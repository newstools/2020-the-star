The Independent Policing Oversight Authority has launched a probe into an incident where police officers were caught on camera dragging a woman from a moving motorcycle. It is alleged that Olenguruone OCS was the man behind the wheels of a motorcycle dragging a woman in a police station claimed to have stolen some items. In the video that has gone viral, the hopeless woman is seen dragged while being whipped by police officers from behind. The woman is also heard calling for help and pleading with the police not to kill her. "Aki msiniue (please don't kill me)," the victim is heard shouting. The woman who has been identified as Mercy Cherono was dragged for a distance before being left half-naked. Ipoa on Wednesday said it will launch its own investigation and will soon release its findings. "The authority will make appropriate recommendations if culpability is established," Ipoa said through a statement.
