The government should establish a level 4-hospital in every subcounty to realise universal health coverage, two MPs have said. Kandara MP Alice Wahome and Nyeri Woman Representative Rahab Mukami said the hospitals should be well equipped to deal with various diseases. They spoke to the media on Wednesday after attending the burial of Eva Wangui Muchemi who died of cancer. Eva, the wife to former Solicitor General Wanjuki Muchemi, was buried at Magayuini  in Tetu, Nyeri county. Wahome said people suffering from other diseases have not been receiving the required health services since Covid-19 was confirmed in the country. The establishment of fully equipped level-4 hospitals, she said, would ensure other ailments are taken care of. The legislator said the country seemed to be poorly prepared to tackle Covid-19 disease and called on Kenyans to pray and take the necessary precautions to ensure the disease’s spread is contained. “Many counties are yet to establish centres to cater for Covid-19 patients,” she said. “Although the Ministry of Health has been giving daily briefs on the disease, it is time it takes action and zeroed down on specific counties, informing Kenyans the steps they have taken to tackle Covid-19.” Cancer, she said, is one of the major killer diseases in the country and has left many people destitute after draining their resources. The government should have established a cancer centre to serve the country and the region, she said, adding that people have been leaving to India due to lack of such a centre. “Those who are well-off are able to seek treatment abroad but poor Kenyans and especially those in rural area are unable to,” she said. Mukami said after confirmation of coronavirus in the country, many people with other ailments have not been getting the necessary medical attention. Edited by Henry Makori
