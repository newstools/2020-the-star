Vihiga United captain Patrick Okullo has set a return to the top flight as the team's irreducible minimum when they face Kisumu All Stars in the Kenya Football Federation /Kenya Premier League playoff. Vihiga finished third behind Nairobi City Stars and Bidco United in the 2019-2020 National Super League to book a place in the playoff and Okullo can't wait to lead his teammates in securing a return to the top flight when normalcy returns. Okullo revealed that the team is anxiously waiting for the announcement from the President Uhuru Kenyatta on when normal activities will start for them to resume training as a unit. “We really miss our training sessions and we can’t wait for the game to start. As a team, each player has been working as an individual to maintain and keep fitness and we pray for normalcy,” he said He added: “I believe we are in good frame and ready for the play off but we just need to double our efforts and sacrifice in order to realise our objective as a team. I have the experience of playing in Kenya Premier League with this team and I believe we deserve to be there. It gives us a good platform to showcase what we have as players." He urged team-mates to remain focused and not underestimate the opponents in the forthcoming match. The midfielder showered his teammates with praise for their exploits in the past season. He also lauded the team chairman Kahi Indimuli and the entire technical bench for going out of their way to ensure the team honours their matches. “I have confidence in our coach Sammy Okoth and the management to take us to the next level as we strive to reclaim our rightful position in the country’s top tier league, where every player wants to play,” added Okullo. He said the task ahead of them requires sound preparations and a focused playing unit.
