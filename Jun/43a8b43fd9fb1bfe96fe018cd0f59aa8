A police officer accused of killing a 13-year-old boy in Huruma two months ago will seek to be released on bail on Wednesday. Duncan Ndiema was arraigned Tuesday and charged with the murder of Yassin Moyo. He appeared before Justice Luka Kimaru and pleaded not guilty. Kimaru directed his lawyer Danstan Omari to file a formal application on bail and serve the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions ahead of the hearing. Omari also said that results from the Aga Khan University Hospital showed that his client is not infected with the coronavirus.Â The advocate had on Friday said his client could be sick and urged the court to give them time before his arraignment. Omari said his client is a law-abiding citizen and it's now upon the state to prove the charges levelled against him. On March 30, Yassin, alongside his mother and siblings, had been watching police patrol the streets. The officer allegedly fired at them, injuring him. He died in hospital. (edited by o. owino)
