Residents of Mirera Estate in Naivasha are tense after arsonists set fire to the area AP camp allegedly to protest harassment by the officers. The suspects locked the house of the officer in charge from outside during the wee hours before setting it on fire. Quick action led to the rescue of officers' families. No one was injured. They, however, lost all their property. Efforts by fire fighters from Naivasha subcounty stopped the fire from spreading to the camp's armoury. Elder Rimui Mungai said there had been problems between the officers at the post and motorcycle operators. He said this has raised tension during the curfew with the operators accusing the officers of harassment. "The arsonists locked the house of the officer in charge from outside before setting a tyre on fire outside his door. In the process the fire spread to adjoining houses as the officers scrambled to safety,” women leader Esther Nyokabi said. She admitted there was a problem between youths and security officers over how the curfew rules were been implemented. She said that there was a need to address the issues amicably without breaking the law as both parties needed each other. "The target was the house of the Inspector who fortunately wasn't in but the fire burnt down his house before spreading to the other structures," she said. Naivasha police boss Samuel Waweru, who visited the scene, confirmed the incident adding that no one was injured and police had launched their investigations. "At the moment we don’t want to start speculation on the cause or motive but our security officers are investigating the incident and necessary action will be taken if need be," he said. Last month, residents of the nearby Karagita Estate blocked the Moi South Lake Road for two days leading to running battles with police following the closure of a corridor leading to Lake Naivasha.
