The Nyeri administration will start distributing relief food to over 10,000 needy families beginning next week. Governor Mutahi Kahiga said Thursday that the assorted foodstuffs are being repackaged in small bags for distribution. Beneficiaries shall get food rations once a week, Kahiga said. “Right now we have identified 10,000 needy families and will ensure we reach them in their localities in each of the eight subcounties,” he said. The governor estimates that 200,0000 could be at risk of starvation in the county. He spoke when he received assorted foodstuffs from the Kikuyu Council of Elders led by their national vice chairman who is also the Nyeri boss David Muthoga. The governor thanked the elders for the donation. He said the war on Covid-19 cannot be won by an individual but through a combined effort. Kahiga said the county will set aside 300 isolation beds for Covid-19 patients as ordered by President Uhuru Kenyatta. However, asymptomatic patients will be put under home care instead of admittance to hospitals. This was agreed during governor’s meeting at State House Wednesday. “Kenya will be the first country in Africa to start the home-based care model for asymptomatic Covid-19 patients. This will come with its protocols which will be set for people who will qualify,” he said. The county chief said people will also be sensitised on how to take care of patients at home. Muthoga said the council also contributed food for 1,000 families to the National Covid-19 Emergency Response Fund. The chairman lauded the county for its handling of the Covid-19 pandemic and development projects in general. The council will support the county government deliver on its mandate, he said. Muthoga also called on politicians from the area to respect the President and support his agenda for the nation. “We want delivery of services and not politics. We want to talk about what the government had done for us and how they should assist us today,” he said. (edited by o. owino)
