A group of 20 MPs from Western Kenya have accused ODM leader Raila Odinga of using divide and rule tactics to pursue his political interests in the region. The legislators, led by ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi and Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang'ula, on Monday said Raila should stop taking the Luhya community for granted. They said the ODM leader has enjoyed massive support from the region in the past "even when there were better candidates" from Western. "He is behaving like a rude guest and encouraging rudeness in young leaders, " the MPs said in their signed statement read by Kiminini MP Chris Wamalwa. Addressing the press at Wetangula's home in Karen, the legislators further asked Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli, CS Eugene Wamalwa and Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya to stop speaking on behalf of Luhya community. "Our leaders are Mudavadi and Wetang'ula. If you are not with our leaders, then you have signed your political death warrant, " the statement said. The MPs present include Didmus Barasa (Kimilili), Ben Washiali (Mumias East), Sakwa Bunyasi (Nambale), Ferdinand Wanyonyi (Kwanza), John Waluke (Sirisia), Nasri Sahal (nominated) and Alfred Agoi (Sabati). Others are Tindi Mwale (Butere), Dan Wanyama (Webuye West), Christopher Aseka (Khwisero) and Malulu Injendi (Malava). The MPs said leaders from other regions should not think they can use Western to ascend to the top. They further said matters concerning Western cannot be discussed in venues outside the region.
