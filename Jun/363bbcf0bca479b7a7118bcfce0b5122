We are getting more and more into the woods! These were the words of Health CS Mutahi Kagwe when he briefed Kenyans on the Covid-19 pandemic situation on Thursday. "We have informed you that the disease is firmly rooted in our communities. The level of spread has become clearer. "We cannot afford to relent in this fight if we must safeguard the lives of Kenyans." Kagwe said many cases are asymptomatic and can be managed from home. "We are reaching at a time when Mbagathi and Kenyatta University are getting full. MOH has home-based protocols," he said. This means many people in isolation may be be released provided they follow WHO protocols. "A time is coming when we have to change tack. We have learnt that we have been in school on how to manage and understand this disease," the CS said. "We must implement our own systems in our own environments." He said that when people go home, the families should take care of them, adding that they do not need hospitalisation. More to follow
