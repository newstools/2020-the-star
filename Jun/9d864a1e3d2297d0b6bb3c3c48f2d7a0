Kenya on Thursday recorded 213 new cases of Covid-19, raising the country's total confirmed cases to 4,257. The new cases emerged from 6,024 samples that were tested in the last 24 hours. This is the highest number of tests done so far, following a backlog of samples following a shortage of reagents. The average number of tests that have been done previously are about 2,000. Reagents have since been replenished. Health CAS Rashid Aman said Kenya's cumulative tests now stand at 130,498. The youngest of the new cases is one year old, while oldest is 73 years. A total of 106 patients have been discharged, raising recoveries to 1,459. However, another 10 patients have died - the highest. The cases are distributed in Nairobi 136, Mombasa 32, Kajiado 13, Busia 5, Nakuru 4, Machakos 4, Garissa 3, Isiolo 3, Taita 2,  Kitui 2, Migori,  Narok  and Embu one case each. Aman raised concern about areas in Nairobi, including Westlands and Dagoretti, where cases continue to rise. "Something is not right and residents have to do some soul searching," he said.
