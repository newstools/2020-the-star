The filing of cases in all of Nairobi Courts will be done exclusively through the Electronic Filing system from July 1, 2020. The "e-filing" is part of the Judiciary's efforts to increase the use of technology in all its functions. The Chief Registrar of the Judiciary Anne Amadi in a statement on Tuesday said the move will achieve higher levels of efficiency and convenience to its stakeholders. Amadi said that one will be required to register first through the e-filling portal before logging into the Judiciary system, upload documents, access court fees and then submit the files to the registry. The cases can be filed using a computer or any other device which allows attachment of files. The registrar said the system is already available and the public can familiarise with it before it is effected. Chief Justice David Maraga will launch the e-filling system by the beginning of July. The courts are already increasing the use of ICT platforms to conduct hearings and deliver judgments and rulings. The Judiciary is also planning to launch Court Recordings and Transcription System in 32 courtrooms around the country. When the first coronavirus case was reported in the country on March 13, the courts scaled down its operations to reduce the spread of the virus in courts. The courts also conducted hearings and delivered their rulings through Skype. On Monday, the courts resumed its normal operations in courtrooms after a two-month break as a result of the Covid-19.
