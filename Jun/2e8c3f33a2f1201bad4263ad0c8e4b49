A member of a notorious criminal gang in Nakuru urban settlements was killed on Friday night and another seriously injured. This was after members of 'Confirm' criminal gang clashed with their counterparts from Flamingo and Kivumbini. Efforts by police to quell the violence bore no fruits. Tension is still high in the three estates as residents fear retaliatory attacks from either sides. In the past, the gang has been involved in similar attacks and at times involves boda boda operators when they defend their customers from the muggers and robbers. Nakuru police commander Stanley Kilonzi said two houses were burnt during the fracas around 9:30pm on Friday. "The fight was between two groups of the criminal gang and it took place at Flamingo Estate where two houses were also torched," he said. Kilonzi said the victim, Alphonse Ogae Ougo aka Young, was stabbed severally and died on the spot. "The stabs were too many, we only picked the body and took it to Nakuru County Mortuary," he said. The police boss said the one who was injured is admitted at the Nakuru County Referral Hospital in stable condition. Kilonzi said 18 members of the gang have been arrested as police launch investigation into the matter. Ougo's relative who sought anonymity described him as a humble young man. "It is true that he involved himself in crime but we were still hopeful that he would change," he said. 'Confirm' has been a nuisance for the past decade causing fear among residents.
