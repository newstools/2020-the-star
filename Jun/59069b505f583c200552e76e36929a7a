Kariobangi Sharks will not sign new players for the new season, club chairman Robert Maoga has confirmed. Instead, the former Shield Cup holders, will release at least five players who the technical bench have already deemed surplus to requirement. Maoga said the club took the decision in a bid to counter their ballooning salary wage as well as to ensure the players who were not in the technical bench's plans will get sufficient playing time elsewhere. The administrator disclosed that he was looking forward to work with 25 players as opposed to the number at his disposal at the moment. He further revealed that the casualties are already aware of their fate but will continue earning until coronavirus is contained and football resumes "We have more than 30 players and we see no intentions to bring new ones. We have identified players who are not in our plans and it is just a matter of time before we part ways. Having a smaller number is cost effective and injects competition for playing time unlike when you have many players who most of them warm the bench for long.We have already informed them but it is insensitive to release them during this difficult times," he said. In the meantime, Sharks have maintained that record Tanzanian champions Yanga are yet to table bids for the duo of Sven Yidah and Harrison Mwendwa. The two players have in the past months been linked with a move to Yanga but Maoga insisted that he is yet to receive offers for two midfielders who were instrumental during the SportPesa Super Cup in January last year. He, however, said he will not impede them from switching allegianceÂ  to 'Jangwani Boys. "There have been speculations that the two are on demand at Yanga but we haven't been approached. If they are interested, they have to follow the right channels and we will negotiate. Since football has resumed,there, we will be glad if they get deals and continue showcasing their talents," he added.
