Wiper Party leader Kalonzo Musyoka has urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to peg any decision he takes towards the reopening of the economy strictly on expert opinion. Kalonzo told the President to seek expert opinion on whether to ease or remove the measures the government has imposed to contain the spread of Covid-19. The President is expected to address the nation and offer further direction on how to handle Covid-19. Many Kenyans are eager to hear an announcement about measures to reopen the economy that has taken a serious beating due to the pandemic. But Kalonzo urged serious caution on the part of the President. He made the remarks on Wednesday when he received  donations to the Kalonzo Musyoka Foundation in Nairobi. The food and non-food items were from BF Suma, a health products company and Prof Emmanuel Mutisya, chairman of the Diaspora Council of Kenya. Kalonzo said he sensed danger ahead if the country slipped  back to “business as usual," amid the Covid-19 pandemic, a statement from his office said. The Wiper boss noted that the coronavirus pandemic had ravaged world economies and there was reason for serious caution to prevail as the reopening of the country’s economy was being considered. “I know the President will be talking to the country I think about the sixth (June 6)…in the next two to three days or thereabouts. I would want to urge him to really receive all the expert advice because Kenyans are not sure whether we should just go back to business as usual," Kalonzo said.  Edited by Henry Makori
