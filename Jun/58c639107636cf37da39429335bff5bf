Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu is expected to appear before the county assembly on Monday to defend herself against allegations contained in an impeachment motion against her. The Star confirmed on Thursday that county assembly clerk Elijah Mutambuki wrote to the governor inviting her to the full assembly session that will be discussing her impeachment. Speaking on the phone, Mutambuki said Ngilu had been invited as procedure but the contents of the letter sent to her last Tuesday could not be shared. “It is true we have invited her but the assembly cannot share the actual contents since is does not have any vested interest in the matter. If they want, the governor’s office can share the content,” he said. Calls and text messages to Ngilu’s head of communication Galgalo Fayo went unanswered. The Star raised the issue on Wednesday after Education CS George Magoha left Kitui after a tour of the textile factory Kicotec. However, Ngilu who briefly spoke at the steps of her office excused herself saying she was going into a meeting and would invite us for later for a session. By press time, she had not summoned us for the appointment. The motion for Ngilu’s removal is sponsored by the Majority leader Peter Kilonzo. Thirty nine MCAs out of the total 54 MCAs have signed up in support of the motion. Speaker George Ndotto has approved of the motion that has been slotted in the House Business Committee’s schedule for debate on June 29. Ngilu has been cited for, among other things, abuse of office and conflict of interest, gross violation of the Constitution and the County Government Act, contempt towards the county assembly and fiscal impropriety. Kilonzo said the assembly had set aside a special place where governor Ngilu and her legal team will seat if she chooses to answer the summons. “Ngilu has the right to be heard and impeachments are not a one-off event because if we end up impeaching her, the matter will be escalated to the Senate.” Edited by R.Wamochie
