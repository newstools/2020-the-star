Former double Division 3 and S Class champion Karan Patel is working to be the best rally driver in the country after upgrading to R5 Ford Fiesta (Toto Moto). “This season has been a bit better than last season. It went well obviously. But now there is no more rallying. The whole idea this season was just to learn the new car and get some wins if possible. We hope to be very consistent and win the championship next season,” Karan said. Fourth-place behind two Evolution 10’s and a VW Polo R5 on KCB Nyahururu Rally, left no doubt that Karan is moving in the right direction. His blistering pace in the Rift Valley Motor Sports Club round in March didn’t just serve up great moments ahead for the former East African 85cc Motocross Champion, but was a clear indication that he is ready to fight for top places against R5’s and R4 Evolutions. The Premier Class man believes he now has what it takes to steer his Fiesta to desirable heights and indeed go for the Kenyan championship title next year. “In 2016, we did some WRC events in Europe and it was an eye opener. We realised we needed to work hard to improve our pace and we proved that on our overall standing in the country. I’m still working hard to be the best rally driver in Kenya then we’ll move on and see if we can do the ARC.” After his six year working stint at Wilson Airport, Karan now moved to become the accountable manager in the newly established Tailwind Solutions Ltd located in Nairobi’s Industrial Area.The company deals with aerospace and industrial nondestructive testing.
