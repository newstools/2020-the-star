Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua has formed a task force to investigate the alarming report on 4,000 pregnancies among the school-going children. This comes following the report from the Childrenâ€™s Department Technical Working Group indicating that the country had high teenage pregnancy figures between January and May. The report had indicated that Machakos had 4,000 cases but it was disputed by the county government. Speaking on Thursday, the governor said that the task force will probe the report before making appropriate recommendations. The governor said there is need for sex education among school-going children if the trend is to be managed. "We need proper education, and all Machakos schools will set a programme to educate our children on abstinence and safe sex. This is because many of them are children between the ages of 10 and 15, an age at which parents struggle with talking to their children on this issue," Mutua said. At the same time, Mutua has called upon the President to set up a special task force to study the matter. Mutua said the girls who get pregnant as well as the boys responsible will undergo counseling and be provided with social protection and be allowed to resume school without victimisation. On Thursday, Education CS George Magoha said he will interrogate the report to find out if it was exaggerated.
