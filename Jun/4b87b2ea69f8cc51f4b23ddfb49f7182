Taita Taveta Governor Granton Somboja has waived all market levies and agricultural cess to cushion small-scale traders and farmers during the pandemic. In a statement of Thursday, he said traders and farmers shall not be subjected to agricultural produce cess and market levies for a period of two months. “Taking into account the need for government to raise revenue through taxation; tax regimes should not be undertaken in a way that burdens certain sectors of the economy,” the county boss said. The suspension, Samboja said will apply to all the major markets in the four subcounties, trading centres, shopping centres and villages. He urged farmers to take advantage of the waiver and reap big from agricultural produce. “This directive is further aimed at encouraging farmers and traders to continue producing and trading within the agricultural sector,” Samboja added. A fortnight ago, Finance and Economic Planning executive Andrew Kubo had ruled out the possibility of a waiver, saying business operators would pay for renewal of their business permits. He said the budget implementation cannot happen without the realisation of revenue from the national government, donors and the local revenue.
