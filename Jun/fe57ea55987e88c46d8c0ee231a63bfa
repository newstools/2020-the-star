East Africa Breweries Limited has announced a $5 million(Sh531million) programme to support the revival of bars and eateries after Covid-19 restrictions are lifted. Dubbed “Raising the Bar” , the two-year programme will be available from July 2020 offering eligible outlets and bars free access to digital training and support. The programme has been created following a survey of bar owners to identify key priorities for reopening. Some of the top priorities included hygiene measures, digital support and practical equipment to transform how their outlets will work when they reopen. The programme will also provide targeted support to help pay for the physical equipment needed for outlets to re-open. “We have launched Raising the Bar as so many outlets have been forced to close by this crisis and badly need help to open their doors again,” said Ivan Menezes, Chief Executive of Diageo, EABL"s parent company. Bar owners will be able to register their interest for the programme via www.diageobaracademy.com globally. “We want to support the long-term recovery of the hospitality sector as these businesses play an essential role in bringing people together to socialise and celebrate something that we have all missed so much during this terrible crisis,” said Andrew Cowan, EABL CEO. Participants seeking funding must meet some minimum requirements. The restaurant must be registered as a legal entity or equivalent in each jurisdiction and have been operating for minimum period of 12 months before introduction of any national or local lockdown restrictions due to Covid-19. It must also have a beer and/or spirits licence or equivalent and demonstrate at least one way in which they plan to “Raise the Bar” in their community. Bar and eatery owners will receive regular updates on best practice training and resources and be able to participate in global surveys to share insights, as they build back their businesses
