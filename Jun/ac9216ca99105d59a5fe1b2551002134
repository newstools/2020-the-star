Women in Motorsport (WIM)-Kenya has announced elaborate plans geared towards empowering more girls to compete at the highest level in the sport. The unprecedented move is part of a five-year strategic plan envisaged to grow young budding talent at the grassroots level. While making the announcement, WIM-Kenya vice-chairperson, Tuta Mionki said the noble initiative is a deliberate move aimed at creating an enabling environment for women racers, especially the underprivileged ones in various parts of the country. “WIM-Kenya had identified a home in Nairobi and another in Narok for mentoring girls and we were in the process of getting them involved in karting before the Covid-19 issues cropped up,” Tuta said. The essence, she added, is to help young girls realise their potential by venturing into various disciplines of motorsports hitherto perceived a ‘male-dominated world’. Tuta noted that their campaign seeks to demystify the notion that ‘motorsport is only a preserve of the privileged’. “Motorsport has been perceived to be only for a certain group; which is not the case. You can actually participate in the sport in many facets and still be part and parcel of the adrenaline, joy and growth of the sport. We also want to demystify the notions that motorsport is only for men,” Tuta who deputises Helen Shiri at WIM-Kenya noted. Tuta believes that the project will not only unlock women’s fervour in the sport but will definitely mentor the young-budding girl-child from sprawling slum areas across the country. “The girls will be handed the rare opportunity to taste the intensity and adrenaline which characterises the sport through go-karting,” she noted.
