A 38-year-old woman has been charged with robbery with violence after she allegedly colluded with a gang to steal valuables from an online lover she had invited home. Eunice Waweru was accused at a Makadara law court of robbing Dennis Ntabo of his Samsung phone worth Sh23,000, an ATM card, a silver ring and Sh5,000 cash in Kahawa West in Nairobi on May 18. She was also accused of transferring Sh15,946 from his M-Pesa account jointly with others who were not in court. She denied the charges. The prosecution said Ntabo, 32, was delivering electronics to a client in the area at about 6pm. He thought he was unlikely to beat curfew and decided to contact his online girlfriend whom he had only met once in town. Wambui picked him on a boda boda and took him to her house. She said she lost her key. A friend arrived and as they waited four men arrived and accosted Ntabo, court papers said. They held him hostage at Wambui's house where they terrorised him overnight and robbed him, the court was told. They demanded he call his friends and get more money. They sent him Sh20,946. In the morning, the robbers took him to a bus station where they paid his fare. He reported the crime to the Kiambu police station and led the officers to Wambui's house. She broke into tears when Makadara chief magistrate Heston Nyaga said she would be released on a Sh500,000 bond. Wambui told court she is poor and could not afford the amount. The matter will be heard onÂ  September 2. (Edited by V. Graham)
