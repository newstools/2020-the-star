Two IT officers working for The Sarova Stanley hotel are seeking President Uhuru Kenyatta's statement in a case in which they have been charged with intercepting CCTV footage showing his entourage arriving along Kenyatta Avenue on June 2. Their lawyer Danstan Omari on  Wednesday said they will also be demanding the footage, and for AU envoy Raila Odinga's statement. Raila was captured touring the CBD with Uhuru in the footage. Omari said the suspects will use them as evidence in the case during trial as his clients have since lost their jobs owing to the case. Patrick Rading and Janet Magoma were arraigned  in court on Wednesday charged under the  Computer Misuse and Cyber-crime Act. Omari told magistrate  Bernard Ochoi that taking such a footage is not a security risk as his clients were "just being patriotic Kenyans". It is alleged that the two on June 2 at around 8.20pm at Nairobi county within Kenya jointly and without authorisation intercepted CCTV footage capturing Uhuru's entourage along Kenyatta Avenue. The state did not oppose their release on bail, but challenged the defence to produce evidence showing they have indeed lost their jobs as alleged. The magistrate released them on a cash bail of Sh10,000 and directed the state to provide the defence with all the witness statements and documentary evidence they intend to use during trial.
