Three traders were charged in a Nairobi court with obtaining more than Sh100 million by falsely pretending they could award a businessman a tender to supply laptops. GilbertÂ  Wachira, alias Moris Kariuki; Collins Muchera, alias Charles; and Mercy Wanja Murithi, alias Hannah Nyaguthie, appeared before Milimani senior resident magistrate David Ndungi and pleaded not guilty to the fraud charges. The first count states that between August 8 and October 29, 2018, in Nairobi county, they, jointly with others not before court, conspired to defraud John Omondi, a director of Hopeland Advertising and Design Limited, of Sh62.95 million by falsely pretending that they could award him a tender to supply laptops. They are also accused of obtaining Sh12 million from another complainant, Eunice Gakinya of Evaton General Supplies, which was deposited into the account of Collins Muchera Imbaya, alias Charles, at Diamond Trust Bank using the same tricks. All the accused persons are facing other counts of obtaining Sh15 million, Sh10 million, Sh9 million and Sh750,000 from the same complainants using the same tricks of awarding tenders to supply laptops. The accused persons are said to have committed the offence on the same dates within Nairobi with others already charged. The magistrate ordered each of them to be released on Sh200,000 bail pending the hearing of the case on June 24. Edited by Henry Makori
