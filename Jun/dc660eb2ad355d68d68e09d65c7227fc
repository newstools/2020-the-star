Moi University and the University of Eldoret are preparing for reopening, ensuring compliance to control the spread of Covid-19 among students and staff. The two universities together have more than 70,000 students and 20,000 staff. They also have to support off-campus populations and service. President Uhuru Kenyatta has directed the Education ministry to start preparing for gradual re-opening of educational institutions by September 1, though the date is not certain. A team is working on reopening and restructuring the education calendar. Vice Chancellor of Moi University Professor Isaac Kosgey says a committee is working on protocols so they are ready for re-opening. The Moi University senate will meet next week to discuss a preliminary report on the protocols for re-opening. Kosgey said the approved requirements will be distributed to students and staff before reopening. He was speaking when the university and the Rivatex firm in Eldoret donated more than 3,000 face masks at the Eldoret police station. The universities are likely to face difficulty enforcing measures such as social distancing. Spacing in lecture halls, social halls, libraries and hostels will be reworked. Kosgey said the senate would ensure all facilities comply with Covid-19 control measures. Sanitiser dispensers will be installed and information materials distributed. The universities will also face challenges in controlling and keeping safe many students and staff who live off campus. Eldoret University vice chancellor Professor Teresia Akenga said they were working on similar measures. Both varsities are focusing on online learning. Akenga said online learning is not possible at this time as institutions were shut down before online learning was set up. She said the universities will embark on a crash programme to make up for lost time. (Edited by V. Graham)
