Nestle Kenya has bolstered the war against Covid-19 with a Sh17.99 million donation handed over on Wednesday to the Kenya Red Cross Society and International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Society. The money will be spent on among others, sensitisation, food relief, water, sanitisation and hygiene initiatives. Nestle East Africa managing director Ngentu Njeru said the donation will complement government and other stakeholders' efforts to contain the spread of coronavirus. Some Sh5,623,500 will be given to 1,000 vulnerable households in Mathare through cash transfer and food rations. The rest (Sh12,371,700) will support a WASH project in Samburu county, through provision of a solar water pumping system, water storage, and money directly to affected victims "to protect their dignity". Kenya Red Cross Society secretary general Asha Mohammed said, "Frequent and proper hand washing with running water and soap is an essential measure of preventing Covid-19 transmission. We must ensure greater access to these facilities.” The organisation campaigns against fear, stigma and misinformation on Covid-19 besides providing food and cash. Further, it sensitises the most vulnerable on sanitation and hygiene. Some of the targeted beneficiaries are flood victims whose crops have been washed away, houses destroyed and farmlands lost. Many are living in camps and are unlikely to return to the original homes. This is not the first time Nestle is supporting the vulnerable in the fight against Covid-19. Recently it partnered with Kenya Red Cross to donate breakfast cereals to Mukuru informal settlement residents. It also donated Sh5.88 million worth of foodstuff to the national Covid-19 Emergency Fund.  - mwaniki fm
