The Kenya Forest Service has temporarily banned picnics, parties and alcoholic drinks at the Ngong Hills Recreation Park. The move, according to the Ngong Hills Forest manager, is to reduce the spread of the coronavirus. This comes as Kenya's cases have shot past the 2,000 mark. In a statement on Tuesday, the manager said park visitors will strictly have to observe social distancing while in the park. At the same time, visitors will not be allowed inside the park past 5pm and no one will be allowed to enter the park after 4pm. The park is popular for parties, and there have been complaints of visitors leaving the place dirty. Recently, Milimani residents in Ngong area collected over 1,000 used condoms left over by park visitors from Nairobi. Other rubbish left included facial masks, whiskey, and wine bottles, which pollute the environment.
