Gor Mahia club officials will have a chance to vie for various elective positions next month. The club, in a statement, revealed they had held a virtual Executive Committee meeting this morning. "It has been decided that the club's elections will take place on August 8. The Electoral Board will be put in place to oversee the polls, which will be conducted under the new constitution," said the statement. It is expected that incumbent chairman Ambrose Rachier will defend his seat. Several youthful club supporters are expected to challenge his 12-year stay at the helm of the club which he turned into a domestic behemoth, winning eight Kenyan Premier League titles. Other positions that are likely to be hotly contested include the Secretary General post that has seen it's three previous holders including Bernard Omondi, throw in the towel before the conclusion of their tenures. Others who let go midway are George Bwana and Chris Omondi. The club also confirmed that membership renewal/registration is ongoing and more fans are urged to join the process.
