A Busia cleric has urged the national government to roll out mass testing in the county as Covid-19 cases increase. ACK Katakwa Diocese Bishop John Okude said on Tuesday mass testing will help ascertain how many people have the virus in the border county. He said in an interview that Governor Sospeter Ojaamong, Deputy Governor Moses Mulomi, MCAs and other stakeholders in the health sector need to work towards ensuring the exercise is implemented. Busia by Monday had 51 coronavirus cases, the highest in the Western region.  Bungoma was second with only two cases. Kakamega and Vihiga each have one confirmed case. Okude said the constant interaction between lorry drivers and residents of Busia is putting the lives of locals in danger since truckers are among the primary carriers of the virus. “We are not safe as a community and I would advocate for mass testing in Busia. Poverty and ignorance are pushing our people to mingle with others every day,” the cleric said. “We do not know who is sick and who is not. The government, if it cares, should bring machines and start testing.” He said there could be many asymptomatic people within the community as those infected take time to exhibit signs. “Our people should refrain from carelessly interacting in public. Those showing signs of illness should go for testing,” Okude said. He said the church can play an instrumental role in fighting the pandemic, calling for the reopening of places of worship. On Monday, the Health ministry reported that Kenya’s coronavirus positive cases crossed the 2,000 mark after 59 tests turned positive between Sunday and Monday. Health CS Mutahi Kagwe said the cases in the country had reached 2,021. Distributed per county, Nairobi recorded the highest number with 29 followed by Mombasa which had 14 cases. Busia had four, while Taita Taveta registered two, Kajiado (two), Kiambu and Kilifi recorded one each. Busia is yet to record a Covid-19 related death. Edited by A.N
