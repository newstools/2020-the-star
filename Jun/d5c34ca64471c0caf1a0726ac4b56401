Kirinyaga Senator Charles Kibiru has withdrawn from the Senate Deputy Speaker race. He was among five Senators who were to battle for the vacant position after nominated lawmaker Millicent Omanga dropped out of the race. The seat fell vacant following the removal of Tharaka Nithi senator Kithure Kindiki by a majority vote last Friday. "I believe that the interests of our nation at this point in time when President Uhuru Kenyatta, is keen on fostering greater coherence among Kenya, it would be derelict of me not to view my would-be victory as merely Pyrrhic," Kibiru said. In a statement on Monday, Kibiru said the ongoing remake of the country's politics calls for sacrifices, some of which must be personal by nature. Kibiru went on to thank his colleagues in Senate for the support they extended to him while his candidature lasted. "Similarly, I salute all friends in and out of the National Assembly who urged me on," he concluded. Other candidates are; Steward Madzayo (Kilifi –ODM), Isaac Mwaura (nominated – Jubilee), Margaret Kamar (Uasin Gishu – Jubilee) and Judith Pareno (nominated –ODM). Early Monday, the Jubilee Party endorsed Kamar to be the senate deputy speaker. This announcement was made by Majority whip in the senate Irungu Kang'ata on Monday. Senate Majority and Minority Whips are the second-ranking members of each party's leadership. The main function of the two to gather votes of their respective parties on major issues.
