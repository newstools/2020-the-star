The High Court has ordered a school board to pay a contractor Sh13 million  balance for building a dormitory. James Kariuki  trading as Jimai Electrical Service sued the board of management St Mary's Girls High School Igoji, Meru, in 2018 seeking to be paid the sum. The claim arose out of a tender awarded to Kariuki on December 16, 2014 for the construction of a dormitory on the school’s parcel of land at a cost of Sh43 million. The agreement was executed on January 12, 2015 by the parties. Upon completion of the construction on July  31, 2015, Kariuki was issued with a certificate of practical completion by the Imenti South subcounty works officer. On the same day he handed over the dormitory to the school. He was issued with a handover certificate by the Imenti South subcounty works officer. “Out of the total contractual sum the school paid Kariuki sum of Sh30,000,000, leaving a balance of Sh13,727,740 which they had not paid  despite demand and notice of intention to sue being issued to them,” the judgement reads. He said after construction was completed the school did not pay the balance and therefore breached the contract between them. Justice Anne  Ong'injo on May 28 ruled that the school’s argument that Kariuki sought a higher award in terms of cost was unfortunate and misplaced. “In conclusion, this court finds that the plaintiff has proved his case on a balance of probabilities and judgement is entered as prayed, save that no award of costs is made and interest on the sum of Sh13,727,740 from January 13, 2017”, the court ruled.
