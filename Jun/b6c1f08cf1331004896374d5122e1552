Rapper Juliani says he is in good terms with his former girlfriend, actress Brenda Wairimu. Juliani and Brenda broke up about three years ago after being together for about eight years. The two have a five-year-old daughter, Amor Njeri, whom they are co-parenting. Juliani recently dismissed rumours that they don’t co-parent. “She is the mother of my child and I can’t take that away from her. She has helped ensure that I spend time with my daughter as I try my level best to provide,” he said. “I may not be together with her in a relationship or romantically but as the mother of my child I respect her so much. Besides, she is also a good person.” Juliani says he chose to remain single after their break-up and the situation remains unchanged.
