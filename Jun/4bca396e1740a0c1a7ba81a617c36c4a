ODM leader Raila Odinga has the world in calling for justice following the murder of George Floyd, an African American who was killed by a white police officer in Minneapolis, Minnesota. "I join the thousands out there in saying a prayer for the family of George Floyd and more importantly, for the US- a prayer that there be justice and freedom for all human beings who call America their country and that citizens be judged by the content of their character, not the colour of their skin," Raila said in a tweet. This is reminiscent of US rights activist Martin Luther King's 'I have a dream' speech where he called for people not to be judged by their race. Raila said, "It is a dream we in Africa too owe our citizens, even as we stand with Floyd's family in the US." Floyd died after a white police officer bent his knee on his neck. The officer was dismissed and charged with third degree murder. The African Union on Friday condemned the killing of Floyd, 46. In a press statement, AU chairperson Moussa Faki said the union “rejects the continuing discriminatory practices against black citizens of the United States of America.” “The chairperson of AU strongly condemns the murder that occurred in the United States of America at the hands of law enforcement officers, and wishes to extend his deepest condolences to his family and loved ones.” Faki called on the US authorities to immediately intensify their efforts to ensure that there is total elimination of all forms of discrimination based on race or ethnic origin.
