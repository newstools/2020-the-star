Lugari MP Ayub Savula has asked President Uhuru Kenyatta to intervene in issues affecting Western Kenya. Savula urged the president to create a special fund under a supplementary budget to address problems facing sugarcane, tea, maize and coffee sectors. He said that promises made at a meeting chaired by Interior and Co-ordination CS Fred Matiang'i on development of the region last Thursday were mere political statements. "We as leaders from this region want direct intervention by the president because he is the one who signs the warrant of expenditure. We don't want to meet ministers because we have met them before and nothing happened," he added. Savula said that ANC and Ford Kenya MPs skipped the Thursday meeting because leaders from the region met CS Matiang'i last year and and none of the resolutions was captured in 2020/21 budget estimates read in Parliament. "Why should they wait until the budget is read without any serious allocation to cater for issues of sugarcane, tea, coffee and maize to summon us for a meeting to discuss our problems?" He asked. Savula said that leaders from Western want direct intervention by the president because the budget estimates left out issues of sugarcane, tea, coffee and maize. "They are telling us that they want to look for money from. World Bank. The process of getting money from World Bank tedious and will take us into the next budget making cycle," he said. "We know that this the second last budget of president Kenyatta and we don't want to wait for the last one," he added.
