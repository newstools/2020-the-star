Seven healthcare workers, including doctors and nurses, have been put in quarantine at Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital after contacting a patient who tested positive for Covid-19. The asymptomatic 18-year-old was to undergo surgery and was diagnosed during routine pre-surgical screening. His family in Langas Estate on the outskirts of Eldoret town is in quarantine. His contacts are being traced. Aruasa said the quarantined health caregivers will be tested after 14 days to ascertain their status and if found to be negative they can return to work. He said there was no cause for alarm by the public; hospital operations are normal. "There was no panic in the hospital as rumoured and work is going on as usual in all wings of the facility," he said. "Residents should not fear to seek treatment at MTRH over the incident as all the necessary precautions to ensure their health and safety are in place," Aruasa told the Star. The nurses and doctors who came into contact with the patient exercised caution and wore protective equipment, he said. The CEO said the medical staff are well-trained and prepared for any eventuality. Ninety per cent of Kenyans who test positive for the coronavirus exhibit only mild symptoms, he said. Covid-19 is now within communities and people should not shy away from seeking medical services, Aruasa said. No one will be denied services if they test positive for the virus, he said. More than 30 patients in Uasin Gishu have tested positive for Covid-19. (Edited by V. Graham)
