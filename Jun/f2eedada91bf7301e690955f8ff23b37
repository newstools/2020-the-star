US Ambassador to Kenya Kyle McCarter has expressed confidence justice willl be served for George Floyd. Floyd, an African American, died after a white police offcer held him down on his neck using his knee. In a video message, McCarter on Tuesday said that he has heard the voices of the American people, which he said reflect their "horror and anger at the repugnant acts of these officers". "A strong independent judicial system with the power to investigate and prosecute forward is the best means to ensure justice is served," McCarter said. "I am confident that justice will prevail." On Tuesday, Kenyans joined the protests by marching to the US Embassy in Gigiri, calling for justice to Floyd's family. Floyd's death has been criticised by African leaders, including the African Union chairperson Moussa Faki, who said that the union “rejects the continuing discriminatory practices against black citizens of the United States of America.” ODM leader Raila Odinga also called for justice and inequality to all people living in the US. According to findings from private examiners hired by the family, Floyd died from asphyxia (lack of oxygen) due to compression on his neck and back. The officer was fired and charged with third degree murder.
