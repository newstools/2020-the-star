The High Court in Meru has slashed the life sentence of a man convicted of defiling his 10-year-old daughter severally after a successful appeal. Max (not his real name), was charged with the defilement of the Class 2 pupil on diverse dates between 2018 and 2019 in Imenti, Meru county. He pleaded not guilty but was convicted by the Nkubu Magistrate’s court and sentenced to life. Dissatisfied with the ruling, he appealed  at the High Court. He claimed the prosecution failed to prove the offence to the required standard as the adduced evidence was "insufficient, inconsistent and contradictory". In her testimony, the girl informed the court that her father had on several occasions called her to his bedroom, undressed her and defiled her. The court also heard that she was unable to tell anyone as her father had  threatened to kill her if she did. However, following a guidance and counselling session in school, she informed her teacher on how her father had severally abused her sexually. "That he would block her mouth and threaten to kill her if she told anyone. She also stated that the appellant would wash her after each ordeal," court papers read. When put on his defence, the accused denied having anything to do with the incest as he used to leave home early and come back late. He further said the daughter used to sleep with her grandmother. Justice David Majanja thus reduced the life sentence to 20 years. “The appeal is dismissed save that the life sentence imposed is quashed and set aside and substituted with a sentence of 20 years imprisonment from the date of arraignment,” Majanja ruled on Tuesday.
