Gengetone artistes Ethic claim Octopizzo refused to collabo with them in their new album. Octopizzo is never afraid to call out anyone when they come for him. It all started when Ethic tweeted, claiming Khaligraph is greater than Octopizzo ,and this caught his attention. He commented on the post, asking them if this is hate brewing because he refused to jump on a track with them. “Aaah is it because I refused to jump on your project or? Anyway, it is life. Wakiritho. Ta!Ta!” Octopizzo said. To which Ethic replied, “We gave Octopizzo the privilege to be on our super dope album but hakuona vision, truth ni numbers ziko but angekuja tu na zile mathogothanio zake, video for the song wasn’t part of the plan… All in all, watch out June 13th album dropping, ‘Big Man Bado odinare' Ni mbwaya ni moto.”
