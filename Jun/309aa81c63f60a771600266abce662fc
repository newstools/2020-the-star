Police in Kisii on Tuesday opened up investigations into the death of a catechist in Mosocho, Kitutu Chache South. Villagers say the 63-year-old David Gisemba took his life by hanging himself in his house, an incident that has baffled them. Catholic faithful were still flocking to his homestead in Nyoero area, Bonyagatani location, yesterday to mourn him. The deceased's son, Simon Gisemba, said they had yet to know the motive of his father’s suicide. He said he was doing household chores when he heard a commotion in the house and he ran to find out what was happening, only to see his father hanging on a rope. " I tried to save his life but it was too late. We do not know the motive because he did not show any signs of depression," Simon said. Area chief Jared Oyaro suspects that marital conflict could have caused the death. The police said Gisemba did not leave a suicide note but was seen handing some money to one of his sons shortly before he entered his house to hang himself. His body was taken to Kisii Teaching and Referral Hospital mortuary. Elsewhere, police in Ogembo arrested one suspect in the gruesome defilement of a 14-year-old student at a funeral in Tendere on Thursday night. County police commander Jebel Munene said they have arrested one suspect but three are on the run. The student, who is recovering at Ogembo Hospital, said about four men, among them her uncle, dragged her to a maize farm near the home where a funeral was taking place and defiled her in turns. She was found lying unconscious the following day and rushed to hospital. Gender activists have since stepped up pressure to have the suspects face justice. Edited by Frank Obonyo
