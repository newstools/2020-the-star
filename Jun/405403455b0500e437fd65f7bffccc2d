Mathare United chairman Bob Munro yesterday threw a spanner into the works,saying the clubs will have the final say in as far as the Kenyan Premier League contract is concerned. He said by virtue of the fact that the 18 clubs are shareholders in KPL,they will have to be consulted before any decision touching on the contract is made. “The 18 clubs are key stakeholders and Football Kenya Federation will have to consult them before making any move in as far as the top flight league is concerned,” said Munro The incumbent federation chief Nick Mwendwa is on record insisting that KPL will not be handed fresh mandate to oversee the competition after September 24. Munro, who is one of founders of KPL, told FKF to consider the voices of clubs before renewing the contract or sourcing for another company to run the league. Munro's sentiments comes barely two days after Gor Mahia chief executive officer Lodvick Aduda appealed to clubs to resist attempts to enrol them in a different league before all details are made public. Aduda is gunning to oust Mwendwa from the FKF top post in the elections set to be conducted once coronavirus fades. Munro maintained that Sony Sugar problems were as a result of poor governance by the federation as well as congested fixtures they were subjected to, in the 2018 season, which he said drained their coffers. At the same time, Munro blamed the federation for the financial problems bedevilling the top flight clubs. He regretted the unceremonious exit of SuperSport for the financial conundrums the clubs and KPL find themselves and the worrying lows Kenyan football had sunk to. The South African broadcaster terminated its contract with KPL in April 2017, citing a breach of contract after FKF successfully managed to step up the composition of the league from 16 to 18 teams. He said the transformation to align to the Fifa calendar was also done haphazardly without putting into consideration the financial capability of the KPL clubs.
