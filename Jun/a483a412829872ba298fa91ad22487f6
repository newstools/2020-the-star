Speaking on Citizen TV on Monday, Kagwe said when some Kenyans try to beat the system it gets frustrating. "Sometimes it gets frustrating. My mother is in Nairobi since this coronavirus started. When you see people who are trying to beat the system by flouting the government directives it can get frustrating" Kagwe said. Kagwe said people take directives for granted adding that when there is a lockdown frustrations pile up. "You start asking yourself, what are these people going to eat... there lies the frustration... as a human being you do sometimes lose your cool and it happens sometimes," he added.
