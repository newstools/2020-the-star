The Director of Public Prosecution Noordin Haji has approved the arrest and prosecution of a police officer accused of fatally shooting a 13-year-old boy in Huruma, Nairobi. Haji said on Tuesday that police officer Duncan Ndiema Ndiwah is linked to the death of Yasin Hussein Moyo. Yasin was shot on his home balcony on March 30 in Kiamaiko, during the curfew implementation. Haki Africa Executive director Hussein Khalid had criticised the police for using force during the implementation of the dusk-to-dawn order. Khalid had said that Yasin was killed 20 minutes from the onset of the first day of the curfew on MarchÂ  27. Yasin's mother cried for justice, saying that it would have been better for her child to die from the coronavirus disease, rather than from a police officer's bullet who was firing, ostensibly to keep people home to prevent spread of the virus. Yasin was a standard eight student at Ndururuno Primary School and was at home like other students after the government closed all the learning institutions. His family had earlier called upon the office of the Interior CS Fred Matiang'i to invervene and ensure that they get justice. haji had also asked the Inspector General of Police Hilary Mutyambai to investigate the matter. On Tuesday, the Independent Policing Oversight Authority said that 15 people have been killed since the onset of curfew order. Ipoa said the 15 deaths are among 87 complaints against the police it has received since March 27.
