Lafey MP Abdi Mude has urged the police to immediately arrest suspected defilers. On Saturday, two girls aged 14 and 15 were raped in Fino. The girls are hospitalised but are in stable condition. Mude urged the government to beef up security following numerous attacks on wananchi. “Amid lockdowns and epidemics, crime has not stopped across the country. Assault cases are reported daily, especially about children and other vulnerable groups. The police should arrest and prosecute offenders,” he said. Two weeks ago Education CS George Magoha expressed concerns over increased defilement cases, many of which go unreported. Amina Gedow, a rights activist in Mandera, said some cases go unreported because wananchi are either compromised or do not trust the justice system. On Sunday, a police officer and two al Shabaab militants were killed during a gunfight in Lafey, Mandera county. According to police, an unknown number of al Shabaab gunmen wanted to destroy a Safaricom mast in Warankara but were repulsed by National Police Reservists. County police commander Jeremiah Kosiom said police will enhance security in the area and urged for cooperation from the public. The county, which borders Somalia, has suffered numerous attacks by militants who disappear immediately after carrying out an attack. Hundreds of police officers and civilians have been killed.
