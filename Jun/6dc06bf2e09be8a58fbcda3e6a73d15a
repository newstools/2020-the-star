Three Kenya Power Company employees in Mombasa have tested positive for Covid-19, the company's managing director Bernard Ngugi has said. In a statement sent to newsrooms on Tuesday evening, Ngugi said three employees are currently receiving medical attention in an isolation facility. “The three employees have been isolated and are under medical treatment and psychological support as they recover,” said Ngugi. The MD said following the occurrence, all the employees on the first floor of Kenya Power Electricity House in Mombasa have undergone Covid-19 test. “Employees working on the first floor of the building and banking hall have also been requested to stay home for one week as they await results and health check clearance before resuming duty,” he said. The entire building has also been fumigated. Last week, the Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB) closed its Mvita Branch in Mombasa after one of its employees contracted the disease. Positive cases of Covid-19 in Mombasa stood at 517 as of Tuesday. Last month. the National Emergency Response Committee was asked to review cases in the Coastal region, with a likelihood that the government may impose stiffer measures to curb the virus spread. Kenya Ports Authority principal public relations officer Hajji Masemo had said the authority had received 1,000 testing kits. Masemo said that KPA was testing 200 employees per day. A statement from acting KPA managing director said the authority had scaled up efforts to curb coronavirus. Some of the actions taken include conducting wide-scale fumigation to disinfect most areas within the port, mandatory screening and disinfecting of all cargo ships and crew, all offices and the Marine Control Tower Unit which was also fumigated.
