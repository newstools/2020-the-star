Deputy President William Ruto on Thursday distributed various equipment to 30 youth and women groups from Embakasi Central, Starehe and Langata constituencies in Karen, Nairobi. The equipment included shoe shining stands, washing machines, saloon items and tailoring machines in a program that is targeting 5,000 young entrepreneurs. Ruto said that the first step being taken will determine the ambition being pursued by each group. The DP added that he is celebrating Kenyans who have remained focused to achieving their dreams despite the setbacks they are encountering. “I celebrate all Kenyans who resist all setbacks; who refuse to be discouraged; who are not willing to let their dreams die. I know what dreams are and I salute everyone who is taking the first step towards their dream,” Ruto said. Ruto had previously met with 30 youth and women groups from Dagoreti South, Embakasi North and Embakasi West. He provided them with car washing machines, motorcycles, water tanks and animal feed, saying that the small micro-enterprises run by the youth and women have been greatly affected since coronavirus was reported in the country. The DP said the revival of this sector is fundamental to the overall economic recovery of the country.
