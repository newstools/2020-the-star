Kakamega Senator Cleophas Malala has brushed off his expulsion from the ANC party. Malala was kicked out from Amani National Congress following a special National Delegates meeting held on Friday morning. The party led by former presidential candidate Musalia Mudavadi accused the first-time senator of being disloyal to the party and its leader. The party said it had followed due process, including inviting the senator to appear before the disciplinary committee of the party, which he declined. "As I was presiding over the proposed impeachment of Governor Anne Waiguru, some funny people were hiding in some cocoon planning to remove me as senator for Kakamega," Malala said. "I want to remind the people that I am the Kakamega senator and will stay to be so." Malala spoke when he briefed the Senate on the acquittal of Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru on Friday afternoon. The senator chaired the Senate committee on Waiguru’s impeachment. The committee acquitted Waiguru, saying the accusations against her were unsubstantiated. Malala and the ANC leadership have been on the warpath following the senator’s stand, especially on the Building Bridges Initiative about which he has publicly differed with Mudavadi. The lawmaker abandoned the party last year when he declared support for a rival candidate in the Kibra by-elections where the ODM party won. The ANC meeting also resolved to adopt a new party constitution and extended the term of office for all party officials. Edited by Henry Makori
