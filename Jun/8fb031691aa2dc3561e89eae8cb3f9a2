 A Covid-19 patient who fled from Uasin Gishu county has been arrested in Bungoma and put in isolation. Bungoma Health executive Antony Walela said the man was among 26 truck drivers who tested positive at the Turbo testing centre. He however sneaked away before he could be isolated. Walela said they were notified by their counterparts in Uasin Gishu of the fleeing driver. “He was driving his truck towards Uganda in disregard of his condition and we managed to arrest him in Webuye town,” Walela said. The truck driver of the Somali origin is from Eastleigh in Nairobi. He was put into isolation at the Webuye Subcounty Hospital. “We thank God for our colleagues for alerted us on time or else this guy would have knowingly infected people with Covid-19 without their knowledge,” Walela said. Walela said another truck driver from Meru county who had been isolated at the Webuye facility had recovered. He was discharged. Another from Vihiga is still in isolation. “We discharged one of the two truck drivers after he tested negative for coronavirus. One is still in isolation and we now have two, including the new case,” Walela said. He asked residents to take care of themselves by adhering to government directives of wearing face masks, sanitising hands and social distancing to curb the spread of the virus.  Edited by P.O
