Vanessa Mdee and Rotimi have been posting photos and videos of their love journey on social media. Just the other day, the Hollywood actor surprised Vee Money on her 32nd birthday. He bought her flowers, balloons and a cake. “You deserve this, my love. Had to come up with something while you were sleeping 🔥❤️,” Rotimi wrote. “Corona can’t stop my baby from enjoying her birthday. Love you, Queen. Had to figure something out 😂. But she deserves the world. Best year of my life ❤️.” Vanessa Mdee shared the surprise video and wrote, “He is my ultimate gift, the greatest blessing. Glory to God.” Tanzanian actress Wema Sepetu has praised the couple. “Talk about my Favorite Couple...asked them to get married. Nawaombea muoane na kipenzi cha moyo wako. You guys are too cute for words. Bless you, abundantly babe. Kisses…😘😘😘’ Love looks so good on you. And on your Birthday I wish u more Love…” Vanessa and Rotimi are quarantining together in the United States. The two met in July last year at the Essence Music Festival, where they both performed. Rotimi was with his then-girlfriend while Vanessa had just broken up with singer Juma Jux.
