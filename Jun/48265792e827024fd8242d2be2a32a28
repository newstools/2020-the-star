As the world continues to condemn the murder of African American George Floyd at the hands of a white policeman, a Kenyan artiste has joined in and paid tribute using art. An artist in Kibra, who goes by the moniker Detail Seven, painted a picture of the outcome of police brutality using graffiti. Floyd succumbed after the policeman put his knee on his neck for an extended period of time, despite him saying he couldn't breathe. The officer and three others who were with him were all arrested, the former charged with second degree murder. They were fired. Detail Seven also wrote the names of individuals who succumbed due to police brutality. Ipoa on Wednesday said at least 15 Kenyans have died as a result of police brutality during enforcement of the dusk-to-dawn curfew. Here are some of the murals painted by Detail Seven. On Tuesday DPP Noordin Haji ordered the arrest of the officer accused of killing 13-year-old Yasin Moyo during endorcement of the curfew. Moyo was on his house balcony when he was shot.
