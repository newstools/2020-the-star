A woman was on Monday arraigned at a Kibera court for allegedly creating a disturbance by insulting tenants in Parklands, Nairobi. Padma Reva Lakhani was charged before Kibera senior principal magistrate Derrick Kuto. She denied the charges. Lakhani is accused that on June 21 at Golden Crest apartment, Parklands, within Nairobi county, she created a disturbance in a manner likely to breach the peace by insulting the tenants. She allegedly insulted tenants in houses D2, D3, D4,D6, D7 and D8Â  in the apartments. According to the police reports, the accused person insulted a tenant at night, who remained indoors until the following day. Early the following day, the accused again insulted others who decided to report to the police. The police report shows that Lakhani had been reported earlier for the same offence but the matter was not taken to court to give her time to reform. After pleading not guilty to the charges, the magistrate released her on Sh50,000 bond or Sh30,000 bail. Kuto directed the matter to be mentioned on July 23. Edited by Henry Makori
