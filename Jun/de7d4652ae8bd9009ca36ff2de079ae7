The National Environment Management Authority (NEMA) has given Strategic Environment Assessment approval to the second phase of Tatu City to meet the demand for businesses, homes and social amenities. The NEMA approval now paves the way for Tatu City to develop on a 2,500-acre piece of land designated for large-scale affordable housing and businesses. The city’s first phase, also 2,500 acres, has more than 50 businesses operating or developing, two schools open educating 3,000 students daily and more than 5,000 homes delivered or under construction.
