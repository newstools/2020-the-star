AFC Leopards technical bench have been handed a boost ahead of the much awaited football  resumption following the return of versatile midfielder Marvin Nabwire. The talented rookie has been battling injuries since December 2018 after suffering a nasty knee injury which culminated into a surgery in April last year. Despite resuming light training in November last year and consequently making his way back to the squad the following month,his bid to cement his place in the starting team was thwarted by another injury in February. The former Kakamega High School alumnus, who was eyeing to net at least 10 goals in the second leg of the 2019-2020 season, sprained his muscles while on duty against Kisumu All Stars and was ruled out for a unspecified period. The break, triggered by the threat posed by coronavirus, has however, proved be a blessing in disguise for Nabwire as he has since recovered and will be available for selection when action resumes. Sporting and public gatherings remain suspended as a precaution measure employed by the government to stop to the spread of the virus. “Nabwire is back on his feet again and we are looking forward to see him compete for playing time in the midfield. It was unfortunate that we lost him in February; months after recovering from a career-threatening injury but the medics have cleared him. We hope he will not suffer another setback in the new season and he will rediscover his form as well as inject competition in the midfield,” said the club chairman Dan Shikanda.
