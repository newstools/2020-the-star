Bunyala deputy county commissioner Jacob Ruto has appealed to well-wishers to donate food to flood victims in various IDP camps across the subcounty. Ruto said the food the national government had distributed to 60 IDP camps had been exhausted. He spoke at Bunyala subcounty headquarters on Tuesday during the distribution of relief food to over 40 secondary school teachers in Budalang'i constituency who had been affected by floods. Ruto said distributing relief food to over 40,000 flood victims requires a lot of money, and if the burden is left to the national government alone, then they (victims) are likely to starve to death. “It is not known when they [flood victims] will return to their homes, so I am calling upon well-wishers to volunteer and donate more relief food to those in need,” the deputy county commissioner said. Ruto said apart from the relief food, the flood victims whose houses have been damaged by the floodwaters need materials to enable them rebuild their houses. “Most of the flood victims had their houses totally damaged and that is why I am further appealing to well-wishers to come out and assist them on humanitarian grounds,” Ruto said.
