Elders have raised concerns over increased modern architecture in Lamu Old Town, a cultural heritage centre. The town was listed as a World Heritage Site by Unesco in 2001 owing to its well-preserved Swahili culture. The requirements of any place listed as a world heritage site are that it maintains its originality, especially the architecture and culture. Members of the Lamu Council of Elders, however, noted that the majority of buildings and structures being put up in Lamu do not adhere to regulations laid down by Unesco. Even the older buildings are being modernised. In 2014, the town was placed on the World Monuments Watch by Unesco as being under threat from westernisation, forces of nature and the impact of social, political and economic change. The elders said that even after being placed on the watch list, the threat to its heritage continues to increase. Deputy chairperson Mohamed Mbwana said their main concern is that the westernised architecture will soon overtake Lamu's heritage and render it extinct if conservation measures aren’t effected soon enough. “We are calling upon the county government to ensure they vet every new building or structure before its put up and ensure the plan corresponds to the requirements of a heritage site,” Mbwana said. The elders have also urged the county and national governments to work with the National Museums of Kenya and formulate regulations that will promote and preserve the county’s culture and heritage. They also wondered why a pledge by the county government of Lamu to set up a Sh6 million cultural centre in Mokowe, Lamu West, in 2019 to serve the same purpose has yet to materialise. Edited by A.N
