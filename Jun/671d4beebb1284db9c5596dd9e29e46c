St. Peters Mumias School is set to become a volleyball powerhouse with the arrival of veteran volleyball coach Rashid Makokha to take charge of the team. Makokha, who formerly set a record of turning around things at Lugulu Girls and Mukumu Girls said he was ready to take the challenge of working with the boys’ team this time round and make sure the desired goals and results are achieved. “I am grateful for the school administration under the principal Cosmas Nabongolo and the community for a warm welcome and the orientation which has made me settle very fast," said Makokha. “I have analysed the team and I believe it's good enough to compete with other teams at all levels. We now want to roll out our sleeves and get to business, it’s a process but with good structures at our disposal we have what it takes to succeed." “But this does not mean we exert pressure on the players.  We want to help them become strong and fit both mentally and physically as we focus on our goals,” said Makokha. Makokha managed to assist Mukumu and Lugulu win titles at the national level and produced many stars who have remained dominant in national teams. “We are using this break to analyse the players through recorded previous matches and training sessions and am so impressed. We have the potential to succeed and get this team far," he added. “It’s good to work with great and experienced technical bench members who are well informed and ready to sacrifice. I believe together we can establish a strong and formidable side.” St. Peters, which is commonly known for rugby and soccer is putting structures in place to ensure that they excel in other disciplines like hockey, volleyball and basketball.
