For Mama Christine Sang, nutrition and healthcare were her calling as she worked for decades to improve lives. She was a health pioneer in Nandi where she established the county's first nutrition centre at Kapsabet District Hospital. She practised patient-centred healthcare before it became the norm. Mama Christine died last week at the age of 82. The outpouring of tributes from numerous personalities attests to her contribution to improving health standards countrywide. Those who paid tribute included former Vice President Kalonzo Musyoka, Environment CS Keriako Tobiko, Cherangany MP Joshua Kutuny, Rongai MP Raymond Moi and Kiprono Kittony, chairman of Radio Africa Group. “Mama Christine was an industrious mother, grandmother and health professional. A matriarch who served her community for many years at Kapsabet District Hospital,” Deputy President William Ruto said. The fruits of her work at the Kapsabet District Hospital, now  Kapsabet County Referral Hospital, are evident to this day. The Nutrition Centre is a key aspect of the county's health system. Four nutritionists are employed. Due to the foundation Mama Christine laid, the centre has helped to reduce non-communicable diseases by promoting good nutrition and dietary strategies for diabetes, cardiovascular disease and other ailments. She mentored many young nurses and other health professionals. To many patients, she was a mother who treated them with love and compassion. In an era when patient-centred healthcare was not yet recognised, Mama Christine would always approach her patients with a wide smile to lift their spirits. She was laid to rest at the weekend at her home in Ol Lessos Koilot, Nandi county. Though she is gone, Mama Christine's legacy lives on. (Edited by V. Graham)
