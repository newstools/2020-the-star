A suspected arson attack on ANC's Kakamega office on Sunday night left a store destroyed. The perpetrators are yet to be identified. Speaking on Monday to the media, branch chairman Julius Arunga said that the arsonists broke one of the windows and doused the inside with petrol before lighting the fire. "Fortunately, only the store was burnt but the rest of documents and other items are intact. We don't want to speculate, but it is not a coincidence, " Arunga said. Arunga said that the burnt store was holding some of the materials that were used during the 2017 General Election. "It's unclear what somebody would want in an office like ours with very little assets," he said. Branch chief executive officer Isaac Otiende said the fire has no strategic effect on the day to day running of the party. Only ANC and independence party Kanu have physical offices in Kakamega town. ODM operates from the county government headquarters. Jubilee operated from former MP Manyala Kenya's hotel in the town during the last elections.
