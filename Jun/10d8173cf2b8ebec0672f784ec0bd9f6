This year’s Bukusu circumcision ceremony has been postponed due to the Covid-19 pandemic, elders have said. This follows consultations between the council of elders and county's Health department. Bukusu boys usually undergo the cut in August and December of every even year. The rite marks the transition of boys into manhood. It involves ringing bells known as 'Chinyimba' and vigorous dancing in preparation for the circumcision day. The ceremony involves people dancing and taking a local brew known as busaa, a prime setting for the spread of the coronavirus. The Bukusu are one of the Bantu tribes in Kenya and the largest sub-tribe in the Luhya community. "I held a meeting with all the elders from the communities that practise circumcision and we have agreed to postpone the ceremonies due to fear of Covid-19 spread," Bungoma Gender, Culture and Sports executive Everlyne Kakai said. She spoke to the Star after a meeting with elders from Bukusu, Sabaot, Batura and Tachoni communities. Joseph Omukolongolo, chairman for initiators (Balusanya) in Bungoma warned those insisting on carrying on with the ceremony to stop. He said this is a bad year for the Bukusu and other communities to carry out circumcision as it portends a bad omen. "I plead with health officers not to allow circumcision to take place," he said. Sinino criticised some churches for carrying out circumcision, saying they are misleading the community. He urged village elders, chiefs and assistant county commissioners to ensure that boys are not allowed to prepare for the ceremony, a process called 'Khukhupa chinyimba'. Bukusu Council of Elders chairman Richard Walukano said the community never carries out circumcision during pandemics. “Those who are insisting on circumcising their boys should know that they are cursing their own children," he said.
