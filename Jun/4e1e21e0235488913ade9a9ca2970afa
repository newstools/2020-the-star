The Vihiga government is conducting a headcount to establish the exact number of employees it has, Public Service and Administration executive Pamela Kimwele has said. The drive will also help Vihiga clean up the county payroll which officials claim has been manned by cartels for the past two financial years, leading to a bloated wage bill. “We are also planning to have a biometric machine linked to GIS where your fingerprint will be required while signing in and out,” she said on the phone. The drive started last week on Thursday. Kimwele said they are working with the County Public Service Board (CPSB) to check on the qualifications and work experience of the staff. “Once the CPSB has captured all the relevant information and qualifications of the staff, the employees will be placed in relevant dockets as per their papers and experience to end incompetence queries,” Kimwele said. She said Governor Wilber Ottichilo has been complaining of incompetence and unqualified staff across the board. “The governor wants everything put in order, and he has given timelines,” Kimwele said.
