Foreign Affairs CAS Ababu Namwamba will represent Kenya at late Burundi President Pierre Nkurunziza's funeral. This was confirmed by Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka when he was at Jubilee Party's headquarters on Wednesday to sign a cooperation agreement between the parites. Details of the funeral are yet to be released by the Burundi government. Kalonzo wished President Uhuru Kenyatta the best, following a statement on Monday that four officers at State House were confirmed to have Covid-19. Uhuru and the First family tested negative. Nkurunziza died of Covid-19, according to diplomatic sources. In a presidential proclamation last Friday, Uhuru said all flags in public buildings, grounds and wherever else throughout the entire territory in the country and at all of Kenya’s Diplomatic Missions abroad shall heed the directive. "In solidarity with our brothers and sisters in the Republic of Burundi, the wider EAC and the whole of Africa who are in deep mourning at the loss of a Great Son of Africa I, Uhuru Kenyatta, under the authority vested in me as the President of the Republic of Kenya, do hereby order and direct that in memory of the Late President Pierre Nkurunziza, and in solemn solidarity and mourning; the Flag of the East African Community and the Flag of the Republic of Kenya shall be flown at half-mast from dawn on Saturday, 13 until sunset on the day of his interment," Uhuru said.
