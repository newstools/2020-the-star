This year's farmers field day at Wambugu Agricultural Training Centre in Nyeri  might be held virtually due to the coronavirus outbreak. Principal David Kariuki said if the government maintained the partial lockdown and ban on public gatherings, the field day would be broadcast live on TV and radio. The lockdown and ban on public gatherings was imposed by the government following the Covid-19 pandemic in the country. Kariuki told the Star on Tuesday the field day is slated for July 24 and 25. The event has been held continuously for 17 years. It is organised through funding by various stakeholders and attracts about 200 exhibitors and over 50,000 farmers and learners. The field day is among the highly attended in the country and attracts participants from almost all 47 counties. It is usually held on the last Friday and Saturday of July yearly. Kariuki who is the secretary of the stakeholders’ forum has written to them about this year's event. “I take this opportunity to sincerely thank you for your continued support and participation in our annual field day event that has been held successfully in the last 17 years,” he said. Other activities interrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic include monthly meetings that were held by stakeholders to plan for the field days. The meetings were held from February to July. Kariuki said due to Covid-19, this year’s meetings were disrupted apart from the first one held in February. Only the secretariat has been meeting to organise the field day, he noted. “We are happy to report that many companies have a good crop in the field and are taking care of it in anticipation of the field day,” he noted. He said holding the event virtually would enable the forum reach farmers and maintain the field day tradition. It would also enable the companies that have invested in crop demonstrations make use of their investment. Edited by Henry Makori
