The Bomet administration will spend Sh64 million to fix water lines damaged at Kapletundo ward in Sotik two years ago. The water lines were destroyed during the construction of roads by the national government in the area. More than 4,000 residents were disconnected as a result. The county sources the water for distribution from Itare River. Water county executive Peter Tonui said the funds will be used to buy pipes and for general works to be undertaken on the damaged lines. Tonui said the tender for the works has already been awarded and the contractor will begin installing the pipes this week. The works should be finalised in a month. The project is a reprieve for residents who have for the last two years had difficulties getting water for domestic and commercial use. Governor Hillary Barchok said Friday additional funds will be set aside to connect more residents to the water lines. “We are targeting to reach 8,000 customers but we will have to seek for more funds to enable us to realise the aspiration,” he said. Barchok said youths will be engaged in the casual jobs to be created by the project. “We have asked the contractor to utilise the local youth so as to help them earn as well as put their skills to good use,” he said.
