The Nairobi Securities Exchange has launched a dynamic mobile app to enhance investors’ participation in Kenya’s capital market. The app is designed to provide market participants with convenient, faster and real-time access to the Exchange’s activities. It features market snapshots, stock prices, market analytics, financial news and is a gateway to stockbroker apps. “The delivery of this mobile app is consistent with NSE's intent to offer uninterrupted services amid the current situation and government directives put in place to mitigate effects of the pandemic,” NSE chairman Sam Kimani said. Kimani added that as the country fights a health crisis, there was a need to put in place measures to support trading in the market while ensuring they adhere to the health protocols of the government. “The Government commends such strategies which place special focus on enhancing technology, innovation, financial inclusion and financial literacy across private sector players in the country,” said Maureen Mbaka. Mbaka is the Chief Administrative Secretary, Ministry of ICT, Innovation and Youth. The NSE has also undertaken strategic measures to ensure local and foreign investors have uninterrupted access to Capital Market services in Kenya. The NSE commissioned the upgrade of the NSE app to incorporate advanced features aimed at ensuring investors continue to access and invest in the stock market remotely through the application. “With the upgrade, the app will be a gateway to the Online Share Trading and Mobile Trading Apps offered by the various trading participants. First, the platform ensures convenience and accessibility to any investor with a mobile phone,” Kimani said. The NSE App is available free of charge on both Google Play store and IOS. (Edited by V.
