Gospel musician and former Tusker Project Fame winner Ruth Matete now says she is 'done' trying to get her late husband’s body for burial. In a letter, Matete informed the Nigerian Embassy that she is no longer interested in John Apewajoye’s body and shall no longer lay a claim on it. Apewajoye died after a few days in hospital after a gas leaked and caught fire at their Great Wall apartments house in Athi River. Matete was at first suspected to have had a hand in his death before an autopsy report showed that the husband had died from 60 per cent burns to his upper body. The singer through her lawyer said she can no longer afford the mortuary bill as the Nigerian Embassy continues to detain the body with no explanations. The body has been laying at the Kenyatta National hospital for almost two months now weeks following a request by the Nigerian High Commission to have it detained until the Nigerian government approves its release. Nigerian authorities believe the ongoing investigations into Apewajoye’s death by the DCI in Kenya may lead to something that will bring the matter to a closure. After weeks of trying to have the body released, Matete through her lawyer Robert Odanga has ruled out on moving to court to compel the Nigeria Embassy in Nairobi to foot the morgue fees and release the body. “You can hold the body and do with it as you please,” reads part of the letter. Odanga said the embassy has become dismissive, unwelcoming and hostile towards Matete and her representatives leaving her sad and frustrated. He also indicated that Matete only wanted her husband laid to rest so that he can have closure and peace during her pregnancy but the embassy has denied her that. “She will now try to move on and should not be contacted by anyone in regard to the burial,” said Odanga.
