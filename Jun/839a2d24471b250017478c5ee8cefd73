Meru County Senator Mithika Linturi has said the claims that Deputy President William Ruto allies have created their new party is just reports based on the media. He said political parties that are in the country have been registered by the office of the Registrar of Political parties and Jubilee Asili is not one of them. In an interview on Citizen TV on Tuesday night, the senator said that Jubilee Asili is just a mere office where Jubilee party MPs who cannot access the party headquarters can meet and comfort one another. "What I know is that there is an office where the like-minded people have decided that they must hire so that those people who cannot access the Jubilee Headquarters to sit down to brainstorm and to try to at least to comfort one another," Linturi said. Ruto had met MPs who were recently dewhipped by the party from various positions in both the Senate and the National Assembly. Ruto also posted a new slogan - 'Sote Pamoja'. The MPs retweeted a tweet by the DP quoting it with the same slogan in the clearest indication yet that they were done with the Jubilee Party. This comes just days after the party signed cooperation agreements with Kalonzo Musyoka's Wiper Party and Issac Rutto's Chama cha Mashinani. 'Tuko Pamoja' has been the Jubilee slogan which President Uhuru Kenyatta and Ruto used to rally Kenyans behind the Jubilee Party in the last election. Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen had also dismissed that they had formed a party. "Ignore the rumors doing rounds. Jubilee Party is our party, our labour of love and visionary investment, whose fruits we look forward to enjoying." Murkomen added that "Jubilee Asili Centre is the meeting venue for and by members who have been denied access to our party office on Thika Road.Tuko Sote Pamoja!"
