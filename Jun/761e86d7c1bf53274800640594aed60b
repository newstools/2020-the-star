Comedian Zeddy has slammed celebrities for their hypocrisy after the death of comedian Kasee (Joseph Kivindu). "I see celebrities posting RIP Case. This is hypocrisy and it must stop," she wrote on social media. "If you can't help me while I am alive, please leave me alone when I die. Do not post me, let my fans do. It is good for people to know what drives comedians to commit suicide." Kasee breathed his last on Sunday evening while on his way home to beat the 9pm curfew. Comedians in Kenya Society chairman Ken Waudo painted a picture of what Comedian Kasee’s last moments were like. “First reports indicate he drank poisoned drink, but police are to give comprehensive reports of the same,” he said. Kasee is survived by a wife and two children.
