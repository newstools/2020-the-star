The pump price for super petrol has increased by Sh5.77 per litre in the latest review by the Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority. That of diesel and kerosene has decreased by Sh3.80 and Sh17.31 per litre respectively. Until July 14, motorists will pay Sh89.10 for a litre of petrol in Nairobi, Sh74.57 for diesel and Sh62.46 for a litre of kerosene. Petrol has increased from Sh83.33 a litre that it has retailed for in the past one month in Nairobi. Diesel drops from Sh78.37 a litre while Kerosene, used for lighting and cooking by poor households, has dropped from Sh79.77 a litre. “The computation of the pump prices has taken into account the changes effected by the Tax Laws (Amendment) Act of 2020 that made taxes and duties part of the vatable amount in the calculation of VAT for petroleum fuels, EPRA director general Pavel Oimele said in a statement. The changes in this month’s prices are as a result of the average landed cost of imported super petrol increasing by 31.54 per cent from $188.70 per cubic meter in April 2020 to $248.21 per cubic meter in May, he said. “Diesel decreasing by 5.58 per cent from $242.13 to $228.62 per cubic meter and Kerosene decreasing by 51.84 per cent from $262.44 per cubic meter to $126.39 per cubic meter,” Oimeke said. Over the same period, the mean monthly US Dollar to Kenya Shilling exchange rate appreciated by 0.17 per cent from Sh106.83 per dollar in April to Sh106.65 in May. The increase in petrol does not come as a surprise as last week, EPRA had warned against hoarding of fuel products in anticipation for a price increase. The regulator reported an artificial shortage in Western Kenya. Nairobi, Mombasa and other major towns were also affected.
