The Nyeri county government has allocated Sh40 million to post-Covid-19 economic recovery. Finance CEC Robert Thuo said the money is meant to assist in economic recovery after the pandemic. The strategy is undertaken with the support of development partners such as the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change. The institute will work together with the county government in developing an action plan that will cushion residents against the adverse effects of Covid-19. The institute will help the county with Covid-19 sensitisation, resource mobilisation, social protection response, public health response and service delivery. The Institute for Global Change was initiated by Blair, the former prime minister of Britain to help leaders across the globe build strong crisis response systems. “The emphasis of the recovery strategy will be on those initiatives that are sustainable while creating employment opportunities for our people,” he said. “Towards this economic recovery strategy, we need to adopt an agenda for prosperity through budget implementation issues.” Finance CEC Thuo said there was a need to lay strategies to improve the county own revenue mobilisation. He said the county needed to adopt strategies on value addition of agricultural produce to not only create employment but also generate revenue. The County, he added, should adopt a strategy of rebranding so as to attract tourists and investment. Edited by Henry Makori
