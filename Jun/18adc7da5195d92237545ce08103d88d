President Uhuru Kenyatta has asked the international community to ensure all lives are protected. Uhuru on Thursday said there should be no targeted oppression on any group in the society. While speaking during a virtual meeting of the Atlantic Council, Uhuru said global partners must ensure that the rule of law is applied equally to all. "All lives matter and there should be no targeted oppression on any group in the society. We encourage all our partners across the globe, we need one another because when  two communities or people of different race clash it becomes an expensive idea," Uhuru said. Uhuru said Kenya learnt bitter lessons from the 2007-08  post-election violence and would not wish for any country to take that route. "We must understand that we live together, no community or race  should feel superior to the other. The rule of law must be observed and applied in equal measures," he said. Uhuru said the current Black lives matter protests have been escalated across the globe because others feel the laws are being overhanded on one grouping and not the other. There have been protests in various countries following the killing of  African Americans by white police in the US. George Floyd was murdered after police held him to the ground with his knee on the neck for close to nine minutes. This sparked violence across US states, with other countries staging demos in solidarity. There have also been protests following the fatal shooting of an African American - Rayshard Brooks- as he tried to run away from police who tried to arrest him.
