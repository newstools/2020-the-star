Top artistes from the continent are set to headline the second edition of the #WeareoneAfrica series of virtual concerts. The concerts will be streaming live every Saturday at 10pm EAT on all WAOAfrica platforms, including YouTube, Facebook and Instagram. The virtual concerts are a series of virtual events curated in partnership with Amref Health Africa for the sole purpose of fighting corona as a continent through entertainment. The campaign will seek to inspire audiences to support the front liners and vulnerable communities and further create awareness during these unprecedented times. For the warm-up edition, #WeareoneAfrica hosted Khaligraph, Gilad and Bien from Sauti Sol, who represented Kenya. All the proceeds go to the Amref Health Africa Coronavirus Response Fund.
