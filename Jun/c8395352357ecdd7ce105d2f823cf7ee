Three people charged with possessing elephant tusks worth Sh300,000 have pleaded not to the charges. Jesse Karanja, Ngugi Muigai and Catharine Kambura denied the charges before Kibera senior principal magistrate Derrick Kuto. The charge sheet says that the three committed the offence on June 23  at Shell petrol station in Karen in Nairobi county. The police report says KWS officers received intelligence that some men were looking for someone to buy the elephant tusks. The officers then went to the petrol station and posed as buyers. They met and questioned the sellers and asked if they had a licence to trade in wildlife trophies. They did not. The three were arrested, booked in police cells and arraigned. The suspects were released on a Sh100,000 bond each. The  matter will be mentioned on July 23.
