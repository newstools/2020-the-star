Clerics holding prayers in Matuga with more than 15 people and without observing social distancing will be prosecuted. Deputy county commissioner Isaak Keter said some pastors and imams are violating the rules meant to contain Covid-19. “It has come to my attention that preachers are performing normal prayer services and don’t observe social distancing,” he said. On May 22, the government had allowed clerics to pay minimal visits to places of worship for virtual video recording and limited the number of participants to not more than 15. Keter spoke on Thursday at Kwale administration police headquarters. He said religious leaders visit houses of worship regularly and conduct prayer services more than three times a day. The DCC reiterated that the government regulations on the closure of worship places are still in place. “Let me remind you the rules are active and if you can’t adhere to them, we will arrest you,” he said. Keter said that officers will be making rounds and any clergyman found breaking the law shall be arrested and charged in court. Meanwhile, over 40 litres of illicit brew was destroyed and 20 people were Thursday evening arrested for contravening Covid-19 guidelines. Matuga subcounty police boss Francis Nguli said officer acted on a tip-off from the locals and established dragnet for the suspects. The majority were women from Karanja and Wayani in Golini location. They will appear before the Kwale magistrate's court today. Nguli warned matatu and boda boda operators against breaking the one pillion passenger rule. He said police will seize all bikes and vehicles whose drivers fail to abide by both traffic and public health laws. (edited by o. owino)
