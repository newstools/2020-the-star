An Eldoret court has awarded Sh1.4 million compensation to a man who was castrated by a neighbour in Lugari subcounty last year. Eldoret resident magistrate RK Onkoba awarded Morris Ndimu the money against Henry Mwani, Sammy Dapash, Samuel Karanja and Moses Dapash. In his written submissions through Kitiwa & Partners Advocates, Ndimu had demanded Sh1.5 million from the four for assaulting and injuring his private parts making him unable to father children. Ndimu who had been herding cattle for different people in the community for a living. In his statement, the complainant said the four ambushed him as he went about his house chores on May 24, 2019, grabbed him and forced him into a waiting pick-up before driving him into Everest forest in Likuyani where they assaulted him from 9.30am to 3pm. “Miwani and Dapash removed his trousers and boxer while Henry Shikami with help of the three others reached for my penis and testicles and used pliers to press my genitals three times until I passed out and was rescued by a good Samaritan who was passing by known as Peter Okwara at around 3pm,” he said. “I have suffered injuries as I am a young man who is yet to marry and at this stage being not able to sire children due to the unlawful conduct of the defendants has indeed caused trauma to me.” A medical report filed in court indicated that Ndimu suffered blunt trauma on the penis, testicles, cut wounds on both legs and severe pain occasioning loss of consciousness. Ndimu told the court that he had been assaulted without justification. He said his attackers claimed he had stolen one of Miwani’s cows and promised to teach him a lesson. He reported the matter to Mlimani police post in Mautuma in Lugari where an OB number 7/27/5/2019 and a P3 form were issued. A medical assessment report by Dr Joseph Sokoke of Eldoret indicates that Ndimu suffered 10 per cent permanent disability during the assault. Edited by Henry Makori
