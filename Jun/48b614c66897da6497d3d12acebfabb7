The 2017 world 1,500m champion Elijah Manang'oi will use the virtual race scheduled for June 11th at Nyayo Stadium to gauge his preparedness for the upcoming competitions. Manang'oi is making a comeback to active athletics after suffering a knee injury that denied him the chance to defend his title in Doha last year. The Commonwealth Games champion is focused on the Diamond League in Monaco in August as well as the rescheduled Olympic Games next year. Manag'oi is especially keen on featuring in Tokyo Games having gotten injured during Rio 2016 games. “It is a nice feeling to be back after a long lay off and I seriously need to gauge myself. I have been out since July last year but thank God I am back on my feet. I was disappoint ted to miss World Championships last year. I was mentally drained after pulling out of Doha but God’s great and I am back.” Manang'oi said in as much the coronavirus pandemic has taken a toll on sports, it gave him sufficient time to recover. “Almost all races were either cancelled or postponed and Covid-19 has brought everything to a stand still. It gave me time to train hard and recover fully and I really feel good.” At the same time, the 2018 African champion said he and reigning world champion Timothy Cheruiyot are keen to mentor the upcoming athletes in the specialty. The duo have formed a formidable partnership, which has seen them dominate the scene since 2017. Timothy was the runner-up at the 2017 World Championship and won the event last year in Doha. “We hope to control the 1,500m race for the next three years before passing on the mantle to the younger generation. My younger brother George and others are coming up and will be a force to reckon with going forward.”
