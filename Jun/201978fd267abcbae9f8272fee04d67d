Nyamira County athletes are crying for help following cancellation of their races due to the coronavirus pandemic. The athletes, who train at Embaro Primary School, said they have been forced to   quit training and resorted to doing casual jobs to put food on their table. Through their spokesmen—long distance runners Dickson Simba, Dennis Okenye, Dennis Kiyaka, Eunice Onyancha and Nancy Kerage—they said they have had no choice but to  work in farms and construction sites. “I work at construction sites where I’m paid Sh300 per day. This will help me get money for food to enable me train the following day,” said mountain runner Dennis Kiyaka. They asked the county government of Nyamira to come to their rescue. “We heard through the media that the county has set aside funds to cushion the vulnerable and I guess we fall in that category.  We don’t even have food while some of us have been locked out of our rental houses,” said Kiyaka. Simba and Teresa Omosa have participated in virtual races organised by Austria based Run2gether through manager Thomas Krejci. “The virtual challenges have helped me get some cash. Our management also cushioned us. However, most athletes especially those upcoming ones are suffering,” said Simba. “I won the first challenge which was 10km and came 9th in the 5km race while in the third race a 20km race, I took 60 minutes,” added Simba. Simba also appealed to the Nyamira county government to construct a stadium with a running track. “This county has produced Olympic gold medalists among them Naftali Temu, Charles Asati and Robert Ouko. It is sad that we don’t have even a murram track,” said Simba. Athletics Kenya Nyanza South chairman Peter Angwenyi also asked the county to expedite construction works at Manga Stadium. He also wants another stadium built at Ensoko playground in Borabu Sub County.
