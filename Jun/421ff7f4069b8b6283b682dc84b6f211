The government has closed the dilapidated Uhuru Gardens which has turned bushy and created controversy over activities happening in the memorial park. On Thursday, Sports CS Amina Mohamed announced that the park had been closed for a year for renovation. “The grass is very long and weeds have most of the pathways. After agreeing with museums, we decided that we needed to close it down to take it back to its original form and make sure it retains its glory,” she said. KDF officers were deployed to secure the area on Tuesday. She was accompanied by National Museums of Kenya Director General Mzalendo Kibunjia. The once respected site regarded as sacred has for years remained neglected and now looks like a perfect scene for National Geographic movie. “We need to grow new grass…we need to make sure the place has picnic sites for families so that parents can bring their children and instil a sense of history and a sense of pride,” Amina said while touring the facility. Located along Lang’ata Road, the park contains three monuments; the Fig tree or (Mugumo), the 20th Anniversary Monument and the 25th Anniversary Monument. The Mugumo tree, considered sacred by most Kenyan communities, is now surrounded by tall grass. Most litter bins have rusted and can no longer hold waste. Amina said lack of resources led to neglect of the site. “This is a very hallowed grounds and it’s a shame that the area is in such shape. We want it to be historic and a tourist site because this is our Independence square,” she said. Last month, a video clip circulated widely on social media showing merrymakers dancing and drinking alcohol in the park. Other reports say the place had been turned into a brothel by visitors.
