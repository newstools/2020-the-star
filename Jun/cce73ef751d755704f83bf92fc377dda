The National Cohesion and Integration Commission has summoned Kikuyu gospel artiste Muigai Njoroge over his controversial song Ino migunda about evictions. “You are hereby required to appear at the commission's offices at KMA Centre on 26 June at 10am to assist the commission in ongoing investigations,” a letter signed by NCIC acting secretary Millicent Okatch reads. Should he fail to appear, Njoroge may face contempt proceedings with the requisite consequences. He has said he doesn't intend to offend. “Pursuant to Section 29 of the NCI Act, a summons issued by the commission must be obeyed as if such a summons were issued by the High Court,” NCIC says. Ino Migunda – which loosely translates as 'These pieces of land' – was released on June 15 on Njoroge's official YouTube account. So far it has garnered 650,000 views and stirred controversy as land is an emotive topic. “This land will one day be subdivided equally since it cannot be sliced to pieces for human consumption. A home in Kisumu will be in trouble while screams will be heard from Nyahururu to Kabarak,” the singer says in the song's chorus. According to the NCIC, these words are inflammatory and a threat to national stability and peaceful co-existence. “These words were calculated to be threatening and insulting and likely to affect harmonious coexistence between Kenyan communities contrary to Section 13(1)(a) of the National Cohesion and Integration Commission,” the commission says. This is the second time this year that the musician has ruffled feathers with his songs. His song Tukunia – released in January – attracted admiration and criticism for its lyrics castigating President Uhuru Kenyatta for lack of development in the region. In the song, Njoroge criticises President Kenyatta's sidelining of Deputy President William Ruto, likening it to aborting a seven-month pregnancy. However, in an interview with the Star, he denied that he had been paid by Dr Ruto to release the song.
