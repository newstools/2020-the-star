He said, experience of dealing with other infectious diseases shows stigma undermines at testing and treating the disease. "We must remember at all times that it is the virus which is the enemy not the people infected with Covid-19. We must therefore care for each other, hold each other's hand walk together in this fight, and remember that none of us is free of coronavirus until all of us are free," he said.
