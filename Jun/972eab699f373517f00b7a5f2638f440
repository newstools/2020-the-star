For the last one week, we have seen several politicians who are known foot soldiers of the Deputy President William Ruto running to ODM leader Raila Odinga’s office purportedly to pledge their loyalty. While they are welcome to join those of us who have stood with Baba (Raila) all along and now with President Uhuru Kenyatta through the handshake, Raila should be careful. Some of these people are wolves in sheep’s skin. Some of them are on record saying unprintable words against Raila and therefore it is suspicions that they are streaming to Raila’s camp with all sorts of praises. They will be back-benchers on this side. For the sake of peace and unity, they can join us but let them remember that we will not forget the many times they abused Raila. We have their records. If they could not respect the President when he asked them to stop early campaigns, will they respect Raila ? My victory was stolen in 2017 but I have remained faithful to ODM and Raila. We are now waiting for the Building Bridges Initiative Report and referendum. It is unfortunate that some of these leaders are so unprincipled. They are opportunist. Why change your position now? They have eaten DP’s money as they moved around the country. Ruto has been to their constituencies for various activities and now they are abandoning him. How will they explain that to their supporters?Politicians must learn to measure their words because they might come to haunt them one day.I therefore want to call on my party leader that as much as he wants to embrace these so called new friends, he should listen to the sixth sense. Some of these people are up to no good. Lempurkel, the former MP for Laikipia East, spoke to the Star
