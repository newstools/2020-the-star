Political realignments have begun at the Coast owing to the improved relationship between President Uhuru Kenyatta and Raila Odinga. Raila enjoys massive support in the region. Lands CAS Gideon Mung'aro, a former Coast Jubilee point man and Mombasa businessman Suleiman Shahbal met the former prime minister in his Nairobi office on June 10. Mung'aro is said to be keen on succeeding Governor Amason Kingi in Kilifi, while Shahbal wants to succeed Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho. Mung'aro is a former opposition Minority chief whip who was removed in 2015Â  for shifting loyalty to Uhuru. At the time, he was in ODM and was Kilifi North MP. It is believed the CAS, who was branded a rebel by ODM loyalists at the time, wants to ride on Raila to win the support of voters. Mung'aro in a phone interview, said their visit to Nairobi was mainly to consult Raila on various development issues at the Coast. He said Raila also wanted to know what was being done on land matters at the Coast. Mung'aro said some other issues discussed will be revealed later. "I'm already in government but I want to bring everyone on board so that the region benefits economically and politically," he said. Mung'aro said they will begin consultations with governors and other leaders from the region. He said his reunion with Raila resulted from the March 2018 handshake between Uhuru and Raila. "If he [Raila] is working with my boss who am I?" Mung'aro asked. In Kilifi, Kingi is serving his final term as governor and there are speculations on who is best-suited to succeed him. Those who have declared interest include Magarini MP Michael Kingi (the governor's brother), Owen Baya the Kilifi North MP, Senator Stewart Madzayo, Gabriel Katana, a county executive in Kingi's administration, Kilifi South MP Ken Chonga and Deputy Governor Gideon Saburi.
