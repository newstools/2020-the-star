The Ministry of Health has lauded Kenyans for following the containment measures issued as a way of reducing the spread of the coronavirus. Health CAS Rashid Aman on Wednesday, however, said some Kenyans have become lax when it comes to wearing face masks. He said some have started using their masks as chin guards instead of covering their noses and mouths to prevent getting into contact with droplets which can lead to the spread of the virus. “You will notice quite some people who may not be wearing masks and if they are wearing masks, they are not wearing them properly. I often see people using masks as a chin guard. The mask is not a chin guard,” Aman said. “We also noticed people who wear masks and just cover the mouth. It defeats the purpose. The mask must be properly worn to cover both the nose and the mouth.” The CAS also said the restrictions on entertainment have not been relaxed, apart from restaurants and the eateries. This comes as the National Emergency Response Committee earlier condemned revelers who ignored social distancing rules and opted to party at Langata's 1824 club. The committee, led by Health CS Mutahi Kagwe, also criticised the 'greedy' club owner who put money before lives. Aman asked Kenyans to continue observing the measures that have been set to curb the spread of the virus. Kenya recorded another 123 cases of the virus on Wednesday, adding the number of Covid-19 cases in the country to 2,216. Also, the country reported the highest number of recoveries. A total of 54 people were discharged, raising those discharged to 553. The CAS announced that three more males succumbed to the virus, including a 12-year-old boy from Nyeri who tested positive for the virus posthumously. The other two deaths were recorded in Nairobi.
