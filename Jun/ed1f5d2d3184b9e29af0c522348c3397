Cabinet Secretary Raphael Tuju has been handed a lifeline after a commercial court vacated orders requiring him to grant two receiver managers to his Karen property over a Sh1.5 billion defaulted loan. Judge Mary Kasango set aside the orders she issued on March 23 on grounds that Tuju and directors of Dari Limited were denied a right to be heard. Kasango had directed the director of Dari Limited to allow the managers appointed by the East Africa Development Bank –Muniu Thoithi and George Weru - access to the Karen property. Tuju was also required to provide the receivers with Dari’s statement of affair, financial returns and company records, cash book as from December 23 last year to date, the management accounts, the debtors and creditors listing and the company’s staff payroll for the last three months. But Kasango on Thursday said Tuju has shown there is sufficient reason for the orders to be reviewed. "The impugned order will be vacated. There’s an error in granting those orders without affording them an opportunity to be heard," she said. She ordered the file to be placed before Justice Grace Nzioka on Monday next week for further directions. She noted that the judge did not recuse herself from the case, only that she directed the application for contempt be heard before her as the orders of March 23 emanated from her (Kasango). The loan, which was granted by the East Africa Development Bank, was meant for the construction of Sh100 million two-storey, flat-roofed bungalows and the purchase of a nine-year-old bungalow built by Scottish missionary Dr Albert Patterson. The bungalow currently operates as a high-end restaurant. Edited by R.Wamochie
