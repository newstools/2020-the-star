The Communications Authority of Kenya has said the number of courier service providers have surged since the country was hit by the coronavirus. In a statement, the authority acting director general Mercy Wanjau said that it facilitates domestic and cross border e-commerce activities by licensing national and international courier providers to transport and deliver packages. The Ag DG said some public service vehicles and e-commerce market platforms have taken advantage of the virus to offer courier services without being licensed. She said any person who will be caught delivering the services illegally will be charged in accordance with Section 49 of the authorities Act. The act states that the person who contravenes the act will be charged a fine not exceeding Sh300,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year or both. Members of the public have also been asked to demand a valid compliance certificate when seeking services. The authority said that services from the dully registered operators will ensure that the consumers will be able to be compensated in case of complaints. The authority said it has developed a courier market structure and licence administration framework under which different courier licences are granted.
