Kenya is now officially in a political silly season, Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu has said. This was after her lawyers were chased away from the county assembly on Monday. Earlier, there was drama at the Kitui Assembly after lawyers representing Ngilu were forcibly kicked out of the assemblyâ€™s premises. The MCAs had summoned the embattled governor to appear before the assembly just days after the High Court had temporarily stopped them from tabling an impeachment motion. The battery of lawyers were led by the Kitui County Laywer Morris Kimuli and Martin Oloo. A video shared on social media showed the two lawyers being roughed up and pushed outside the assembly premises. "The County Assembly that invited me (in person or represented by counsel) to answer to allegations in a witch-hunt impeachment motion have violently kicked out my lawyers," Ngilu said. In a tweet on Monday, Ngilu added that "If it is a proper and legitimate impeachment, why resort to draconian measures? We are now officially in political silly season." Over the weekend, Kitui county assembly Majority Leader Peter Kilonzo vowed to fight for the removal of Ngilu. His impeachment motion against the governor was suspended by the court. But he described the ruling as a lull before the storm. On Thursday, Ngilu filed an application before the High Court in Nairobi challenging the impeachment and obtained orders suspending tabling of the motion. Justice Weldon Korir directed that the orders would remain in force until full hearing and determination of the suit.
