Makueni Senator Mutula Kilonzo Junior on Tuesday rejected a whole House hearing of the case regarding Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru's impeachment. Mutula said the Senate is an independent institution that cannot be guided by the views of outsiders. "When you are an interested party, you don't choose the judge. We can't go the plenary way just because the people and their leaders have demanded the plenary," Mutula said. He added that, "The Senate is an independent House and we can't be influenced by third parties." "I cannot support the insistence that we must go the Kirinyaga way." Embu Senator Njeru Ndwiga said the case should be heard the plenary way because the people of Kirinyaga want it. "Kirinyaga people are crying for justice. Justice must be done and justice must be seen to be done," he said. Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen echoed his remarks, saying that if the Select Committee clears the governor, the matter ends there. Kirinyaga Senator Charles Kibiru said the locals want the plenary roue because the MCAs from Kirinyaga want to be heard. The House will decide whether to go the committee way or reject the proposal altogether and have the governor defend herself before the whole House. Here is the list of committee members: Senator Abshiro Halake, Michael Mbito, Mwangi Paul Githiomi, Beth Mugo, Anuar Liotiptip, Philip Mpaayei, Cleophas Malala, Beatrice Kwamboka, Stewart Madzayo, Judith Pareno and Moses Kajwang. The High Court last Thursday declined to nullify the impeachment of Waiguru. Justice Weldon Korir last Thursday declined to overturn the impeachment, ruling that the county assembly had proved it did not violate any court orders.
