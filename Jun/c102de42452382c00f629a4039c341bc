Governor James Ongwae yesterday warned residents against disobeying new curfew hours issued by President Uhuru Kenyatta. Ongwae said those who will be found during odd hours will face the law as the measures taken by the government are not aimed at punishing Kenyans. He said the rising Covid-19 cases have put the economy in a big mess because businesses were closed. “Our people should be warned that those who will be found disobeying the new curfew hours will face the full wrath of the law,” Ongwae said. He added that the decision to relax curfew hours will enable businesses to resume operations, thus improving the economy. Speaking to the Star, the governor said his administration is doing its best to contain cases and added that all isolation centres are ready to host those who test positive for the virus. On Saturday, President Kenyatta announced an extension of the nationwide curfew by another 30 days, but relaxed the hours from 7pm to 9pm and 5am to 4am. The county boss said the extension time by the President is enough for every citizen to reach their homes in time, hence there should be no excuses. He said his government is aware of the situation in the country but safety remains a priority. Ongwae said it is the responsibility of every Kenyan to respect and follow the coronavirus disease control guidelines. “Everybody should observe the social distance, wash and sanitise hands, wear masks because this is the only way the diseases can be controlled,” he said. Ongwae urged parents to ensure their children stay at home instead of roaming around the villages. He also advised them to guide their children in their studies as they wait for reopening of schools. President Kenyatta hinted that schools may reopen in September and thus directed a new school calendar made and released by mid-August. Edited by Frank Obonyo
