Just what has elicited the sudden scramble for slots in the yet to be created Covid-19 Emergency Response Committee of the National Assembly? Suddenly, the idea which was mooted by Nyeri Town MP Ngunjiri Wambugu is eliciting a lot of interests. Well, word is that some MPs feel Nairobi Senator Johnson Sakaja is running away with the show and that it was time they also did something. Others were overheard saying that since it comes with an extra coin, much needed at this time of the Covid-19 pandemic, why not fight to be part of one? Two MPs almost went physical in a meeting last week over a seat they are all eyeing. The sitting MP is said to have accosted his nominated colleague, warning him over alleged political activities in the constituency aimed at discrediting the current holder of the seat. Moles told Corridors that the meeting came to a standstill following the confrontation before other legislators intervened to separate the two. Even after they were apart, they continued engaging in a discomforting shouting match, causing a lot of drama. That Ugenya MP David Ochieng’ came face to face with the large camel herders who have told him to prepare for any decision they will make on his claim for the Health committee seat is not new. What is baffling a usually quiet lawmaker is what he described as “the impunity with which the big parties lord over independents and MPs who rode on small parties to the House.” His pick was the bravado with which Suba North MP Millie Odhiambo and her neighbour in the South John Mbadi told off Ochieng' at the plenary on Tuesday. The two were candid with their reminder that the lawmaker was holding the seat on borrowed time.
