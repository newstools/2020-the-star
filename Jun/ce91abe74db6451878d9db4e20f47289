 Two Chinese nationals were on Friday charged in a Kibera court with uprooting the teeth of their compatriot and gorging out his eyes during a fight over a disputed bet. The two allegedly caused grievous harm to their colleague. A police report shows they were on the second floor of a house in Kilimani playing a game known us “Magian” in Chinese language. The two, Gu Xiong and Jin Ping, were charged before Kibera senior principal magistrate Boaz Ombewa where they pleaded not guilty. The two were accused of seriously injuring Dong Chen Pang whom they allegedly beat up on May 16 at Kingston Apartments along Ng'ong Road. The offence was committed at night according to the charge sheet tabled in court. The matter was reported to police after the fight and Pang was taken to hospital. He was later treated at Coptic Hospital after the eye developed complications. Xiong and Pang disagreed over a bet and picked a fight before Ping joined in to fight Pang, the police report says. Through their lawyers, the duo urged court for a lenient bond term saying that they were residing in Kenya and that they are not a flight risk. It was also raised in court that all the Chinese nationals will be leaving the country on June 16 and thus the complainant lawyer asked the court to detain the accused person’s passport to prevent them from flying back to China. Prosecutor Charles Mwangi said detaining the accused person’s passport was the only way to ensure he remains available. Ombewa ordered the two suspects to deposit their passports and other travel documents with the court. They were granted a Sh400,000 bond each with an alternative bail of Sh100,000 with credible contact persons. The court directed the matter to be mentioned on July 4.  Edited by P.O
