The Nairobi government has invited applications for 1,498 jobs after promoting 6,279 low-cadre employees. The promotions follow protracted labour disputes between City Hall and the Kenya County Government Workers Union over job stagnation, timely pay and retirement benefits. Some workers had been on one job group for 20 years. Forty-seven beneficiaries are retirees while 391 have been re-designated. At departmental level, 425 workers have been promoted from the Finance and Economic Planning; 328 from Environment, Water and Natural Resources; 21 from Legal Department; 57 Administration; 1,126 Devolution and Subcounty; 27 Audit; seven CPSB, 362 Education, 1,310 Security and Compliance; and 1,184 Health Services. The others are from Social Services (83), Trade (206), Disaster Management (63), Lands (46), Urban Planning (87), Urban Renewal (32), Supply Chain (30), Agriculture (116), ICT (30), Public Service Management (84), and Roads (293). Governor Mike Sonko's spokesman Ben Mulwa said on Tuesday that the promotions are a fulfilment of a pledge the county boss made when he came to office in September 2017. “For many years, Nairobi was rocked by perennial workers' strikes due to delayed payment of salaries. Today, salaries are paid before the close of each month, an achievement due to the fiscal discipline the governor introduced, and his commitment to the plight of workers,” Mulwa said.  He spoke outside City Hall during the presentation of promotion letters to the workers' union by the County Public Service Board acting chairman Thomas Kasoa. Kasoa said the beneficiaries include those seconded to the Nairobi Metropolitan Services. Mulwa said the retirees had been struggling to get their benefits since 2018. The new vacancies are in the Security and Compliance sector (800 constables) and Disaster Management and Coordination (200 firemen and women). Each of the successful applicant in the two categories will earn Sh14,610-Sh16,250 per month and get Sh4,125 house allowance and Sh3,000 commuter allowance. Pregnant applicants will not be considered. The Education docket has 498 vacancies in the Early Childhood Development and Education section (Job Group G) whose basic monthly pay is Sh21,500–Sh28,970, house allowance Sh6,750 and commuter allowance Sh4,000. All applications should be scanned and sent in pdf format to cpsb@nairobi.go.ke on or before June 8. Applicants should have clearance certificates from, KRA, CRB and Certificate of Good Conduct from the Kenya Police Service at the time of interview.   - mwaniki fm
