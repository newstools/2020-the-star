Treasury CS Ukur Yatani has proposed an introduction of a voluntary disclosure programme to allow Kenyans who are not tax compliant come clean. During presentation of the Budget in Parliament on Thursday,Yatani said the complying individuals will in turn be accommodated through a tax amnesty on all the omissions disclosed. Therefore individuals will not be liable to any penalties or interest on disclosed omissions in the last five years  once payment of the principle tax is made. The programme once approved will run for three years. Meanwhile, the government has also scrapped import Declaration Fee and the Railway Development Levy for Kenya Deference Forces and the National Police Service. "This charges reduce budgetary allocations in these institutions. I have therefore proposed to exempt from both IDF and RDL on all good including materials, supplies, equipment, machinery and all motor vehicles imported for official use by the KDF and the NPS." Further, Yatani proposed introduction of a minimum tax payable by all companies at the one per cent of their gross turn over in order to ensure all taxpayers contribute to the maintenance of the country's infrastructure. He noted that some companies continue to enjoy facilities whose cost and maintenance is catered for by the government revenue contributed through other patriotic taxpayers. Introduction of Digital Service tax on value of online transaction at a the rate of 1.5 per cent was also new to the 2020/2021 budget. Yatani said it was necessary to provide a frame work that will enable taxation on income derived through digital platforms.
