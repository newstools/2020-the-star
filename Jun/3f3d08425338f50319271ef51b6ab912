 Anti-Doping Agency of Kenya Director of Education Agnes Mandu has been appointed to the World Anti-Doping Agency Education Committee with immediate effect for a three-year term. This announcement follows the review and approval of the 2020 committees. Her term ends on December 31, 2022 though she is open to re-apply upon the expiry of her term. It is anticipated that her appointment will help boost the countryâ€™s efforts in the fight against doping. Several top athletes in the country have been suspended after being found guilty of the vice as the country seriously tries to fix the problem. Committee terms are three years, however, the current term is less by two months due to the roll out of the new governance reforms in 2019 which had an impact on the timing of standing committee appointment for 2020. The process of determining committee composition involves the WADA president Witold Banka, Director General Olivier Niggli and the chair of the committee, newly appointed Ms Kady Kanoute Tounkara
