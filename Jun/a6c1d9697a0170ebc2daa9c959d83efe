Treasury CS Ukur Yatani has said the government has set aside funds targeting unemployed youths in the country. The CS said that his ministry will allocate Sh10 billion to the 'Kazi Mtaani' programme. The CS made the announcement when reading the 2020-21 FY Budget estimated at Sh2.79 trillion. Kazi Mtaani programme is meant to accommodate youths in eight selected counties. The programme was launched by the President on April 25, targeting youths in slums from the eight counties. The programme was first rolled out in 28 slums in Kiambu, Nairobi, Mombasa, Kwale, Nakuru, Mandera, Kilifi and Kisumu. The country has a huge number of youths who are unemployed and the number has increased after the coronavirus hit the nation. Many industries were forced to reduce their workers and others were closed. The CS added that the country's economy is projected to grow at 2.5 per cent. This is due to invasion of desert locusts and flooding as well as the Covid-19 pandemic.
