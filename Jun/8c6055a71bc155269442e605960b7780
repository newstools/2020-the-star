The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has received complaints about the revealing of nationalities of Covid-19 patients. This is why the Health ministry no longer reveals the nationalities of foreigners whose results turned positive for Covid-19, director of health Dr Patrick Amoth has said. During the daily Covid-19 briefing he said, in the spirit of good neighbourliness, the ministry therefore decided not to reveal nationalities. Kenya on Friday recorded 117 new cases of Covid-19, raising the country's total number to 4,374. This is out of the 3,043 samples that were tested in the last 24 hours. Out of these, 112 are Kenyans while five are foreigners. A total of 83 of these cases are males, while 54 are females. The youngest is 11 while the oldest is 75 years old. Another 91 patients have been discharged. However, another two patients have died, raising fatalities to 119. More follows..
