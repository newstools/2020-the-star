Safaricom is set to undertake routine maintenance of its M-Pesa services on Thursday, from midnight to 5am. The company said on Wednesday through a statement that the maintenance is meant to improve service provision to its customers. During the maintenance, all M-Pesa services, including airtime purchase, will not be available. "The timing of this maintenance activity has been planned to result in the least inconvenience to our customers," part of the statement reads. M-Pesa services have transformed many lives and business in the country. In April, the company announced that its service revenue grew by 4.8 per cent for the year that ended on March 31, to Sh251.2 billion compared to Sh239.8 billion the previous year. M-Pesa accounted for 33.6 per cent of the firm’s earnings, second after voice calls which contributed 34.5 per cent of Safaricom’s service revenue. M-Pesa revenue grew by 12.6 per cent to Sh84.44 billion while voice service (incoming and outgoing) revenue dropped 1.4 per cent to Sh94.45 billion during the period under review. “Revenue growth for the year was driven by a strong performance on M-Pesa and a strong performance on mobile data,” Safaricom chief financial officer Sateesh Kamath said.
