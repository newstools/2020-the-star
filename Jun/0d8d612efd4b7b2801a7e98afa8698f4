Thereâ€™s no part of the world that has not felt the outrage following the murder of George Floyd, an African-American man from Minneapolis, US, whose death brought memories of numerous blacks who have been killed in a similar fashion by racial supremacists. Such incidents reverse the gains that humanity, through blood and sweat, has made century after century. We seldom come across religion or political ideology that openly cultivates subjugation of a people based on race, tribe, education, colour or denomination. But man, in his selfish endeavour to maintain hegemony over fellow man, continues to perpetuate discrimination. Racism remains a stubborn blot in developed countries and despite decades of proof in the fields of science, technology, sports, entertainment and entrepreneurship that no race is lesser than the other, it rears its ugly head unabated. On the flipside, victims of racism could be perpetrators of tribalism, religious supremacy, classism and clanism. In Kenya, where a majority have been bold in castigating the murder of Floyd through social networking sites, ethnicity continues to make millions feel they are children of a lesser God when they start counting the numerous opportunities it has denied them. When tribalism is not devastating souls, classism is reigning supreme. No one deserves to go through what Floyd went through. It was inhumane and the culprits must be brought to book. But we should remember that even as we demand justice for Floyd, the horrible memories of six-month-old Baby Pendo; Moraa, Mutinda, Vaite, and countless Kenyans who continue to suffer in silence will continue to haunt us if we keep shelving their agonies. We must put our house in order first.  Freelance Journalist and Writer
