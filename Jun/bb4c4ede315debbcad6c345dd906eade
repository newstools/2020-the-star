Two Mwingi lawmakers have lauded the recent cooperation agreement between Wiper and Jubilee Party. The legislators say the deal will ensure Kamba people are counted in the development agenda of President Uhuru Kenyatta as well as give Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka an upper hand to clinch the presidency in 2022. Mwingi Central MP Gideon Mulyungi and his Mwingi North counterpart Paul Nzengu urged Wiper members to embrace the deal ‘as it would be of great benefit to them both materially and politically’. Speaking during the launch of road construction works by the Ministry of Public Works at Mwingi town on Saturday, Mulyungi said the agreement with the ruling party was welcome in Ukambani. He said since Kalonzo went out of his way to assist President Kenyatta in achieving his Big Four agenda, it was likely that the President would reciprocate by supporting Kalonzo’s presidential bid. Mulyungi, however, reiterated that Wiper party was still a devoted member of Nasa adding that leaders should view the recent agreement as an end to the opposition coalition. Nzengu said high level of development was expected in Ukambani following the political agreement. He gave examples of expected completion of the Kitui-Kibwezi-Meru Road, and the starting of the Grant Falls Megadam which is expected to be the largest in Africa and a great aid in putting to an end the perennial floods in Tana River and Garissa counties. He urged Wiper leaders to support Kalonzo in his recent bid of unifying the nation and supporting the President’s development agenda. Edited by R.Wamochie
