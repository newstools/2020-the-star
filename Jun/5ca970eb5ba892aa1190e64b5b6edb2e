A man accused of impersonating a police officer on Tuesday told a Kibera court that his life is in danger. Victor Kioko said he feared for his life after the murder of a colleague who, like him, was a state witness in a case in which a senior police officer was jailed for killing a civilian. "I was hidden by the state until December 15 last year," Kioko told senior principal magistrate Boaz Ombewa during the hearing of a case in which he is charged with impersonating a police officer and refusing to be photographed at Kilimani police station. "One of the witnesses in my case was killed by the police and the case is with Ipoa," he said. The alleged impersonation happened on September 15 last year at Kilimani while the refusal to be photographed by police officer Nicholas Ndubai was on June 8 at the same station. Kioko denied both charges. He said the officers were out to revenge on behalf of their colleagues. “Your honour, I don’t want to be taken back to the police station," he pleaded. Ombewa ordered that he be remanded at Industrial Area police station but he objected and pleaded to be granted Sh20,000 bail. He was freed on Sh25,000 bail with a similar surety. The case will be heard on July 8. - mwaniki fm
