Education Cabinet Secretary George Magoha has called on parents, political leaders and stakeholders to support to schools in preparation for reopening in September. The CS said the government would do everything possible to reopen schools but parents and other stakeholders should show their love and care for their children by ensuring their safety. Magoha spoke at Kakamega Primary School on Sunday when he paid an impromptu visit. He wanted to assess the level of preparedness  for control of coronavirus. “Please, chairs of the boards of management kindly plead with your members voluntarily to help us to ensure that we comply with the presidential directive of going back to school on the 1st of September because it’s a long journey,” Magoha said. He added that at the ministry level certain committees would be formed to work out modalities of how the learners should go back to school. He said the President wants public participation in every aspect, “even with regards to how we are going to decide for our children to come back and sit in school, new examination dates and timetabling.” Edited by Henry Makori
