Nandi governor Stephen Sang was on Saturday forced to defend the planned purchase of cement at more than Sh 9,100 per bag. This was after a document leaked on social media of the planned purchase. The document was from the department of Education, research and vocational training which had listed items and materials for completion of ongoing ECDE projects for 2018/2019. The first item on the list was 400 bags of cement whose total cost was indicated as Sh 3.64 million implying that each bag would cost more than Sh 9,000. “There was an error on the document. Instead of the 400 bags indicated on the document it should have been 4,000 bags," Sang said. With the corrections it implied the county was to use about Sh 900 per bag of cement. This is the average market price of cement in North Rift region. The county rectified the erroneous figures but social media which was awash with it, picked up the document and circulated it widely accusing Sang’s administration of graft. “Even maliciousness requires creativity," Sang added. Supporters of the governor accused Sang’s critics of being desperate to pick on anything in efforts to discredit the county boss. “It’s like they are so desperate that they have nothing big to blame the governor for. They hang on such a fake document hoping to gain some political mileage by falsely accusing the county chief," youth leader Kiplimo Bett said. He said Nandi had made great strides in devolution since Sang took over but political rivals were desperate to paint the county as failure.
