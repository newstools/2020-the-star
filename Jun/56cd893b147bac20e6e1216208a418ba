Former AFC Leopards and Kakamega Homeboyz striker Dennis Mukaisi is keen to take up coaching as a career. Mukaisi, who has retired from competitive football, has already started the journey and completed his basic training in coaching. He has also expressed his desire to move on to the next level in a bid to acquire the necessary qualifications as he pursues opportunities at high-level football. The high school teacher termed his eight-year playing stint as sufficient experience to join the coaching fraternity. “I believe I have managed to gather enough experience to understand how to improve the players as individuals as well as the entire playing unit," he said. “Having worked under various senior soccer coaches in the country, I have learned many things in football and this has placed me in the right position as I pursue coaching as a career," he added. Mukaisi said with the passion he has for football, he is willing to sacrifice and give  back to the society. "For me to reach where I am, someone somewhere sacrificed and I need to reciprocate,” Mukaisi pointed out. He cited Lirhembe Arsenal and Mukumu Boys High School as the two places that shaped his career from childhood. He further attributed his rise to the current National Super League side, Vihiga Bullets' coach Edward Manoah and former Mukumu Boys High School soccer coach Fanuel Wakhanu. Mukaisi, who is currently coaching Mukumu Boys, played a key role in the success of Lirhembe Arsenal during the last edition of Senator  Malala Soccer tournament in Kakamega.
