My determination for this coming election, is that we must bring this country together whatever the price and cost, DP William Ruto has said. These were the words of Ruto from a clip aired in  2012. The deputy president shared the clip on Sunday saying that "This was in 2012, 9 yrs ago. Am as persuaded now as was then." In the clip, Ruto said he is convinced that Kenya must be united. "... those who do not believe that Kenya will be one are in for a shock. I have a lot of energy and I intend to dispense it to get it done," he said. "We are determined that you will not vote for a person because of the village he is coming from, spelling of his name but what he can do for a nation." Ruto was speaking to Churchill live show in 2012 when he was campaigning. It was not clear what he was alluding to but over the last two weeks, Kenya has seen several politicians who are known foot soldiers of Ruto running to ODM leader Raila Odinga’s office purportedly to pledge their loyalty. Since the Jubilee purge in Parliament in which a number of Ruto lieutenants were pushed out of key positions of leadership, a number of Tangatanga members are said to be contemplating realigning themselves to survive politically. The Star has established a number of pro-Ruto MPs, especially those earmarked for disciplinary action, are planning to meet the ODM boss in the coming weeks. Ruto has maintained a deafening silence over the purge targeted at his allies in the bicameral House.
