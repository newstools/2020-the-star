A flower farm worker was electrocuted on Karagita estate in Naivasha while trying to charge his mobile phone using a faulty charger. The middle-aged man was dead on arrival at a health centre. It’s alleged the man tried to connect a faulty charger at about 8pm, causing a blackout in the neighbourhood. “We were attracted to the house by a sharp scream only to find out that the man who was living alone had been electrocuted,” neighbour John Omondi said. Meantime, a boda boda rider was struck and killed by a canter along the Nairobi-Nakuru highway. He was trying to join the highway from a feeder road. The death brought to six the number of boda boda operators killed on the highway in two months. Speeding and reckless overtaking were blamed. “The driver of the canter did the best he could to avoid an accident but he ended up crashing into the motorcycle," a witness said. (Edited by V. Graham)
