The family of a woman suspected to have been killed by her husband - a KDF soldier - in Nakuru is unable to access her body for burial. Leah Otieno died on June 12 in her house where she lived with Kennedy Otieno. Her husband reported that she had committed suicide, but a postmortem report revealed that she died of strangulation. Otieno, who is stationed at the Lanet Military Barracks, has since been charged with her murder. He is being held at the Bahati police station, pending the mention of his case on Monday, June 22. Early Friday morning, Otieno's family declined to release the burial permit to Leah's family for her burial. The family of Leah had gathered at the Evans Sunrise Hospital mortuary ready to collect the body and ferry it to Bungoma for burial on Saturday, but they were told to produce the original burial permit. Leah's sister, Stella Terewa said, "On getting here [mortuary], we were told that we cannot take the body because we did not have the original copy of the burial permit." She said Otieno's brother took his sister-in-laws's documents from their matrimonial home in Lanet and sought a burial permit. "I wonder why he took my sister's documents and her burial permit yet he is not her next of kin or her husband," she said. On Friday, Terewa said the suspect's family is frustrating their efforts to bury Leah.
