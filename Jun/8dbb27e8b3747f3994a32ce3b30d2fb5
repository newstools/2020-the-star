Nairobi City Water and Sewerage Company MD Nahashon Muguna now says the city's water supply has finally been restored after weeks of shortage. The shortage had been caused by a massive landslide in the Aberdares Forest following heavy rains. It damaged the main pipeline that supplies water from Sasumua Dam to Nairobi. Muguna had earlier stated that by May 31, the temporary reinstatement works would be completedÂ before permanent works are exhausted. In a statement on Friday, the Board chairperson Beryl Okumu Odinga said the restoration works faced a lot of challenges which caused the delays but Sasumua Dam is now fully reinstated. She said due to heavy rains the road was severely damaged and one of the bridges to that area was also damaged impairing access to the cite. "The terrain where the re-connection works were being carried out was also very tough and steep. Transportation of pipes and other materials to the site was done by farm tractors," she said. "Despite all these predicaments we are glad to inform you that the emergency repair works are now complete". According to her statement, the transmission teams will now embark on equitable distribution of the available water' The damage cut off 11.6 per cent of Nairobi's water requirement. Tanker trucks have been delivering water to many areas, including informal settlements, but it's still not enough. Areas that were largely affected by the acute water shortage include Waiyaki Way, Kangemi, Lavington, Westlands, Parklands, MP Shah Hospital, Aga Khan Hospital, Nairobi Hospital, Kenyatta Hospital, Upper Hill and Kilimani. The University of Nairobi main campus and the Upper and Lower Kabete campuses, Kenyatta University Parklands campus also were cut off.
