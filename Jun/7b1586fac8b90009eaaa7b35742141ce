Zari Hassan’s second-born son Raphael Ssemwanga has for the first time opened up on his mother’s relationship with Tanzanian superstar Diamond Platnumz. Raphael is Zari’s second-born from her marriage to late ex-husband Ivan Ssemwanga, which yielded three sons. Speaking to a Tanzanian media, he said he did not mind having the singer around because he was the one their mother had chosen. “I didn’t mind because it’s who my mother chose so, you know I can’t do anything. If he was making her happy at the time, then that was okay with me,” he said. Asked if he and his brothers talked to Diamond, he said their schedules limited interaction. “I was in boarding school at the time, so I’d only come home a few times, I didn’t see him that much,” he said, adding that he doesn't talk to Diamond. "Mum sometimes calls him so he can talk to Tiffah and Nillan.”
