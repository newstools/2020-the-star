Singer Vivianne says the pressure and hypocrisy in the music industry can drive someone into depression. Vivianne was responding to the viral podcast of Vanessa Mdee, who said she quit music last week. Speaking on her podcast 'Deep Dive with Vanessa Mdee', she said that while she loves music, the industry itself steered her down the wrong path. "The reason why I had to leave the industry is that I needed to choose my life, the music industry is demonic," she said. "People will tell you half-truths about what goes on, and the truth is I just wanna be an advocate for honesty and beauty, and being a sincere advocate for what facing your demons can do for you." Sharing an old photo of herself and Vanessa, Vivianne explained that although she loves doing music, the pressure is too much. "This is an old pic of Vanessa Mdee and me. Truth is she is a ball of fire and one of the best entertainers hands down," she wrote. "I saw some news about her in a blog and got to listen to one of her podcasts #deepdive. "I know for sure everyone has their unique journey but as much as possible we have to be able to stand in solidarity when it comes to the truth. "I love to make music but the pressure and the hypocrisy will drive you into depression or substance abuse, that’s for sure." Vivianne said  in her capacity, the lack of truth and lack of love that is characteristic in the entertainment system is demonic. "I appreciate @vanessamdee very much for being vulnerable and honest about her journey," she said. Vivianne urged female artistes to love and appreciate one another. "And if nothing else gets heard, I’d like to appeal especially to my female counterparts in entertainment to extend grace to one another and be ambassadors of truth and love," she said. "I’m definitely not perfect at it but I try and also share my truth. Tag your best female artiste and let’s remind each other to be ambassadors of love and truth!"
