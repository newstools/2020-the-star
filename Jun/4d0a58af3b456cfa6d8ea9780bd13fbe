A case in which four businessmen are charged with attempting to extort Sh30 million from Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi will be mentioned on July 15. George Ngugi, Abdul Aziz Alim, Moses Musee Maluki and Noah Akala Aduwo, who are Mombasa traders, have denied extortion charges against them. Milimani chief magistrate Lawrence Mugambi directed the matter be mentioned on July 15 to fix a hearing date. In the case, the prosecution has listed over six witnesses, including Governor Kingi. The accused persons who are being represented by three lawyers, led by Lewis Kanyoko, are said to have pretended to be investigators from the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission. They are charged with introducing themselves to Ahmed Ibrahim, the liason officer to Kingi, as EACC officers investigating corruption at the county of Kilifi. They then extorted Sh30 million from Kingi alleging they were investigating him over corruption, court papers read. The alleged offence was committed on June 20, 2018, at Gracia Hotel in Kilimani, Nairobi. They are all out on Sh600,000 bail each pending hearing and determination of the case. Senior state prosecutor Jennifer Kaniu is leading the prosecution in the case which was filed late last year. Edited by R.Wamochie
