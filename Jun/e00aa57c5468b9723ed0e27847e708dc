Former Harambee Stars shot-stopper Washington Muhanji believes goalkeeping standards in Kenya could be better had emphasis been put like in the rest of the departments. While lauding the gains made over the years in moulding goalkeepers of repute, Muhanji said there is need to have special academies for goalkeepers just like the set-ups in developed leagues, especially in Europe. Muhanji, who featured for the defunct Scarlet FC and AFC Leopards, said goalkeeping in the country requires a lot of attention and major investments in order to move football to the next level. “Locally, we depend on schools, which are doing great work in nurturing talent and I urge them to maintain that spirit for the growth of local football and individual players," said Muhanji. “Recently, we have seen the emergence of Arnold Origi, Patrick Matasi, Boniface Olouch, Faruk Shikalo among others who are currently inspiring other upcoming shot-stoppers in the country,” stated Muhanji. However, he observed that many potential goalkeepers at the grassroots level lack a platform to showcase their talent and that structures should be put in place to develop them. He advised the young stars and upcoming goalkeepers to work hard and remain disciplined in order to attain the objective of playing at the highest level, both locally and beyond. Former Harambee Stars shot-stopper urged the Kenya Premier Limited and Football Kenya Federation and other soccer stakeholders to shelve their self-interests and do what is right for the growth of football. Muhanji who is currently serving on the technical bench of Musingu High School has not ruled out making a comeback in the top level football, as a coach.
