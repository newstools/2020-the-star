A plan for Limuru town to operate 24 hours a day was ready before the coronavirus outbreak, municipality manager Ndung'u Muna has said. Muna said street lighting, tarmacking of the bus park and drainages had been improved through a Sh160 million funding by the World Bank. He said that the municipality had subdivided the funds into four projects which are all at 95 per cent complete. The manager said their vision was to ensure traders improve their services and working conditions. Muna said Governor James Nyoro had agreed to tarmac Limuru bus park and instal street lights with Sh60 million. “The bus park is now at 95 per cent complete. We have finished tarmacking, we have installed 26 street lights. We have 92 street lights in the whole town,” he said. "All these lights are energy-saving and solar-powered. They will reduce expenses, only maintenance if needed," he said. Muna spoke when he toured the bus park on Monday. Other projects being undertaken are drainage, stormwater management and tarmacking of Kiambaa- Kimende road. Board members, led by chairman Clement Kamau, traders, county government officials and the contractor were also on the tour. Bus park chairman John Kamau said traders were happy with the renovations.  Kamau said the public service vehicles now have ample space since a lot of drivers used to avoid places with potholes, hence overcrowding in one place. Limuru Central MCA Joseph Kahenya said the lighting of the bus park had reduced insecurity, with thugs and people with ill motives moving away. "We have enough lights, the stage and on other streets. Security has been improved too. This has left an impact on security,” he said. (edited by o. owino)
