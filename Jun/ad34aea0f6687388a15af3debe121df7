 The Amani National Congress Party will in two weeks begin meeting leaders from all the 47 counties to strengthen and popularise its leader Musalia Mudavadi as the preferred candidate for the 2022 presidential race. Deputy Party leader Ayub Savula on Monday said the programme will begin with a meeting at his Manyonyi residence in Lugari constituency. "We're focused on forming the next government and not just being part of the next regime. We want all leaders to stand behind Mudavadi because he is the only Luhya who has declared interest to contest for the presidency,‚Äù the Lugari MP said. Mudavadi has been hosting delegations of leaders from across the country at his communication center in Nairobi in the past weeks in what is seen as part of his plans to craft alliances ahead of 2022. He has met with former Gatanga MP Peter Kenneth, former Justice Minister Martha Karua, Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago and MPs from Western, Rift Valley, Central and Coast regions. Savula said Mudavadi was working closely with President Uhuru Kenyatta and all other leaders across the political divide. The MP asked ODM members to keep off ANC affairs and concentrate on their activities. Savula claimed the orange party was behind propaganda that ANC and Ford-Kenya have agreed to support Deputy President William Ruto's 2022 presidential bid.  Edited by P.O
