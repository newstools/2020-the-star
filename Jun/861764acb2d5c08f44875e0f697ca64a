 Gender-based violence and teenage pregnancies are on the rise in Bungoma county during the Covid-19 period. Bungoma County Referral Hospital nursing officer Chemtai Kiplai said most young people do not use contraceptives while engaging in sex. "Some 2,700 teenagers aged between 10 and 19 conceived in the last quarter of 2019. The number has increased in the first quarter of 2020 to 3,317 cases." She said the number of post-abortion clients in facilities within the county has increased, which, according to her, means that there are many unwanted pregnancies that have been occurring in the county since schools and colleges were indefinitely closed due to the coronavirus pandemic. Bungoma Gender and Culture executive Everlyne Kakai said the county is working in partnership with Marie Stopes International to create awareness at the grassroots on how to handle sexual and gender-based violence. County director of health Johnstone Akatu said gender violence victims suffer psychological, emotional and physical injuries due to the traumatic experiences they undergo. "We have a few psychosocial counsellors against an increasing number of gender-based violence victims," he said. Bishop Daniel Makecho of Hope Ministries said there is a need for counsellors and religious leaders to intervene and assist people at family level to reduce disputes. Makecho said the Covid-19 pandemic has created a crisis after many people lost jobs. "People are unable to feed their families, refugees are forced to share substandard accommodations and with the closure of churches, mosques, which provide spiritual direction, the situation is becoming more chaotic," he said. Citizens For Good Governance executive director Phillip Wekesa appealed to the county government to hire more psychosocial counsellors to address the problem. Edited by A.N
