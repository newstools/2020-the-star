An Embu Directorate of Criminal Investigations officer has been charged with raping a 42-year-old woman in his office at the Manyatta police station on May 31. Jervasio Njeru, a former Embu North DCI officer, was also charged before chief magistrate Maxwell Gicheru with acting indecently with an adult and abuse of office by taking advantage of his position as a DCIO. Njeru denied wrongdoing through lawyer Momanyi Gichuki. He applied to be released on bond, but the prosecution argued that he would interfere with witnesses who are junior policemen. Gichuki said his client has a constitutional right to affordable bond and promised he would attend court as required. The magistrate released the accused on Sh500,000 bond with a surety of similar amount. The case will be heard on June 16. Court papers say Njeru raped the woman after she was arrested on May 30 and held at the Manyatta police station. Complainant Stephen Gathuri had reported the woman for allegedly swindling him of some cash on May 27. Njeru allegedly sent for the woman to his office for questioning but instead raped her. She escaped and reported him to the same station. He was arrested on June 2 and detained at the Itabua police station. The woman was escorted to the Embu Level 5 Teaching and Referral Hospital for examination and treatment. The officer had been in detention for a week as investigations were underway. Prosecutor Victor Ombongi had applied for the suspect to be held pending investigations. Resident magistrate Jean Ndengeri had on June 3 gave the DCI officers a week to hold Njeru at Itabua police station until his plea taking, which was scheduled for June 9.
