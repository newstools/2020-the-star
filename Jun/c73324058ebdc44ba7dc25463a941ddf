Fear has gripped Lusembe village in Ikolomani, Kakamega county following an invasion of monkeys. Residents fear contracting diseases from the wandering wild animals. Sebenzia Ambalwa and Mercy Malesi complained the monkeys have troubled them for the last three weeks. "We now live with them. Apart from destroying our crops we are also afraid of being infected by deadly viruses," Ambalwa said. County Kenya Wildlife Services warden Rose Malenya said her office had not received a report about the primates and promised to respond immediately the matter was reported. “We have not been told anything about this. We always advice the affected persons to come and report such issues in our offices and if they do so we respond in the shortest time possible, not more than six hours,” Malenya said. "They eat unripe bananas, maize, beans and potatoes and this will lead to hunger," Malesi said. Women and children in the area are afraid of being attacked by the animals. Area assistant chief Geoffrey Ikutwa confirmed the invasion but said he was yet to reach the KWS office to seek a solution.  Edited by Henry Makori
