The Kenya Covid-19 Emergency Response Fund Board has expressed satisfaction with the quality of locally manufactured Covid-19 pandemic management products. “The local manufacturers who are currently producing assorted Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) ordered by the fund for the Ministry of Health are keeping to global benchmarks,” said Covid-19, Emergency Response Fund Board Chairperson Jane Karuku. The Board members including Kenya Association of Manufacturers CEO Phyllis Wakiaga and representatives from Equity Group Foundation visited Texplast Industries in Kikuyu, Ruiru based Alpha Knits, and Manchester Outfitters in Nairobi County. The team also visited Kitui County Textile Centre (KICOTEC) and Shona EPZ near Athi River town. At Manchester Outfitters, Board Chairperson Karuku confirmed that the local PPE producers who were competitively sourced, are currently working within the stipulated delivery schedules. She added that the local manufacturers have proved their worth as dependable suppliers for the much-needed kits on all fronts including quality and value for money. “The Emergency Response Fund has released financial resources amounting to more than Sh1 billion this far for the local procurement of Full kit PPEs, protective goggles, gowns, examination gloves, surgical and respirator masks. The funds have also been earmarked to purchase Face shields, headcovers, and medical footwear,” Karuku said. Kenya COVID-19 Fund kicked off its operations last April with a passionate call for corporate Kenya and development partners to step up to the resource mobilisation challenge currently facing the country. So far, the fund has raised more than Sh2.65billion to support medical facilities, welfare and social livelihood interventions such as food relief.
