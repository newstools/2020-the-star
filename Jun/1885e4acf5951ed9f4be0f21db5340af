Former Amsterdam marathon bronze medalist Erick Ndiema will be fighting to shed off some weight when the sporting world open up after the coronavirus pandemic. The 2014 Eindhoven marathon silver marathon, who was part of the 2014 Commonwealth Games marathon team, admit the pandemic has affected his training hence adding 2kgs, which he says is not good for his marathon running. “If the world open up for sports to continue, I will have to start afresh. I only train three days a week, morning runs only. While competing in a marathon, I have to run at 64kgs. Unfortunately, I have to shed off 2kgs which is not easy in this pandemic. I have to train more than I am doing now to ensure that I keep fit,” said Ndiema. Returning from long and nagging heel injury, Ndiema’s current life rotates around farming back in the village in Kitale, Trans Nzoia County, where he engages in maize and cattle farming . “I had to be more creative to avoid boredom after being restricted to just some light morning training back in the village,” said Ndiema. In addition, he said his current engagements cannot fetch him as much money as he used to while competing in road races. “I am really suffering because my main source of income, which is running has been halted. There are no races here or abroad. When I travel overseas, I can get something to feed my family but that is no longer the case,” said Ndiema. The former Family Bank Half marathon champion picked an injury during the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, Scotland taking over four years to recover. Doctors said he had a blood clot, which was operated on. After recovery, he was enlisted to run in China, targeting a personal best time, but that was never the case. Coronavirus struck and his dream was postponed. Currently, he enjoys a 2:07:07 set at the 2011 Amsterdam Marathon where he placed third.
