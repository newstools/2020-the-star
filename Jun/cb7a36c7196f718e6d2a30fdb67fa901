Vihiga government is planning to upgrade some of the urban areas in the county to municipals, Urban Development chief officer Lucy Ijai has said. “We have already  applied to the Ministry of Lands, Housing and Urban Development to upgrade Luanda town and Kaimosi, Cheptulu towns,” she said. Ijai said once the three get a charter, they will qualify for World Bank funds for upgrading urban centres and cities. Ijai  said the Ministry of Lands will engage the Kenya Institute of Planning, which will check on various aspects to determine if they qualify. She added that they have also engaged the Institution of Surveyors of Kenya, which will send a team of surveyors to survey the proposed municipals. “Once everything is done, the IEBC will effect the boarder that will be put in place by the surveyors,” Ijai said. "Once that is done, the Ministry of Lands will be free to give municipal charters to the proposed towns," she added. However Ijai said the delays in building the Moses Mudamba Cultural Centre in Mbale has been caused by the fact that the proposed land, which was bought by local authorities under Kakamega County Council, was never transferred to local authorities by then.
