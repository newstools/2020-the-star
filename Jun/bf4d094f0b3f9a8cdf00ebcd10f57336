This year’s FIA African Rally Championship (ARC) has been cancelled due to coronavirus fears. FIA African representative Surinder Thatthi confirmed the cancellation after Zambia withdrew from the series citing the pandemic situation. World motorsport governing body, FIA clarified that the 2020 series would only continue if 50 per cent of the events are held. But following cancellation and postponement of events, including Kenya’s WRC Safari Rally which was to double up as the fifth round of the continental tour early next month, the 2020 ARC is done and dusted. The much-awaited Safari Rally return to WRC was postponed to 2021 but organisers are leaving nothing to chance as preparations continue in earnest. The country’s hope to make a big comeback after an 18-year hiatus suffered a major blow due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Over the weekend, Kenya government officials and WRC Safari organisers visited the Service Park in Naivasha. Cabinet Secretary, Amina Mohammed led the team of organisers in the tour and expressed satisfaction with plans on the ground so far. Amina is optimistic Kenya will deliver a great event next year. In attendance were WRC Safari Rally Project CEO Phineas Kimathi and event director Jim Kahumbura. Regarding ARC cancellation, Surinder said: “Zambia organisers said they cannot hold their event this year because of the current global health emergency.”
