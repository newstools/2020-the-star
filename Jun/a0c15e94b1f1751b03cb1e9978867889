National Super League side Migori Youth coach Robert Ojienda is now focusing on rice farming following the cancelation of the 2019/2020 season due to the coronavirus pandemic. Ojienda said he decided to venture into rice farming at his fathers’ farm at Gem Rae Irrigation scheme in Kisumu to keep himself busy during this period of coronavirus pandemic. “Since I can’t do what I love— coaching, I have decided to do farming and in the next three months, I expect a bumper harvest. I also train daily at home to keep fit,” said Ojienda. The coach admitted he misses coaching. “I miss football but there is nothing I can do since all sports gatherings were suspended,” added the youthful coach. He said he is now focusing on next season since the season was cancelled by football governing body, FKF. “The decision to cancel the season was the right one in the prevailing circumstances. Let’s hope this pandemic is contained to allow us prepare for next season,” he noted. Ojienda said Migori Youth will target promotion to the Kenya Premier League next season. The club was hoping to gain promotion this season but their dream ended with the cancellation of the league. The departure of creative midfielder Antonio Abwao to KCB and striker Clinton Okoth to KPL giants Gor Mahia also derailed Migori’s promotion hopes. His players, he added are currently training on their own to keep fit. “I follow their progress through Whatsapp and other online platforms,” added Ojienda.
