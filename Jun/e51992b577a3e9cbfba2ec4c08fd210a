Dear Felly, I read the article that you wrote with the title; Stop with the excuses and man up, and wish to comment that while you raise some valid points, it is said that women always get a pass in the mess that is slowly taking over our society. Until women have to ''woman up', we will continue to strengthen ''dog eat dog' survival at the expense of others mentally. Are there things that men and women can do jointly e.g debate on issues or one side will always have to do their part to match the other side? While I appreciate your courage to speak boldly to a common problem, I regret to say that the approach is very one-sided. Regards, Allan. Dear Allan, Thank you for your email. You are right, both sides have work to do. The reason it seems I hit men so hard is that I am old school. I believe men are supposed to take the lead and we follow. Sadly men have taken on roles of abusers, slackers etc but still expect respect. Because men have forgotten their role, women have been left without a head and are doing whatever they can to survive. Like any species in nature, women are adapting to the environment. Not always what we want but what is happening. Are there things that women and men can do jointly? Of course. The biggest one being knowing and respecting each other first as human beings and then as partners. Also respecting each otherâ€™s roles in their relationships and in society as a whole. I have taken note of your feeling that it is one-sided and I wish to say while I would like to write more good things, I write only what I see in this column. Not fiction. Until I see/ experience otherwise, this will be the tone. I know though that men can do better and some often do. (Yes I mention them in my articles). Look at this column as a mirror, you do not like what is looking back at you, change, till you can stand your reflection.
