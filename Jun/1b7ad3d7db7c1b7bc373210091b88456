Singer Bahati has called out former WCB’s signee Harmonize for his bad blood with his former boss Diamond Platnumz. Harmonize left the record label last year and started his Konde gang, and he is doing well. Bahati, a friend of both Diamond and Harmonize, says the beef should stop. Through his Instagram page, he tells Harmonize to respect the fact that although he has made a name for himself, Diamond played a major role in his success. “We don’t forget how we have been helped just because we’ve become stars, no!” he said. “Don’t bite the hand that fed you. And if you’ve happened to read the Bible in Ephesians 6:2, my religion teaches me to honour my parents and in this case, #WCB is your father and mother.” Bahati goes on to say that although beefing is the order of the day among artistes, Harmonize does not have to subscribe to it. “You don’t have to create one with Diamond to be at the top. His mistakes cannot be compared with the kind heart that pushed him to pick you up from the streets and made you who you’re today. God used him to introduce you to the world,” he said. Bahati then asks Harmonize to swallow the bitter pie and apologise to Diamond. “Apologise and walk away with your blessings bro,” the singer said.
