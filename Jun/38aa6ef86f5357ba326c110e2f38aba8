Kenyan tourism stakeholders will leverage on online platforms for marketing the country, as movement and travel due to the Covid-19 pandemic remains restricted. This is to ensure Kenya remains a destination of choice when travel resumes. Kenya Tourism Board (KTB) on Thursday hosted a webinar that brought together sector players to discuss the importance and gains that would be accrued, by utilising the digital space to market the destination, tourism products and experiences. “Marketing is all about momentum and keeping people engaged, KTB chief executive Betty Radier said. Channels used include Instagram, Facebook and YouTube. Recently, Tourism and Wildlife CS Najib Balala launched a virtual Safari live stream campaign to showcase game safaris in some of the parks and reserves across the country using Magical Kenya platforms. The two-month long live-streaming campaign will spread to Laikipia, Samburu, Mt Kenya, Aberdares, Amboseli, Tsavo East and West, Chyulu Hills, Masai Mara and Watamu. This will allow the audience to interact with the diversities of Kenya’s safari experience and bring Kenya to the Kenyan’s and the world. Kenya Tourism fund (KTF) chairman Mohammed Hersi encouraged the tourism trade partners to utilise online and digital space with an aim of showcasing their offering to the world, and also creating confidence that they are taking care of the destination.
