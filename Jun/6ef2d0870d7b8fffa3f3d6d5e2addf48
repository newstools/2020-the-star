Labour Court Judge Maureen Onyango has suspended the vacancy notice by the Communication Authority of Kenya for the position of Chief Executive Officer. This is after the Information Communication Technology Association of Kenya (ICTAK) moved to court to stop the recruitment of the new CEO arguing that the process was an illegality. Last week CAK advertised for the position in the local dailies and their website asking applicants to submit their applications by close of business June 23. Justice Onyango further certified the matter as urgent and ordered ICTAK to serve CAK with the papers within the next 14 days. “That leave be and is hereby granted to the applicant to apply for an order of certiorari to remove this court and quash the vacancy notice for the position of /director /general/ Chief Executive officer of CAK,” the order reads. The judge ruled that the leave granted to the association will serve as stay pending the hearing of the case. In their case, ICTAK argues that the recruitment notice by CAK is heavily tainted with illegality, irrationality, procedural impropriety, and unreasonableness. “The impugned recruitment notice is discriminatory, contrary to Article 27 of the Constitution and also ultra vires the powers of CAK,” they argue.
