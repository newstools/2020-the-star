Embattled Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru on Saturday submitted to the Senate bundles of documents in response to the impeachment charges against her. The county chief beat the Saturday deadline set by the Senate special committee formed to probe the charges. The documents were stashed in several brown boxes marked 'Kirinyaga County Government'. "Today at about 4.20pm, I filed responses to the impeachment motion with substantive responses to each of the allegations leveled against me," she posted on Facebook. Waiguru and her accusers are set to face off before the committee chaired by Kakamega senator Cleophas Malala on Tuesday when the hearing begins. The panel had given the governor until Saturday to file the responses and also specify her mode appearance - in person, by an advocate or both. "I have full confidence in my legal team and believe my response is sound. Let's allow senate to do its work. I have confidence in the rule of law and believe that Truth & Justice will be our shield and defender," reads the Facebook post. The county assembly speaker also had until the close of business on Saturday to submit the names of MCAs and/or advocate that will represent the Assembly and specify the mode of appearance. The hearing will take place on Tuesday and Wednesday before the committee retreats to write a report for tabling on Friday.
