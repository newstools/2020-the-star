Cotu Secretary General Francis Atwoli has asked Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang'ula to stop early campaigns. He said that the Bungoma senator and ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi should instead support President Uhuru Kenyatta to actualise his Big Four Agenda instead of engaging in "dry politics". "They should stop putting western in a campaign mood. This time people are implementing President Uhuru Kenyatta's Big Four agenda," Atwoli told the Star on the phone on Saturday. He said that leaders from Western should instead push to ensure the government completes projects earmarked for the region. Wetang'ula was teargassed by police in Bungoma on Friday as he led a convoy during his return home since he was toppled as Ford Kenya leader on May 31. Wetang'ula is fighting in court to reclaim the party from Kanduyi MP Wafula Wamunyi and his Tongareni counter Eseli Simiyu. Police on Saturday also dispersed six MPs allied to deputy President William Ruto in Malava constituency with teargas for violation of Covid-19 protocol. MPs Ben Washiali, Didimus Barasa, Mwambu Nabonga, Justus Murunga and Ferdinand Wanyonyi had gathered at their colleague Malulu Injendi to discuss issues affecting western. Atwoli said Wetang'ula should stop moving around in the region in company of agents of deputy president William Ruto and focus on development. "They should join Oparanya (Wycliffe) and Wamalwa (Eugene) to negotiate with government for development," he said. Oparanya and Wamalwa were named Luhya spokesmen during a meeting at Atwoli’s Kajiado residence three weeks ago. They have been meeting elders to seek their blessings. They led a section of Luhya leaders in a meeting With Interior CS Fred Matiang’i in Nairobi on Thursday to push for development of the region.
