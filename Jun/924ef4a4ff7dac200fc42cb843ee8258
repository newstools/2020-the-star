The embattled Kirinyaga County Governor Anne Waiguru has said she is being hunted for solidly supporting the Building Bridges Initiative. In her closing remarks before the Senate Committee probing her case, Waiguru said that she is being accused for supporting the Handshake between President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga. "My stand has made me enemies with people of deep influence inside & outside my County which is a matter on public record,resulting in endless attacks on my person because of my support for BBI and the Handshake," Waiguru said. The county chief pleaded with a senate committee to dismiss the MCAs’ case against her terming it trivial and full of innuendos. She added, “Outside conspiracies visited on us with the help of a few local leaders has brought shame and humiliation to us at home. I pray that it should never be allowed to happen again.” The governor said the MCAs failed to prove their case, adding that they are full of generalities, hearsay and innuendos and thus the case not meet constitutional threshold to out her. “Having listened to the presentations made by the assembly, bear me witness that they mainly involved emotional and contradicting witness statements that were neither supported by any evidence nor fully substantiated by facts,” she said. She reiterated that her innocence, stating her lawyers; Paul Nyamodi and Kamotho Waiganjo proved beyond reasonable doubt that the impeachment case did not hold water. “My lawyers have dispelled the false allegations that formed the basis of my impeachment and we have seen that they are an affront to impeachment process as prescribed in the constitution. The issues raised could have indeed been clarified through routine inquiries,” she said. The 11-member committee led by Kakamega Senator clepgas Malala has finalised cross examining both parties and will be compiling the final report before presenting it before the Senate on Friday.
