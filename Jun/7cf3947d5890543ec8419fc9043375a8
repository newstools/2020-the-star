A group of Nandi elders has asked Baringo Senator Gideon Moi not to antagonise Deputy President William Ruto. They said on Saturdaythat for now Ruto was de facto leader of the Kalenjin community in the Rift Valley. Moi was being pushed into creating a wedge and splitting the region and its vote, they said. They spoke in Kapsabet a day after the Deputy President made a surprise visit to Kipsirwo Village, Kapsisywa location, to meet the Talai Council of elders for a blessing ceremony. The ceremony, in which milk and honey were poured on him, was also intended to protect the Deputy President who is facing political travails. Nandi elders’ spokesperson Charles Tanui said the ceremony was long overdue and that the blessings from the family of the legendary leader Koitalel Samoei was timely. He asked Moi, who is the Kanu national chairman, not to be seen as competing with Ruto because division was likely to split the Kalenjins. “Seeking blessings from the Talai Council of Elders to make his political career smooth is a good step,” Tanui said. Tanui, who was accompanied by Simon Cheruiyot and Shadrack Korir among others, said their group endorsed the DP. The Talai clan is said to possess powers to bless and foretell the future and their predictions are said to often come to pass. Clan members of the Nandi legendary leader are spread across Nandi, Kericho, Laikipia, Uasin Gishu and parts of Trans Nzoia counties. Three Nandi MPs - Vincent Tuwei (Mosop), Alex Kosgey (Emgwen) and Alfred Keter (Nandi Hills) - were conspicuously absent. Clan members led by Barsirian Manyei enthroned Kenya’s first President, Jomo Kenyatta, in 1964 at State House, Nakuru. Tanui said the Talai do not use witchcraft to bless leaders but use their inborn mystic powers that leaders seek to help them navigate their course. “When it comes to voting, it will be upon Kenyans to decide who to support, but to avoid many misfortunes one has to seek elders’ blessings,” he said..
