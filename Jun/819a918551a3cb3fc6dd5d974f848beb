Religious leaders have urged the government to reopen places of worship to heal broken marriages and failed relationships. The leaders made the call in a meeting organised by Eastern regional commissioner Isaiah Nakoru at the School of Government Embu campus. On Monday President Uhuru Kenyatta directed the ministries of Interior and Education to work on guidelines and protocol on the gradual reopening of places of worship and schools. The leaders drawn from the Christian, Muslim and Hindu faiths committed to ensuring that Covid-19 control measures are observed by worshippers. Embu Bishops and Pastors Fellowship secretary John Gachungi said the stay -at-home order has led to depression, anxiety and a rise in divorce. He said initially they thought the order would help couples to bond and strengthen their families but this was not the case. Gachungi said Kenyans are demoralised. He said places of worship contribute to family unity through prayer, counselling and forgiveness. “Once we begin the gatherings we shall promote wearing of masks, keeping social distance, washing and sanitising hands, use of thermal guns to take people's temperature, among others," Gachungi said. Muslim and Hindu leaders also said they will ensure all measures are followed to the letter by their faithful. Nakoru described Covid-19 as an evil spirit that should be dealt with through prayers and government control measures. The meeting follows President Uhuru Kenyatta’s advice that such consultations should be held to inform the process of lifting the cessation of movement order. Edited by Frank Obonyo
