The reopening of worship centres will depend on adherence to guidelines put in place by the state, Catholic Archdiocese of Nyeri Archbishop Anthony Muheria has said. This includes how Kenyans conduct themselves in meetings in villages and towns. “We are appealing to every Kenyan to be disciplined and follow government directives,” he said. Muheria on Saturday also urged religious leaders to educate their followers on the risks of Covid-19 so that when people return to their places of worship, they will not be a danger to one another. Archbishop Muheria was appointed by Interior CS Fred Matiang’i and his Health counterpart Mutahi Kagwe to chair an Inter-faith Council that will oversee the protocols ad reopening of places of worship. Muheria said the council started working last week and has already held two meetings. “Right now we cannot say anything because we are just starting to work. Our only appeal is to ask ourselves what we are doing to prepare ourselves for that moment,” he said. Muheria further said there is need to bring all religious leaders and all Kenyans on board as they the consultations start. “It is a journey that involves our being able to discipline our attitudes so we make sure we are not going to be a danger to our sisters and brothers,” he said. Muheria spoke when he received a Sh10 million cheque from Brookside Dairy at Our Lady of Consolata Catholic Cathedral Church in Nyeri town. The firm was contributing towards Hope4U initiative meant to provide food to over 10,000 needy families. The Hope4U is an initiative of the Catholic Archdiocese of Nyeri and the Diocese of  Kitui but the kitty will also help vulnerable families outside the borders of the two counties. Edited by A.N
