Nandi Senator Samson Cherargei was on Friday night involved in an accident along the Eldoret-Kapsabet road. Cherargei's vehicle rolled several times near Mulango area a few kilometres from the Eldoret International Airport as he was driving to Eldoret from Kapsabet at about 9.30 pm. His aides said the Senator sustained slight injuries were treated at a hospital in Eldoret for slight injuries and allowed to go back home. "It's true the senator was involved in an accident but thank God he was not seriously injured," said the aide. He said the Senator was assisted from the scene by a good Samaritan and taken to hospital where he was checked and allowed to go to his Eldoret home. Cherargei was not picking his calls or answering texts to comment on his condition by the time of publishing. Police are investigating the incident. Cherargei had earlier on Friday accompanied DP Ruto to meet Nandi elders. The DP and his team which also included Nandi governor Stephen Sang met the Talai elders as from 4 am on Friday. The Talai elders performed sacrifices and cleansedÂ  Ruto to protect him from harm and political miseries. The two-hour elaborate ceremony was organised by the Nandi Laibons Council of Elders and was conducted in Kipsirwo village from 5 am to 7 am. It was meant to protect the DP from bad omens. Ruto was then handed leadership instruments, including a baton (nogirwet) and a traditional stick (Siarit) said to have been used by legendary Nandi chief medicine man Orgoiyot-Kipnyolei arap Turgat. They had gathered at the home of retired Anglican priest Canon James Baasi. Elders from the larger Talai clan were selected to preside over the event.
