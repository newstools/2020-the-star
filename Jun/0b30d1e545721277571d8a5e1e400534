Former Machakos Senator Johnstone Muthama has ditched Wiper Party and declared support for DP William Ruto's 2022 bid. Speaking during a press conference on Thursday, Muthama said he ceased to be a Wiper Member the day he withdrew out of the Machakos senatorial in 2017. "What business do I still have in wiper? I have no business to be in wiper. I will ensure William Ruto becomes the 5th president of Kenya. And for the record, I am not being expelled from Wiper, I vomited wiper in 2017, excuse me,"Â  he said. "I am working round the clock to team up with Ruto to ensure that he is elected. We can only meet with Ruto to discuss serious issues." His move comes after Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka initiated a process likely to lead to his expulsion from the party. The party on Tuesday announced it will commence disciplinary proceedings against Muthama over alleged insubordination. The ex-senator has 14 days to respond to the allegations of disloyalty, failing which the party will take disciplinary action against him, including expelling him from the political outfit. Muthama is facing four accusations ranging from advancing the agenda of rival politicians to failing to perform his mandate as not only a Wiper NEC member but also head of Nasa Coordination Committee, which he co-chairs with Senate Minority leader James Orengo. Wiper is also accusing the former senator of spreading malicious propaganda and actively spreading hatred among the rank and file of the party membership. More to follow
