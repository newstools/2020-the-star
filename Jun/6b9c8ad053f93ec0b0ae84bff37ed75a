A white giraffe has been spotted outside the Ishaqbini Hirola Conservancy in Ijara constituency, Garissa. The giraffe was spotted by the Kenya Wildlife Service on Tuesday. The animal was in the midst of other giraffes at the conservancy.  KWS is yet to issue a statement on whether it is male or female. This comes after Kenya’s only white female giraffe and her calf were killed by poachers three months ago. The deaths were confirmed by community members and rangers of Ishaqbini Hirola Community Conservancy. Following the incident, only a lone bull remained. The white giraffe made headlines in 2017 after its discovery, with its unique white hide. It is white but not albino, because of a condition known as leucism. Unlike albinism, animals with leucism continue to produce dark pigment in their soft tissue, thus her eyes were dark in colour.
