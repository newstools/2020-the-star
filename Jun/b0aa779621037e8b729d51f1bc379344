The construction of the dual carriage Nairobi expressway has begun, signalling a possible end of traffic jams in the city. On Wednesday, excavators, rollers, graders, loaders and bulldozers were busy doing preliminary groundwork on the area between the dual carriage of Mombasa Road. Dozens of heavy-duty tippers were parked at an already cleared area near Jomo Kenyatta International Airport as drivers took a rest over lunch hour. The Chinese funded-project is financed through a Public-Private Partnership and had been delayed after attracting divergent opinions. It is on course, employing dozens of workers who have a reason to smile as many remain at home due to job losses brought about by the coronavirus pandemic. Some of the areas with evidence of works include the South B footbridge where machines are digging trenches. Between the Mombasa Road dual carriage, trees have been cleared, paving way for more advanced works. At the JKIA intersection, a section has been carpeted with murram, with huge heaps of soil by the side of the road. The Sh62 billion expressway is part of Kenya’s Vision 2030 development programme. It starts at JKIA and terminates at James Gichuru junction along the Waiyaki Way in Westlands. There will be 10 interchanges at Mlolongo, SGR terminus, Eastern and Southern bypasses, Capital Centre, Haille Selassie, Museum Hill, The Mall - Westlands and James Gichuru Road junction. The project is intended to ease traffic, hence reduce the energy and fuel costs associated with traffic snarl-ups. Estimates from the Kenya National Highway Authority indicate that the city loses Sh50 million daily to traffic jams. Edited by R.Wamochie
