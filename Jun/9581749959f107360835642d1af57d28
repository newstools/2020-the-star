Diamond Trust Bank and Serena Hotels will jointly provide 200 hot meals daily during the month of June 2020 to health workers. These meals will be for health workers fighting covid-19 at the government-designated Kenyatta National Hospital and the Mbagathi District Hospital in Nairobi. Speaking after the handover of the first lunch packs at KNH, DTB Group Chief Executive Officer Nasim Devji said the programme is part of the Bank’s commitment to the society during the COVID-19 pandemic. “This is a small way to appreciate the efforts of the frontline health workers who have committed themselves to help deal with this unprecedented time. We celebrate their dedication and commitment as they go about this daunting task,”  Devji said. The meals will be prepared at Nairobi Serena Hotel. DTB’s contribution towards the joint initiative will come from the recently announced Sh 100 million kitty. Serena Hotels MD Mahmud Jan Mohamed said: "At this time of crisis it is heart-warming and inspiring to hear of the incredible work that the brave front line workers are dedicated towards, with resilience to help and give dignity to the people with severe COVID-19. We as Kenyans couldn’t be prouder and truly appreciative of your amazing efforts…God Bless." KNH Chief Executive Officer Evanson Kamuri thanked DTB and Serena Hotels for the support. “We welcome with a lot of appreciation the kind gesture from Serena Hotels and DTB to provide hot meals to our frontline workers," he said.
