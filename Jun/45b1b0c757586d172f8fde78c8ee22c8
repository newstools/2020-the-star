A 21-year-old woman was Thursday evening buried alive when a sand quarry collapsed in Kolondo village in Kabondo Kasipul. Cynthia Awuor was harvesting sand when the six-foot quarry caved in. Village elder Richard Olweny said on Friday they have lost four people to sand harvesting tragedies in the last three years. “We’re perturbed by this incident. The woman was still young,” Olweny said. Kodumo West assistant chief Nelly Atata said the woman was in the company of others who managed to escape. “Awuor died after loose soil collapsed and buried her,” Atata said. Area deputy county commissioner Jack Obuo urged residents to stop excavating sand in the quarry. Obuo said they would arrest anybody who will be found harvesting sand at the site. “We want residents to stop sand harvesting since Homa Bay government had restricted excavating sand in the county. Arrest would be made against people who violate the ban,” he added. The body of Awuor was taken to Rachuonyo Level 4 Hospital mortuary in Oyugis.
