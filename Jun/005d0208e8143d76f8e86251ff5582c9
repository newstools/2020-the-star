Former Fiji Sevens coach Ben Ryan will conduct a rugby webinar with the country’s top coaches on Friday. Ryan, who guided Fiji to the Olympic gold medal in Rio, Brazil four years ago is regarded one of the best Sevens tacticians of all time. The theme for the webinar will be ‘getting the performance culture right’. Ryan, who also guided the Pacific Island nation to two World Sevens Series titles, rates Kenya highly in the shorter version of the game. He has also coached England for five years and has had a stint as technical director for the French Rugby Federation in the past two seasons. Those expected to attend the webinar are national team, Kenya Cup, Championship and Nationwide coaches. This will be the third webinar Kenya Rugby Union is conducting since the coronavirus pandemic hit the country in Marc. The first two were conducted by South African coaches — Pine Piennar of the Blue Bulls franchise focused on attack while Western Province’s Levy Labeeb conducted the defence drills and organisation. The union hopes the webinar will sharpen the coaches’ and the rest of the participants’ acumen in various aspects of the game. Director of Rugby Thomas Odundo has called on coaches to attend. “I am asking our coaches not to miss this opportunity with Ben Ryan. Looking at what he has achieved in the global game and his standing, it will be a good opportunity to interact with him and get knowledge on how we can improve the game in the country,” said Odundo. this text.
