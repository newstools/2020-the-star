Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya has announced he will hold talks with his Taita Taveta counterpart Granton Samboja to end the latest border stand-off between the two counties. Mvurya said on Friday he spoke with Samboja over the phone and they agreed to meet in two weeks to peacefully resolve several border disputes. The boundary dispute has been simmering, with each laying claim to the Kuranze mining zone containing several gemstone mines. The two counties are also embroiled in a boundary dispute over the bustling Mackinnon Road Township along the Mombasa-Nairobi highway. Each claims it is within its territory. Taita Taveta is involved in similar disputes with Makueni and Kajiado counties. “I spoke with Governor Samboja and we agreed on the need to hold face-to-face talks and resolve the border disputes amicably,” Mvurya said. Speaking in Kwale town, Mvurya said they agreed that officials from both administrations will cease activities likely to raise tensions. Mvurya underscored the need to recognise that Kwale and Taita Taveta cannot exist without each other. Two weeks ago the Taita Taveta administration’s efforts to start collecting taxes in Mackinnon Township were met with stiff resistance from Kwale officials who accused their counterparts of trespassing. “The long-standing boundary dispute between our two counties will end after holding broad-based consultations and actively keeping the public engaged,” Mvurya said. He added that he and Samboja had pledged closer cooperation. The Kwale governor said he hoped the border talks would lead to peaceful coexistence and avoid the occasional disquiet in the border region. (Edited by V. Graham)
