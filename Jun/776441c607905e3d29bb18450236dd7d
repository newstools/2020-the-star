Kenya’s bid to enhance forest cover was on Thursday boosted after the Treasury allocated Sh540 million for tree planting. Treasury CS Ukur Yatani Thursday said the money will be used to source seedlings locally and enhance tree planting programmes. The CS also announced a Sh1 billion allocation to support flood control using local labour in the most affected areas. “I have also set aside Sh 850 million to cater for  rehabilitation of wells, water pans and underground tanks in ASAL areas using local labour; and Sh540 million to enhance tree planting programme across the country using locally sourced seedlings,” the CS said when he read the 2020-2021 budget. The current vegetation cover is 7.2 per cent. The constitution envisages a cover of 10 per cent by 2022. To achieve the 10 per cent cover, some Sh48 billion is needed to plant 1.8 billion trees. Yatani noted that climate change is a key concern and like other economies, Kenya's is vulnerable to its effects. He said over the last 10 years, there has been increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather being experienced. There is need to pursue a green economic development path to minimise the extremities, he said. “In this regard, the National Treasury proposes to tap into the Green Climate Financing by issuing the first “Sovereign Green Bond” to finance major infrastructure projects in the FY 2020/21. These proceeds will be directed towards green projects at both the National and county level,” he said.
