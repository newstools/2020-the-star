A 35-year-old woman has been charged with using her dead sister’s identity card and stealing an M-Pesa mobile phone before transferring Sh194,000 to three accounts. Veronica Nthenge faced three counts of impersonation, cash theft, and theft of a Sh5,000 Nokia mobile phone that belonged to Kideye Mohammed. The incident allegedly took place on April 13, in Eastleigh, Nairobi. Nthenge pleaded not guilty before Makadara senior principal magistrate Angelo Kithinji and was released on Sh50,000 bail. The case will be heard from August 21. Police reports indicate that Samwel Kiba, the accused’s husband, had called his friend and requested him to hire out his car to his wife for nine days. However, during the signing of a car hire document, the accused allegedly introduced herself as Cecilia Ndinge. The police say that on the same day, she went to an M-Pesa shop on the 8th Street, Eastleigh, and deposited Sh150 into an M-Pesa account, which bore the name Cecilia Ndunge. Immediately Nthenge left the shop, the owner of the shop realised that the phone he was using for M-Pesa transactions was missing. He immediately called his M-Pesa agent administrator for assistance but was told that the float money had already been transferred to three different mobile numbers. The footage of a CCTV mounted at the shop revealed the make of the vehicle that Nthenge was using. An investigation was initiated and the vehicle circulated as wanted by the police IC3 command. On June 10, the vehicle was intercepted by Traffic police officers at the town centre. After interrogation, the officers traced and arrested Nthenge. They also recovered two national ID cards bearing the names of Cecilia Ndinge and Veronica Nthenge. Further investigations revealed that Ndunge was the sister of the accused and she had died. Edited by F'Orieny
