Kenyan basketballers can now breath a sigh of relief after renovations programme at Nyayo Stadium shifted from the main arena to the indoor gymnasium. The gymnasium that plays host to basketball league matches is slowly picking a different face with seats already fitted on the stands. Games at the venue have time and gain been forced to be halted due to the facility’s leaking roof. Justus Akhwesa, a Kenya Basketball Federation (KBF) technical official, said: “Technically, I am impressed with the way the seating arrangements has been done. We also hope the scoreboard will also be fixed because this has been our biggest problem.” He said the gymnasium not only lacks proper locker room and scoreboard but has lately been plagued with poor lighting. Akhwesa went on: “After Corona, I think we will be able to get back to the game and enjoy it more from where we had left it.” UON Dynamites’ coach Juma Kent said it is important that the facility is improved because Nyayo is very central to both the fans and the players as compared to Moi Stadium, Kasarani. The facility hosted the Afro-Basketball pre-qualifying tournament in January, where Kenya emerged tops. It was the first time Kenya was hosting a major competition since 1993. The gymnasium has ocassionally played host to several pro-boxing fight cards in the past.
