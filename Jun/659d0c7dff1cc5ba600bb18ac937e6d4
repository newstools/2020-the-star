President Uhuru Kenyatta has  mourned the passing on of his outgoing Burundi counterpart Pierre Nkurunziza. Uhuru, in his condolence message on Tuesday, said Nkurunziza was  an outstanding regional counterpart who served his country with distinction as Head of State and Government, and worked tirelessly for the peace and stability of his country and the Great Lakes Region. The President said, "Death has robbed East Africa of a prominent leader whose contribution to the integration and progress of the region shall be sorely missed." He prayed for God's calming comfort as the family, people of Burundi and East Africans mourn their departed leader. The government of Burundi on Tuesday announced the death of Nkurunziza, 55. According to a statement, Nkurunziza died after suffering a heart attack. He was admitted to hospital on Saturday after feeling unwell. His condition then improved, but on Monday he had a cardiac arrest and efforts to revive him were unsuccessful. Late last month, Burundi’s First Lady Denise Nkurunziza was admitted at the Aga Khan University Hospital, Nairobi, after she reportedly contracted the novel coronavirus. She was airlifted to Kenya’s Capital from Bujumbura, flying  on an Amref plane. Pascal Nyabenda, President of the National Assembly, will be sworn-in as new President ahead of inauguration of President-elect Everiste Ndayishimiye in August.
