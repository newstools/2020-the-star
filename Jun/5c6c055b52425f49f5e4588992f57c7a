A matatu driver risks life imprisonment for allegedly robbing a police officer of a radio communication equipment with violence. Onesmus Matheka also allegedly attempted to knock down Corporal Cosmas Mwaniki in South B for stopping him for carrying excess passengers in contravention of Covid-19 containment measures. Matheka denied the offence on Tuesday before MakadaraÂ chief magistrate Heston Nyaga. The court heard that on June 16 in South B, jointly with others not in court, he robbed Mwaniki of a police communication gadget and threatened to use violence on him. Matheka had earlier been flagged down by a senior Traffic Police officer at Syokimau for carrying more than the recommended passengers and violating the directive meant to ensure social distancing in public service vehicles. He refused to stop. The officer alerted his colleagues at the Imara Daima junction, who also flagged down the driver. He again refused to stop and allegedly attempted to knock down one of them before speeding off. Two of the officers gave chase on motorcycles intending to intercept Matheka at the Nyayo Stadium roundabout. The accused, however, diverted from Mombasa road to South B estate at Capital Centre. The officers - Mwaniki and Daniel Wangila - caught up with him at South B Shopping Centre where the matatu driver allegedly incited rowdy youths against them. The officers had to flee from the mob gathered at a car wash near South B mosque where Matheka had stopped. Mwaniki, however, boarded the vehicle and directed the accused to drive to Embakasi Police Station. On the way, Matheka and some accomplices are said to have attacked the officer in the cabin and robbed him of the gadget. The officer fled as the assailants bayed for his blood. The driver was traced and arrested by the Directorate of Criminal Investigations officers. The court freed him on Sh500,000 bail. The hearing starts on September 9.  - mwaniki fm
