Kitui youth movement leadership has accused Senator Enoch Wambua of arrogating himself the role of  the defender of Wiper leader Kalonzo  and unduly criticising Governor Charity Ngilu. “This is a man who has the audacity to be the self-appointed defender of Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka against attacks. Since he was elected, all news bytes attributed to him are about attacks on Ngilu,” they said in a statement yesterday. Group chairman Moses Munyalo cautioned the senator against seeking to derail Ngilu’s development agenda through undue attacks.  Munyalo was reacting to last week’s sentiment by Wambua in which he accused Ngilu of abdicating her duties as governor and opting to be a messenger. “Her new assignment is characteristically simple but very evil; try to stand in the way of Kalonzo and scuttle any attempts to seal a working relationship with President Uhuru Kenyatta,” a statement by the Senator said. Wambua noted that his attention had been drawn to Ngilu’s latest, "cheap and laughable utterances alleging, without providing any evidence," that the Wiper leader has ordered MCAs to frustrate her efforts to serve the people of Kitui. “What a shame from a person who personifies failure, political treachery and deceit. Ngilu must desist from dragging the name of Kalonzo Musyoka to her self-inflicted woes,” Wambua’s statement read. He said if the governor really cared about the people of Kitui, she should apologise to them for wasting their time and misappropriation of their resources by her administration and do the most honourable thing of resigning. Ngilu had in an earlier press conference in her office accused Kalonzo of using majority Kitui Wiper MCAs to frustrate her. She was enraged that the Kitui county assembly had thrown out her nominees to the Kitui CPSB and said she read Kalonzo’s hand in it.
