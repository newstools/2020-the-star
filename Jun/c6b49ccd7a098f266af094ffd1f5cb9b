Singer Akothee has for the first time revealed that she was legally married to her first husband, the father of her three daughters. The mother of five said she and Jared Okwello formalised their union in an SDA Church. She shared a photo on Instagram from back in the day and captioned it,"Weh, my friend! I was legally married in a church, don’t see me twerking naked on social media and imagine I just emerged from the streets of Koinange. But Daddy, why oversized… Awendo SDA church," she wrote. Akothee and her first husband separated but she is still in good terms with the ex-husband. She now prides herself as being the president of single mothers.
