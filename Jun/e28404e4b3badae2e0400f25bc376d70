The recruitment and promotion of teachers will be done in a transparent manner while putting into consideration regional balance, the Teachers Service Commission has said. Chief executive officer Nancy Macharia said on Thursday the commission has taken steps to ensure marginalised regions are not disadvantaged in the appointment and promotion of teachers. “The commission will continue to conduct recruitment and promotion of teachers in a fair and transparent manner as per its policy and the law. In this regard, it will ensure the activity is non-discriminatory and based on regional balance,” Macharia said. She made the remarks in a presentation to the Senate Standing Committee on Education. The committee had requested her to explain the criteria used during the recent promotion of 1,000 primary school teachers to teach in secondary schools Macharia was asked to state the reasons for leaving out teachers from Isiolo county despite their being qualified and tendering their applications and instead posted teachers from other counties there. Macharia was further asked to outline measures put in place to remedy the situation as well as prevent further occurrences of the anomaly in light of obligations to provide opportunities to marginalised communities. Macharia said it was not true that the commission did not promote teachers in Isiolo in the latest exercise. “To the contrary, the commission promoted four primary school teachers in Isiolo county during the said exercise.” She noted that the commission used subject combinations, performance in KCSE exam and grades attained in teaching subjects and length of service to pick the 1,000 teachers to be promoted. “All promotion vacancies are filled competitively with the objective to promote national values, fairness, non-discrimination and equity,” Macharia said.
