Health authorities in Kitui on Friday ordered Kyalilini eatery in the town’s CBD shut down after two of its workers were found to have contracted Covid-19. Kitui health and sanitation chief officer Dr Richard Muthoka said the  county disease  surveillance team  raided the  restaurant  mid-morning and took away all the nine workers at the premises. They ordered it closed. “We took the two workers who are confirmed to be Covid-19 positive to Kauwi Level 4 Hospital isolation and treatment centre while the other workers are held at the Kitui KMTC quarantine centre,” Muthoka said on phone. He added that primary contacts of the two infected workers were being traced, including family members and anyone believed to have interacted with the patients. “Health personnel had taken samples of the restaurant workers after the owner approached us to have the workers tested in preparation to reopening. The samples were taken to Nairobi on Tuesday and results came back on Thursday night,” Muthoka said. Muthoka said before shutting down the restaurant, the facility prepared food and served clients to take away. “The workers have also been delivering to clients at their places,” he added. “Within the county we now have only three active Covid-19 cases all admitted at the Kauwi isolation and treatment centre.” Edited by Henry Makori
