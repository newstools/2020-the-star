A real estate consultant is embroiled in a legal tussle with the Parliamentary Service Commission (PSC) over the proposed Sh3 billion Centre for Parliamentary Studies and Training set to be built in Karen. Nairobi based Arprim Consultant successfully sought orders against the cancellation of a tender process by the Commission. It had emerged as a finalist for the provision of consultancy services for preparation of a master plan, preliminary and detailed design, tender documents and construction supervision of the proposed Centre for Parliamentary Studies and Training. The PSC terminated the tender process after declaring it "non responsive." In a decision made on May 21, the Public Procurement Review Board (PPARB) cancelled and set aside PSC's notification of termination dated April 30 and ordered that it completes the procurement process to its logical conclusion. This includes issuance of letters of notification of the outcome within 14 days from the date of the decision. The High Court on June 2 allowed the PSC to challenge a decision by the Public Procurement Administrative Review Board to allow a request for review filed by Arprim Consultants. The firm was among bidders seeking to provide consultancy services for preparation of a master plan, preliminary and detailed design, tender documents and construction supervision of the proposed Centre for Parliamentary Studies and Training.
