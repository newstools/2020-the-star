ODM party leader Raila Odinga has mourned the death of former Burundi President Pierre Nkurunziza. Nkurunziza died on Tuesday after suffering a heart attack. In his message posted on his Twitter page on Wednesday, Raila wished Burundians peace, hope and stability at this time of mourning. Raila added that Burundi’s institutions should stand firmly for the country and the people. The 55-year-old outgoing president was hospitalised on Saturday after feeling unwell. His condition then improved, but on Monday he had a cardiac arrest and efforts to revive him were unsuccessful. Raila's message came hours after President Uhuru Kenyatta also sent his condolence message on Tuesday. Uhuru described Nkurunziza as an outstanding regional counterpart who served his country with distinction as Head of State and Government, and worked tirelessly for the peace and stability of his country and the Great Lakes Region. Late last month, Burundi’s First Lady Denise Nkurunziza was admitted at the Aga Khan University Hospital, Nairobi, after she reportedly contracted the novel coronavirus.
