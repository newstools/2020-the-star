Optiven Group on Friday reopened its entertainment centre, GMC Fun Place, at Kitengela. The facility was closed on March 23 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The centre is now accentuated by a brand new half Olympic-size commercial pool, The Oasis Blue Sky Pool. Present were Kajiado Deputy Governor Martin Moshisho and Optiven Group CEO George Wachiuri. This development will be a big boost to the tourism industry, struggling due to the effects of Covid-19.
