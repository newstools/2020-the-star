Youth Enterprise Development Fund chairman Victor Mwongera has been found guilty of contempt for firing the CEO even after the court had halted process. Labour Court judge Hellen Wasilwa ruled that Mwongera disobeyed the court order she issued in April that directed him and the board not to dismiss the CEO. In the case, Josiah Moriasi who is the immediate former CEO had moved to court to challenge the termination of his contract by the YEDP board. Judge Wasilwa said the import of the court order was to maintain the status quo by staying the decision made not to review Moriasi’s contract and therefore not dismissing him. “My finding is that the respondent treated this court’s order contemptuously and is therefore liable to being punished,” the court ruled. She dismissed Mwongera’s defense that the orders were issued when the CEO’s contract had already expired. Justice Wasilwa said the orders were issued on April 30 and at that time the contract had not yet lapsed. Mwongera had claimed that they found the order of court incapable of being implemented. However, the court ruled that the law on contempt is clear in that they cannot plead incapability of enforcement of court orders as they had argued. “The order made by this court however difficult it may seem to implement, the respondents treated the said order casually and even denied the applicant access to his office amongst other actions as cited by the applicant,” she ruled. In his contempt application, Moriasi had asked that the chairman be found  guilty of contempt and be denied audience before the court until he purges the contempt. In response to the application, the chairman argued that Moriasi served an appointive fixed term contract which ended on April 30 so the order by the court could not revive his lapsed contract. It was his argument that he had already issued a letter of appointment on the same day to Benson Muthendi to serve as chief executive officer in acting capacity. Edited by Henry Makori
