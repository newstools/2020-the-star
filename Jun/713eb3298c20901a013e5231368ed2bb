Young people from Western have accused Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa of betraying them by only working with the old folk. They said he does not deserve to be made Luhya spokesman because he has no agenda for the young people. The Western Youth Development Network addressed the press in Bungoma town. Eugene declined to comment on the allegations. Chairman Sawka Mungachi said they strongly oppose his appointment as community spokesman because they feel that he does not speak for them. Sakwa said ever since Eugene was appointed to the Cabinet, he has only been reviving the political careers of old politicians, leaving out hundreds of youths. “We are dismayed by the fact that Wamalwa wants to ride on the youth but has always worked with old politicians like Musikari Kombo and Noah Wekesa," he said. Sawka said Eugene should be replaced by a youthful person like ODM secretary general Edwin Sifuna during the impending Cabinet reshuffle. “We want a youth to represent us in the Cabinet, not a person who uses our name to get his position and immediately forgets about us,” he said.
