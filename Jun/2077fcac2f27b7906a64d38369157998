Attorney General Paul Kariuki and Solicitor General Kennedy Ogeto will not be allowed to practice as advocates in the country from next month. This is after the Law Society of Kenya agreed to expel the two in the coming Ordinary General Meeting on July 23. The OGM will be held virtually. The LSK believes Kihara and Ogeto are misadvising the government on the rule of law. Once struck off the Roll of Advocates, Kihara and Ogeto will not be allowed to practise for a specific period, depending on how LSK members will agree. LSK secretary Mercy Wambua said in an email on Wednesday that the council had already prepared a motion to expel Kihara and Ogeto. It will be discussed at the OGM next month. “Motion on the expulsion of Paul Kihara Kariuki (P.105/969/78) and Kennedy Nyabuti Ogeto (P.105/2129/91) from the membership of the Law Society of Kenya,” Wambua said in an email. The LSK holds its OGM in March every year. However, it was postponed this year from March 28 until further notice due to the Covid-19 global pandemic and subsequent government restrictions banning the holding of public gatherings as a measure for containment of the spread of the virus. The LSK council held its meeting on the May 11 and resolved to hold the OGM virtually next month. “Notice is hereby given that an ordinary general meeting of the Law Society of Kenya is convened for and shall take place at the offices of the Law Society of Kenya along Gitanga Road virtually through the Zoom/webinar platform at 10:00 am on Thursday, 23rd July 2020,” the email read.
