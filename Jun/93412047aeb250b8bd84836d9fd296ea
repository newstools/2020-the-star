In a normal society, sanctity of human life is treasured. However, when a society turns a blind eye to wanton killings, the value of human life is degraded. Revenge killings then become a norm. For the longest time, the people of Marsabit have slaughtered each other over superiority battles, boarder disputes and resources, among other issues. Innocent lives are lost as communities revenge on each other. Not once has the national government followed through with a thorough investigations and prosecutions. This, in a way, has made perpetrators believe they can get away with murder. Often, when the government intervenes, it does it in a way that makes people believe one community is targeted. The people of Marsabit need to understand they are marginalised and they ought to look at their diversity and embrace it for their own good, not cannibalise each other. It is laughable for a people knee deep in poverty, without proper hospitals, schools and access to clean water, among other challenges, to dig themselves deeper by decimating each other. It is time all the tribes stop pointing fingers on who is the aggressor or who has done what and stop these senseless killings. It is also time for the national government to stop treating the deaths of the people of Marsabit as those of lesser human beings. They are not second-class citizens! The state should do unbiased thorough investigations and prosecute those responsible from both sides.
