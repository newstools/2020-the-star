Kenya Harlequins will announce their new head coach next week. Speaking yesterday, Quins chairman Michael Wanjala said eight candidates had applied for the job and the coaching panel will conduct its final interviews today before settling for the right candidate for the job. The coaching panel includes Kenya Simbas coach Paul Odera, former Kenya Sevens coach Gordon Anampiu and head of technical committee Victor Sudi. Wanjala termed the panel very insightful and knowledgeable in as far as the game is concerned. "They are some of the best rugby brains we have in the country and their input will be critical on who becomes the coach." The head coach position was made vacant earlier this month after the incumbent Dominique Habimana was told to re-apply for the job after just one season. The Ngong-Road outfit who have won the league eight times in their history failed to make it to the 2019-2020 playoffs, finishing a disappointing ninth with 28 points. Wanjala said lack of a pre-season hampered their chances and with the new coach set to be appointed in the next one month, they will not take any chances this time round. “We learnt our lessons from last season and we hope to start our preparations early. We have talented squad and if we get our preparations right, then we can be very competitive for the 2020-2021 season,” he noted. Wanjala said with the Covid-19 pandemic, it is difficult to attract sponsors because of the tough economic challenges. “ It's very tough situation but as the club, we will keep  looking around to secure good deals for the club."
