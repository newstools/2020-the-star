The ICT Authority has partnered with Huawei to provide students with online training and skills so they can be recruited to the DigiTalents group. This after the authority began recruitment for its fifth group of DigiTalents which is ramping up support for the current group before they graduate. The 400 DigiTalents are managed and supported through an online portal which helps match students to internships as well as mentors. The platform is also used for submitting and assessing innovations. Huawei has been a key partner to the ICT Authority in building the nationwide fiber backbone network as well as providing a cutting-edge cloud data centre for the authority’s sister organisation under the Ministry of ICT. “I want to thank you for the continued support and collaboration in several programmes that Huawei has been supporting under the skills and career development toward our Digitalents,” ICT Authority programme manager and national coordinator Zilpher Owiti said. With its East Africa training centre in Kenya, over 30 universities and institutes have been certified as training partners and have access to the best global training materials. Over 150 DigiTalents receive training on condition that they pass the exams. They are then certified for free to join the more than 1,200 other trained students from the programme. After completing their testing, the participants will have access to free Huawei learning resources and tools including eNSP, fusion computer and different AI models. They will also become Huawei Certified ICT associates and will be prioritised for future job interviews and hiring by Huawei and its partners. The programme has been successful and has shown the ICT Authority at the forefront of online learning as well as strategic partnerships, leveraging both to great success. Edited by R.Wamochie
