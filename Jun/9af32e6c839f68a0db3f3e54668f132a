Women living in slums and working in the informal sector held protests on Monday to call for inclusion during distribution of funds from the government's stimulus package. The women want to be classified under the 'vulnerable group' which is entitled to funds. President Uhuru Kenyatta last month announced plans to roll out an eight-point Economic Stimulus Programme, to resuscitate the economy from the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. The programme intends to cushion vulnerable groups in informal settlements whose livelihoods were shuttered rendering some families destitute after losing their source of income.
