Zoo Youth will next season officially change their name to Gusii FC, according to the chairman Paul Mayieko has said. The national Division One club will also play their home games at Gusii Stadium and Cardinal Otunga High School in Mosocho from next season. Mayieko said their target is to qualify to the Kenya Premier League in the next three years. “Our target was to play in the National Super League next season. However, that was not possible due to cancellation of the season by the Kenya Football Federation. Our target now is to play in NSL in the 2021-22 season and KPL in the 2022-23 season as per our strategic plan,” Mayieko told the Star. He announced that the club intends to sign six youthful players and a similar number of experienced footballers. “National Division One is a very competitive League. We intend to sign youthful and experienced players who can help us achieve our ambitions,” said the former Shabana chairman. During his tenure, Mayieko helped Shabana gain promotion from National Division One to NSL. He said coach Andrew Ongwae is currently working on the new signings. Last month, FKF general secretary, Barry Otieno, announced the cancellation of the 2019/2020 season due to the coronavirus pandemic and used first leg standings to promote and relegate teams. In first leg, Zoo Youth were number three. Silibwet, who were on top of FKF Division One Zone 'B' were promoted alongside Zone 'A' leaders Mwatate. Soy FC and MCF FC will meet in a play-off to determine the third team to be promoted to the second-tier league.
