The National Aids Control Council has appointed Dr Ruth Laibon Masha as the new executive director. Masha takes over from Dr Nduku Kilonzo who has been serving in the position since 2014 as her term comes to an end. In a statement, NACC board chairperson Angeline Siparo said under Nduku's leadership, Kenya has achieved significant results in reducing annual new infections and AIDs related deaths, with continued monitoring of county AIDs plans and revamped community AIDs reporting framework. "During her tenure, Kenya's approach to HIV prevention was globally acknowledged and she served on four global panels and commissions," Siparo said. "At the NACC, Dr Nduku has provided stewardship, growing the institutional profile and human resources and ensuring good governance practices." Dr Masha previously worked in Kenya for the UNAIDS Kenya office, ActionAid and Family Health Options Kenya. She has been tasked with securing the gains made in HIV/AIDs response in Kenya and action towards a strengthened response in the wake of Covid-19. She joins the office from UNAIDS in Geneva Switzerland where she served as an advisor to the global HIV prevention coalition and adolescent health.
