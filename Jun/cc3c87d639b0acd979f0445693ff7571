A gang of five that has been terrorizing Parklands residents in Nairobi have been arrested. They are; Susan Wambui Njoroge, Kennedy Aluoch, Kilibe Justine, Samson Wanjohi and James Mwangi. The suspects have been burglarizing houses in Parklands using hundreds of master keys found in their possession, DCI director George Kinoti said on Tuesday evening. When police raided their hideout, they found over 12 laptops, jewelry, mobile phone chargers, and hard drives. "The suspects are in lawful custody and will be charged accordingly," DCI said. Last month, two suspects who had represented themselves as genuine container sellers were arrested for defrauding an individual of Sh 72,000 . Ethan Mwangi and Isaiah Otieno were arrested by DCI detectives within Huruma Estate in Nairobi.
