The Catholic Church is worried about the increasing number of Covid-19 infections among truck drivers. In a statement by the Kenya Conference of Catholic Bishops, the church says that the government should do better to improve the safety and health of truckers. “Truck drivers constitute an immensely to the economic growth in our country. The increasing number of infections indicates that there are gaps in addressing their safety and health,” Reverend Virgilio Pante, who read the statement, said. Truck drivers account for the majority of Covid-19 infection at the border points in the country. Most have decried the increasing cases of harassment by members of the public who consider them carriers of the virus. The clergy also expressed concern over the welfare of street families and mentally ill persons, noting their increased exposure to infections. “Although we note that various well-wishers have come on board to support the street families, the government should pay more attention to their health and safety,” Pante said. A survey released by the Ministry of Labour on Wednesday last week revealed that 55 per cent of women on the street have HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases. The survey also shows that only 37 per cent of street girls and boys use condoms during sex. Pante said the pastoralist community was another vulnerable group that needs close attention from the government. “Although the infection rate among the pastoralist community is low, we still encourage the national and county governments to sensitise this community on Covid-19 preventive measures,” he said. The church implored Kenyans to give one another material and emotional support during the prevailing difficult times occasioned by Covid-19. (edited by o. owino)
