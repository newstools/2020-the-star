A hot deejaying competition is about to go down. Titled 'Compe ni Compe', it will take fans on a musical journey through the art of disc jockeying. The competition targets all DJs with the ability to wow the audience with their art and skills. DJs will compete from the comfort of their homes and their various sets streamed live on a Facebook Group page. The winner will be voted for by the audience and will be named the 'Kenyan DJ of the Year'. They also stand to gain street credibility and some monetary incentive. The timeline of the competition depends on the number of participants who will confirm their availability. With the ongoing online debate of DJs being cut off during live streaming, the organiser of the online DJ competition, Prince Otach, said the copyright issue is more complex than we think. He, however, encouraged Kenyan DJs to join the competition. “This is an opportunity for true Kenyan DJs to stand up and be counted," Prince Otach said. “Kenyan DJs have been selling us an illusion of an over-hyped top DJ, who believe they have it. This is their time to come out and claim their seat at this competition.” DJ Kalonje and DJ Brownskin will be joined by top Embu DJ Caril the scratch queen master in the competition.
