Singer Otile Brown says Nabayet, his Ethiopian ex-girlfriend, was a Godsent. She came into his life at the right time and ended up being the love of his life, he said. Otile had just broken up with Vera Sidika and the drama went public, with both parties slinging mud at each other. Speaking to comedian Jalango on his YouTube page, Otile said Nabayet was different. “A lot of people do not understand me and they judge me based on my previous relationships. I am a guy who will do crazy things for the person that I love,” he said. Otile said even though they have broken up, Nabayet is still the only woman he ever loved. “...nobody else. She was just an amazing lady whom I valued so much and loved dearly,” he said. Otile said she never cooked for him though. Nabayet was never scared of showing her vulnerability, he said. “She understood me very well and was very supportive. She was a lady who would cry when she was insecure or angry. She was not a drama queen.”
