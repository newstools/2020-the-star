On Madaraka Day President Uhuru Kenyatta rightly pointed out that the Constitution is a "living document' that can be amended and updated. The Building Bridges Initiative team has been seeking views since 2018 and will soon make its final recommendations. One proposal will take centre stage – the creation of the post of an executive Prime Minister. However the BBI will not be proposing a Westminster parliamentary system because the PM will be an MP chosen and appointed by the President. So the new PM will be little different from super-minister Fred Matiang'i who today manages much of government business. As President Kenyatta said, the BBI changes are intended to enhance unity and reduce violence in the political system. If the creation of a PM and two deputy PMs can achieve that, few will oppose it. So in all probability, the BBI proposals would receive an overwhelming majority. Yet the referendum will be very expensive – estimates go up to Sh10 billion. Wouldn't it be better to spend that on cash transfers to poor people during this Covid lockdown? Let's find a way to make the necessary BBI changes without holding a referendum.
