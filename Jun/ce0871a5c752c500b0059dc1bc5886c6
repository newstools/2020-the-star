Contractors who abandon sites after shoddy work will forgo their pay and be blacklisted, Vihiga Governor Wilber Ottichilo has said. Ottichilo said the county has been frustrated by contractors who get tenders, abandon projects but harass the county to pay them via the courts. The county chief spoke at Izava Liaduiywa ward in Sabatia where he commissioned a 2.8km road. “We have lost millions of shillings over those lazy contractors and other millions in courts battling with them over payments. This time it is not business as usual,” he said. Those who cannot meet the standards of delivery should not bother to come for work, Ottichilo said. “I won’t listen to the courts. You do shoddy work or you fail to finish your work we shall re-advertise it and award it to another company,” the county chief said. He committed to paying contractors who finish work and present clearance documents. The road project was awarded to Tallon Africa Enterprises headed by Josephine Gavulani. The governor said she had done a good job in Nandi, Uasin Gishu and other areas. “Josephine is the first local lady contractor the county has awarded a tender. What she will deliver will give us a chance to work with more ladies,” Ottichilo said. The project is expected to be complete by January next year. Ottichillo urged local contractors to invest in Vihiga county to ensure economic growth. He said investing in Vihiga will end capital flight that the county is suffering from. (edited by o. owino)
