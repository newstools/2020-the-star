Four Lamu sailors who had been missing since Tuesday night have been rescued. The four had been transporting building blocks from Manda-Maweni to Mokowe in a dhow when the vessel was swept away by strong winds. The incident happened at Ingimi, a few metres from the new port at Lapsset site in Lamu West. The four - Ahmed Shee, Andalla Mohamed, Shee Ali and Bwana Lamme - were rescued by Lamu County Marine Search and Rescue team on Wednesday morning after a distress call by one of the sailors on Tuesday at 9pm. The search team had spent the night at sea. The rescue was confirmed by the SAR team leader Shee Kupi. “They are shaken but are all okay and have already reunited with their families. We are appealing to all sea users to be extremely cautious because the ocean is currently experiencing very high tide and strong winds,” Kupi said. Six people escaped death narrowly after three boats they were using to transport miraa to Somalia capsized at Ashuwei area, near Mlango wa Tanu channel in Mkokoni Lamu East on Wednesday. The sailors were aboard three vessels when they encountered rough tides occasioned by the strong winds. The six were rescued by Kenya Wildlife Service officers from the nearby Mkokoni camp after one of them made a distress call. However, they lost the miraa worth millions of shillings. On April 19, six mangrove loggers escaped death narrowly when their boat sank at Mkanda Channel in the Indian Ocean. The vessels, fully loaded with mangrove logs, hit a reef and capsized.  - mwaniki fm
