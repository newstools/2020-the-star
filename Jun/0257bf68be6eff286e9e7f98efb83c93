Labour CS Simon Chelugui has urged Kenyans to engage in tree farming so saw-milling goes on without massive reduction of forest cover. He spoke in Nakuru during a visit to find out about joblessness and redundancies caused by the coronavirus. "We need to embrace tree farming so we don't depend on government forests for saw-milling. If we plant trees, we will benefit from tree products while our youth will retain employment," Chelugui said. He was responding to Nakuru Deputy Governor Erick Korir who said hundreds of youth in Elburgon who depended on logging have been jobless since the government banned tree felling. The ban on logging and extraction of timber in all public and community forests was initially imposed on February 24, 2018. Cabinet extended the ban for a year in November last year. Environment Cabinet Secretary Keriako Tobiko said more time was required for the full implementation of new measures to protect the forests. Korir said youth whose main source of livelihood was timber trade have been asking for help to get other sources of income. It is approximated that close to 1,000 youth from Elburgon, Molo and Total who worked as loaders, power saw operators, transporters and millers were affected by the ban. Over the past nine years, the multibillion-shilling industry has been one of the country's leading employer, especially for uneducated youth. Elburgon Timber Manufacturers Association chairman Bernard Gitau said many youth are suffering. Recently, Nakuru Governor Lee Kinyanjui appealed to the national government to consider youth from Elburgon in the ongoing Kazi Mtaani programme. Edited by Josephine M. Mayuya
