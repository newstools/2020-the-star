The Chandarana Foodplus chain of retail stores has opened a branch in Kakamega. Chandarana opened their doors to shoppers at the Beholden mall on Friday. It joins Tuskys, Khetias and Maisha Mart supermarkets in the town. Branch manager Joseph Kagesi said that the move to open in Kakamega followed demands by shoppers. "When we were opening in Eldoret, customers demanded that we move to Kisumu and demands for Kakamega were made when we went to Kisumu. A market survey revealed the potential in Kakamega. We are the face of variety and quality at affordable prices," Kagesi said. Kagesi said that the fast growth of the town witnessed under devolution provides a ready market. The outlet has employed 90 people all from within the county, Kagesi said. “We are welcoming other bands to move in and complement our services,” he said. Residents said the opening of the new outlet will give them a variety to choose from. “We want as many supermarkets to open branches here so that there is healthy competition that will ensure better services,” Mary Ayuma, a shopper, said.
