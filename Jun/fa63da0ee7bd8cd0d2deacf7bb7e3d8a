Meru county has traced close to 20 contacts of 13 people who tested positive for Covid-19 last week, Health executive Misheck Mutuma has said. Addressing a press conference on Sunday at Gatimene Hotel in North Imenti, he said the 13 were all from the constituency. Mutuma said that they have taken samples of the contacts for testing. “If they test positive, 65 people will be quarantined,” he said. Those in treatment isolation wards are doing well, the CEC said. The first patient has fully recovered and discharged. Mutuma said nearly all the cases in Meru are asymptomatic. He urged residents not to take for granted the precautions issued by the Ministry of Health. “It’s a pity when I walk in Meru town and find people without masks, overloaded on a boda boda and others crammed in crowds.” Mutuma said they will increase the 76 isolation beds to 340. They have added 24 beds at Nyambene Level 4 Hospital, 34 at Maua Methodist, 20 in Kunene Hospital and 189 at Igoji, he said. He said they do testing at high-risk areas as kits are not enough for mass testing. Mutuma added they have requested the national government to facilitate testing at the Meru Teaching and Referral Hospital as taking samples to Nairobi takes days to get results back. The county, he said, has been distributing food to slums identified as the most vulnerable in community. "So far, we have given food to Majengo Mjini and Makutano. Those politicising the donations should stop because we cannot feed everyone in the county.” Edited by R.Wamochie
