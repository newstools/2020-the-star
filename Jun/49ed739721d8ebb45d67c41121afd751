A court in Nakuru has ordered the African Inland Church (AIC) Kijabe management to pay a former manager Sh975,000 for unfair dismissal. In her ruling, Justice Monica Mbaru of the Employment and Labour Relations Court awarded Reverend John Njuru Ndung'u the money after establishing that the termination of the contract was unfair and a violation of the law. Ndung'u was employed by the church as a station manager in July 2015 and took up another contract in 2018 on a monthly salary of Sh60,000. The salary was later increased to Sh84,700. In early 2019, Ndung'u was sent on a 30-day administrative leave to allow for financial audit and handing over of the management report. On March 13, 2019, he was dismissed over allegations of engaging in fraudulent activities. But aggrieved by his dismissal, he went to court to seek compensation and retirement benefits worth Sh24 million. He argued that he was dismissed without a valid reason, without notice or being given time to defend himself. Ndung'u sought an anticipatory 17 years' salary amounting to Sh23 million as he was dismissed at 53 years, yet he was to retire at 70. Justice Mbaru declared the sacking unfair and awarded him compensation on June 2. In its defence, the mission station had said the ex-manager engaged in fraud. The court heard that in 2017, the cleric sold firewood worth Sh40,000 to Kinyanjui Boys' High School where he was an administrator, but the money was not paid to the church station. In 2018, Ndung'u allegedly illegally procured a medical bill credit of Sh15,000 to his employee, an amount he did not clear. Further, he is said to have falsely presented that rubber for the station’s water pump would cost Sh100,000 while the actual cost was Sh76,000. “A cheque was done in his name but never procured the rubber and thus the respondent [station] demanded a refund of the Sh 100,000 which has never been paid,” the station said. While seeking compensation, the Reverend claimed that his salary was Sh126,000, a statement the management strongly opposed claiming that his last salary was at Sh84,700. The defence said the claimant illegally, without justifiable cause, increased his salary to Sh116,000 and Sh126,000. He also proceeded to renew his contract on June 29, 2018, a month before his contract was due and by this, his contract was ambiguous, the court heard. The station thus claimed that Ndung'u was paid illegally during his tenure and through this, he dispossessed the church of its property.
