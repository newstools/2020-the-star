First Lady Margaret Kenyatta and DP's wife Rachel Ruto will follow the Madaraka Day celebrations from one of State House's balconies and not the dais. A dais is a raised platform at the front of a room or hall, usually for one or more speakers or honoured guests. As a tradition, the two normally sit next to their husbands - President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto during national events. But this changed on June 1, 2020. Sources tell the Star that the two will be following the proceedings from the balcony in a bid to exercise social distancing as the country fights Coronavirus pandemic. According to images seen through a live broadcast by NTV, the two chairs have already been put in the balcony. In addition, less than 20 seats have been set on the dais. Next to the President, there are about four other seats only - one reserved for the Deputy President. The President will lead the country in celebrating this day at State House, Nairobi and very few people will be allowed to attend the function. This is a national holiday celebrated every  June 1 of every year in Kenya. It commemorates the day in 1963 that Kenya attained independent self-governance after decades as a Kenya Colony. For the first time in history, Kenyans will celebrate Madaraka day virtually. The celebrations will be hosted in two venues in Nairobi due to coronavirus pandemic. The unique June 1 celebrations will start at 8am where the Kenya Defence Forces stage a show at the Nyayo stadium and culminate in the live address by President Uhuru Kenyatta from State House, Nairobi. All the events are synchronised into one event and will be aired live on media platforms with no crowd allowed at the venues. Very few people will attend the State House celebrations according to the details obtained by the Star. The 57th national celebrations will be streamed through all local media houses and also through online platforms.
