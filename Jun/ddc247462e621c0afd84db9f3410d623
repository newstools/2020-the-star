 One person was killed on Tuesday in skirmishes between rival clans in Mandera following disagreements over the construction of a water pan in Wargadud ward. Scores others were injured. The clans failed to agree on where the dam would be dug. Wargadud MCA Abdullahi Noor who recorded a statement at the Mandera police station called for calm and a ceasefire. The MCA said the county government project will benefit all residents irrespective of clan affiliations. Mandera East director of criminal investigations Benard Kigen said three people have been arrested in connection with the clashes. Kigen said the fighting was not an inter-clan flare up but was caused by competition over resources. The DCI boss said area leaders have been tasked to end the fighting or the project will be diverted to other wards. Residents who spoke to the press regretted that the incident could lead to a flare-up of tribal clashes. They said the construction of the earth dam would have greatly minimised water shortage in the area “We have lived in peace like brothers and sisters. Let us not allow this isolated incident trigger inter-clan clashes which were the order of the day a few years ago and which led to loss of lives. I am appealing for calm from members from the two communities,” local elder Abdi Ahmed said. The Garre and Degodia clans have in the past fought over control of county resources. Clashes in 2013 lasted for two months and led to the death of hundreds of people. Many more were displaced and property destroyed Governor Ali Roba has on several occasioned led peace efforts and pleaded with the two clans to peacefully co-exist, reminding them of the violence that he said derailed development.
