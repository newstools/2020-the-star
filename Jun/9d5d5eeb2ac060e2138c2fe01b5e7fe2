Opposition chief Raila Odinga on Thursday held talks with Mandera Governor Ali Roba in what is seen as a drive to woo more allies of Deputy President William Ruto. Roba has been a staunch supporter of Ruto and a key Jubilee point man in Northeastern. “Today I met the right Honorable Raila Odinga and Senator James Orengo for a consultative meeting on a number of issues including a continued partnership in politics. I also sought his advice on a number of other issues relating to governance and networking,” Roba said via Twitter on Thursday. The governor’s meeting with Raila comes hot on the heels of other Ruto allies meeting the opposition chief this week. On Wednesday, Ruto suffered yet another blow after three key allies switched allegiance, joining President Uhuru Kenyatta and Raila’s camp. The three pro-Ruto visitors were Lands Chief Administrative Secretary Gideon Mung’aro, Laikipia North MP Sarah Korere and Coast businessman Suleiman Shahbal. They trooped to Raila’s Capitol Hill office to pledge their allegiance and disassociated themselves from Tangatanga. The first to cross over to the Uhuru-Raila side on Tuesday was Laikipia Woman Representative Catherine Waruguru. Korere was once a staunch DP ally and an unapologetic crusader against President Uhuru and Raila’s handshake that gave birth to the Building Bridges Initiative. The lawmaker, who was among the 16 Jubilee MPs to be axed from lucrative parliamentary committees, expressed support for the handshake and the BBI while meeting Raila.
