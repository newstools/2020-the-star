Gospel singer and TV presenter Branice Mudi, aka Branny, says fans should expect more from her after her collaboration with Masterpiece. She released 'Wahala' about a month ago. The hit is an upbeat Gospel jam with a touch of AfroPop. She told Word Is on Monday that Masterpiece and her have been friends for a while. "I've wished to work with him before but looks like it was not God's time until 'Wahala' happened. For that, I'm so grateful," she said. "Wahala' is of Nigerian origin, meaning worry or problem, so in this case, we say 'I have no worries when I'm with God'." Branny feels like she has just started and vows to give more to her fans. "I'm going to put in extra work like never before and release more projects that are well arranged and a notch higher than all the previous ones," she said. In these unprecedented times, Branny has cancelled her gigs. "Money has been scarce, causing quite a challenge in recording both audios and videos," she said. "For me, quality is key. And quality definitely requires money. All this shall pass, though. God has greater plans," she said. Last year, Branny scooped a Groove nomination as female breakthrough artiste of the year. "I'd love my fans to know I appreciate them beyond words. I wouldn't be here now if it weren't for them. Also, they should be ready for more good stuff that they'll get to vibe to, dance to, and be blessed with."
