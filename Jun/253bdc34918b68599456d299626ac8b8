@ddibondo  Meru MCAs and sorghum farmers have asked Treasury CS Ukur Yatani to review the proposed taxation for Keg beer, saying it will hurt both growers and production companies. In his budget statement last week, Yatani proposed reducing sorghum remission from 80 per cent to 60 per cent. That means tax for the brewery products will rise from the current 20 per cent to 40 per cent. MCAs said the move will raise Keg beer production costs. "This will directly affect the farmers because the brewery will roll the cost to them," Ntima West MCA Paul Bagine who chairs the county assembly's agriculture committee said. Meru county has 55,890 farmers who grow sorghum across nine constituencies. Bigne said they harvest approximately 19,000 metric tonnes every season. The farmers received Sh700 million in the last season. He said the breweries pay Sh32 for each kg of sorghum and the farmer uses about Sh24 to Sh26 in production per kilo. Governors have also raised concerns over the proposed taxation. The Council of Governor's agriculture committee chairman Muthomi Njuki said the changes will hurt farmers in counties that cultivate sorghum and millet for sale. The Tharaka Nithi governor has also written to Yatani protesting the excise tax. Bar owners have also protested the move, saying it will hurt sales and cut jobs by 200,000. Abogetha East MCA Mwirigi Kainga said the move is unacceptable especially during the Covid-19 pandemic. "We reject the proposals by the Treasury CS because most of our youth will be rendered jobless," Kainga said. Robert Kithinji (Nyaki East) and Gabriel Chokera (Mikinduri) also expressed their disapproval of the proposed tax measures. Eliud Mutembei of the Cereals Growers Association in Meru said farmers are already incurring a lot of costs in production and that it would be unfair to further tax them. He said if implemented, many farmers will be pushed out of business.  Edited by P.O
