Meanwhile, he said three health care workers in Nyeri tested positive. Aman said that they are at risk of contracting the disease. "They put their lives on the line to care for the affected. We do not take this for granted. Let us recognise this sacrifice and display our compliance with the measures," he said. "Healthcare workers are directly dealing with Covid-19 but we have other workers in first line not necessarily medics getting infected. It is an occupational risk but we are providing PPEs, sanitisers and ensuring containment measures are in place."
