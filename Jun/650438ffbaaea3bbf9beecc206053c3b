Parliament has passed road toll law paving the way for construction of the Nairobi expressway and Limuru–Mau Summit road. The new law was part of the proposals in the Finance Bill, 2020, which is now before President Uhuru Kenyatta for assent. National Assembly Transport Committee chairman David Pkosing said the new law was long overdue. Speaking at his KICC office, the Pokot South lawmaker added that the government will now be at liberty to enter into a public-private partnership to help improve the country’s road network. “After successful delivery of the toll law amendments,  my focus is now aimed at delivering the President's intention to restructure the entire aviation sector to make Nairobi a regional hub, creating more jobs for Kenyans and to grow our economy,” Pkosing said. “I aim to deliver for the President at the earliest time possible, latest end of August. My committee has been on record as a serious performer, and I have no doubt in my mind we will deliver this for the President within the given timelines.” He noted the country is currently losing about Sh50 million a day because of the traffic jams. “If you calculate, someone spends about 40 minutes to fly from Eldoret to Nairobi but ends up spending more than three hours to move from the airport to Nairobi’s CBD,” he said. “Now an investor can build a road and be allowed to toll to recoup their investment. After they recoup their money the toll returns to the public,” he explained. On the Nairobi expressway, motorists will pay Sh300 to avoid the busy Uhuru highway from Mlolongo to Westlands. The project, to be implemented by Kenha, will be a four-lane dual carriageway. It connects the Nairobi-Mombasa and the Nairobi-Malaba sections. The expressway will have 10 interchanges, including the SGR terminus at JKIA, Eastern Bypass, Southern Bypass and Enterprise Road. There is also a similar plan for  Limuru to Mau Summit so as to help decongest roads from Nairobi to Western. Edited by Henry Makori
