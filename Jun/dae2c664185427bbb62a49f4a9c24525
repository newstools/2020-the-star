Elite Sports Africa Basketball Academy has donated foodstuffs to over 60 young basketballers from Umoja Estate and its environs. Martin Okwako, the Academy founder, said the donations will ensure the families get good meal for at least a week during this difficult time of coronavirus pandemic. He said the initiative, aimed at ensuring the well-being of players, is also supported by Australia-based national team star Desmond Owili as well as his teammates. “This is a development program that nurtures young upcoming talents, both boys and girls U-12, as well as the youth. We also focus on the well being of our athletes,” said Okwako, a former Co-op Bank guard. Morans coach Cliff Owuor as well as national women’s team players Silalei Shani, Melissa Akinyi and Annerose Mandela also graced the occasion. Meanwhile, Okwako revealed they have a similar program in Kigali, Rwanda headed by their national U-18 team assistant coach Patrick Habiyaremye. “We try to connect kids to scholarship opportunities both locally and abroad and we have three kids studying in the US with multiple benefiting from local high school scholarship,” added Okwako.
