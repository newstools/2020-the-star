Shalom Hospital has not been closed, but has been placed under quarantine, Ministry of Health has said. But, the 125 inpatients have been placed under quarantine and are being monitored closely. This comes after four Covid-19 patients were announced dead on different dates after being referred to Kenyatta National Hospital. The Health Ministry has stated that medical personnel are working on shift basis with the proper protective gear to ensure that the patients are well taken care of. "However, the hospital shall not admit anymore patients until it is proven there is no more cross infection," the ministry said. Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua in a press statement said the county government held consultations with the Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Council and the Director General of Health and decided to seal off the hospital following the deaths. Mutua said other inpatients have also tested positive for coronavirus and it is feared the patients contracted the virus while in hospital. The Health ministry on Saturday expressed concern over rising cases of Covid-19 caused by cross infections within health facilities. The alarm came after four people died from the disease at the Shalom Hospital in Athi River, Machakos county. Three more patients tested positive alongside a hospital worker. Speaking during the daily Covid-19 briefing at Afya House, Health Chief Administrative Secretary Mercy Mwangangi said all county governments must ensure they have dedicated healthcare facilities to handle coronavirus cases. “This is a matter the ministry is taking seriously, and I want to appeal to all hospitals, public or private, to be extremely careful, and put in place measures that reduce the slightest possibility of cross infection,” Mwangangi said.
