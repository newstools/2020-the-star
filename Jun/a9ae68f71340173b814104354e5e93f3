Nigerian producer Young D and Grammy winner Miri Ben-Ari, better known as AfroStringz, have launched their first single, 'She don’t know'. It is about the girl next door and a boy who secretly developed a crush on her but didn't know about his special feelings for her. The video captures moments of secret love between five people who hang out in a studio. Speaking about the song, Afrostringz said they are the first artiste group to combine African music and violin as a "sound". "It is a powerful multicultural experience, whether in the studio or live performance, that has no limits. This is the power of music," he said. "AfroStringz represents a philosophy: mixing the rhythm of Africa with the sound of Stringz to create harmony through music and bridge between communities.”
