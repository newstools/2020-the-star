The Covid-19 outbreak at the Industrial Area prison is already contained, authorities have said. Prisons Department head of communication Kevin Aluda dismissed media reports that indicated a breakdown in contact tracing at the facility after 31 positive cases were recorded last weekend. The reports claim there was a plan for mass testing. The reports had indicated that the head of the institution was on panic mode after Health CAS Rashid Aman announced on Wednesday that the cases had risen to 42. But Aluda told the Star on Thursday that while it was true the institution had recorded 31 positive cases out of a sample of 59, none of them had made any contact with the inmates in the fortified blocks or with the staff members. He said that the 59 were from court and were set to be booked into the facilities but as a precaution, they were quarantined for 21 days and later tested. “The 31 positive cases were immediately evacuated to Kenyatta University Hospital for case management while the remaining 28 were taken for further quarantine just to be sure,” Aluda said. He said there was a slight mix-up in the numbers announced by Aman, saying that the 42 cases announced were inclusive of the 31 announced over the weekend. The 11, he explained, were from Makadara probation office and Industrial Area police station whose samples were taken on May 29. “Out of the 11, seven were from Industrial Area and four from Makadara probation. They had requested that we help them in testing because we have the equipment capabilities,” Aluda said. "So it is not true that all the 11 cases emerged from our inmates," he said. He added that the Industrial Area OCDP had submitted eight samples but seven tested positive while the Makadara probation office submitted five samples and four turned positive.  Edited by R.Wamochie
