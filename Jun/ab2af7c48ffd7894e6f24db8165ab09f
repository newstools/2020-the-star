A bill seeking state officers’ suspension after being charged with corruption might be misused through political witch-hunts if caution is not taken, a former senator has said. Former Embu Senator Lenny Kivuti on Sunday said he supports the bill introduced in Parliament by Majority leader Aden Duale last Tuesday. The bill proposes that appointed or elected leaders charged with corruption be suspended at half pay after being charged until the determination of the criminal case. Kivuti aspires to run for Embu gubernatorial seat after narrowly losing to Governor Martin Wambora in 2017. He said if approved, it will significantly help in the fight against runaway corruption, adding that graft cannot be wiped out by presidential declarations. Kivuti said the anti-corruption fight cannot  succeed through arrest of high-ranking leaders. The county requires clear legislation on the matter, he said. He, however, said when introducing the amendments which also seek to have the case against an accused leader be heard within two years, the government should consider that there could be witch-hunt by rivals who can fabricate allegations. “To prevent witch-hunts against elected and appointed leaders from people with ill motives, the law should provide that allegations against any leader are fully substantiated with watertight evidence,” Kivuti said. The bill is seeking amendments to Section 62 (6) of the Anti-Corruption and Economic Crimes Act, 2003 and was tabled after a rigorous campaign by anti-graft agencies led by Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji. If the proposed changes are approved, governors charged with corruption would be suspended at half pay with effect from the date of the charge until the conclusion of the case. This would also apply to the Deputy President. Edited by R.Wamochie
