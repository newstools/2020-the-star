Mustangs’ coach Humphrey Mugendi will challenge the Kenya Basketball Federation (KBF) incumbent Paul Otula for the chairman’s seat during this year’s polls. The KBF elections were earlier scheduled for April 25 but were put off due to the coronavirus pandemic. The tactician said he doesn't have any line up and will be going it alone when the new date is set. Mugendi said he hopes to give federation a fresh start with his pillars that include accountability and inclusivity. “I will bring changes in terms of accountability but I am also aware that the changes will not be achieved without including all the stakeholders,” he noted. He said stakeholders are important when it comes to decision-making and he will also strive to improve the conditions of the referees. “Fixtures are the other element that needs a lot of sobriety,” he noted. Mugendi said he will involve a committee to review the contracts, partnerships, agreements and make informed decisions. “I want basketball stakeholders to feel part of the game for the first time. I want us to forget the past and start a fresh,” he observed. He said there is also need for the team managers and other stakeholders to work hand in hand with the federation. Mugendi has also coached Daystar university, Nairobi Aviation College and KCA University. KBF secretary, Vitalis Gode has made it clear that he will not be seeking re-election and his assistant Ambrose Kisoi expected to replace him. Equity Bank player Shem Otieno has also declared his candidature for the vice chairman’s position.
