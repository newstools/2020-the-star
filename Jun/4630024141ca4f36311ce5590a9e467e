A fraud suspect was on Friday afternoon arrested by DCI detectives at the Milimani Law Courts. The suspect identified as Mercy Waihiga Wanjiku alias Linda was accused of obtaining money by false pretenses from unsuspecting Kenyans. She allegedly obtained Sh1.7 million worth of anti-lock jam pins from one of her victims. "The victim went ahead to purchase the items and delivered them to a parastatal vehicle near Agip House as directed. He was to proceed to Jogoo House procurement section for payments but the suspect had switched off her phone immediately after the delivery," the directorate said in a Twitter post. The suspect was reportedly nabbed when she was arraigned in court answering to other offenses. Wanjiku is allegedly also a suspect linked to issuance of fake tenders at Afya House. The DCI said investigations are still ongoing to nab her accomplices.
