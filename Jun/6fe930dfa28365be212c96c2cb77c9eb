The High Court has suspended the wind-up of the Strategic Food Reserve Trust Fund, which currently holds Sh10 billion in its accounts. Justice Weldon Korir issued the order after activist Okiya Omtatah argued that the Sh10 billion will be misappropriated if an April 14 legal notice issued by Treasury CS Ukur Yatani was not suspended. Omtatah suspected that the decision was meant to allow Yatani, Agriculture CS Peter Munya, AG Kihara Kariuki and the National Cereals Produce Board unhindered access to the cash. “With the Fund’s Oversight Board in place, Ukur, Munya and the NCPB cannot spend even a cent of the money without the authorisation of the board,” the activist said. He cited improper motives and corrupt practices of cartels in the sector to use the imminent importation of maize to profiteer. “It is is a fact in the public domain that when the NCPB and maize cartels wanted to push for maize importation, the fund opposed it to protect local farmers,” he added. Omtatah argued that the Legal Notice No. 61 of April 2020 was unfair and unconstitutional. He faulted the Treasury CS for purporting to wind up the fund without the approval of the National Assembly. “There is absolutely no public interest to be served by abolishing the fund, which is well managed and was executing its mandate perfectly,” he said. He added that the legal notice has no transition mechanisms to secure the fund's assets and resources. “There is no other public body which can discharge the functions of the Fund. Not even the NCPB can discharge the functions of the Fund,” he said. (edited by o. owino)
