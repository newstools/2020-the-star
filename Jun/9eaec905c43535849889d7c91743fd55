They say you've got to start children off early to ensure they have a bright future. It has also been said that if you give someone a fish, you will make them forever dependent on you, but if you teach them how to fish, they can become independent. And that is exactly what Treasury CS Ukur Yatani did on Thursday as he took hisÂ  two sons and nephew along with him to Parliament Building, where he read out his maiden Budget speech. Suited up, the sons were seen outside engaging in pleasantries with MPs after the Budget had been read with their father, Yatani, beside them. His two sons - Ali and Ibrae Yatani - spotted a mohawk, while their cousin - Sales Doko - went for a clean shave. Yatani, while reading the Budget, acknowledged the tough balancing act of ensuring all sectors were covered while dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic. Only 53 MPs were allowed within the precincts of Parliament following social distancing rules.
