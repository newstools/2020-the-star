Sauti Sol member Chimano says he got armpit botox (a cosmetic surgery) to prevent him from sweating a lot. "I’ve had botox done on my armpits to prevent sweating if you want to wear certain clothes," he said at their studio in Lavington. "You don’t want to be at an interview and people are seeing a sweat patch. At some point, it was embarrassing. You might think it's a normal bodily function but people don’t understand. "I just did it once. I am scared of doing it over and over, but you never know." He says he is happy with how it looks and it's something people should not do out of pressure from other people. "It's for you, do whatever you want," he said.
