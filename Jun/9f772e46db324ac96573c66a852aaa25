ODM party leader Raila Odinga should not make his Capitol Hill office a centre of corruption, Kirinyaga Woman Representative Wangui Ngirici has said. Speaking on Friday, Ngirici claimed that politicians with questionable records were being sanitised at Raila's office. "That everybody who misappropriates public funds is being sanitised at Capitol Hill... That Capitol Hill of corruption will one day be closed down," she said. "If Raila is just and fought for our democracy, do not agree to be used to spoil what Kenyans have fought hard for. We are taxpaying Kenyans and we want justice." Ngirici, without naming names, seemed to be talking about Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru. Waiguru was impeached early in the week by MCAs for gross misconduct and misappropriation of funds. Waiguru dismissed the claims. This verbal attack comes barely days after Raila met with Laikipia Woman Representative Catherine Waruguru for private talks at his Capitol Hill office. Waruguru has been a fierce supporter of Ruto, who went round bashing the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) championed by Raila and President Uhuru Kenyatta. Her surprise appearance at Capitol Hill in company of National Assembly Minority Whip Junet Mohamed set tongues wagging. Immediately she left Capitol Hill, the MP began to preach about the benefits of uniting the country.
