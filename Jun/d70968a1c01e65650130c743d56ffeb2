Media personality Grace Msalame has announced that she is expecting her third child. Taking to social media, Msalame shared a photo of herself holding her growing baby bump. "Six months later... Now quite visible all over my face & obvious belly so hello 👶🏽 Soon to be Mum of 3💖💖💙 Blooming in @bloom_kenya," she captioned the photo. However, she has not disclosed who the father of her child is. Grace has always been a secretive person and only shares what she feels the public would like to see but not what they want to see. She has two girls (twins) from her previous relationship and in the next three months, the girls will have a sibling. In 2018, she shared a photo that raised so many questions from her followers as we ushered the new year. She shared a photo of her hand placed on another hand and she had a ring on the fourth finger. Could she be engaged? A question asked by many. "Here’s hoping you ushered in the new year with those you Love Happy & Blessed 2018 to you all #LoveFeelslikeHome," she wrote.
