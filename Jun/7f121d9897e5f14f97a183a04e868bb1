Bomet county has said it will kill all stray dogs in Bomet town as part of measures to address cases of residents being mauled at night by strange creatures. Governor Hillary Barchok said he has instructed his officers from the veterinary department to start the exercise immediately to get rid of the wandering canines in the town. Barchok said while they are yet to fully establish what could have attacked a 78-year-old man on Tuesday night leaving him with serious injuries, physical examination by doctors showed he was clawed by an unknown creature before being mauled. His eyes were gouged out, ear chopped off and part of the knee mauled. Noting they cannot rule out superstitions of ‘killer cult’ as has been hypothesised by the residents, he was concerned by the increased number of dogs in the town which he said must first be killed. “We want to start by eradicating all these dogs within our town as we address the issue…we are working closely with the security officers on the issue and seeking to identify what the creatures could be,” Barchok said. He further stated that floodlights will be installed at major points within the town and residential houses to supplement the existing street lights. The county chief pointed out that his administration will also in the next financial budget install CCTV cameras. He was addressing the press at his office in Bomet on Wednesday when he received a donation of personal protective equipment from the national government worth Sh8 million. The governor, who was with county commissioner Geoffrey Omoding, disclosed that he had visited the patient at Tenwek Mission Hospital. The patient, he said, was out of danger and was set for another operation on Thursday.  Edited by R.Wamochie
