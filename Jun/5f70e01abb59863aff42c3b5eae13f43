Amani National Congress (ANC) party has condemned the arson attack on its Kakamega branch office on Monday. The office was set on fire by unknown individuals targeting a section where branch party documents were being kept. The party said there is no cause for alarm over the loss of information even as the team continues to asseess the damage caused by the fire. "In the past, the party and its national leadership have come under spirited verbal assault by our detractors, political competitors and their agents both from within and without," a statement by ANC secretary general Barrack Mwuluka said. The secretary general said that the party will resist emerging efforts to kill multiparty democracy through 'intimidation and scaremongering'. Also, the party has called upon the police to investigate and apprehend the people behind the attack. "Such banditry must be discouraged, for it is going to unnecessarily heighten political temperatures in Western Kenya."
