The government is monitoring Kibera closely and a section could be put on lockdown if Covid-19 cases continue to rise. "It is on the table and the government will announce if it feels it necessary to do so... We are looking at where the cluster might be," he said on Tuesday. Kibera has become an epicentre for Covid-19. Kenya on Tuesday recorded 72 new cases of Covid-19, raising the country's total number to 2,093. The cases are from 2,892 samples tested in the last 24 hours. A total of 39 are from Nairobi, while 13 are from Busia. The youngest is 11 years and oldest is 73. Another 17 patients have been discharged, raising the recoveries to 499. On a sad note, another two people have died, raising the deaths to 71. Aman hit out at truck drivers not following guidelines. "If you do this you will create congestion and create problems for yourselves," he said. Meanwhile, the government has said it is contemplating alternative ways to find 140 Covid-19 patients who cannot be traced. Aman said efforts to find them have borne no fruit, despite numerous calls for them to present themselves. He said tracing the cases using ID numbers is among the alternatives being explored. "We have been trying to trace them but we are yet to make progress. We are therefore going to use alternative means including use of IDs and alternative contacts,” Aman said. Public Health Director Dr Patrick Amoth last week said the 140 were among those who turned up for the voluntary mass testing. According to Amoth, they gave the wrong contact information and when their samples turned positive, they couldn’t be found.“As the CS said, they can run but cannot hide from the long arm of the government. They can choose to present themselves before the disease puts them down,” he said.
