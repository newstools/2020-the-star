Kenya is no doubt the world’s athletics superpower, thanks to its huge talent. And National Police Service stands out as the goose that lays the golden athletics egg for Kenya. These athletics stars headline the police department in rank and file. They boast of a sizeable number of senior officers, popularly known as gazetted officers –who are of or above the rank of Superintendent of Police (SP). At the moment, there are at least four former track stars holding the rank of Commissioner of Police (CP), the fifth-highest rank in National Police Service. Former superstars in Marius Tum (400m), Tabitha Ranga (1500m), William Yampoyi (800m) and Karisa Mwaringa (100m) hold the rank of Commissioner of Police.

Kilisio is attached to Presidential Escort while Kirui is an Administration Police officer based in Mombasa. Kirui said Kenya Police is the best employer especially for athletes. He attributed his achievements to the National Police Service. “Working with police is a motivation as it is the only employer who recognizes athletes,” said Kirui. He urged budding athletes to aspire to join police service, saying the system works perfectly. “Promotion is almost guaranteed if you do your work well. For us athletes, you only need to continue flying the country’s flag high across the world and you are good,” he added. “Just like a good father buys a prize for the child who has performed well in class, the promotion is a way of appreciating for what we do for the country—raising the national flag in foreign countries,” added the former Chicago marathon winner. Kirui was promoted from the rank of Police Constable to Sergeant after winning gold at the 2009 World Athletics Championships in Berlin, Germany. In 2011, he defended his title and landed on a promotion to Inspector of Police (IP). His passion and love for the disciplined forces do not go unnoticed as he salutes his bosses after winning big city marathons.
