Former Football Kenya Federation President Sam Nyamweya has once again stated his commitment to renew the Kenyan Premier League contract should he reclaim the top seat in the forthcoming polls. The existing contract between the two bodies is set to expire in September this year but the current regime has been on record insisting that the contract will not be extended once it elapses. However, Nyamweya, who is seeking to make his way back to Kandanda House says he keen to hand the financially-limping body fresh a mandate. "When I become the President of FKF, I will, as a matter of priority, extend the contract of KPL and even go further and allow other leagues to run semi-autonomously," he said in a statement In the meantime, Nyamweya called on Nick Mwendwa to respect the contract between the two bodies. The animosity between the two was rekindled in April after FKF concluded the 2019-2020 season without the blessings of KPL, who are set to convene a governing council meeting next week to discuss the fate of the season. "I fully support KPL's decision to convene a Governing Council and with guidance of the Government of Kenya and FIFA on COVID-19 pandemic, restart the KPL and take it to its logical conclusion," said Nyamweya. "FKF as currently constituted does not have a National Executive Committee and consequently cannot constitute membership to the Joint Executive Committee which is the only organ mandated to review and or terminate the contract between FKF and KPL," he claimed.
