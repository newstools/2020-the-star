Homa Bay fishermen have commended Treasury Cabinet Secretary Ukur Yatani for allocating funds to crucial development projects in the county. They said their businesses would improve once the planned construction and improvement roads are complete. Yatani allocated Sh2.8 billion to construct the 81km Mbita-Magunga-Sori Road. Another Sh28 million was allocated to improve the Rusinga Island Ring Road. The fishermen said they have been counting losses due to the poor state of the roads. Speaking to journalists on Thursday, the county Beach Management Units chairman Edward Oremo said fishermen operating in Suba North and Suba South constituencies take a lot of time on the road to reach markets. “The poor state of roads has deprived many fishermen a lot of benefits, including accessing markets for their catch. With improvement of the roads, we hope to maximise on profits,” Oremo said. The fishermen also thanked President Uhuru Kenyatta for honouring the pledge he made in 2017 to improve the Rusinga Ring Road. On July 12, 2017 President Kenyatta visited the area and said the government would construct the Rusinga Ring Road to facilitate movement of fish from the beaches around the Island to the mainland. “The traders expect a promising future on fish business because of eased transport. Completion of the roads would make many people to realise their dream in fishing industry,” Oremo said. The government also allocated more than Sh600 million to improve selected fish landing beaches along Lake Victoria. Homa Bay has more than 134 active operating beaches and has more than 60 per cent of the lake water cover in Kenya. Irene Obote,  a fish trader at Nyandiwa, said the shortage of cold storage facilities and poor roads were to blame for the losses they suffer. “Many fish traders do not have refrigerators where we can store fish. We find ourselves sell rotten fish due to delayed transport and lack of preservatives,” Obote said. Edited by EKibii
