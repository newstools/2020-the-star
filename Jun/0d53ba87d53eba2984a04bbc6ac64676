The economic hardships caused by the coronavirus pandemic have forced sex workers in Vihiga to offer their services during the day to beat curfew restrictions. They contact their clients on the phone. County acting chief officer for medical services Richard Boiyo told the Star shifting sex work to daytime would make it harder to combat coronavirus that has already hit the county. “The virus has now been reported in the county. Night activities have shifted to daytime. Although they must go on with life, we are appealing to them to minimise body contact to stop further spread of the virus,” Boiyo said. Sex workers have demanded they be provided with sanitisers within their operating areas as they conduct their activities. They said shifting their activities to daytime and using phones to contact clients is meant to avoid being on the wrong side of the law. “We have got families to take care of. We have rents to settle, we need food as well," one of the sex workers said on condition of anonymity. "So, we will continue coming here unless the government is going to facilitate us on rent, food and some upkeep.” She said the government was advising them to stay at home, sanitise and wear masks yet they have no money for basic needs.
