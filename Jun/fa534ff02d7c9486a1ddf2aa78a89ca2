Health CS Mutahi Kagwe has explained why truck drivers are encountering congestion and delays at border points. Speaking during his daily briefs on Thursday, Kagwe said a majority of truck drivers are commencing their journey to the borders without Covid-19 documents expecting to be tested at the border point. "This has resulted to unnecessary congestion and delays that have been witnessed at our border points. This is pure indiscipline and will not be accepted and tolerated," he said. Kagwe expressed his concerns about how truck drivers are commencing their journey to the borders without these  documents. "A large number of truck drivers are testing positive. Let me make it clear that all drivers take a Covid-19 test at least 48 hours before embarking on their journey and acquire a Covid-19 free certificate," Kagwe said. He went on to urge law enforcement officers to take appropriate actions against each and every driver flaunting these such measures. Kenya on Thursday recorded 124 Covid-19 new  cases, bringing the total to 2,340, Health CS Mutahi Kagwe said. A total of 87,698 tests have been done to date. Mombasa has the highest numbers at 40, Nairobi at 38 and Busia at 26.
