The Referendum Bill, 2020 was on Tuesday taken through the first reading at the National Assembly. The Bill, by Ndaragwa MP Jeremiah Kioni, sets in motion the enactment of a law to guide a referendum process. It was prioritised during Tuesday's business. The referendum is touted as the reason President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga have been whipping their troops in Parliament. Jubilee cracked the whip on its rebels in anticipation of the BBI changes that could reform the executive structure. Currently, there is no legal or constitutional provision for conducting a referendum, a situation that scuttled Thirdway Alliance Party of Kenya leader Ekuru Aukot's Punguza Mizigo initiative. Kioni wants the referendum conducted alongside the General Election. Kioni says the referendum results should be declared within 48 hours of the closure of the final polling station
