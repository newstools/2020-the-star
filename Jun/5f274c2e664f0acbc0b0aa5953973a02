Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya has urged Luhyas to support Jubilee and ODM if they want to be in government after the 2022 polls. "If I walk out of ODM, I will join Jubilee because those are the only parties that will form the next government in 2022," he said. He said Luhyas are tired of being in the opposition. “Enough is enough! Even our neighbouring brothers, who have been there since 1966, are now inside the government," Oparanya said on Sunday. "They are benefiting at the moment and Kisumu has a new look.” The county chief spoke at Ebunangwe resort when he met elders from Vihiga county. Oparanya said the region is still lagging behind in development and most of the youth are jobless. "It's either we align ourselves with those parties that will form the next government, or we will continue camping out in the cold as others enjoy the warmth of the house."  Edited by A.N
