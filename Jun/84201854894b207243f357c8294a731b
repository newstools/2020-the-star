Tanasha Donna says she has been raising her son, Naseeb Junior, alone as Diamond has not been providing anything since their break-up early this year. Speaking to comedian Jalang’o, Tanasha said she has been doing it all by herself. “What do you mean supporting financially? I have been doing it all on my own, to be honest,” Tanasha responded, when asked if Diamond has been providing any financial support. “I will be 100 per cent honest with you. I am very real and I am not going to say something that is not the case. With all the respect I have for him and I don’t have any bad blood with him. No, he is not supporting (me), and I am doing it on my own,” she said. She explained that she isn’t complaining about it since she is doing just fine, raising her eight-month-old son. “I don’t need his support. There is nothing that boy lacks in his life. He is fine, that’s what matters,” she said. Diamond's other baby Mamas Zari Hassan and Hamisa have also complained about him not taking care of his children. Hamisa once sued him for the upkeep of their son Dylan in 2017.
