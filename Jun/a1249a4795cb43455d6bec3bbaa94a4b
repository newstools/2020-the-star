Supporters on Monday protested the arrest of Starehe MP Charles Njagua, popularly known as Jaguar, over alleged incitement. The protesters, mostly youth, camped outside the Nairobi Area police station where Jaguar was being held demanding the legislator's release. Jaguar's arrest was announced by Nairobi police boss Philip Ndolo who told Milele FM that the MP was arrested for transporting youth to a Grogon building to forcefully take ownership of shops. "I'm currently at Nairobi Area. The charges against me are unclear though they seem connected to Mwariro Market," the MP  wrote on Twitter on Monday. " I'll keep fighting for my constituents. Being a leader is tough but my resolve remains unshaken. Allocations at Mwariro Market have to be fair." Protesters claimed the arrest was unjustified and the MP was being bullied. In a video by the Star, one supporter was seen being beaten by police officers before being arrested.
