Kisii senator Sam Ongeri has finally been elected as Chairman of the Senate County Public Accounts and Investment committee . Senator Hargura Godana (Marsabit) has been elected as vice chairman in the elections held on Thursday morning. The chairperson seat has been emotive. A month ago, Nark senator Ledama Olekina was ejected from the seat by his party ODM. The party, through minority leader James Orengo, had accused him of defying the position to elect Ongeri as the chair. Ledama moved to court to stop his ouster but later withdrew the case after mending fences with ODM boss Raila Odinga. Ledama is now an ordinary member of the 9-member panel. Others are Fatima Dullo (Isiolo), Ochilo Ayacho (Migori), Johannes Mwaruma (Taita Taveta), Charles Kibiru (Kirinyaga) and Irungu Kangata (Murang'a).
