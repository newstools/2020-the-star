A pastor who has been on the run in Mwingi after he allegedly defiled 20 minors has been arrested. Mwingi Central subcounty police commander Peter Mutuma said Joshua Kimanzi Munuve was allegedly holding the 20 girls in his church in the name of praying for them. Last year in November, Munuve was exposed after some parents who worshipped at the church raised alarm that he had turned their schoolgirls into sex slaves. Parents from Kwa Mbungu village, where his church is located, demanded the return of their daughter who had scored 304 marks in last yearâ€™s KCPE. The outrage exposed that Munuve was holding hostage more than 20 other minors in his church compound and around Mwingi town where he had rented several houses for other minors. A resident said last November that the pastor had allegedly impregnated his niece adding the case went unresolved after being reported to Mwingi police station. When police were notified and pursued the pastor, he fled with the minor who never reported to Form 1. The other minors were rescued and released to their family members. Seven months later, the pastor was found hiding the same girl at Katalwa market, a few kilometres from Mwingi town, leading to his arrest. Confirming the incident, Mutuma said the pastor is in police custody and the minor has been rescued. Edited by R.Wamochie
