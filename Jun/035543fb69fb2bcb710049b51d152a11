The Ford Kenya wrangles have escalated to Bungoma county assembly after MCAs allied to coup plotters were removed from their plum positions on Tuesday. MCAs supporting embattled ex-leader and Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang'ula took all the assembly leadership seats. They blamed those removed for supporting Governor Wycliffe Wangamati who was part of the coup. In the coup, Wetang'ula was replaced as party leader by Kanduyi MP Wafula Wamunyinyi. In the assembly, Majority leader Florence Wekesa and Majority chief whip Everlyne Mutyembu were replaced by Joseph Nyongesa and Mukuyuni MCA Meshack Simiyu respectively. Tongeren MCA Elizabeth Tindi is the new deputy Majority leader while Joseph Maguda (Township) is the deputy chief whip. The MCAs also said they were going to make changes in committees to ensure proper oversight. Speaking after assuming the office, Nyongesa said he was going to ensure they carry out their oversight role well. He asked Wangamati to accept that he was now the Majority leader and work with him. “I have no problem with him despite his fear of me. Let him accept and we can work together,” Nyongesa said. The changes were communicated by speaker Emmanuel Situma. However, party secretary general Eseli Simiyu said the changes are illegal as there was no consultation. Eseli said that there was no gazette notice giving MCAs a go-ahead to make any changes in the assembly dominated by Ford Kenya leaders. (edited by o. owino)
