The Kenya Wildlife Service has refuted claims that a road is being constructed inside the Nairobi National Park. The Service in a statement said the reports circulating in social media were misleading. Through its Corporate Communications Department, the Service said contrary what is being reported, a contractor had embarked on improving the road joining the KWS headquarters to its Central Workshop inside the park. It had widely been shared on social media that there was an expressway being constructed in the park. "KWS has recently noted reports appearing in social media platforms insinuating that there is a new express way road being built next to the SGR passing through Nairobi National Park. This is not true, and a total misrepresentation of the facts," read a statement in part. It further read, "The correct position is that a local contractor engaged by KWS is improving the road joining KWS Headquarters to Central Workshop inside the Park". According to the service, the contractor is currentlyÂ  scooping murram from a quarry near the Standard Gauge Railway for use on the existing murram road. "The contractor will rehabilitate the quarry pit after completing the works on the road in accordance with an Environmental Management Plan approved and availed to him by KWS Management," the statement read.
