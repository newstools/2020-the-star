Singer Serro has released her debut album, 'Kuwe', a Zulu word translating to 'For You'. In the 14-track album, Serro not only displays her vocal growth but also vulnerability by sharing her journey through music and life. It is written in blends of six languages: Luo, Kikuyu, Giriama, Swahili, Zulu, and English. Kuwe holds ballads, serenades, songs of thanks and the misgivings of love and life. After the release, Serro says this would be a good playlist to ponder on, now that we have more time to connect with ourselves and others during the lockdown. 'Kuwe' was co-composed and produced by Mutoriah, who says Serro's open-mindedness makes her easy to work with. "Her talent and musical ear also make the process exciting. Our souls are on the same frequency, I love it!‚Äù he said. 'Kuwe' comes four years after her first single 'Rongai' in 2016.
