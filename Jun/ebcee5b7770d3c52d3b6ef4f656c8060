Plans by the Kenyan Premier League to complete the 2019-2020 season have been dealt yet another blow after the government extended the suspension of public gatherings for another month. President Uhuru Kenyatta, in a State of the Nation address, said he made the decision on advice from medical experts. KPL, who are pursuing to overturn Football Kenya Federation’s decision to end the league without their blessings and have the remaining nine rounds played, are set to convene a Governing Council Meeting next week to deliberate on the possibility of the competition resuming. However, with the new directives, KPL’s ambitions appear to have been narrowed once again since the Sports Disputes Tribunal is yet to deliver a ruling on the matter. Meanwhile, FKF President Nick Mwendwa says local clubs do not have the capacity to meet the health guidelines issued by Fifa. In an interview with Radio Jambo Mwendwa, who is battling to retain his seat for another term, regretted the financial state of clubs and said in the event that the government clears the return of sporting activities, clubs will not be able to honour matches. He said it was just a matter of time before he was vindicated of his decision to conclude the season.
