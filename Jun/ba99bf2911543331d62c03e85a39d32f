Ohangla musician Bernard Obonyo's, popularly known as Abenny Jachiga's has been laid to rest. Jachiga was buried by policemen secretly at 2:30am. Only his brother witnessed the burial. "We were inside the house and only heard sounds and when we opened the door, we saw that he was being buried as the officers were on standby," said one of the relatives in a live recorded video on Facebook. This was to ensure that the rowdy crowd that disrupted the burial process on Friday did not do so today. Emotions ran high during preparations for Jachiga's, burial on Friday at Kadiju village in Chiga within Kisumu county. At his home, a grave that had already been dug where he was set to be laid to rest was refilled by angry mourners who buried a wheelbarrow and tree branches claiming they were not ready to allow the musician to be hurriedly laid to rest. The standoff ensued while the deceased was still en-route to his village in a convoy from town. Earlier, police had a hard time controlling the crowd which defied social distance directives with most not wearing their face masks as they escorted the deceased from the Port Florence mortuary.
