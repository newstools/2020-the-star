Suna East MP Junet Mohammed has vowed to be more loyal to ODM Party leader Raila Odinga to avoid being ousted like Garissa MP Aden Duale. Junet was speaking in parliament on Tuesday after Duale read his exit speech as the majority leader in parliament. Duale who has served in the position for seven years was replaced by Kipipiri MP Amos Kimunya. "As for Duale,when you see us following Baba like cows, it is because we fear the consequences like what you are facing today," he said. "So politics is like that mkubwa. If you go against the wishes of people who own parties and lead this country,..these are the consequences." Junet said whatever happened to Duale is a learning experience for him. "... it is a good experience for me. Now I will be more loyal than I am now. I will sing baba throughout," he said. He welcomed Kimunya saying that he should not repeat his words on death. Kimunya once said that he would rather die than resign as Finance minister. This was after he found himself entangled in yet another scandal, this time regarding the sale of the Grand Regency Hotel to a Libyan firm. "This work of politics is very difficult and when the going gets tough don't die. Remain strong, don't say you'd rather die than resign .Please don't die, we shall support you..dying is the worse thing that can happen..," Junet said. "I want to tell Kimunya that we will work with you and I know you are equal to the task." Speaking at the National Assembly, Kimunya encouraged Duale to look at the changes positively. "...as we all go through such changes, and this is a chance to reflect and understand that it all happens for the greater good," he said. "I know and understand that such duties come with a lot of commitment and sacrifice. Duale did his best to deliver, and I have learned a lot from him." Kimunya said he has worked with Duale and seen how good he can be in his job. "... and I commend him for the good job done on behalf of the party and Kenyans," he added.
