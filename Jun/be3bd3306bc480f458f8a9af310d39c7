Seven Tanzanian sailors are quarantined in Kilifi after they were rescued from their capsized boat in the Indian Ocean. The men were rescued on Wednesday last week by fishermen from the Mtwapa Beach Management Unit. The vessel, Haina Hollo, had departed Tanga for Pemba on June 2. It carried 700 eucalyptus logs. It was overpowered by strong winds of more than 20 knots before it lost engine power. The vessel was pushed by wind and waves onto a reef where it capsized. “It was shipwrecked and drifted into Kenyan waters on June 3,” the Kenyan Maritime Authority said. “After they were rescued, the men were weak and exhausted. The Mtwapa BMU assisted them before they were transferred to Kilifi for quarantine.” The Kenya Coast Guard, the Maritime Authority and Kilifi county government assisted the crew at Mtwapa. The vessel is still on the reef and the owner is making arrangements for towing and salvage. KMA has notified the Tanzanian Maritime Authority as well as the Tanzanian Consulate in Mombasa, which contacted the vessel owner. Winds in the Indian Ocean are strong between May and August. KMA has issued its latest advisory on June 3 urging all mariners to be extra vigilant. The authority recently conducted maritime safety campaigns in Kilifi, Mombasa, Homa Bay and Siaya counties.
