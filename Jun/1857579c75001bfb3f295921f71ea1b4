Kenya is placed third in Africa in the 3-on-3 basketball, according to the latest rankings released by International Basketball Federation (FIBA). Egypt top the list with 242 points while Mali are second on 155 points followed by Kenya on 122 points. Nigeria, Uganda, Togo, Senegal, Madagascar, DR Congo, and Nigeria complete the top ten nations in Africa. An elated Kenya Basketball Federation (KBF) first vice chairman, Hilmi Ali said the improvement was a result of hard work. “What makes me happy is that the work we have done in the past one year is now paying dividends,” said Ali. He said the country was able to climb up the ranking because they have organised 13 events locally and this meant more points. “Besides taking part in the All Africa Games last year, we also organised many local events that earned us points and pushed us up the ladder,” he added. Strathmore University’s Martin Buluma and Christine Akinyi of Zetech University are the top two ranked players in the country. On the league front, Ali warned teams that have not delivered their registration forms and photos that that they risk being locked out of the show. He said only five out of the 60 teams have their playing cards ready for the season. “I asked all teams to submit the requirements over a month ago and so far, only five team have complied,” he said.
