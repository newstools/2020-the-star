The Nairobi Metropolitan Service is now under the Office of the President following an Executive order. The President effected the restructuring by amending the Executive Order No. 1 of 2020 issued in January this year. The Presidency title was also changed to the Executive Office of the President. “In exercise of the powers conferred by Article 132 (3) (b) of the Constitution, as read with all other enabling laws, I, Uhuru Kenyatta, President and Commander-In-Chief of the Kenya Defence Forces, order and direct that the government shall be organised as set out in this order,” the order reads. The order assigns functions and institutions among ministries and state departments, and supersedes Executive Order No. 1 of 2018 (Revised) issued in July 2018. It contains portfolio responsibilities and changes made in the structure of government. It specifies functions of the constitutional commissions, independent offices, the Judiciary and Parliament. Among the functions of the Executive Office of the President are overall policy direction and leadership, a role that will be played by the Cabinet. The new order implies that the  implementation of the four functions of Nairobi county transferred to the national government will now be under the direct supervision of President. Uhuru stated his office, will be directly in charge of the implementation of the deed of transfer of the four functions transferred to the national government. Last month, Treasury CS Ukur Yattani proposed a Sh27.9 billion allocation to NMS; Sh9.32 billion for development and Sh18.6 billion for recurrent expenditure. NMS boss Mohammed Badi had raised concerns that service delivery in Nairobi may fall due lack of funds to carry out his mandate. He noted that the tussle over the approval of the budget between the county assembly and the county government of Nairobi had delayed the access of funds.
