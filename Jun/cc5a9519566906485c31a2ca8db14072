Nyamira Senator Okong’o Omogeni has urged residents to desist from thinking common cold and the coronavirus are similar. Omogeni on Monday said those with the cold should not be victimised. Those who develop signs of the coronavirus will be isolated and tested then discharged if negative, he said. “I am urging you not to associate common cold with the coronavirus. The symptoms are clear. It will be unfortunate to have cases where people are discriminated against because they suffer from the cold,” he said. The senator spoke to the Star after he distributed wheelchairs to persons with disabilities in Kitutu Masaba and North Mugirango constituencies. His remarks come as Covid-19 cases continue to hurt all sectors in the country. "I am urging all residents to observe government directives because they are aimed at curbing the spread of the disease." He said people living with disability have the potential to meet their goals, but they need support. “Those living with disability and have trained in various fields like tailoring, carpentry, among others should be given financial support to start businesses to earn a living,” he said. He urged Governor John Nyagarama to set aside funds this financial year to support vulnerable groups. Omogeni called on well-wishers to chip in and assist the vulnerable groups. He told Nyagarama to account for funds the county has been receiving from the National Treasury, saying it would be prudent. Residents have the right to be told how the money allocated to the county is spent and the projects initiated, Omogeni said. Edited by R.Wamochie
