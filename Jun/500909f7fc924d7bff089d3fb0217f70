Ogilvy Africa has rolled out the region's first real-time marketing product dubbed FEED targeted at using analytics to address evolving customer needs. The product is being launched across Africa in a phased manner in order. It is expected to help brands keep pace with the audience interests through social intelligence and analytics, community management and content innovations in a unified offering. "With FEED, we are delighted to see real-time marketing become a reality in this region however the agility and compatibility of these offerings, remains a challenge," CEO Ogilvy Africa, Vikas Mehta, said. The first phase starts in Kenya with command centers and physical infrastructure set up in Nairobi.Â  The next phase will be in Ghana, Zambia and Tanzania. The product which has been under a three month testing with some of existing clients of Ogilvy Africa will be available to clients throughout the continent by the end of the year. Every deployment has the capacity to serve the entire continent from any location and is expandable to unlimited users. FEED can go-live in 6-12 weeks of audit, depending on the scale and complexity of the operation. Upon deployment, clients have an option to get an on-site team placed in their premises running a command centre supported by off-site teams stationed in Ogilvy Africa's offices. "While technology is available to all, technology alone seldom solves a problem. The added layer of our talent, combined with FEED's proprietary process is key." Mehta said.
