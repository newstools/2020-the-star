Machakos Children’s Department has urged the Judiciary to conclude pending cases of underage Gender-Based Violence and defilement, saying they have taken longer than two years in court. The department raised concerns over the delay in settling cases touching on children. Machakos children's officer Salome Muthama said some children with minor offences have been remanded for more than two years while waiting for their cases to be determined. The children have been out of school, she said. She also complained of the pile up of cases. "The cases take longer than two years which is agonising to our children who may have suffered GBV," she said. Muthama urged the police to expedite their investigations for quick justice. Society has also been faulted for hiding information from the police which could be used as evidence, out of fear. Muthama said many defilement and rape cases have been dismissed due to lack of evidence. "Some witnesses decide to hide critical information that can help these children acquire justice.” The officer, however, urged the Judiciary to allow children suspects to be given a legal representative in court. She said so many children end up being convicted for wrong reasons. But Machakos senior resident magistrate Brenda Bartum said they were working on new rules to ensure every child gets a right to have a lawyer. Speaking on Tuesday during the Day of African Child at Machakos Rescue Centre, Bartum also assured that the pending cases will be expedited. "I will ensure we prioritise these cases once we resume work from coronavirus break and justice will be served,” she said. She said the court was working on introducing video conferencing during the Covid-19 period.  Edited by R.Wamochie
