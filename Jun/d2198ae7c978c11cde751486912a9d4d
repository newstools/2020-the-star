A recovery centre for victims of gender-based violence is being put up in Kisii. Woman Rep Janet Ongera said the centre will be used to rehabilitate drug addicts and domestic violence victims. The one-storey building will have 20 beds, an ICT centre and staff offices. The contractor said the Sh27 million centre will be completed by December 2020. The Monday function was attended by Governor James Ongwae, county assembly nominees and gender activists. "Even as the focus is on women, we should not run away from the fact that there are women who batter their husbands. We urge you to solve domestic conflicts amicably whenever they arise," Ongera said. Kisii ranks ninth in gender violence incidents. Rape and defilement cases make up 12.9 percent of reported incidents. In the last three months, Kisii has seen a steep rise in teenage pregnancies and rape cases. Over the weekend, 38 teenagers found at an orgy were quarantined at Kisii School. Widows narrate harrowing tales of attempts by in-laws to grab their land. Ongera urged parents to counsel their children. She said spousal violence is on the rise. "Men battered by their wives often keep to themselves to avoid stigma. Silence is not the alternative," Ongera said. The Woman Rep said it is high time dialogue is used to resolve domestic challenges. Assembly nominees Jane Justin, Josephine Ombati and Kisii Central MCA Kepha Mrefu told a politician eyeing government land to back off. "We definitely want to see this land-grabber tamed. Soon we may call protests to show our displeasure," Justin said. Mrefu said he will mobilise women in his ward to deal with the greedy politician. Edited by Frank Obonyo
