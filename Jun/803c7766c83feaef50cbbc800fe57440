Supporters of the 'Black lives matter' movement held a peaceful protest against racism and police brutality outside the US Embassy in Gigiri on Tuesday. Carrying placards with messages including 'Defund the police', the group called for an end to discrimination. This follows more than two weeks of protests in the US following the killing of African American George Floyd after a white policeman put his knee on the man's neck for close to nine minutes. The officer was fired and charged with second degree murder. A three-year-old dog named Skoot was not left behind in the protests held in Gigiri as she donned a placard written 'Black lives matter'. This is the second time the dog is taking part in a protest. She accompanied the owner, Susan Tilson, when she protested against gun violence and advocating for gun control in America three years ago. Protests have been gaining momentum in Kenya with a protest in Mathare on Monday organised by mothers of victims and survivors of police brutality and another on Tuesday held outside Parliament buildings.
