Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli has announced he will host a second Bukhungu stadium rally to declare the Western Kenya spokesperson. He said the meeting will go on despite sharp differences in Luhya leadership. Atwoli said he had contracted the University of Nairobi to come up with poll findings to declare the Luhya kingpin. He said he will hold the biggest rally at Bukhungu stadium next year following the poll findings to declare the leader who will represent the region on the national table. The announcement comes after Wetang'ula, Musalia and Atwoli hosted Western leaders at their homes separately in a show of might. "The people of Mulembe nation are fine. They are moving forward very well," Atwoli said in a phone interview with the Star on Monday. He added the Bukhungu event will be held immediately the Covid-19 pandemic is addressed. “We are confident with how President Uhuru Kenyatta is handling the pandemic and believe that he will address it as soon as possible,” Atwoli said. He said the next rally will be called Bukhungu II and will bring together all the communities in Western Kenya. “We have Luos in Western. We also have Tesos and other communities in this region whom we want to walk together. They also want better lives and opportunities, which I am pushing,” Atwoli said. Atwoli declared Musalia the Luhya spokesperson in June 2017 ahead of the general polls that year. The declaration followed a survey conducted by a team from Nairobi University’s faculty of Political Science between July and November 2016. “Luhyas are united and it’s time to focus on important things. Brokers in the region have been cornered,” Atwoli said. Musalia garnered 39 per cent while his newfound ally Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang’ula and Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya tied at 30 per cent each. Edited by Henry Makori
