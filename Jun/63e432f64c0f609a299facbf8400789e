A man was on Tuesday charged in a Thika court with forging his mother's national ID card and land lease documents to inherit her 4.94 acres (two hectares). Wilson Kiarie denied forging Margaret Wangui Kimani's ID on May 29, 1995, and her Thika municipality land lease document on September 4, 2013. The ID was purportedly a genuine card issued by the principal registrar of persons while the land lease document was purportedly  a genuine one prepared and signed by Zablon Agwata Mabea in the presence of a land registrar at the Ministry of Lands, Ardhi House, in Nairobi. Kiarie is further said to have uttered a forged lease document at Kanyi Kiruchi and Associates for a parcel in Thika in 2014 with the intent to defraud. According to court documents, Kiarie pretended he had inherited the land from Margaret Wangui, now deceased. The parcel of land was a subject of dispute between the accused and Abardare Investments Limited. Kiarie was released on Sh200,000 bail or a Sh500,000 bond until July 13 when the case will be mentioned.  - mwaniki fm
