Police in Nairobi are looking for the driver of former Wajir Senator Abdirahman Ali Hassan after he allegedly disappeared with Sh 2.1 million belonging to his boss. Joel Musyoki Nyamae drove away with the money while the politician was attending a meeting at Kenyatta International Conference Centre on Wednesday afternoon. “The driver left for an unknown destination. Later, the vehicle was found abandoned near Nyayo House with the keys. No money was recovered,” a police statement from DCI Parliament reads. The cash was stashed in a rucksack that had been placed in the rear seat of the Toyota Landcruiser – KBU 262A. The former senator reported the incident at DCI Parliament where he was issued with OB No. 23/25/6/2020. “The suspect is still at large. A team from DCI Central is in pursuit of the case,” the police statement says. Abdirahman was Wajir County’s first senator in 2013 and served as the deputy minority leader in the senate during the same period. Previously, he was Wajir South legislator from 2002-2010 on an Orange Democratic Movement ticket. He was also an assistant minister for Trade and Industry from 2005 to 2007.
