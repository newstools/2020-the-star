The Ministry of Interior and Coordination of National Government has dismissed the article published in one of the dailies. The article had reported that an attempt by the Ministry of Interior to seal a fake arms deal amounting to Sh60,000 flopped. In its reply to the article on Wednesday, Interior PS Karanja Kibicho said that the article referred to fake documents alleged to have been generated from the Ministry of Interior and Coordination of National Government, leading to the collapse of a fake arms tender deal involving a company based in Bamako, Mali. The PS added that the Ministry has never been aware of, nor involved nor propositioned the mentioned fake tender in the article. He added that procurement procedures in government are open and transparent, hence devoid of intermediaries. Kibicho has urged Kenyans to be cautious of conmen and fraudsters pausing as brokers for Government Tenders. "Indeed, we condemn in the strongest terms, the fraudulent acts aforementioned in the article if true, and urge members of the public to be cautious of conmen and fraudsters pausing as brokers for Government Tenders as a whole," Kibicho said. He further said that the budget of the ministry is in the public domain and ministry officials are always at hand to clarify matters regarding procurement. According to the published article, the deal flopped after one of the participants "a city lawyer" tried to con his fellow of the initial Sh7.5 million paid as commitment fees.
