The National Emergency Response Committee has condemned revelers who ignored social distancing rules and opted to party at Langata's 1824 club. This, as Kenya's Covid-19 cases continue to rise by triple digits. The committee, led by Health CS Mutahi Kagwe, also criticised the 'greedy' club owner who put money before lives. "No one should be surprised why we have cases rising in Langata. Our young people have decided not to follow the government guidelines," he said. "And obviously a greedy Kenyan who does not care whether people contract the disease or not." A video did the rounds on social media on Wednesday, showing a crowd of party-goers at 1824 club relishing in music and alcohol. Some of them did not have their masks on while others had theirs on their chins. Kenya's coronavirus cases are at 2,216 as at Wednesday. Health CAS Rashid Aman on Wednesday warned Kenyans against using their masks as if they were 'chin guards'.
