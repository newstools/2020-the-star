The Parliamentary Sports Committee is concerned with the future maintenance and destruction threat posed by hooliganism at Nyayo Stadium even as the government prepares to re-open the facility. Whereas the committee gave the facility a clean bill of health,they expressed concern over how Sports Kenya plans to guard the facility from hooliganism going forward. Nyayo Stadium has been closed since 2017 for renovations. A spot check revealed that the contractor is currently working on the landscaping as well as the drainage with a huge section of the stadium already done. Changing rooms and VIP areas are also ready and seats are in place. The committee, led by Machakos Town MP Victor Munyaka, visited the facility on an inspection tour on Thursday, where they were briefed on the progress by Sports Kenya director general, Pius Metto and chairman Fred Muteti. “We are pleased with the progress here at Nyayo Stadium and we have been assured that in the next one week, the contractor will be able to handover the facility,” Munyaka said. He, however, noted that for the facility to be protected, they will need to come up with proper security network to keep at bay hooligans hell-bent to destroy property. Muteti said the process of replacing the tartan track will be done in the next financial circle, saying they will only repair the worn out sections of the current track and clean it up.
