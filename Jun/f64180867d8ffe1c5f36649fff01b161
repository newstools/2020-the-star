Senate Speaker Kenneth Lusaka has formally received a notification and documents from the Kirinyaga county officials on the impeachment of Governor Anne Waiguru. Lusaka on Wednesday said he had received the resolution of the House to oust Waiguru, a list of all MCAs who attended the session and endorsed the motion and the charges against her. The documents are now in the custody of the clerk awaiting the decision of the Senate business committee on the next course of action. Lusaka said he has convened a special Senate Business Committee at 2.30 pm on Thursday. The SBC will decide whether a team of 11 senators will be selected to interrogate claims against the Governor. This will be subject to approval by the whole House. The other option will be to allow the county boss defend herself before the plenary. "The SBC will decide which way to go with the whole process," he said. The speaker said he will a communicate the MCAs resolution to the House on Tuesday next week. However, Lusaka said he will likely gazette a special next week to conclude the matter as the House is scheduled to break for recess on Tuesday.
