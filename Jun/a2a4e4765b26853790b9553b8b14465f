The Registrar of Political Parties has declined to effect changes to Ford Kenya kicking out party leader Moses Wetang'ula, saying the PP7 form making the changes was not properly signed by the authorised officials. Registrar of Political Parties Ann Nderitu on Thursday referred the matter back to the party for internal resolution. In a response to party secretary general Simiyu Eseli, the registrar said, "You are kindly guided to address the issue highlighted above within the precincts of your party constitution and in line with Section 20 of the PPA and apprise us of the same." On Wednesday, a faction that attempted to oust Wetang’ula from Ford Kenya leadership threatened to eject him from the party. Wafula Wamunyinyi, the faction's leader, said they will not hesitate to take disciplinary action against the Bungoma senator for "disrespecting" party structures. The Wamunyinyi faction tabled instruments which reflect the May 31 changes where the Kanduyi MP was named as interim party leader. “…Wetangula was dismissed from the position of party leader and the position taken over by Wafula Wamunyinyi on an interim basis,” the letter reads. Wetang’ula’s team, led by Kiminini MP Chris Wamalwa, also deposited their version of the returns to the Parties Registrar barely hours after the Wamunyinyi side left.
