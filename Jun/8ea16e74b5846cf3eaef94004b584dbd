Residents of Ndeiya in Limuru constituency, Kiambu, have asked the government to deploy more police officers in the area to help reduce the sale of alcoholic drinks and control drug abuse. They say some bar operators carry drinks in bags and sell to customers. Voice of Men and Children national chairman James Njenga said youths were abusing the drinks. They buy and go to open grounds to drink without observing social distance, he said. Customers are no longer locked in bars to drink as the government has tightened measures to stop the spread of Covid-19 disease. “We have several bars which have not stopped locking customers inside and selling alcoholic drinks,” Njenga said. “What is disturbing us is the issue of bar attendants who are carrying bags. They are stocked with different brands of alcoholic drinks. They sell to customers at the roadside,” he said. “These people do not fear anyone. Once they buy, they go to open grounds or at the roadsides in the village and drink in groups without considering social distancing.” He said the worst areas are Boloti, Thigio, Nduma, Gatuura and Royal. He asked deputy county commissioner Charles Mukele to act on the issue. Edited by Henry Makori
