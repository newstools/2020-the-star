Education CS George Magoha has said each classroom will have 15 to 20 learners when schools reopen in September. Speaking in Kitui county on Wednesday, the CS also said teachers will also report to schools two weeks before the reopening. These are part of the measures that will have to be put in place as the country grapples with the virus. "Every school will also have thermo guns for temperature checks," he said. The CS said the government will ensure they get 24 million masks in September so that each child gets at least two of them. The minimum requirements upon reopening have been outlined as clean running water and soap for hand washing or hand sanitiser. The institutions will also be required to sanitise often-touched objects such as door knobs, light switches and stair railings with disinfectant. An Infotrak poll released on Sunday showedÂ 70 per cent of the citizenry is opposed to reopening schools before the pandemic is contained. President Uhuru Kenyatta on June 1 asked the Education and Health ministries to chart the path towards reopening the institutions of learning. Of concern, though, is that the increasing number of cases in the country is a sign that the virus is not under control yet. Infotrak research manager Walter Nyagudi said the biggest concern for Kenyans with regard to reopening of schools is a likely spike in Covid-19 infections among children. More:
