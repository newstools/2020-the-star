Embu elders have opposed calls to end the curfew and lift the travel ban against Covid-19 hotspot counties. They are worried relaxing the measures will lead to an explosion of coronavirus cases. Nyangi-ndiiriri Council of Elders led by chairman Andrew Ireri appealed to President Uhuru Kenyatta to reject the calls. The elders said if the country is opened up, most people from virus hotspots such as Nairobi and Mombasa will move to other parts and spread the virus. “If people who have not been tested and yet are positive travel to other counties, the pandemic will hit the whole country," Ireri said. On May 23 President Uhuru Kenyatta said the country cannot stay in lockdown forever, raising Kenyans' hopes the coronavirus restrictions might be eased. And on Monday he directed the ministries of Interior and Education to work on guidelines and protocol on the gradual reopening of places of worship and schools. The elders praised Education Cabinet Secretary George Magoha for rejecting calls to immediately reopen schools. They said Magoha made a wise decision, adding that the virus might spread rapidly among learners due to the nature of Kenyan schools. “We appeal to the President to maintain the curfew until the pandemic is completely contained,” Ireri said. The elders urged the government to look into the use of herbal medicine as a possible cure. They proposed ndonga, murenda and muthaiti. The elders said powdered Ndonga root mixed with water was used to treat anthrax and swelling while sap from murenda leaves was used to remove toxic substances from the body. Ground muthaiti leaves were used to treat malaria, they said. The elders urged Uhuru to ask scientists to work with herbalists knowledgeable in traditional medicine. "Herbalists will provide the government with local herbs and knowledge of how the medicine is administered," Ireri said. Edited by Frank Obonyo
