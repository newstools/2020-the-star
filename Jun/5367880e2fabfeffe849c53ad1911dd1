Rev Natasha has donated food and various supplies to healthcare workers through her charity, The Natasha Hand of Compassion'. The gift baskets were a sign of appreciation for their work during the coronavirus pandemic, she said. Rev Natasha said her foundation cares deeply about nurses and other health workers. "We would like to express our gratitude for their commitment to treating patients, dealing with corona and continuing to offer essential health services to all," she said. “These workers are our warriors, fighting every hour of the day to save our loved ones and to keep the rest of us safe and healthy.” The Natasha Hand of Compassion has also provided food to the less privileged and the most vulnerable in slums.
