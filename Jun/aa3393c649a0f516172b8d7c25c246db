A man who sought shelter in a church a week ago has been charged with breaking into the house of prayers' store and stealing assorted music instruments worth Sh560,000. Benson Alubale on Monday denied the offence before Kibera senior principal magistrate Boaz Ombewa. The music assortment, which included speakers, pianos,  microphones, cables and keyboard mixers, was the property of Bernard P.A.G. Church. The theft happened on the night of June 1-2. "I never stole the items. I was invited to the church and the following day, I was told the items had been stolen and I was the suspect. But I told them I was clean," Alubale told the court. A police report in court indicates that the accused had spent the  night in the church in the company of a member of the congregation. The following day accused, according to the report, the accused collected keys from a shop with which he opened the church and slept. The theft was discovered by a member of the congregation who had gone to collect his bicycle. The man found the church doors open but the suspect was missing. His phone was switched off. Alubale was released him on Sh100,000 bail.  - mwaniki fm
