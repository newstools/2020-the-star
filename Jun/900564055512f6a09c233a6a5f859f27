The performances of senior national football teams should not be something to be frowned upon for political expediency, reckons Football Kenya Federation Nairobi West Branch Chairman Caleb Malweyi. With elections due many have been rubbishing the teams' performances but Malweyi said Nick Mwendwa's efforts in the growth of Harambee Stars and Harambee Starlets cannot been wished away. Under Mwendwa, Stars qualified for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations for the first time in 15 years, finishing third in Group C, behind eventual finalists Algeria and Senegal and ahead of neighbours Tanzania. Starlets, on the other hand, made their debut in the 2016 Africa Women Cup of Nations after the current tenure re-introduced the FKF Women Premier League and Division One Leagues which gave life to the then dying senior women's national team. The team also closed the year 2019 as champions of the CECAFA Women Championships in Tanzania, for the first time ever. "We have made gains in women's football and youth football under Mwendwa. We want to build on these gains in the coming four years," Malweyi remarked. The current regime alsoÂ  actualised the hitherto inconceivable idea of having a junior national team and developed the National Centre of Excellence to feed Harambee Stars.
