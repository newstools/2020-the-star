Deputy President William Ruto on Friday held meetings with leaders from the western Kenya region drawn from Ford Kenya and Amani National Congress parties. "Held fruitful discussions on the development of the country with leaders from Western Kenya who were drawn from Jubilee, ANC and Ford Kenya Parties," he said via Twitter. Ruto asked the leaders to direct their energies on fighting the pandemic against a backdrop of push and pull in the parties. "The revival of our economy after the Covid-19 pandemic will require concerted efforts from all leaders," he said. "Accordingly, it is imperative that we direct our energy to this endeavor to curtail the adverse effects of the crisis." This comes at a time when leaders from Western have called for unity ahead of 2022 elections with those viewed as rebels locked out. ANC party leader Musalia Mudavadi, Narc-Kenya's Martha Karua and former MP Peter Kenneth formed a seven-person secretariat to build a third force ahead of 2022 General Election. The initiative — driven by the civil society groups to build a ‘national interest’ movement — brings together religious leaders, non-governmental organisations, politicians and professionals. “We are working together with people who have the interests of this country at heart. They include the civil society groups, professionals and other politicians,” Musalia told the Star. A series of backroom meetings by  Ruto, ODM leader Raila Odinga and ANC boss Musalia Mudavadi  in the past few weeks have lifted the lid on political realignments as the 2022 General Election draws closer. The three political bigwigs  are keen on succeeding President Uhuru Kenyatta in 2022 and have held several strategic meetings, some made public while others secret. While Ruto and Mudavadi have expressed interest in succeeding Uhuru ,Raila on the other hand has not  but  his key lieutenants including Siaya senator James Orengo have repeatedly hinted that he will offer his candidature.
