Online comedian Flaqq, aka Mama Otis, is holding an online party tonight as Kenyans celebrate the 57th year since attaining internal self-rule. The party is to celebrate the true Kenyan spirit. On the decks will be Kiss TV's DJ Kym Nickdee and his brother DJ Moh Spice, ensuring viewers are entertained into the night on their Instagram pages. The Madaraka Day party is also served in partnership with Kenya Breweries Limited spirit drink Kenya Cane. Flaqo got the attention of Kenyans when he started sharing online videos imitating popular celebrities like Khaligraph Jones, Bahati and King Kaka. His first video was quick as his mother went out to get some groceries. That hastily done video would go on to give him his first viral video, propelling him to fame beyond his dreams.
