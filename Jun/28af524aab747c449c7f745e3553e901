Detectives probing the suspected murder of Keroche heiress Tecra Muigai have 30 days to finalise their investigations on her boyfriend, the key suspect. The deceased was in a relationship with 54-year-old Omar Lali whom she was staying with at a rented cottage in Shella town before she died. Lali told detectives Tecra fell down a flight of stairs and hurt her head. During a live video link session presided over by Lamu principal magistrate Allan Temba on Wednesday, Omar’s legal team led by advocate Yusuf Aboubakar agreed with the Director of Public Prosecutions and the DCI to give the detectives a month to finalise their investigations. Lali will not, however, be detained during the 30-day duration of the investigations. He was released on May 27 by the same court on Sh300,000 bond and two sureties provided by his mother and brother-in-law. The Lamu court refused to extend the pre-trial detention of Lali as had been requested by the DPP and the DCI. Until her death on May 2 this year, Tecra was the strategy and innovations director at Keroche Breweries. She died at a Nairobi hospital after sustaining injuries after falling down a flight of stairs in a house she shared with Lali on April 27. Lali was arrested on May 3, a day after Tecra’s demise and remained in detention close to a month before he was released on bond. A post-mortem conducted by chief government pathologist Johansen Oduor a month ago revealed that Tecra died as a result of trauma to the left side of her face consistent with a fall. She was laid to rest at her family home in Naivasha on May 16. Edited by Henry Makori
