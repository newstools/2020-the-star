The AU representative for Infrastructure Development in Africa, Raila Odinga, has defended head of African Development Bank Akinwumi Adesina, who has been accused of graft. The 60-year-old president of the African Development Bank is being questioned after a string of alleged corruption and abuse of office allegations from his own staff spilled into the open. He has denied any wrongdoing. In a statement on Friday, Raila said the allegations are only but attempts to derail the institution during this time of global Covid-19 pandemic. "The whole saga began when a whistle blowerÂ made allegations of violations of procurement, contact issuance and requirement procedures. These allegations were promptly and thoroughly investigated by the Executive Board through its relevant committee and a determination made that they were baseless," Raila said. He, however, noted that some members who were not satisfied by the board's findings decided to call for an independent inquiry against the bank's accepted procedures. Raila said this take serves as a threat that can destabilise the institution. On May 30, US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin personally signed a letter to the board rejecting the internal investigation that cleared Adesina. A "Group of concerned staff members of the AfDB" claimed that Adesina has used the bank's resources for self-promotion and personal gain while also paying out huge but undeserved severance packages to staff who resigned mysteriously, and favouring his fellow Nigerians. For his part, however, Adesina said in a statement last week that he is hopeful all allegations against him will be cleared. "In spite of unprecedented attempts by some to tarnish my reputation and prejudice the bank's governance procedures, I maintain my innocence with regard to trumped-up allegations that unjustly seek to impugn my honour and integrity," he said.
