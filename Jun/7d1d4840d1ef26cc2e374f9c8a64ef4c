Embattled Secretary General of the Supreme Council of Kenyan Muslims Ambassador Mohamed Mahad on SaturdayÂ resigned from the council. In his resignation letter, Mahad said his effort to reform council failed hence his decision to exit. "I joined Supkem towards the end of 2017 after successfully vying for the position of Secretary General. I have since tried to reform the Organisation to the best of my ability, however my efforts have failed to yield the desired goals due to the complex nature of the Organisation and its environment.In view of the above, it is my considered view that my continued service as the SG will no longer add value to the Organisation, hence my desired wish to submit my exit from Council.," he said. This comes two days after the Directorate of Criminal investigations summoned Muhad and nine other Supkem members over fund misappropriation. The summons came after one of the embattled officials requested the DCI to launch investigations into the dealings of the council. In a letter to the DCI, Secretary to the Council based in Narok County Mustaapjha Tobiko Ole Tampul asked the detectives to conduct a joint comprehensive investigation into activities by the acting chairman, secretary general, treasurer, organising secretary and members of the National Executive Committee against the suspension of Ambassador Yusuf Nzibo as chairman. Muhad is also serving as a director of great lakes desk at the ministry of foreign affairs.
