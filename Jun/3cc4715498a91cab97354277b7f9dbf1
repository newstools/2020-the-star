There has been some good news about Covid-19 in Kenya in the past few days. A joint study by the Universities of Nairobi and Washington found that Covid-19 is spreading more slowly than in many other countries, perhaps due to Kenya's youthful demographic and tropical climate. On Monday the Health ministry said that recoveries exceeded new infections for the first time, 97 against 95. And this week the WHO said that it was rare for asymptomatic carriers to infect other people, and most Covid-positive Kenyans are asymptomatic. We should not go as far as President Magufuli to claim that there is no longer any risk from Covid-19 but perhaps Kenya will survive without catastrophe. These snippets of good news should not lull us into a false sense of complacency. It is still very easy to catch Covid-19 and the illness can be very nasty, especially for older people. It can still spread rapidly in tropical climates - look at Brazil. So while we hope for the best, let's all always wear our face masks in public, wash our hands every hour, and maintain social distancing at all times.
