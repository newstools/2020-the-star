South African star Jahzo and Rudebwoy Entertainment have dropped the third single off the Dutty Wine album, 'JahAhMiGuide'. It is an inspirational song that talks about Jah being the only hope for Covid-19 since the cure is yet to be found. Jahzo, who hails from South Africa, says, “I fell in love with dancehall music during my days studying at Varsity College in Cape Town. “I have been listening to dancehall music since and fell in love with it due to its uniqueness and message. I grew up listening to the music of Anthony B, Assassin, Buju Banton and Capleton." The song is available on all major digital platforms for download and streaming. Jahzo is currently shooting the visuals for the track, which he expects to release on his birthday later this month.
