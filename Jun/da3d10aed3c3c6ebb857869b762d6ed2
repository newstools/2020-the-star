Senate Majority leader Samuel Poghisio has promised to support the legislation intended to strengthen the Kenya Medical Supplies Authority. Poghisio described Kemsa as the nerve centre for Covid-19 supplies. “I appreciate that Kemsa is growing and expanding its scope, especially during this Covid-19 pandemic. We will discuss and see the legislations that would support the organisation in discharging its duties more efficiently,” he told the parastatal's chief executive officer Jonah Manjari during a courtesy in Nairobi . The legislator said that strengthening Kemsa will enhance its capability to supply drugs and other health products. Manjari singled out the Miscellaneous Amendment Bill as critical to streamlining Kemsa's ability to execute its mandate with ease. The CEO also sought Poghisio’s help in recovering debts owed by county governments. “In recent years, these debts have put undue pressure on the Authority’s revolving fund and undermined its ability to expand its product portfolio. We welcome the Senate Majority leader’s goodwill in supporting Kemsa unlock some of the pressing issues,” Manjari said. He promised to collaborate with Poghisio’s West Pokot county through their Corporate Social Responsibility team to improve the health needs of residents.  - mwaniki fm
