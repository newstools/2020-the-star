A Covid-19 survivor from Kajiado North subcounty has died after developing breathing complications. According to sources, a few days after leaving the hospital last month, she started experiencing breathing problems and was taken for admission at Kitengela Hospital but was later transferred to Kajiado. “The last few days, she had been unresponsive and breathing with the help of oxygen,” the source said. In April, she was admitted at Kenyatta University Teaching Referral Hospital after testing positive and recovered from the virus a month later. Kajiado county government of cleared her Sh 83,000 medical bill after calling for support from well-wishers. Her relatives tested negative after being quarantined in Ngong hospital. Last month while she was at the hospital, thugs burgled into her house. She said no one has been arrested in connection with the theft. The thieves stole electronics and clothes. Her friends remember her as a person who had a great sense of humour, and an active friend. She has left behind two children. Kajiado Health CEC Esther Somoire said soon, the county may not have adequate facilities to accommodate the rising cases, hence the need to be extra careful to help in controlling and manage the situation. The county has received more than 80 positive cases. Edited by R.Wamochie
