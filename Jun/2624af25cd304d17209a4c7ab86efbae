Gospel singer Evelyn Wanjiru says her music journey has come this far thanks to God, proper work ethic and her husband Agundabweni Akweyu. Evelyn met her husband in church and dated him for four years before saying I do. While dating, he started nurturing her in music. During an Instagram Live conversation with Mercy Masika, she said working together with her husband has proven to be the best decision she has ever made. "He learnt music from YouTube and has been my manager since," she said. The couple runs Bwenieve Productions, which they started while still dating. She said her husband does not hold back from correcting her if need be. "I don't know who would handle me. He has partnered with God to make me who I am," she said. The two have been married for eight years now, with no child yet. She explains that she has resolved to trust Godâ€™s timing and promises while in the meantime choosing to live her life to the maximum, free from any fears and doubts. "People expect so much in your marriage but when I look at my husband, it's beyond what people want. I am enjoying every season," she said. During the live conversation, Evelyn also talked about submission in marriage as one of the essentials to keep a marriage. "Submission is very important as a wife. Some blessings come through your husband so let us try. Especially when God has raised you to a level of being a celebrity, don't forget your role as a woman," she said. Evelyn is promoting her new song 'Worthy', featuring Eunice Njeri.
