As the world continues to welcome the preliminary report of drug dexamethasone's use in treating coronavirus patients who are critically ill, experts have warned of its side effects. Health Director-General Patrick Amoth on Wednesday said Kenyans should not rush to buy the drug over the counter without first knowing its side effects. Amoth said fluid retention is one of the drug's side effects and a patient might gain weight as well. He said the blood pressure of a user can go up and the blood sugar in diabetics can also rise. "If you're on insulin or oral medicine for treating diabetes, you will require a higher dose to control your sugar," Amoth said. The medicine can also cause depression since it affects the mood and also affects the sleep pattern. "Any person taking this particular medicine must be wary of these effects," Amoth said. Dexamethasone is a steroid that has been used since the 1960s to reduce inflammation in a range of conditions, including inflammatory disorders and certain cancers. The World Health Organisation welcomed researchers' findings that it can be a life-saving drug fro Covid-19 patients. On Wednesday, Kenya recorded 184 new cases collected from 2,518 samples, bringing the total cases in the country to 4,044. Nairobi had 111 cases, Mombasa 19, Kajiado 14, Meru 13, Kiambu 9, Busia 6, Nakuru 4, Machakos 3, Kwale, Kisumu, Garisa, Taita Taveta and Vihiga had single cases. Vihiga becomes the latest county to record the virus, bringing the total number of counties with viruses to 40. Also, the country recorded 2 more deaths making the number of deaths to 107.
