  Authorities in Embu are looking for a man who escaped from a quarantine centre on Thursday. He is suspected to have contracted coronavirus. County commissioner Abdullahi Galgalo said the man had been in quarantine for 13 days after he and ten others were isolated over suspicion of having contracted Covid-19. Galgalo said the man escaped just a day before his sample was to be taken for testing to prove whether he had the virus. He said the rest patiently stayed in quarantine until the end of 14 days and were released after their tests showed they were free of the virus. Galgalo said he was very afraid that the escapee might infect residents with whom he comes into contact. The administrator spoke at Kavutiri village in Embu East on Saturday. He was with Governor Martin Wambora. They asked the man to voluntarily return to the quarantine facility to be tested. “I appeal to all the residents in Embu and Kenya at large to report any person they know was in quarantine in Embu butv escaped before his 14 days elapsed so he can be detained without mingling with others any further,” Galgalo said. He said they have circulated information about the man all over including in Nairobi and to the deputy county commissioners and chiefs to help apprehend him. Galgalo said he did not want to name the escapee but urged that he be looked for everywhere until he is found. "He does not know the danger he is exposing to himself and his family and the Embu people," Galgalo said. Wambora said he was happy the county had not recorded any cases of Covid-19. He attributed the feat to the concerted efforts among all the players in the coronavirus response team and residents' adherence to health regulations. They urged the residents to continue obeying all the health regulations to remain safe.  Edited by P.O
