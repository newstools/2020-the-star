DCI detectives on Monday arrested a fraud suspect in Nyali, Mombasa county. The suspect, alleged to be a notorious fraudster in the area, was nabbed while in his hideout at Beach Road apartments in Nyali. The arrest comes after numerous complaints from residents over being swindled money and property. According to the Directorate of Criminal Investigation, the suspect named Fahmi Salim Said was involved in defrauding unsuspecting Kenyans off their money. "The 34-year-old suspect is accused of defrauding several individuals cash totaling to more than 11 million shillings. Fahmi is in custody awaiting arraignment," the DCI said in a Twitter post. In November 2019, four suspects were arrested in Mombasa suspected to be involved in an online fraud syndicate. The DCI believed the four conspired to defraud a JKUAT lecturer Sh567,000 in a fake deal to assist him in shipping his car into the country. They allegedly posed as agents of a shipping company dubbed Beforward Car Importers based in Japan. "One of the suspects who identified himself as Martin ID name; James Maina Muhindi, 32 years, enticed the victim into depositing the amount to an account in a local bank-NCBA Bank, to avoid delays in the dispatch of the consignment. The victim became suspicious when he was again called over the phone, being asked to send another Sh 432, 000 Duty fees," read part of the DCI Twitter post.
