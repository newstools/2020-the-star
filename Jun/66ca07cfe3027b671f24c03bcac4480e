A man has been living on his landlord's corridor in Kongowea after failing to pay rent for 10 months. David Obari, 53, was left jobless in 2016 after he fell and broke his leg at his place of work at a go-down in Mombasa. He had to undergo surgery where he was advised that his leg was not fit to do heavy work, so he was forced to leave his job. His company is yet to compensate him for the injury. Obare's monthly rent was Sh3,500 and his family-wife and children, are at his rural home. The landlord allowed him to stay in his single room but eventually threw him out. He still allowed him to stay at his corridor. “I cannot blame the landlord because accommodating someone for 10 months without pay and still, you are living in his house, I can say he has really helped me,” he said. Though he has a place to put his head at night, he is not comfortable living on that corridor knowing that it is a nuisance for the neighbours. Obari says he is unable to get money for food. He depends on neighbours who pity him and give him food. “I only depend on well-wishers." A good Samaritan who was giving him food daily had a stroke and was admitted at a hospital in Mombasa, dealing a blow to Obari. Neighbour Sadun Abeid, however, chipped in after the good Samaritan fell ill. “I take food to him in the morning, afternoon and in the evening,” she said. Abeid said Obari is a conservative man who does not allow people to know he is suffering but it has reached a point where his problems have become visible. Another neighbour Vivian Akinyi thinks it is better if Obari is helped go back to his birth home where he can start a business. "Then he will be able to fend for himself." Edited by R.Wamochie
