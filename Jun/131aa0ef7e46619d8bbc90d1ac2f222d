Do not have children if you do not plan to care for them is Education CS George Magoha's message to Kenyans. The CS was referring to the increased number of teenage pregnancies during the Covid-19 pandemic. Magoha urged parents to monitor, guide and spend time with their children and protect them from sexual and drug abuse, teenage pregnancies and female genital mutilation. "If you have no time to look after your child, then perhaps you have no business creating a child. Spend time with your child," he said. Magoha was speaking at the Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development on Friday when he received the final report of the Covid-19 National Education Response Committee. "It is most heartbreaking that after I went to the slums to fish out some poor girls, took them to school and looked for scholarships. Three of them, in Form 1, are already pregnant during this short period of two months," he said. A survey by the National Council on Population and Development released in March shows one in five girls aged between 15 and 19 in Kenya is either pregnant or has given birth. In Nairobi county, with a population of more than four million people, 2,432 girls aged 14 had conceived, the highest number in the country. According to the report, teenage pregnancies are fuelled by rape, defilement, poverty, early marriage, peer influence, drug abuse and lack of youth-friendly health services. Magoha said schools will only be reopened after scrutiny of Covid-19 data from the Health ministry. He said 351 public schools are being used as quarantine centres while universities are used as isolation centres. Edited by Josephine M. Mayuya
