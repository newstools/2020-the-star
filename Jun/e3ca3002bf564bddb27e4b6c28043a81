Hardly a week after launching a midweek jackpot, National Super League sponsors Betika has now covered gamblers who can't access the internet. Initially, Betika customers would place their bets online but the bookmakers have now introduced betting on Short Message Service (SMS) which will enable their punters to place bets even when they have depleted their data bundles. The firm’s clients will not only  bet before a particular game starts but  will also bet on live matches through dialing *644# and with a minimum of Sh2 in their  Betika wallets where they will explore a number of options including upcoming games, odds and live matches. The Sofapaka shirt sponsors revealed that they came up with the decision after one of their administrators missed a whooping Sh30,000, thanks to depleted data bundle. The administrator said she had elected to place her bet on Bayern Munich to beat their bitter rivals Borussia Dortmund by a 1-0 margin but could not complete the process online. “This happened to me just before the Bundesliga showdown between Dortmund and Bayern Munich. A fellow punter and I got into football banter and we were trying to predict the correct score for the match. His prediction was a 2-1 win for Dortmund while I predicted a 1-0 win for Bayern and to show him just how confident I was with my prediction, I tried to place a Sh2,000 stake on a 0-1 correct score bet. To my disappointment, my data bundle balance was 0.00MB and so I let it pass! Imagine my fury when I checked the full-time score only to realise that I would have made a cool Sh30,000 from odds of 15  if I had gone ahead to place the bet,” she said.
