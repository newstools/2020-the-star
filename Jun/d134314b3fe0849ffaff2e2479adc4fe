 Bungoma Governor Wycliffe Wangamati has told Senator Moses Wetang’ula to forget Ford Kenya leadership as his ouster was a done deal. Wangamati, who was addressing a burial at Kibingei in Kimilili, asked the senator to stop wasting time by going to courts and accept that he was duly ousted. “I want to tell Wetang’ula that matters of Ford-Kenya party leadership were done and dusted and he should sit back and allow other people to lead him,” he said. Wangamati is one of a Ford-Kenya faction led by secretary general Simiyu Eseli that removed Wetang'ula from party leadership in May and replaced him with Kanduyi MP Wafula Wamunyinyi. The senator challenged his removal in court. The matter will be heard next week. The governor claimed Wetang’ula had used the same method to oust Musikari Kombo from the party and told to exit in peace. He said Wetang’ula's ouster came after consultation and a long time of soul-searching. “I want to assure Ford-Kenya members that all is well and it is only a matter of time that the new leadership will engage in revamping the party,"he said. The Wamunyinyi faction accused the senator of failing to revamp the party, a claim the lawmaker has denied and blamed his removal on outside forces. He pointed an accusing finger at Devolution Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa, Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli and ODM leader Raila Odinga. Wetang'ula moved to the High Court in Nairobi and was granted orders blocking the party changes pending the hearing and determination of the case. Justice James Makau set the case for mention on July 9 after the Wamunyinyi group objected that the court had no jurisdiction to hear the matter.  Edited by P.O
