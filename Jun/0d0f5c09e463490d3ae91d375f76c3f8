 Leaders from Busia and Siaya counties have called for a hastened survey and demarcation of the boundary between the two counties at Osieko which has often been disputed. The dispute was triggered by Busia county's decision to fence off part of the disputed land for the construction of Lwang'a market. The fencing was done five years ago. Led by MCAs Casper Ajuma (Bunyala South, Busia) and Willis Ochieng’ (West Yimbo, Siaya), the leaders said a proper survey is needed to settle the ownership of the said section that has been a subject of contention. Ochieng said the dispute needs to urgently resolved, saying it was creating unnecessary tension. “We need to resolve this matter as soon as possible to pave the way for the development of the said market for the benefit of residents. We will not encourage divisive politics that will puncture the very social fabric we are trying to protect,” Ochieng said. He said it was unfortunate that rowdy youths destroyed a perimeter fence that had been erected by Governor Sospeter Ojaamong's administration. “It is illegal to vandalise government property in the guise that it belongs to Siaya. It’s always important to observe the law. I apologise on their behalf.” Ajuma said as leaders we fully behind the legal resolution of the dispute. He urged the surveyors to undertake the exercise with professionalism. A team of land surveyors drawn from the two counties perused documents presented to them by individual teams. They resolved to come up with a resolution after three weeks.  Edited by P.O
