Impala Saracens are looking to bolster their squad ahead of  2020-2021 season. Impala vice chairman, Charles Ngovi, said they are keen to bolster fly-half, fullback, props and second row positions for the next season's campaign. "Planning for the next season has started in earnest though there is still uncertainty over this season. We are looking at ways of improving the team and being competitive going forward,” he added. The Impala boss admitted that they had struggled especially with decision making at fly-half and fullbacks this season and they will need to make changes. "We are looking at strengthening the two key positions. At times, we felt we did not have control in the matches we should have won," noted Ngovi. The side finished fourth on the log after the end of the group phase with 48 points —winning nine matches and losing seven. The former international observed that young players will be given a chance to prove themselves.  “We have a very youthful squad and I believe the blend of experience in the team will keep us in good shape for the season ahead and enable us fight for the Kenya Cup,” noted Ngovi. The Ngong-Road outfit were due to meet Mwamba in the Kenya Cup playoffs before the season was suspended, owing to the rise of the coronavirus pandemic  in March. The other playoff match was due to be played between Menengai Oilers and Homeboyz. Ngovi hopes the season will be completed despite the challenge of the pandemic. "I'm hopeful the season will be completed but first, we have to wait for government directives for us to resume action." A committee comprising of officials of the Ministry of Health, sports and the interior are looking at ways of re-starting sports in the country soon. Players have been sent individual programmes to keep themselves fit until action resumes.
