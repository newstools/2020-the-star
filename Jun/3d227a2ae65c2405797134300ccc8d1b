The Ministry of Public Service, Youth and Gender will help conserve Ngong Hills water tower by planting and maintaining trees. Cabinet Secretary Margaret Kobia said that a greener environment is part of the ministry's obligation to the public. “The form of services to the citizens is public service. For us, a green environment is necessary for the delivery of public service hence why we decided to focus on the environment,” Kobia said. She spoke at 7,400-acre water complex on Tuesday afternoon when she led parastatal heads and employees to plant 5,000 seedlings to mark the Africa Public Service Day. The event, marked across the continent, was this year commemorated through a tree-planting drive and not an exhibition fair as usual. Environment CS Keriako Tobiko said that the efforts of the Public Service ministry would help the water tower reclaim its lost glory. “I am happy that you have expressed your willingness to adopt this part of the forest and not only plant but grow trees. We will provide you with all the paperwork to make this possible,” Tobiko said. The water tower, which is part of the expansive Ngong Forest, has been decimated with only 1,255 acres covered by vegetation. Julius Kamau, chief conservator of forests, praised the public service ministry's contribution to the conservation of the forest block. “Apart from being an ecotourism site, this place is also home to wildlife including leopards, buffaloes and cheetahs. We hope that these conservation efforts will attract more wildlife and subsequently more tourists,” he said. CASs Rachel Shebesh and Maureen Mbaka also attended the event. Chris Kiptoo (Environment PS) and Mary Kimonye (Public Service) and several parastatal heads were also present.
