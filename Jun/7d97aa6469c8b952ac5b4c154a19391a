A former Safaricom customer care director has suffered a major setback after the appellate court stopped payment of Sh14.5 million awarded to her by a lower court. Justices Martha Koome, Mohamed Warsame and Jamila Mohamed stopped the payment, pending an appeal filed by the giant telecommunications company. The three-judge bench agreed with Safaricom that its appeal was arguable and it was not known how Pauline Wangeci Warui would reimburse the money in case the appeal succeeded. “From the circumstances of the application before us, we are satisfied that Safaricom has an arguable appeal on grounds among other things whether Warui should have been taken through a termination or disciplinary hearing despite the mutual separation agreement entered into between them,” they ruled. Warui left Safaricom on March 20, 2015 after signing a mutual separation agreement and was paid Sh46.2 million exit package. A year later, she sued for unlawful termination, claiming that she was coerced into signing the exit deal. Employment and Labour Relations Court judge Maureen Onyango ruled that Safaricom did not follow the right procedure in letting Warui go. She subsequently ordered the telco to pay her an additional Sh14.5 million — eight months’ worth of her salary. While terminating her, Safaricom said that investigations had revealed that its call centre system data had been altered to show that the department was doing well when, in reality, the performance was below target. Aggrieved by the decision of judge Onyango, Safaricom appealed saying the judge was wrong to rule that despite the mutual separation agreement, Warui should have been taken through a termination or disciplinary hearing.
