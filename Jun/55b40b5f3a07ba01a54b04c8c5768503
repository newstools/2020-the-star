President Uhuru Kenyatta and AU envoy Raila Odinga on Monday night inspected ongoing development projects in Nairobi’s Central Business District. The two leaders took advantage of the curfew as most Kenyans are expected to be home, following the government measures to contain the spread of Covid-19. “Uhuru and Raila were relaxed and we could see them laughing together. The conversation was deep as if they were planning something,” a guard at one of the premises in the CBD told the Star. He didn’t want to be mentioned for security reasons. “They were talking as they inspected roads," he said. Uhuru and Raila arrived in the CBD from Waiyaki way with seven black chase cars trailing them. “We saw the cars on Waiyaki Way around Boulevard Hotel entering town at around 8.20pm,” an officer said. The team arrived in the CBD around 8:30pm using the same car after the virtual Madaraka day celebrations, which was held at state house. They alighted from one car –Uhuru from left while Raila from the right- surrounded by tens of heavily armed police officers. They inspected drainages, street lighting, roads and the reconstruction of pavements. The inspection comes after Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko differed with Nairobi Metropolitan Services boss Major General Mohamed Badi on allocation of funds to run the functions assigned to the latter. Both Sonko and Badi  were not present to receive Uhuru during the inspection according to the state protocol. The police commissioner and commander were also not present. Uhuru has done several impromptu inspections over the years. In February, Uhuru made a surprise visit to inspect the late and former President Daniel Moi's funeral preparations at Nyayo Stadium. Uhuru drove himself to Nyayo Stadium in a G Wagon. In March, Uhuru made a surprise visit to Nyeri to inspect projects. Last year, Uhuru made an impromptu visit to the Inland Container Depot at Embakasi along Mombasa road where seized containers were being stored.
