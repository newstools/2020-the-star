Kirinyaga Woman Representative Purity Ngirici wants all senators to vote on whether to uphold Governor Anne Waiguru's impeachment, rather than a select committee. Senate Speaker Kenneth Lusaka on Wednesday said he had summoned a special meeting of the House Business Committee next Tuesday— the panel that schedules the business for the house — to decide the route to take in prosecuting the case. However, Ngirici, who is a close ally to the Deputy President William Ruto, said the voice of the voters of Kirinyaga county shall not be determined by eleven people of a committee. "Anne Waiguru's case is about the misappropriation of county funds and should not be determined by the committee of eleven members," she said. She claimed that the 11 members can easily be corrupted to rule in the favour of the impeached governor. "They will be given Sh1 million each or Sh2 million and the people of Kirinyaga will lose their money and their will will not be heard, we want it to be heard by the 67 senators in the Senate." Ngirici has also urged Murang'a Senator and Majority Whip Irung'u Kangata to keep off  Kirinyaga issues and allow the locals to determine their way. Waiguru suffered another setback on Thursday after the High Court dismissed her application that sought to nullify the impeachment. Waiguru went to court on Tuesday after her impeachment seeking to have the decision by MCAs annulled arguing that they had disobeyed court orders. However, Justice Weldon Korir declined to grant her prayers and dismissed her amended application with costs to the Kirinyaga county assembly and speaker. Waiguru was impeached by the 23 MCAs against the total 33 for misusing her office.
