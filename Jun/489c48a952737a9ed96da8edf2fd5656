Media personality Betty Kyallo invited Nasa leader Raila Odinga's wife Ida Odinga for the relaunch of her salon, Flair by Betty, in Kilimani’s Rose Avenue. Ida was the guest of honour at the launch. In her speech, she commended Betty for working with young people. “The most amazing thing is that they are all young people. Thank you for working with them,” she said. “Most times, people see ladies like Betty and they think they are just for the camera. They don’t realise they can also do other things on their own, and people mistake them that they don’t do things on their own. "Betty, I’m glad that with your brain, hands and mind, you worked out this thing. Girls, this can be done. It can be done. God gave us equal brains. God did not give us different gender brains.” In conclusion, Mama Ida advised, “Keep off drugs. And advise little sisters and brothers. Tell them no one has ever succeeded from taking drugs.” In her speech, Betty said, “I have been dreaming of this day. I cannot believe it is here. "I was telling Mama Ida that we left this place at 5.30am this morning. We were here organising things for you guys to see this. It has been three months of working on this.” Having been in the salon business for two years now, Betty exclusively told Word Is the greatest challenge is customer satisfaction. "You know you can be in a big place like this but the customers are not satisfied with the services," she said. "So for me, I must make sure the customers get value of their money. Everything you see here is my dream come true. I have always been aspiring to do this and I put all my efforts and mind to bring this out." Edited by T Jalio
