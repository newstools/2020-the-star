Nigerian singer, songwriter Fireboy DML, dubbed the ‘future of Afrobeats’, is back with a new banger, ‘New York City Girl’, via YBNL Nation/Empire. He is famed for the hit song ‘Vibration’. Following the success of his debut album Laughter, Tears and Goosebumps, Fireboy teamed up with Type-A for the new single ‘New York City Girl’, a mid-tempo, feel-good record that blends R&B and Afrobeats to bring out his unique self-coined Afro-Life sound. It talks about a whirlwind love affair with a girl from New York he met while on vacation in Lagos, Nigeria. Written during the global lockdown, it explores the feeling of missing the physical connection with a loved one and longing for the day they will see each other again. It is the first single from his much-anticipated sophomore project 'Apollo' scheduled for release later this year.
