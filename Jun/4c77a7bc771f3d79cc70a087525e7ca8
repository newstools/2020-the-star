Those who have planted eucalyptus trees along river banks in Vihiga county have  five years to uproot them. Governor Wilber Ottichilo made the announcement on Friday, saying the period is enough to remove all eucalyptus trees and plant them away from water bodies. He spoke in Evoje, Sabatia subcounty, during World Environment Day, when he led the planting of five million tree seedlings across the county. The county chief urged Vihiga residents to plant more indigenous trees, saying  some of them have medicinal value and can be interplanted with other crops. “We are not discrediting eucalyptus, but we don’t need them near water bodies because they cause more harm than good,” Ottichilo said. They are thirsty, draw a lot of water and grow fast, often drying streams. They are used for windbreaks and telephone poles. They can only be grown at least 50 metres from water. Ottichilo encouraged residents to plant bamboo, especially in wet lands, saying they preserve water catchments. The governor further said he has proposed to the county assembly to end sand harvesting near rivers in the county. “Sand harvesting within our rivers has contributed to water pollution and landslide,” Ottichilo said. He said landslides mostly affect Hamisi subcounty and parts of Maragoli. Edited by A.N
