In his speech on January 14, Uhuru directed changes to the collection structures for musicians, such that their royalties being raised to Sh2 billion per year. He instructed all content service providers to channel all payment of royalties through a single centrally-managed account at the Kenya Copyright Board.

In the agreement on Thursday, complying PSVs will receive a Certificate of Compliance from the Copyright Board after payment. NTSA will support the course by providing relevant data on all registered PSVs and their seating capacity.
