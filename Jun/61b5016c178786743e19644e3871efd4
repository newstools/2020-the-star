Police have been ordered to arrest three Nairobi county officials and present them in court to show cause why they should not be jailed for disobeying orders. Leboo Morintat, Allan Igambi and Halkano Waqo are to be presented in court on July 20. Morintat is the county secretary, Igambi the Finance executive while Waqo is the chief finance officer. The warrant for their arrest was issued by deputy registrar CA Muchoki on Wednesday. It must be executed by Central police police station OCS. The order was given after law firm of Koceyo & Company Advocates complained that the county government had failed to pay them Sh2.4 million legal fees despite a court order that same should be settled. In its application, the law firm had sought to compel the county executive member in charge of finance to pay Sh2.4 million with interest. On February 13, the court issued a show cause notice to the county officials to appear in person or by advocate. The court had indicated that if the county paid the money then its officials didn't have to appear in court on March 16. The county opposed the application, saying it was incompetent.Â It also denied that its officers had refused to satisfy the decretal amount. The county instead said that the national government had not provided adequate funds for it to settle any claims. Currently, the county has several outstanding decrees which it is unable to settle due to financial constraints. It can only be accountable for what it received from the national government, but it has not received any allocation to settle the claims, the court was told. Edited by Henry Makori
