You are the engine of county services, Vihiga Governor Wilber Ottichilo has told Ezekiel Ayiego, the newly recruited county secretary. Ayiego, a former high school principal, was sworn in, replacing Francis Ominde. He is expected to clear up widespread personnel problems. “With Ayiego, I am sure we will clear the mess that has been affecting us, more so from the county secretary’s office. Ayiego will help us on human capital. We are depending on his,vast administative experience in various schools," Otichillo said. "Help us be on record with our the human resources we have. It's quite a shame that in the entire county, we have no idea how many employees we have here," Ottichilo said. The immediate former principal of Chesamis Boys High School said his duties will be anchored on implementing the county strategic plan, maintaining effective collaboration and ensuring efficient  management of resources. Ottichilo further urged the incoming county secretary to look into job promotions, especially for long-serving staff members. “We urge you to develop a proper plan for carrying out promotions. Some staffers have worked for so long and have never been promoted. This has demoralised them and hurt service delivery," the governor said. Deputy Governor Patrick Saisi said, “Ayiego, don't work as a lone ranger. Where you are not sure, consult and make sure you are in line with your boss. Let him brief you to avoid collisions. "Gossipers are everywhere, learn to handl them," Saisi said. The ofice had been run on an acting basis by chief officer for trade Philip Gavuna. Ayiego will be on duty with county Public Service Board chair Ambassador Franklin Esipila and CEC for Public Service and Administration Pamela Kimwele. (Edited by V. Graham)
