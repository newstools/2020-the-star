Kenyans have been urged to use the  Nyumba Kumi reporting structures to ensure that there are no strangers coming into their homes. During a press briefing on Monday in Ol Kalou, Nyandarua, Health CS Mutahi has said this will help curb spread of the virus. He also reiterated that only those patients with mild cases of Covid-19 and who are assessed not to pose the threat of spreading the virus will be released to seek home-based care. "By the time someone is allowed to go home, that person should not be able to transmit the coronavirus," Kagwe said. Kenya on Monday recorded 133 new  virus cases, bringing the total to 3,727. This out of 3,365 samples tested in the last 24 hours. A total of 180,701 tests have been done to date. A total of 33 more discharges were recorded, raising the recoveries to 1,286. However, one more patient has succumbed, raising the fatalities to 104.
