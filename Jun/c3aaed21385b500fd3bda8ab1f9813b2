Health CS Mutahi Kagwe has dismissed speculation the country will be fully reopened on Saturday, at the end of the extended curfew period. Kagwe said experts are still in consultation, looking at modelling to make a decision which will be tabled before the President. "Nobody has spoken about reopening. Not in the form that we might understand. This is something that is still being looked at," he said. This comes after President Uhuru Kenyatta on Saturday hinted of a possible lifting of the lockdown and dusk - dawn curfew soon. Speaking in State House Uhuru said, "Time will come when we shall open Kenya, when that time comes, responsibility will be yours". "I have told my Cabinet Secretaries that we cannot stay in lockdown forever. But if we open up the country by lifting the restrictions and the virus continues to spread, it will be our fault for not taking the precautions outlined," he said. Kagwe, however, noted that some of the areas under lockdown could be opened, but will only become clear once the decision has been made. He was speaking at Afya House during the daily Covid-19 briefing where he announced 124 more virus cases. The country's total number of infection cases now stands at 2,340. Of the new cases Mombasa had (40), Nairobi (38), Busia (26), Kajiado (6),Kiambu (3), Garissa (2), and Taita Taveta (2) , Muranga and Elgeyo Marakwet had (1) case each.
