Embattled Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru is likely to survive the impeachment after a special Senate Committee reportedly cleared her of all the charges. Sources in the 11-member panel chaired by Kakamega Senator Cleophas Malala has disclosed that the committee has dismissed all the charges levelled against the county chief by the MCAs. The committee concluded that the assembly did not substantiate the claims as they failed to directly link the governor with any of the particular allegations. "None of the accounts was directly linked to the governor. However, we have recommended to EACC and DCI to investigate the particular charges and the officers involved," the source said. The committee will table its report in the chamber on Friday. According to the County Government Act, if a majority of the committee members - six out of the 11- reject the charges, the impeachment shall stand defeated and the matter shall not be subjected to further debate on the floor. Waiguru faced two broad charges of gross violation of the Constitution by failing to deliver the state of the county address in the county assembly ; and abuse of office by unsurping powers of accounting officer, an act that amounted to violation of Public Procurement and Asset Disposal Act. The MCAs claimed that the governor has been in charge of a corrupt county tendering policy. She appointed her aides and confidants to county tender evaluation Committees to award tenders to her preferred bidders, they claimed. But Waiguru dismissed the allegations as innuendos, hearsay and propaganda propagated by powerful and influential individuals both in and out of the county who are not happy with her support for the Handshake between President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM boss Raila Odinga Speaking at the close of the impeachment hearings on Wednesday, she implored the committee to thoroughly and carefully scrutinise the evidence and dismiss those unsubstantiated.
