Jubilee officials in Murang’a county want leaders dissatisfied with President Uhuru Kenyatta’s leadership to leave the party. They cited Kiharu MP Ndindi Nyoro and his Kandara counterpart Alice Wahome, whom they accused of openly insulting the President and undermining his vision for the country. Branch chairman Simon Gikuru said a delegates meeting will be convened to discuss how the two MPs will be disciplined. Gikuru said it is important for any leader elected through a particular party to respect its leadership and adhere to its constitution. “If the MPs feel uncomfortable with the President’s leadership, they are free to leave the party and join one whose leadership they will be comfortable with,” the chairman said. He said a similar thing befell the late Kenneth Matiba when he was expelled from the ruling party in 1988 after falling out with then-President Daniel Moi. This was after he resigned as Transport and Communications minister in protest against mismanaged party elections. Ndindi recently said they will not be intimidated by threats of being removed from their committees. The party had earlier removed several senators allied to Deputy President William Ruto from their committees and other key positions over their ‘defiance’. Ndindi said Jubilee could not have formed the government without the help of DP Ruto. Gikuru, who was accompanied Murang’a MCAs at Kenol town on Monday during a press briefing, said Ndindi and Wahome would not be allowed to continue making insulting pronouncements against the President. Kimorori MCA Amos Murigi questioned why the MPs have continued to cling onto the party despite their heavy criticism against it. Makuyu MCA Stanley Mburu asked Governor Mwangi wa Iria and Woman Representative Sabina Chege to provide guidance on the matter. Mburu said the party should expel anyone who disrespects its leadership to set precedence. Other leaders present were MCAs Samuel Wamwea  (Ng’araria) and Charles Mwangi (Ichagaki). Edited by A.N
