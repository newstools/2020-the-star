Lamu flood victims are demanding compensation from the Kenya Electricity Generating Company. They blame KenGen for flooding and want the KenGen parastatal to settle them in a safe place. More than 3,000 people were displaced after their homes were flooded following the bursting of the Tana River and Nyongoro River banks. The worst affected villages are Chalaluma, Dide Waride and Moa in Witu, Lamu West. The others are Mkunumbi, Hongwe, Marafa, Jericho, Jipendeni, Salama, Lumshi, Zebra, Juhudi, Sinambio, Mavuno and Amkeni. The residents say their villages were safe until the construction of KenGen dams upstream at Masinga, Kindaruma, Kiambere, Gitaru and Kamburu. The dams are filled to capacity, hence the flooding downstream after rivers overflowed their banks. But the powert generator says it is not responsible for the villagers' suffering. The floods were a result of normal flow of water from the dams, KenGen's chief communications officer Grace Chepkwony said during a recent visit to flood victims in Tana River. The villagers are also seeking compensation for their destroyed crops and livestock. Community leader Galgalo Jara said ever since the dams were opened, residents of Lamu and Tana River have never known peace. They are in dire need of food, water, medicine and tents. “We know this problem wasn’t here until the KenGen dams were opened. All we want is compensation for all we have lost and to be resettled,” Jara said. Lamu Woman Representative  Ruweida Obbo said a bill has been prepared to force KenGen to compensate the flood victims. “There is a Bill that we have already presented to Parliament for those affected by flooding to be compensated. It’s in order because these floods were caused by their decision to open their dams. They must compensate and provide settlements for these people,” Obbo said. - mwaniki fm
