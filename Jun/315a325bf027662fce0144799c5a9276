Wajir Governor Mohamed Abdi on Tuesday welcomed the President’s post-coronavirus economic recovery plan. The economy has been driven to its knees as a result of measures taken to slow the spread of the coronavirus. Thousands of Kenyans have lost their jobs and most businesses are struggling to stay afloat. President Uhuru Kenyatta last Saturday announced a Sh53.7 billion eight-point economic stimulus programme. Speaking to the press in Wajir town, Abdi said Kenyans will overcome the challenge. The virus hit the country as it was contending with flooding and a desert locust invasion. Abdi said lack of resources to address these disasters has slowed down work in other critical sectors of the economy. He said they have lessened the effects of floods and locusts as a result of timely response. Abdi said his government will support facilitation of schools with e-learning equipment. Among the measures put in place by the county to fight the pandemic include engaging 1,000 community health volunteer across all villages, who are paid a monthly stipend of Sh5,000. Wajir has also established county and subcounty emergency response committees which meet frequently to monitor and review the level of preparedness. Wajir has so far recorded 17 Covid-19 cases and 10 recoveries. Edited by Frank Obonyo
