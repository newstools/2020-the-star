Restaurants are only allowed to operate until 4pm, despite extension of the dusk-to-dawn curfew to 9pm till 4am, the government has said. Making the announcement on Friday, director of Public Health Francis Kuria said this directive shall remain while the ministry consults on a way forward. Kuria noted that after President Uhuru Kenyatta extended the curfew last Saturday, some restaurants took it upon themselves to extend their operating hours to as late as 10pm with some serving alcohol as the main 'dish'. "The president extended curfew time for those who want to do meaningful business do it. As a ministry we are reviewing the protocols in use for the operations of eateries and restaurants and will be released to the public in due course," he said. Further, Kuria said that police officers have  been instructed to crack down on those flouting this directive. He reiterated that that facilities found failing to adhere to  any of the Covid-19 regulations will have their permits permanently withdrawn. Earlier Friday morning, restaurant operators through the Pubs, Entertainment and Restaurants Association of Kenya (PERAK) urged the government to extend their allowed operation time by four hours to 8pm. Their petition was made by officials through a press briefing on Friday. They claimed extension of the national dusk-to-dawn curfew to 9pm should be accompanied by an extension of restaurant opening hours to at least 8 pm. “We request to be allowed to operate up to at most 8pm, as our operators have their own arrangements for staff accommodation and transport, which means that curfew hours will be observed,” PERAK patron Patrick Muya said.
