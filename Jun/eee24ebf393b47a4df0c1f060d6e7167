Governor Anne Waiguru has suffered a blow in her bid to have several documents filed by the Kirinyaga County Assembly expunged from the senate records in her impeachment case. This after the 11-member Senate Committee probing charges against the governor declined to grant her request to expunge the documents. The governor's Lawyer Paul Nyamodi wanted theÂ documents containing four witness statements struck out arguing that they contain new evidence. This, he said, is contrary to Standing Order 19. Nyamodi had sought an entry of one more person to help in the arrangement and Management of the bundles of defense documents. However, the committee said the documents shall remain saying that their admissibility will be argued out during the course of hearing Kirinyaga County Assembly lawyer Ndegwa Njiru sought the committee's intervention to obtain Waiguru's diplomatic and ordinary passport to help sustain a charge against the Governor. The lawyer also sought a visible document related to payment of an imprest to the Governor. Apart from Nyamondi, Waiguru's lawyers also includes her husband Kamotho Waiganjo. The governor was accused of abuse of office, gross misconduct, and manipulating the public procurement procedures. She is also accused of illegally conferring a benefit of Sh10 million to herself for travel allowance. The Kirinyaga County Assembly will argue its case before the committee on Tuesday. On Wednesday, the governor will take the stand to defend herself against the particular allegations advanced for her impeachment. The 11- member committee will immediately retreat to scrutinise the submissions and file a report. The report shall be tabled on the floor on Friday. Should the committee find any of the allegations to be valid, it will uphold the MCAs decision to remove the governor. The decision shall be subjected to a vote on the floor. However, should the majority of the member dismiss the allegation, the case shall have been defeated.
