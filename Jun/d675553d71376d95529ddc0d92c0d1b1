The Senate Business Committee last Friday recommended an 11-member committee to investigate charges levelled against impeached Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru. The proposal is subject to approval by the plenary this Tuesday afternoon. The House will decide whether to go the committee way or reject the proposal altogether and have the governor defend herself before the whole House. Here is the list of committee members: Senator Abshiro Halake, Michael Mbito, Mwangi Paul Githiomi, Beth Mugo, Anuar Liotiptip, Philip Mpaayei, Cleophas Malala, Beatrice Kwamboka, Stewart Madzayo, Judith Pareno and Moses Kajwang. The High Court last Thursday declined to nullify the impeachment of  Waiguru. Justice Weldon Korir last Thursday declined to overturn the impeachment, ruling that the county assembly had proved it did not violate any court orders. Judge Korir had barred the MCAs from tabling the motion in April because Waiguru had argued that because of Covid-19, she could not leave her home. The governor told the court that she had a pre-existing medical condition that had forced her not to leave the house so she could not go to the assembly. Justice Korir had further ruled that the court cannot interfere with the MCAs' mandate but because of Covid-19, he had to intervene for Waiguru's rights not be violated. Waiguru had challenged the impeachment motion that led to her removal from office. In an amended application filed in court on Tuesday — the day she was impeached — Waiguru wanted the court to declare the whole process illegal. “…a declaration that the proceedings commenced by the county assembly in respect of the impeachment motion during the subsistence of the order issued on April 7 are null,” court documents read.
