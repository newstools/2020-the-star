With restrictions still in place as the government seeks to contain the spread of coronavirus, sports remains in limbo with no team training and no matches until further notice. What this has meant is that the income of players has plummeted with many clubs not getting any revenue.The government gratefully recently gave sportsmen around the country a monthly stipend of 10,000 to cushion them from the effects of coronavirus. Unluckily Posta Rangers were not among the Kenyan Premier League clubs listed to benefit and as such their players have been greatly affected financially. Defender Humphrey Okot has now resorted to doing manual jobs in projects around his Huruma Estate residence commissioned by Nairobi Water and Sewerage Company to plug the financial gap and pay his bills. “It’s been tough for us but we have to do what we can to put food on the table, pay rent and other amenities while ensuring we stick to the strict government restrictions,” said Okot. The defender had been helping clear drainage systems in Kiamaiko where hundreds of goat and sheep are slaughtered daily and hygiene in the area has to be of the highest standards. “We have also been helping in water connectivity. It’s a short term contract but it will suffice at the moment,” he said. Posta coach Sammy Omollo confirmed his team were not a beneficiary of the government COVID-19 fund but revealed they had applied to be considered. “We did not receive anything but the management appealed and we await the outcome,” he said.
