 Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua has urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to extend the nationwide night curfew because it has reduced crime. The President first announced a dusk-to-dawn curfew in March to curb the spread of coronavirus and has since extended it three times. The latest extension will lapse on July 6. Speaking outside his office in Machakos on Monday, Mutua said crime rate has drastically reduced in the region since the curfew was imposed. Mutua said Machakos has become safer and that cases of insecurity have gone down because law offenders are afraid of being caught out at night. “I must applaud the low crime rate being experienced across the county occasioned by the national curfew. Since the start of curfew, crime rate has dropped drastically during this Covid-19 period. Machakos has never been this safe,” Mutua said. The governor was speaking after a meeting with the county security committee. He urged President Kenyatta to consider extending the curfew to curb crime. “While discussions are underway on the opening of the economy, I ask His Excellency President Uhuru Kenyatta to consider extending the curfew so that we can continue enjoying the peace and tranquillity we are currently experiencing,” Mutua said. The governor urged residents not to hide crime suspects or conceal information from the police and instead report them for improved security. “Security instruments are a critical component of our well-being, therefore, I would like to call on all citizens to work together with local authorities and police, to report unusual activities within the community, that way we protect our lives and property,” he said. He said police should be immediately notified about any suspicious individuals. “Let us notify the local chief or the police of new people in your vicinity. This is your civic duty that will go a long way in helping our community to remain safe from Covid-19,” he said.  Edited by P.O
