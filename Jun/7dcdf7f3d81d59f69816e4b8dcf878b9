A police officer on Monday night was hacked to death by a gang of panga-wielding thugs in Tchundwa village in Lamu. Constable Rodgers Odhiambo, who is attached to the Tchundwa police post in Lamu East, was accosted as he walked out of a shop in the village at around 8.30pm. He is the second police officer to be killed from the same station after a similar murder last October. The incident was confirmed by Lamu county commissioner Irungu Macharia, who said the officer suffered cut wounds to his forehead, neck and limbs. The officer who was in civilian clothes and unarmed as he was not on duty at the time is believed to have bled to death. Police are investigating the motive behind the ruthless killing. “I was informed of the unfortunate attack last night by a local administrator. The officer was leaving a shop when the gang pounced on him with knives and machetes. They left him bleeding at the scene. He was attached to Tchundwa post. We are investigating the incident,” Macharia said. A team of officers and detectives led by county commander Moses Murithi were already on the ground for investigations. “The county security committee will be meeting this morning to discuss how the continued attacks on police officers in Tchundwa will be addressed,” he said. The murder of Constable Odhiambo comes nine months after his colleague Hesborn Okemwa, who was attached to the same post, was lured to his death by an unknown gang on October 2, 2019. His badly mutilated body was recovered several meters inside a mangrove forest in Kizingitini on October 5. The officer’s G3 rifle that was loaded with 60 bullets has never been recovered to date.
