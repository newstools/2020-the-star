The Vihiga government has started reviving its cooperatives to create more than 2,000 jobs and business opportunities. Cooperatives chief officer Agava Makhumbili said on Saturday they have already profiled all the cooperatives in Vihiga county for capacity building and technical support. “Since the outbreak of Covid-19, most of our youth have been rendered jobless and our aim is to have about 2,000 youth employed,” Makhumbili said during a tour of Emuhaya Soya Farmers Cooperative in Esiarambatsi, North East Bunyore, in Emuhaya subcounty. Agava said Soya Farmers Cooperative has 180 members. Some of the Soya products manufactured by the cooperative include soya yoghurt, soya fresh milk, soya mandazi, soya nuts, soya dairy and chicken feeds among others. The eight-year-old Soya Farmers Cooperative has been struggling to stay afloat. “Lack of capacity to produce on large-scale and marketing of our products has been a major blow to members,” the cooperative chairman Tom Omulando said.
