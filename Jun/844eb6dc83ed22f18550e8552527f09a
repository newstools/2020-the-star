  Inmates at Kamiti and Kiambu prisons willing to change their pleas, mentions will now do so virtually after the Law Society of Kenya donated computers and webcams to facilitate the process. The inmates have had a challenge with the progress of their cases since Covid-19 broke out because of restrictions to court appearances. Most of the cases have been postponed. Beth Fundi, LSK chairperson for Kiambu, said the prison requested for assistance to have the inmates' cases heard. Fundi spoke on Tuesday at the Kiambu G.K Prison during the handing over of the computers and webcams. “We have had meetings with court users and we have resolved that some cases which do not require physical appearance in court can be done virtually,” Fundi said. Fundi said some cases can be conducted virtually without going to the courtroom and it will help in also easing the backlog. “Our clients also have rights to be heard and the more they are being held inside without their cases being dealt with, the more there will be a backlog and virtual means will ease this burden,” she said. Samuel Mugo, officer in charge of Kiambu G.K Prison, said the inmates were faced with challenges, with cases postponed because of lack of technology for virtual hearings. Mugo said that the inmates missed their loved ones since visits to the prison has been restricted and they lacked basic needs like soap and toiletries. “The Covid-19 situation has had major effects on the inmates since we are not allowing visitation, and they need basic things from well-wishers  who have been streaming in with help,” Mugo said. The LSK also donated tissue paper, face masks and soaps to the inmates. Kiambu senior principal magistrate Stella Atambo said the courts have put in place measures to have the cases heard virtually.
