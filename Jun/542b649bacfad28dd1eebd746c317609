Police officers who brutalise members of the public will only have themselves to blame when they are sacked and prosecuted, Laikipia East Officer Commanding Station has warned. “Don’t brutalise anybody if you love your job. Just play your part and leave the rest to God,” PK Macharia said. "Work smart and stay safe. None of us loves associating with people in trouble. The earlier you know, the better for you," the OCS said on Wednesday in a signal to his officers. Macharia told them to observe the rule of law and respect and treat Kenyans with dignity. “Remember that neither you nor your (relatives) have shares in the police service." The signal was titled Police Brutality. Two weeks ago, Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang'i warned police officers against brutality, adding that they will individually be held responsible. Matiang'i issued the warning after a closed-door meeting he held with representatives of the civil society concerned about the government's commitment to the rule of law. The meeting followed demonstrations in Nairobi after the killing of more than 15 by the police while enforcing the curfew and regulations associated with Covid-19. Scores of others are nursing serious injuries. Macharia reminded the officers: “Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang'i has declared war on rogue police officers following a closed door meeting with high ranking government officials and civil society groups concerned by increasing cases of police brutality in the country.” Last week, the Independent Policing Oversight Authority disclosed that it had received 87 complaints against the police since the curfew and heightened security measures were rolled out on March 27. Ipoa warned that officers found culpable will be prosecuted. - mwaniki fm
