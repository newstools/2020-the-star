The number of people in need of food aid in Othaya has doubled from 2,000 to 4,000 during the coronavirus pandemic, area MP and an administrator have said. Othaya MP Gichuki Mugambi and deputy county commissioner Henry Ochako  said many people who lost their jobs after the government announced stringent measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus have depleted their food reserves and the little savings they had. Ochako said the number is increasing as many people were caught unawares by the pandemic. Mugambi said families that used to receive monetary aid from relatives working in towns outside Othaya, like Nairobi and the diaspora, no longer get help as the crisis has affected almost every sector in the country and across the world. “We had some areas within Othaya where we do tea farming, and they also had very limited hours to work. But now we thank the government because of the extension of working hours, and I am sure now most of the farmers will be able to feed their families,” the MP said. He was referring to the 7pm to 5am curfew that had been imposed by the government, but has now been extended from 9pm to 4am. Those in need of help include people who work in sectors that are yet to be reopened, such as bars. He said Othaya has 245 bars and they employ a big number of people. “Those are opportunities lost, and we know those people are ready to work, but they have nowhere to work. Therefore, we have to support them,” he said. Gichuki said as the government continues to ease controls, people should also reciprocate by being disciplined. People should keep social distance, wear masks and sanitise or wash their hands regularly with soap and running water, he said. The lawmaker urged residents to eat a balanced diet and exercise their bodies to boost their immunity.  Edited by A.N
