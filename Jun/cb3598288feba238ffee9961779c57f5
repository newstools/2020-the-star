A parliamentary committee has given the Lands ministry until July to automate revenue systems to seal the loopholes in the collection of levies. National Assembly Lands Committee chairperson Rachael Nyamai (Kitui South MP) on Tuesday said the digital revenue collection system must be sped up to reduce leakages. “The collection by the ministry can surpass Sh11 billion. We have given them a deadline when to stop cash collections. The deadline is July 2020,” Nyamai said in Parliament. Nyamai said that the Lands ministry can collect a lot more money through automation. Lands CS Farida Karoney on Wednesday told the Star on the phone that an electronic register will help cut off brokers. “Once the system is in place July, it will address most of the issues the committee has raised,” she said. Karoney said payment of government taxes will be tracked as records of transactions will be available. "Cash is prone to fraud," she said. The CS said once the new system is up and running, the ministry will be in a better position to know how much it generates from stamp duties, rent, among others. The move by the ministry is meant to limit the interaction of lands officials with clients as much as possible to limit cases of corruption. The committee also raised concerns that the National Land Commission was using 80 per cent of the allocated money towards personnel emoluments. Nyamai said the new commissioners must strategise on how to cut such spending. “We have engaged them and the ministry is willing to take back employees from NLC that the commission does not need in the same terms and conditions so that they do not lose their jobs,” Nyamai said.
