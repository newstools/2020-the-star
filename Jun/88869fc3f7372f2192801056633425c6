A community led by former gang members who had turned their lives are confronting a torrential Nairobi river. The river has burst its banks and is surging over the gabions they installed in a stretch just below the bridge that links Korogocho to Dandora.. "This is happening right now due to heavy rain. And it is still raining,” said leader Fredrick Okinda at 730 pm on Saturday. The group fears devastation of the park they have built, which has won awards and been a God send to children in the community. Komb Green is a community based organisation formed by reformed youths whose main agenda is to rehabilitate Nairobi River and to green the riparian land. Their urban farming might also be destroyed. “This is why we need to add more gabions,” Okinda said. It is going to be a long night for these men.
