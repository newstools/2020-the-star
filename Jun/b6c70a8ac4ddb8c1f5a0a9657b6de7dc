Hospital administrator Eston Mbuthia urged parents to monitor their children and ensure that any slight change in their health is noted and addressed, especially during the cold season. The administrator further cautioned residents against purchasing over-the-counter drugs without a prescription. “Avail yourself and the children who are not feeling well in any of the primary health institutions so that they can be attended to by professionals," Mbuthia said. There are three level 5 hospitals in Kiambu county (Thika, Gatundu and Kiambu), 13 level 4, 24 level 3 and 70 dispensaries. The Kiambu government recently said Tigoni Hospital will exclusively be a Covid-19 facility for the duration of the virus. All in-patients who had been admitted to the hospital were transferred to other county facilities. County director of Meteorological Services Madgalene Gateri has also advised residents to wear warm clothes during this cold season and to continue tending their farms so they can boost their food reserves for domestic consumption and for sale.
