Four staffers working at State House have tested positive for the coronavirus, spokesperson Kanze Dena has said. President Uhuru Kenyatta and the First family are free of the virus, she said. In a statement on Monday, Dena said, "During last week's mass Covid-19 testing held on Thursday, 11th June 2020, four (4) persons were found to have contracted the disease." The infected officers were admitted at the Kenyatta University Teaching, Referral and Research Hospital in Kiambu County for treatment. Families and close contacts of the affected officers are also being attended to accordingly. The cases follow a mass testing exercise that was conducted at State House on Thursday last week. "As part of proactive measures being implemented to contain the spread of Covid-19, State House staff are regularly tested for the disease. The tests are conducted on all staff including His Excellency the President and members of his family," Dena said. She said to strengthen Covid-19 containment measures, extra access protocols for State House staff residing outside the compound and visitors have been rolled out. "State House would also like to remind Kenyans that every person is at risk of contracting Covid-19. No one is immune to the disease," Dena said. She said all Kenyans must fully adhere to the Covid-19 containment protocols as set out by the Ministry of Health. Earlier ODM leader Raila Odinga had announced that he took the test and his results had come out negative.
