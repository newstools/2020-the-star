Foundation Move Up recently partnered with Jua Cali and Enkare foundations to celebrate the menstrual day in Mathare in a door-to-door food and sanitary towels distribution to the vulnerable. Reuben of Foundation Move Up said, "During this Covid-19 time, we are especially focusing on providing food for the less privileged in our community. "We are also helping restore dignity of girls and women by providing them with menstrual hygiene classes and giving out period cups."
