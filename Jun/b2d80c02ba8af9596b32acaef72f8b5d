The Meru county assembly has passed a Sh10.2 billion budget for 2020-21. Budget and Appropriations Committee chairman Julius Mbijiwe (Mwangathia) said they expect Sh8.1 billion from the equitable allocation from the National Treasury, Sh220 million from Facility Increment Fund and Sh600 million from licences and other revenues. Mbijiwe said Sh705 million will be conditional grants from the national government and Sh669 million from development partners. “We allocated the money according to departments,” he said. Health got the lion's share at Sh3.3 billion. Of the amount, Sh2.4 billion will go towards salaries, Sh400 million towards goods and services and Sh548 million for development. Mbijiwe said they allocated Sh300 million for repair of roads, Sh60 million towards drilling of boreholes and Sh60 million for distribution of water through purchase of pipes and other equipment. “We have allocated Sh80 million to youth empowerment through the Meru Youth Service and other programmes.” The County Public Service Board got Sh24 million. Veterinary services was allocated Sh15 million to improve milk delivery. He said after receiving a memorandum from university students on difficulties they face paying fees, they allocated Sh2 million for varsity bursaries. The county has allocated Sh50 million to fight Covid-19 after receiving Sh100 million from the national government. The budget was passed unopposed. Majority leader David Karithi (Athwana) said medical workers should work hard to improve services as they have been allocated the largest share. Minority leader Ayub Bundi (Abothuguchi Central) said county workers have accumulated unpaid statutory deductions which ought to be paid before entering the new year. He questioned why the budget for their salaries was low yet the number of employees had increased in the last two years. “The arithmetic to allocate 30 per cent toward paying of salaries and 70 per cent towards development is not achievable in this scenario as we have a 47 per cent wage bill. We could do 35 per cent development and 65 per cent for salaries,” Bundi said. He said there will be Sh220 million pending bills in 2019-20 on top of Sh974 million pending in 2018-19 due to lack of supplementary budgets. Edited by R.Wamochie
