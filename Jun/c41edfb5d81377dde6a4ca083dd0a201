US President Donald Trump met with his top campaign advisers on Thursday amid polls showing his tumbling prospects for re-election as the U.S. economy suffers from a global pandemic and protesters gather in cities across the country. Two sources familiar with the meeting said Trump summoned campaign chairman Brad Parscale, White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, senior adviser Jared Kushner, deputy campaign manager Bill Stepien and pollster Tony Fabrizio. Trump was described by one source as frustrated as he struggles to respond to a crushing set of problems, most recently protests resulting from the death last week in police custody of African American man George Floyd in Minneapolis. Internal campaign polls mirror public polls showing Trump losing his re-election battle at this moment against Democrat Joe Biden, the source said.
