Tanzanian comedian Idris Sultan spent nights behind bars after being arrested and charged with cybercrime last month. He was arrested for laughing at a throwback photo of Tanzanian President John Pombe Magufuli. He was also charged with owning and using a sim card that wasn’t registered in his name. Sultan is now back and active on social media and in his first message, he promised to be bigger and better. “I know how many times I have made you go through tough times, I have made many sad, many mad and many cried all because they loved me too much,” he said. “I cannot promise to be different but I can promise to be bigger and better. I love you and thank you for the great strength you give me. Asanteni sana 😍.” The comedian has also signed a new deal with a betting company.
