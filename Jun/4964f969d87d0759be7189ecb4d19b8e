The organisation that represents the recorded music industry worldwide has opened its first regional office in sub-Saharan Africa in Kenya. The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry will have an office in Nairobi headed by the newly appointed regional director, Angela Ndambuki. She will work across the region’s 46 countries to promote the value of recorded music, campaign for the rights of record producers and expand the commercial uses of recorded music. Ndambuki is looking forward to working on strengthening the copyright industry in sub-Saharan Africa. "Both in policy and operations, especially in light of the Africa Continental Free Trade Area,” she said. She is the former CEO of the Performers’ Rights Society of Kenya, a collective management organisation licensed by the Kenya Copyright Board to represent performers in copyright and related rights works. Ifpi CEO Frances Moore said sub-Saharan Africa has an incredibly exciting and diverse music landscape. "The opening of our office in Nairobi demonstrates Ifpi’s focus and commitment to sub-Saharan Africa and will enable us to better champion issues affecting the local recording industry," he said. He thanked Rob Hooijer, saying his work as the regional coordinator helped them expand their presence in the region and laid the groundwork for the opening of their office in sub-Saharan Africa. "We look forward to continuing our cooperation with him,” Moore said. Ndambuki takes on the regional role immediately, moving on from her position as CEO at the Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry. The KNCCI is Kenya’s nationwide trade lobby and a member of the International Chambers of Commerce. According to IFPI’s recently released Global Music Report, in 2019, recorded music industry revenues for Africa and the Middle East grew by 15.9 per cent to $101 million (Sh101 billion).
