KTN news anchor Ben Kitili and his wife Amina Mude are separating. This was announced by Amina on social media over the weekend. “Hey, good people. Some of you have noticed that I have deleted all my relationship pictures on Instagram. Thank you for the concerns,” she wrote. “I just want to clear the air before you start reading some headlines. Ben and I are currently separated. “I don’t know what the future holds but I am grateful for the beautiful memories and definitely the beautiful kids we made. “It has been one month of pain and tears, but I know that one day the light will shine.” The two got married in November 2018 in a private wedding officiated at the AG's office. Later they held a private celebration that was only attended by very close family and friends at the Panari Hotel. Ben had proposed to Amina in 2015. After their wedding, Kitili shared a photo of his wedding ring on social media and wrote, "There comes a time." Last year, in a Q&A session with her fans on Instagram, Amina said marrying someone from a different religion (she is Muslim, him Christian) wasn’t easy for her parents to approve. "They approved but it wasn't so easy. Religion wasn’t an issue to me. Ben is such an awesome guy, so things just clicked," she said. "If you find a guy who loves you and adores you, fight for him. The rules of love are not cast on stone." Amina is a Vlogger and an advocate for healthy living. The two are blessed with two kids.
