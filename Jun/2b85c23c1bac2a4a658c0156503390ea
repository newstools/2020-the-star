Four people were on Monday charged with impersonating Karen Hospital procurement officers and fraudulently obtaining Sh4.7 million medical equipment from a private company. John Orimba, Rachel Mwaura, Mercy Nyawira and Ian Adama Owino pleaded not guilty before Kibera senior principal magistrate Charles Mwaniki. Each was released on a bond of Sh2 million or a cash bail of Sh100,000 each. The charge sheet said the four, with others not before the court, obtained Sh4,752,826 equipment from Megascope Healthcare Limited between April 20 and May at an unknown location in Kenya. It said they obtained medical equipment by falsely pretending they were procurement employees from the Karen Hospital, a fact they knew to be false. They were charged with 14 other counts, including obtaining goods by using forged documents and making documents without authority. The charge sheet said they forged a DTB bank cheque for Sh67,434 dated May 12 and purporting to be from Karen Hospital. It bore account number 003025911 and serial number 02055. They were also charged with writing Standard Chartered Bank cheques. The four suspects were also charged with making a document, L.P.O. NO.04938, dated May 12 for 1,117,867, purporting to be a genuine document issued by Karen Hospital. John Orimba alone was charged with handling stolen goods. The count said on June 11 at Mediflon Enterprises Limited on Murangâ€™a Road in Nairobi within Twiga Towers he retained healthcare equipment knowing or having reason to believe they were stolen. The case will be mentioned on July 7. (Edited by V. Graham)
