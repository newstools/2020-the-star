Kakamega Woman Representative Elsie Muhanda has appealed to parents to stay close to their children and guide them during the coronavirus pandemic to avoid pregnancies. Speaking in Kakamega on Sunday, Muhanda decried the alarming moral decay among schoolchildren, with a good number of girls indulging in early sex and marriage. “Learning starts at home and every child has a right to acquire parental education. I have observed with pain as I move around Kakamega that our children are engaging in sexual activity and some even from primary school are getting married,” the MP said. Muhanda urged parents to keep a close eye on their children, especially the girls, keep them busy with school work and other chores, and teach them family values. “We don’t want by the time the coronavirus curve flattens in a few months to count very many corona babies from our children,” she stated. The legislator told the Ministry of Education that many parents from remote villages across the country don’t own smartphones, making it difficult for their children to adopt e-learning. When schools reopen, learning should begin where it stopped when Covid-19 struck, she added. Muhanda also urged the committee put in place by President Uhuru Kenyatta to chart the way forward concerning churches reopening to expedite the process. “This is where we run to when we have problems, and again churches play a very important role in our children’s upbringing,” she said.
