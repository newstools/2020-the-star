The Ministry of Health is urging Kenyans to have a mask on when in public to curb the spread of Covid-19. But that face mask has to be worn properly. However, a man charged with assault appeared in court with two masks, one on his forehead and the other on his mouth. "What is wrong with you? Put on the face mask well," the magistrate told him amid laughter from the court attendants. He refused and it took police intervention for him to wear it properly. He also had  two different types of shoes both worn out. A man pleaded guilty for assaulting his wife but had an explanation for it to the magistrate. "I assaulted him as a punishment because she slept with our caretaker. I, however, ask for forgiveness,"the man told a Nairobi court. He offered the explanation even before the charges were read, and the prosecutor had to tell him to wait until the facts were read to him. It is alleged that he came back from work and found his wife cooking . He asker her if he the caretaker had become her second husband before beating her up The matter pushed to Monday after a probation report is filed in court. Some Senior city lawyers caused drama at a Nairobi court  after they entered the court panting and sweating after a tough day engaging in a hide and seek game with DCI officers. Soon after they arrived, they complained to a Kibera court that the DCI officers had been escaping with their client from court to court and requested for some 15 minutes before the case proceeded,  perhaps after seeing their client present in the Dock. They later convinced the court after which the client was released.
