Starting July 1, filing of cases in all Nairobi courts will be done exclusively through an electronic system. Chief Justice David Maraga said increased use of technology in all Judiciary functions will achieve higher efficiency and convenience for stakeholders. In a press release, Judiciary Chief Registrar Ann Amadi said the Law Society of Kenya, Directorate of Public Prosecutions, the police and members of the public will be required to register themselves via an e-filing court portal to log into the system. They will be able to upload documents, assess court fees and submit files to the registry online. “Any computer or device that allows attachment of files will be sufficient to access the system and conduct the e-filing,” Amadi said. She affirmed that the system was already open for use and encouraged the public to familiarise themselves with it prior to the official launch by CJ Maraga in July. Since the outbreak of Covid-19 in March, the courts have increasingly used ICT platforms to conduct hearings and deliver judgments and rulings. Another forthcoming initiative is the launch of a court recording and transcription system initially in 32 courtrooms around the country. The Judiciary fully automated its operations in a shift set to speed up resolution of court cases as well as stop revenue leakage in March. Lawyers and other litigants were required to file and track their cases in courts across the country electronically. Payment for court services were also automated in the directive. On Monday, the courts resumed normal operations after a two-month break as a result of the Covid-19 outbreak. Edited by Henry Makori
