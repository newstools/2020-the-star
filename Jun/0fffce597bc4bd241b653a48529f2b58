A drop has been recorded in the number of coronavirus patients at Msambweni Subcounty Referral Hospital in Kwale. Governor Salim Mvurya said out of 15 patients who were admitted to the Covid-19 unit, five have been discharged, six are under normal observation while four are under close observation. Mvurya said none of the patients is in critical condition. All of them are asymptomatic. “Apart from the first French patient who was airlifted to Nairobi, none has so far shown any weaknesses or required a ventilator to breathe, they are all strong,” he said. He said the majority of the new cases are truck drivers from Tanzania. By Monday, 64 samples were taken to the laboratories. Ten drivers tested positive and were sent back for treatment. Mvurya maintained that joint efforts from both county and national governments have helped in fighting the contagion. Kwale has 15 confirmed cases. The county boss emphasised that his administration will continue to observe strict measures to stop coronavirus from spreading. “Screening exercises have to go on at all our entrance and exit points and no one shall be granted smooth entry if they haven’t observed the public directives,” he said. At the same time, county commissioner Karuku Ngumo launched public awareness even as the national government ponders having asymptomatic patients get home-based care. He said people must prepare themselves in case such a move is officially approved by the government. “I urge people to get rid of stigma against victims who have recovered from coronavirus or have been exposed because a time shall come when they won’t be spending more time in hospitals but at home,” Ngumo said.
