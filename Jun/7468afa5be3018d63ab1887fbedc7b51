Vanessa Mdee has called it quits in the world of music, saying she was living a lie and it drove her into alcoholism and depression. "I just wanna be an advocate for honesty and beauty and being a sincere advocate for what facing your demons can do for you," she said. She was speaking on her podcast, 'Deep Dive with Vanessa Mdee'. Mdee said alcohol had taken over her life to an extent of not making firm decisions. "I became a person of horrible choices. I couldn't recognise myself anymore because I woke up every day trying to just get by and I donÂ´t want to just get by anymore," she said. "More than ever, I had moments of anxiety and moments of depression." Vanessa said she hid her addiction so well and she was living a lie.
