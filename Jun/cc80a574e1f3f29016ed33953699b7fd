 Gun owners have appealed to well-wishers to reach out to police officers with support, saying the cops are key front-line fighters in the war against coronavirus. National Gun Owners Association (NGAO) said police should be supported like any other frontline fighters. NGAO Kenya Covid-19 Response Committee secretary Julius Mumo said police officers ought to have the correct equipment and knowledge to fight the spread of the virus. Mumo spoke at Kanyonyoo Border Patrol Unit in Kitui where they trained 176 police officers on the fight against the spread of coronavirus. “We have so far trained over 4,600 police officers drawn from 26 counties and hope to reach out to all counties by the end of this month,” Mumo said. He decried shortage of resources like Personal Protective Equipment in most police stations which are key in fight against the pandemic. He asked well-wishers to help. Knyonyoo Border Patrol Unit acting deputy commandant Baraza Tanui lauded the exercise. He said the camp leadership has tried their best to issue its officers with some PPEs and ensuring they adhere to all set measures in the fight against Covid-19. “We ensure officers visiting the camp from outside and those from home undergo temperature testing,” Tanui said. He said some residents were hostile towards police officers sensitizing them on the need to adhere to health regulations to curb the spread of coronavirus. “While sensitising locals who come from very primitive zones, some run away from the officers as they still have ill motives against police,” he said.
