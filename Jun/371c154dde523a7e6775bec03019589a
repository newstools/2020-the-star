National basketball team coach Cliff Owuor hopes to introduce a new training schedule for Morans ahead of their Fiba Afro-basket qualifiers in November. Speaking yesterday during an online meeting with his players, Owuor urged the players to intensify their daily Individual training. He said he will send workouts via video to all the players who will then send it back for assessment and advice after completing the exercises. “I want everyone to be fit and therefore, I have come up with another training schedule for them. All players must be actively engaged so that by the time we start, they will be fit,” he said. Owuor said he will continue to explore and discuss all their three opponents with his players in a bid to take note of their strengths and weaknesses. Kenya will face off against former African champions Angola, Senegal and Mozambique in the two-leg qualifiers slated for November. “We discussed Angola at length since they remain the favourites. It also came to our attention that they have changed coaches and are in a transition,” said Owuor. Assistant captain Tyler Ongwae, who is based in Denmark, urged his team-mates to continue working hard on their trainings until the time when it is safe to play. “We will do all that we can until we get an all clear directive to resume play,” he said, adding: “When that time finally comes, we will be ready.” In attendance were assistant coaches Sadat Gaya and Carey Oketch as well as his diaspora players, Ongwae, Bush Wamukota (Rwanda) and Ariel Okal (Algeria).
