Bunyala South MCA Casper Ajuma has appealed to the national government to expedite the rehabilitation of Lower Nzoia Irrigation Project to control floods that have caused havoc in the area. Ajuma on Monday said that despite being awarded the Sh10 billion, Synohydro Construction Company has failed to complete the project three years down the line. He spoke at Bubango Primary School IDP camp in Budalang'i during the distribution of relief food to more than 800 flood victims. He said the majority of the flood victims currently camping in more than 63 IDP camps are from Bunyala South, having been forced out of their homes by raging floodwaters from River Nzoia and the backflow from Lake Victoria. He appealed to Budalang'i MP Raphael Wanjala to intervene as a matter of urgency and consult the relevant ministry so the stalled project can be completed. Juma, however, sought to assure the victims that the Busia government will provide them with 4,500 jembes and iron sheets to facilitate construction of 10,000 houses that were destroyed by floods.
