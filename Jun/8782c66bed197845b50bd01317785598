A magistrate's court has acquitted a KCB branch manager- Sayid Ibrahim- linked to the embezzlement of Sh26 million in Wajir county. Magistrate Teresia Murigi on Tuesday said evidence on record did not establish a case against Sayid. She also said there was no evidence to show Sayid benefited from the transaction of an overdraft. The court however found his co-accused has a case to answer. Magistrate Murigi put Ahmed Sahal Omar, Daud Abdullahi, Jeff Kithinji Mworia (all county officers) on their defence. The accused persons were in November 2018 charged with conspiring to defraud the county government of Sh26 million. During the hearing, Wajir Governor Mohamed Abdi Mohamud told the court that he did not issue any instructions for the withdrawal of Sh25 million that led to three of his county officials prosecuted over graft allegations. Mohamed said he was not aware of a request by the Finance CEC for an overdraft facility of Sh25 million to Kenya Commercial Bank Wajir branch. The request was in form of a letter and the overdraft was for payment of county employees and office expenses at Wajir.
