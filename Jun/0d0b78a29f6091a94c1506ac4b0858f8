Former Wasafi signee's Rich Mavoko did not pay a compensation fee when he left the label. His sister, Wenceslaus Dokii, revealed that his brother was asked by Diamond Platnumz to pay Tsh500 million (Sh23 million) to be allowed to terminate the contract with the label but they stood their ground and declined. Rich Mavoko's exit from WCB was a messy and noisy affair rather than a mutual one. This was after he expressed discontent with his contract, which he termed as "exploitative and malicious". “Walituambia tuwalipe pesa mob, nikamwambia Diamond, no we can’t pay you. It was millions of money inalingana kama ya Harmonize. Nilimwambia pia Sallam (Diamond’s manager), you guys nendeni mkajipekue mjitazame tena, hicho kitu mnachokitaka, is it fair?” Dokii said in a recent interview. When Harmonize asked to leave Wasafi last year, he was forced to part with the same amount. He reportedly sold his three houses and a piece of land to raise the money. The compensation was to allow him full rights ownership to the songs he did under WCB. For Mavoko, the tussles ended up at the Tanzania Music Regulatory Board, Basata, who helped both parties arrive at an amicable solution. Rich Mavoko left without paying anything. What is not clear is if he still owns the rights to the songs he recorded under Wasafi. Mavoko ditched WCB in 2018, two years after he terminated his contract with King Kaka's record label, Kaka Empire in 2016.
