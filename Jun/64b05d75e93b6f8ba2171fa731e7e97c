Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong has advised residents to eat plenty of traditional vegetables to boost their immunity and protect themselves against the coronavirus. Speaking after handing relief food to flood victims on Mundere campus on Friday, the governor said strong immunity is important in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic. "I am told that Bunyala residents dread eating vegetables, but I would want to advise you that eating plenty of vegetables will give you immunity over Covid 19," he said. Fishing is the main economic activity in Bunyala subcounty. Fish is more readily available to the residents and many dislike vegetables. Ojaamong said the disease capitalises on weak immunity. He thanked the Kenya Commercial Bank, Diamond Trust Bank and Khetia Supermarket for supporting the flood victims. Governor Ojaamong sought to assure the flood victims that Busia county assembly would give prioritise their needs during budgeting. "Over 8,000 households, translating into over 40,000 people, across Budalang'i constituency were affected by floods, but I want to assure you that Busia assembly will give your needs first priority during its budgeting process," he said, adding that further assistance is needed. "We shall deal with the basics that will assist the flood victims. I am also dialoguing with the national government on how to help as you prepare to return to your homes after the flooding." Governor Ojaamong at the same time said no MCA should push him to tarmac any road before the needs of the flood victims are addressed. He was accompanied by Deputy Governor Moses Mulomi and Bunyala South MCA Casper Ajuma.
