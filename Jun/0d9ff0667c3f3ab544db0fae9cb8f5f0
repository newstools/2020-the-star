@ppcheti Motorists using the Lamu-Garsen road have been warned against careless driving during the rainy season to avert accidents. Lamu county commissioner Irungu Macharia said the roads have been rendered muddy and slippery due to the heavy rains. Any small mistake by motorists could easily result in an accident, death and unnecessary injuries, he said. Macharia said Monday that many parts of the road especially those under construction are in bad shape and should be treaded upon carefully. “You cannot afford to speed or carelessly overtake or swerve anyhow unless you have a death wish. We have lost people over the years during such seasons and we are reminding them to please be careful,” Macharia said. On October 6 last year, three people were injured in an accident that involved a Kenya Red Cross Society vehicle and Toyota Wish at Sese area on the Hongwe-Mpeketoni road. Both vehicles were speeding when the Red Cross driver rammed into the Toyota while trying to overtake. Two other people were injured after a car they were travelling in veered off the road and rolled several times at Mambo Sasa Forest near Witu on the Lamu-Mombasa road on October 22 of the same year.
