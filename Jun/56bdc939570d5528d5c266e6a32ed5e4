YouTube, through the #WithMe campaign, has provided the platform for viewers and content creators to engage and connect. Daily views of videos with “#WithMe” in the title have increased by 600 per cent since stay-at-home orders came up in March this year. Google head of communications Africa Dorothy Ooko says, “As people spend time at home, YouTube is working to provide useful and meaningful content to help everyone accomplish their everyday tasks.” People at home can gain self-improvement, exercise creativity by learning new things and stay connected through YouTube. These include Do It Yourself videos, cooking videos, fitness videos, mood-lifting content and funny videos. Cook #WithMe videos enable creators to share their kitchen expertise with their viewers. Learn #WithMe has ensured learning continues as schools around the country remain closed. Learning creators share engaging resources and activities with students at home to complement the resources being provided by their learning institutions. Churches have not been left behind. ACK Westlands, RCCG Mbagathi, Citam, Nairobi Baptist, Jubilee Christian Church among others livestream their services on YouTube. Through Watch #WithMe, YouTube and MTV Africa organised the Africa Day Benefit Concert, which was streamed on MTV Africa’s YouTube channel. African music artistes used the platform to raise funds for food and health needs of children and families in the continent affected by the Covid-19 pandemic.
