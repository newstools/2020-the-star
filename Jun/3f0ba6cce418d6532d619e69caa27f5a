A Nyahururu court has allowed detectives from Ol Joro Orok to hold a suspected Nyandarua serial killer for 21 days pending investigations. Jayson Theuri, 26, was arraigned on Monday afternoon, having been arrested following a failed robbery with violence, attempted rape and attempted murder in Nyakariang’a village, Ol Joro Orok. Sergeant Peter Mukangai sought more time, saying Theuri is behind a series of murders in Ol Joro Orok. The court heard that the suspect dug a tunnel to access a room where a woman and her children were sleeping. The investigating officer told court that because of limited time between the time of arrest and arraignment, they were unable to record statements from the suspect and the complainant. “We are investigating a series of such incidents that have happened within Nyandarua West between December 2018 and to date,” Mukangai told chief magistrate Charles Obulutsa. The court heard that Theuri was behind the deaths of four people, including women and children, that occurred recently in the subcounty. The police intend to press more charges against the suspect, hence the request for more time. The charges will include murder and robbery with violence. Mukangai also said Theuri's accomplices are still at large and are being tracked. The chief magistrate concurred that the police require sufficient time to harmonise their case. He directed that the suspect be detained at the Ol Joro Orok police station until July 13 when the case will be mentioned. Theuri will, however, be arraigned before then should the police complete their investigation early. The officers can also apply to release him if their investigations do not implicate him, the magistrate said.
