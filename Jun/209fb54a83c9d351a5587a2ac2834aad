Wiper and CCM have signed a cooperation agreement with President Uhuru Kenyatta's Jubilee party. Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka and former Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto were present at the signing ceremony at Jubilee headquarters on Wednesday. Rutto said, "Working together doesn't mean abandoning our party." Wiper secretary general Judith Sijeny said, "The main aim of this is to bring everyone together." Last month, the Wiper National Executive Council authorised Kalonzo to seal a co-operation agreement with Jubilee. The resolution was reached during a virtual meeting held by more than 50 members under its leader. The members unanimously backed the immediate implementation of the cooperation agreement. During the meeting, Kalonzo said that its membership to the National Super Alliance (NASA) would not be altered by the coalition. "This Cooperation Agreement does not breach our agreements under the NASA Coalition," Kalonzo said. This comes after Jubilee party and Kanu signed a coalition agreement. The agreement saw West Pokot Senator Samuel Poghisio of Kanu being named the Senate Majority Leader. Last month, Rutto admitted that he was working on a political deal with Uhuru. He had been picked by a chopper from his rural home in Bomet for a meeting with the President but immediately after the news leaked, CCM came out to strongly deny. However, the party later admitted that they are at the tail end of fine-tuning its working agreement with Jubilee. Rutto is a close associate of Baringo Senator Gideon Moi whose Kanu party struck a deal with Jubilee.
