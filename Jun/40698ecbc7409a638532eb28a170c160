Following extension of curfew to 9 pm, restaurants and eateries can now close at 5 pm, an extra hour of operation, the government has said. Restaurants were previously allowed to operate until 4 pm as part of the government's measure to control Coronavirus infections. Making the announcement on Saturday, Health CAS Rashid Aman said, it was natural to extend operation time for this facilities to suit the new curfew. "For now, the closing time for restaurants and eateries is 5 pm," he said. However, he noted that this is not the final directive as more consultations are being held to reveal the final cut off time. On Friday director of Public Health Francis Kuria warned that facilities found flouting any of the Covid-19 regulations will have their permits permanently withdrawn. He said that police officers have  been instructed to crack down on those flouting this directive.
