Deputy President William Ruto has said that the government will continue creating an enabling environment for the micro economy in the country. Ruto spoke on Monday after meeting national and regional executive members of the Market Traders and Boda Boda Association of Kenya at his office in Harambee House Annex, Nairobi. He said the coronavirus crisis has presented unusual challenges to small businesses, which has compelled the government to find a working model through financing, friendly regulation, and capacity building to cushion the sector. "The government will continue creating an enabling environment for the micro economy like the bodaboda, mitumba and food industry to flourish," Ruto said. On Thursday, Ruto distributed various equipment to 30 youth and women groups from Embakasi Central, Starehe and Langata constituencies. The equipment included shoe shining stands, washing machines, saloon items and tailoring machines in a program that is targeting 5,000 young entrepreneurs.
