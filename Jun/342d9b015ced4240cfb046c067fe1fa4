An Uber driver was on Wednesday charged with sexually assaulting a female passenger who was heading to her boyfriend’s house. Antony Macharia denied the charges before senior principal magistrate Charles Mwaniki. Macharia is accused of committing the offence on June 9 at 10pm in Lang'ata, Nairobi. The passenger was a 24-year-old woman identified in court papers as MA. He was also charged with performing indecent act with the adult. According to the police report brought at the prosecution and seen by the Star, the passenger requested an Uber while at Crescent Road and when it arrived, she sat in the back seat. The passenger had been enjoying drinks at her friend's place before requesting the car. While on the trip, she felt as though someone was touching her. Then she suddenly felt weak. She was surprised to find herself in the seat next to the driver and the drivers hands were touching her private parts, the report reads. She convinced the driver to drive her to her boyfriend’s house and when they arrived, she alighted and screamed for help. The boyfriend got out of the house as he had been alerted by the woman via an SMS. When she told her boyfriend about the ordeal, he confronted the driver but he denied the claims, prompting the boyfriend to report to the police. On Wednesday, the magistrate released the accused on Sh300,000 bond or Sh50,000 bail. The magistrate also ruled that the accused person be supplied with witness statements and documentary evidence. He directed the case to proceed on July 1.  Edited by R.Wamochie
