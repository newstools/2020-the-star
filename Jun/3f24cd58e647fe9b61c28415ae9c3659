Gospel singer Willy Paul has excited his fans with his new song, 'Wema', featuring Gloria Muliro. Released three days ago, the song is trending, with massive positive comments. Many are welcoming him back to doing gospel music. "He even sounds different while singing gospel. He sounds even better. Willy you’re a child of God, Jesus loves you and there’s no sin he doesn’t forgive. He is waiting for you with open arms, repent and live a holy life," a fan said. Willy Paul came into the limelight with Sitolia, featuring Muliro, in 2014 which was also well-received. He then started releasing controversial music which left many confused if he was still a gospel artiste. When asked in various interviews if he is still doing gospel music, Willy Paul says he is an artiste. "What God has put in me is beyond talent. I am a creative artist. One day I could wake up and record a love song, the other a worship song,” he said.
