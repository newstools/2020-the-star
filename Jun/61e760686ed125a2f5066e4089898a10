Local leaders and security officers in Wajir on Thursday visited 400 IDPs displaced by clan conflicts in Basir Eldas constituency. Clashes between the Degodia in Wajir and the Borana in Marsabit in the last one week have claimed nine lives. The two communities have been fighting over pasture and water. Early this week, some members of the Degodia community who live in Turbi, Walda, Sololo, Makutano, Garba and Busuke at the border with Marsabit fled, fearing for their lives. County commissioner Jacob Narengo, Deputy Governor Ahmed Mukhtar and senior national and county officials toured the area to restore calm. They condole with the bereaved families and distributed food and other supplies. The leaders urged the two communities to stop fighting and embrace dialogue. Mukhtar confirmed that seven people had been killed as of Wednesday. He urged security personnel to move with speed and arrest the situation. “I want to make a passionate appeal to the residents to maintain peace and let the security officers handle the issue. They will hunt for the killers, arrest and charge them in courts of law,” he said. Narengo said the security team is on top of the situation and will arrest all those involved in the attacks “I want to give an assurance that nobody will be spared as we go after these criminals. We will be working closely with our counterparts in Marsabit to ensure that they are brought to book,” he said. Local elders said the IDPs were in dire need of basic needs and urged both the national and county governments to provide assistance. Edited by Frank Obonyo
