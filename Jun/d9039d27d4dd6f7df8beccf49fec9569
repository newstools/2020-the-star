The Kenya Bankers Association have re-elected KCB Group chief executive Joshua Oigara chairperson for the period 2020/2021. NCBA Group Managing Director John Gachora retained the vice chairperson's position. Oigara and Gachora have steered the banking industry through various policy engagements in close coordination with the industry regulators. Under their tenure, KBA formulated the 2019 -2023 Strategic Plan that seeks to deepen financial inclusion through affordable banking services based on tech-driven innovations and enhanced operational efficiency. The strategy also provides a blueprint towards meeting regulatory requirements outlined by the Central Bank of Kenya's  Banking Sector Charter. The strategy pushes for the adoption of customer-centric business models, with a focus on supporting MSMEs; risk-based credit pricing; transparency, as well as, information disclosure; and entrenchment of ethical culture in banking. “The industry  has continued to face challenges in the year 2020, observing that the Coronavirus pandemic is one of the greatest challenges faced by the industry in recent history,” said Oigara. He said banks have stepped up to support the national effort during this global health crisis, commending the industry’s efforts to help customers mitigate the financial impact on households and businesses. Since April 2020, banks have restructured in excess of Sh560 billion worth of loan facilities and have waived fees and charges on mobile payments. KBA Chief Executive Officer, Habil Olaka, expressed gratitude to the KBA member banks and the Governing Council for their leadership and support. “With banks being a critical cog in the economy’s wheel, their collective endeavour is to make sure that under the current challenging circumstances there is minimised disruption,” Olaka said.
