Senator James Orengo on Tuesday stirred up the Senate when he insinuated that those responsible for the impeachment of Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru  are not from the County Assembly. "Waiguru’s ‘head’ is being asked for not by the County Assembly of Kirinyaga but by ‘other people’," he said. The senator went head to say that he has evidence to prove his remarks. Orengo's remarks before the Senate on Tuesday regarding the manner of handling Waiguru's ouster seemed to touch the senators wrongly as some started chanting 'that is very wrong'. Nakuru Senator Susan Kihika termed the remarks 'nonsense and inappropriate". Further, defiant Orengo replied, "You know the remarks I support and the stones have heard me" to Elgeyo Marakwet Kipchumba Murkomen, who insisted that the remarks should not be allowed to go on record. Speaker Ken Lusaka was left struggling to tame the House which was now in a frenzy. The highlight of the stormy session were the numerous points of order being advanced by either side of the divided as temperatures flared. Murkomen, who stood up on several points of order, argued that the House and Kenyans were being misled to believe that Waiguru's case could come up again if the committee found her innocent.
