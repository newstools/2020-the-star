West Pokot residents living along the border with Uganda have been urged to be on high alert after three coronavirus cases were confirmed in Amudat in northern Uganda. Pokot North subcounty deputy county commissioner Martin Mbaie said closure of the border by the Ugandan authorities has restricted residents from crossing over. He asked residents to stop border trade since the cases have been confirmed in the neighbouring country. “Most people have been using panya routes to cross to Uganda and to come back. Most farmers from this region farm in Uganda and they have been crossing to check on their produce,” he said. He said they have tried to educate residents on the dangers they are exposing themselves to and asked them to observe the health guidelines. Uganda’s Amudat MP Christopher Akorkimoi said the three positive cases were livestock traders who had crossed into Turkana county to buy livestock. “When they came back they were intercepted at the border, after being tested they were found to be positive,” he said. Akarkimoi said they suspect the three might have contracted the virus in Turkana and currently they are undergoing treatment at Moroto Hospital in Uganda. West Pokot Health CEC Jackson Yaralima said most West Pokot residents buy their products from Amudat market, which puts them at high risk of contracting the virus. The alert comes after a Covid-19 patient escaped from a health facility in Uganda. The 42-year-old Kenyan woman was among three confirmed cases admitted at the facility on Tuesday. West Pokot county commissioner Apollo Okello said police officers from Kenya and Uganda are searching for the woman who has mental health issues. He said the woman hails from Kiwawa location. Okello said the woman, after testing positive, was taken Moroto Hospital in Uganda for treatment but she managed to escape and her whereabouts are not known. (Edited by V. Graham)
