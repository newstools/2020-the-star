Kitui MCAs are set to debate Governor Charity Ngilu’s impeachment next week on Monday. This was after the Majority Leader in the County Assembly submitted an impeachment motion to the speaker of the assembly. The Athi Ward Representative, Peter Kilonzo drafted the motion in which he accused Ngilu of violating the Constitution, abusing of office and gross misconduct. A notice on a local daily indicated that the Kitui County Assembly would convene to debate Ngilu’s ouster. “Members of the public are hereby notified that a notice of motion on the impeachment of Ngilu has been served to the Speaker of the County Assembly,” the notice reads. The notice asked the public to submit their views on the matter through submission of written memoranda and/ or duly filled and signed questionnaire. They are requested to ensure that the memoranda and/or questionnaires reach the Assembly on or before close of business, Friday June 26, 2020. Copies of the questionnaire and the Notice of Motion can be downloaded from the Kitui Assembly’s website Both the questionnaires and memoranda may be hand delivered to the Office of the Clerk, County Assembly of Kitui, at the designated desk or emailed to info.cakitui@gmail.com. This comes a week after Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru was impeached by MCAS. She is currently before the senate to defend herself against accusations of gross misconduct and abuse of office.
