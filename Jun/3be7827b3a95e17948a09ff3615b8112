Harambee Sacco has donated Sh3 million worth of protective gear to the police as part of efforts to contain the Covid-19 pandemic. The donation included face masks, bottles of sanitisers, water tanks, gloves and personal protective equipment. Receiving the donations at Vigilance House in Nairobi, Deputy Inspector General of Police Njoroge Mbugua said it will go a long way in ensuring the safety of officers as they enforce measures to curb the spread of the virus. “We are usually among the first to respond to emergencies and this puts us at a risk of getting the disease,” he added. Mbugua called on other corporate organisations and individuals to make such donations. “We have been receiving donations but we will still encourage others to follow suit,” he said. He said defeating the virus needs a concerted effort from stakeholders and Kenyans at large. “We have so many officers who are members of the Harambee Sacco and they were wondering why they were not getting any support,” he stated. Charles Konzolo, Harambee Sacco’s national treasurer, said organisations need to support the people who are at the forefront fighting the pandemic. “We have a huge membership of the police and that is why we thought it wise to give back,” he said. Konzolo added that the Sacco would be making similar donations to the traffic police department and the general service unit.
