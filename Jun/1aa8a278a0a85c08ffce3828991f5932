Five Jubilee senators facing disciplinary action have to wait another 28 days to know their fate, National Disciplinary Committee vice chairperson Wanjiku Nduati has announced. The five senators, who snubbed a Senate Parliamentary Group convened by President Uhuru Kenyatta, risk expulsion from the party if the committee finds them guilty of misconduct. The senators are Falhada Iman, Naomi Waqo, Victor Prengei, Mary Seneta and Millicent Omanga. "...notice is hereby given the delivery of the determination in the above referenced matters has been extended by a further 28 days from the date hereof," read a notice dated June 8, 2020. The senators were given an opportunity to defend themselves before the party members . They are accused of snubbing Kenyattaâ€™s meeting at State House that led to the removal of Senators Kipchumba Murkomen (Elgeyo Marakwet) and Susan Kihika (Nakuru) as Majority Leader and Whip respectively. According to the law, Jubilee will not be required to submit fresh names to replace them but will use the party list submitted to IEBC before the last polls.
