E-commerce platform Jumia Kenya has opened up its logistics arm to external clients for deliveries. Customers can drop off their parcels at Jumia centers in Nairobi or have them collected through business-to-customer  and business-to-business  type deliveries. “At the request of our partners, we are opening up our logistics arm for B2B and B2C deliveries, with the hope that we can provide a better quality of service, at lower cost,” Jumia CEO, Sam Chappatte said. Online delivery firms are on the increase and Jumuia's move is aimed at giving it an edge over its competitors in the cut throat business. “We have piloted this program over the last months, and believe the service is relevant for both medium and large businesses to reach fragmented customers, or for smaller businesses or individuals to do social commerce selling,” Chappatte added.
