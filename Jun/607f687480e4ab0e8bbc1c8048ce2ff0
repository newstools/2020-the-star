The government has announced a plan to channel Sh1 billion to the National Blood Transfusion Service. Through the Ministry of Health, the government said the amount from World Bank will play a key role in ensuring the service has enough blood as required by the World Health Organisation. Health CAS Dr Rashid Aman said the amount will also be part of the national blood donations campaigns to be launched on Sunday to commemorate International Blood Donor day. "The government has made additional investment to this agency with an aim of boosting its capacity in blood collection," Aman said. He participated in a blood donation drive at KICC on Friday ahead of World Blood Donor Day on Sunday.
