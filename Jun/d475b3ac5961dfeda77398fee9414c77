The Kabete-South C tunnel that is expected to boost water supply in the western part of the city will be completed by December. The multimillion-shilling project is 74 per cent complete, Nairobi Water and Sewerage Company managing director Nahashon Muguna said on Monday. The tunnel excavation has been done. "Currently we have the secondary lining of the tunnel with concrete, which is at 21 per cent going on. We also have construction of intakes at Githika, Irati and Maragua, which is ongoing at 46 per cent," Muguna said. Lang'ata residents will be the biggest beneficiaries as well as their counterparts in Uthiru, Ngando, Karen, Kawangware, JKIA, Coca-Cola, Umoja, Donholm, Kayole, Komarock, Utawala, South B and C, Mihang'o, Imara Daima, Embakasi and Ruai. Nairobi has for years grappled with water shortage as the demand outstrips the supply. Rationing started in April 2017. The NWSC produces 526 million litres daily against a demand of 790 million litres. Muguna said the water pipes will be laid from Kabete along James Gichuru Road,Â  Southern Bypass to South C. A 14 million-litre reservoir at the Embakasi Barracks will also serve the neighbourhood. "The tank is at 95 per cent completion with only the inlet, outlet, scour and overflow pipes and fittings works pending," Muguna stated.  - mwaniki fm
