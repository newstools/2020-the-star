Former  Bandari coach Bernard Mwalala could be headed back to the dugout with three Kenyan Premier League clubs angling to secure his services in preparation for a return to action once the coronavirus crisis has been contained. The youthful tactician has been in the cold since January after being suspended and later sacked by the dockers over a series of unwanted results but is looking to bounce back ahead of the new season. The former Harambee Stars striker, who after his dismissal at Bandari returned to his Kitale hometown, said he has been negotiating with three top division sides and would make a decision once sporting activities resume. He, however, declined to reveal the identities of the interested outfits. "I have been negotiating with three local clubs and I am certain that I will complete a move before the new season begins," said Mwalala. "Life off the pitch has been good but it is my wish to return to what I do best.I have used the time off the touchline to reflect on several issues and personal goals which I would like to score once I am back," he revealed. He disclosed that there are also offers from Tanzania and Rwanda. The former Nzoia Sugar coach was heavily linked with a return to record Tanzanian champions Yanga in November last year only for the Jangwani Boys to settle for former AFC Leopards coach Luc Eymael in January. Mwalala, who turned for Yanga during his heydays, believes he would have already made his way back to the touchline were it not for the coronavirus pandemic, which he blames for slowed negotiations with suitors. "Were it not for the pandemic, I would have signed a deal long ago since there were interests as soon as I left Bandari," he observed.
