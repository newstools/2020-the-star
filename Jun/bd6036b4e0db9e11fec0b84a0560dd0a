Nairobi assembly Minority Chief Whip Peter Imwatok has been charged with obtaining money by false pretence. It is alleged that between February 1 and October 31, 2017 with the intent to defraud, he obtained Sh2.19 million from Fresky Bett by pretending he was in a position to sell her a piece of land. Imwatok denied the charge and through his lawyer asked the court to release him on reasonable bail terms. He told court that he is not a flight risk and will adhere to all conditions set by the court for his release on bail. Magistrate Kennedy Cheruiyot released him on a Sh200,000 cash bail.
