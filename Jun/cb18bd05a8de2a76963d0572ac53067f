The allocation of Sh5 billion to counties to fight Covid-19 is too little and must urgently be increased, Kajiado Governor Joseph Lenku has said. Lenku on Sunday faulted his own county’s allocation of only Sh52 million by the National Treasury, saying it erred in assessing the county’s needs. The infection rate in Kajiado stood at 88 on Saturday afternoon. "We have been allocated Sh52 million, yet now we have 88 confirmed cases by Sunday. Counties yet to record a single case have been allocated more than Sh200 million,” the governor said. Speaking in Kajiado during a briefing on Covid-19 preparedness, the governor said region is vulnerable to the virus, especially due to its porous border with Tanzania. "Seventy per cent of our cases are related to the Namanga and Loitokitok borders where the majority [of carriers] are truck drivers," he said. The governor said the county's preparedness was on course and there were 63 beds in isolation wards so far, 10 ICU beds and 10 High Dependence unit beds. President Uhuru Kenyatta said on Saturday each county must have at least 300 isolation beds. Lenku repeated that health indices used by the Commission on Revenue Allocation had ignored the high susceptibility of some counties to Covid-19. According to the Health ministry data, Kajiado is the third most-prone county after Nairobi and Mombasa, yet its allocation was meagre, the governor said. The Covid-19 conditional grant schedule signed by CRA chairperson Jane Kiringai shows Nairobi, the worst-hit county, was allocated Sh294 million, while Mombasa, the second-most affected, was allocated Sh100 million. The schedule indicates that Kakamega, which is yet to report a case, was allocated Sh262 million, while Kisii was allocated Sh156 million, Lenku said. Uasin Gishu with less than 50 cases was allocated Sh125 million, he said. (Edited by V. Graham)
