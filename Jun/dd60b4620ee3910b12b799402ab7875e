Kenya will have their own international statisticians if the eight nominees for the FIBA Africa online statistics course set for next week get certified. Ambrose Kisoi, the Kenya Basketball Federation (KBF) assistant secretary yesterday confirmed the development, saying it will be a milestone for the country. He said the eight have been given the go ahead to take the two-day course and those successful will have a chance to officiate locally and internationally. “The country has never had a Fiba certified statistician but now we have a perfect opportunity to break the duck and have officials at our disposal,” said Kisoi. He added: “This is an important development for our league and those who qualify will get opportunities to handle Fiba games throughout Africa.” During the Fiba Africa Zone Five pre-qualifiers in Nairobi in January, the continental body had to bring in a statistician from Uganda. Among the participants are Ulinzi Warriors duo of Patrick Odhiambo and Eddy Klaume, who regularly take charge of statistics for the league champions. Teddy Amino, who has also been involved in capturing data during league games, has also been enlisted. The trio were on duty during the January championships. The others participants are veteran Nelly Odera, Sylvia Ongwae, Mary Makau, Gertrude Sagala and Rodreque Wanyama. Kenya is in Group ‘3’ alongside Zimbabwe, Tanzania, South Sudan, Algeria, Equatorial Guinea, Libya, Rwanda, Algeria and Guinea Bissau.
