Mothers with Covid-19 can breastfeed, so long as they wear masks, the Health Ministry has said. During a press briefing on Tuesday, the head of preventive Health Dr Pacifica Onyancha said that the mothers should let the child be attended to by someone else once breastfeeding is completed. She also reminded parents and guardians with children under the age of two not to make toddlers wear masks, lest they suffocate. "Children are fragile... the masks reduce oxygen supply," Onyancha said. Onyancha also said that children under the age of five should not wear masks when in vehicles, lest they fall asleep and suffocate. Meanwhile, Health CS Mutahi Kagwe, while acknowledging the Day of the African Child, called for the care of children to prevent disease. "It is also important to address issues of treatment and cure for children," he said. The Day of the African Child has been celebrated on June 16 every year since 1991, when it was first initiated by the Organisation of African Unity. The day honors those who participated in the Soweto Uprising in 1976. This year's theme is 'Celebration of access to the child-friendly justice system'. Kenya on Tuesday recorded 133 new cases of Covid-19, raising the country's total confirmed cases to 3,860. The new cases emerged from 3,255 samples that were tested in the last 24 hours. Health CS Mutahi Kagwe said Kenya's cumulative tests now stand at 121,926. Another 40 patients have been discharged, raising the total to 1,326. The youngest is 13 years old, while the oldest is 90 years.
