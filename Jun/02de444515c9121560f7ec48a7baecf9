Dennis Okari's daughter with Betty Kyallo, Ivanna, celebrated her sixth birthday yesterday. The celebrity parents threw her a lavish party on Sunday. The event was captured on media personality Betty’s YouTube channel, and it was super emotional. The former K24 news anchor opened up on Ivanna’s hospitalisation last year and her fears that she would lose her only child. Grateful she is alive and kicking and doing super great, Betty threw the party and invited Dennis. She wrote, "Happy 6th birthday child! We all love you so much. You are a STAR! May God Shine your Path today and always." Tears of joy flowed freely as Okari got down on his knees to wish Ivanna a great year ahead and to declare his love for her. “Okay, Ivanna. Look at me. Do I go on my knees?” Okari asked. “I will be the first man to go on my knees for you. Before that other boy comes. So, listen. You are the most intelligent, smartest, beautiful and precious daughter anyone would want in this world. “I love you. Love you. Love you so much. Happy birthday. May you enjoy many, many more. I pray for God’s blessings on your life. You are going to impact your generation.” Okari finished off his tribute with a kiss on Ivanna’s left cheek. This whole scenario left Betty in tears. She could not help herself. Betty Kyallo has been sharing moments of her daughter meeting with her dad Dennis Okari. It is also evident that Okari has been visiting his daughter at Betty's house. In one post, Betty shared a photo of Ivanna with Okari doing homework together. She wrote, "Daddy helped with homework." Edited by T Jalio
