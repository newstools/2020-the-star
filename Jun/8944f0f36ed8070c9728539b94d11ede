The Busia government has expanded Alupe Covid-19 treatment centre to accommodate the growing number of positive cases, mostly truck drivers. Health chief officer Isaac Omeri said on Saturday beds at the centre have been increased from 71 to 120. The Busia Agricultural Training Centre and the Kenya Medical Training College Busia Campus, he said, are also targeted to take in more Covid-19 cases. “The isolation centre at Alupe had surpassed the capacity of 71 people, a situation that prompted our technical team to convert the available rooms at the facility into wards. We have agreed to use the Agricultural Training Centre, which has 42 beds, to admit asymptomatic patients,” Omeri said. “We have also talked to the principal of St Monica Chakol Girls High School, which has over 200 beds to be used as an isolation centre as we take precautionary measures against the increasing number of Covid-19 patients.” Addressing journalists at the Busia County Referral Hospital after receiving a donation of face masks from Busia Professionals Association (BUPAA), Omeri said  truck drivers travelling to the county must be tested from their points of origin. He also urged residents, including police officers, to take precautions as they move around to avoid being infected. Omeri was accompanied by Busia County Director of Medical Services Janerose Ambuchi. Ambuchi said the biggest challenge was truck drivers mingling with residents. “The pandemic is real, and we must take every precaution to curb it,” she said. BUPAA chairman Christopher Ngacho praised the county government for the measures put in place to fight the coronavirus. Edited by A.N
