The Garissa government yesterday received 10,000 face masks and protective gear to support frontline health workers in the fight against Covid-19. The donations were made by the Kenya Red Cross Society. Other items included 15 cartons of disinfectant and 10 cartons of reproductive kits. The donation is part of an eight-month-long EU-funded project that will include the training of more than 150 healthcare workers on handling Covid-19. The training will be carried out by Red Cross and the county government. Staff will be trained on case management, application and use of personal protective equipment. They will also receive psychosocial support as they confront the pandemic. Governor Ali Korane received the donations. Health executive Ahmednadhir Omar said no Garissa health worker has so far tested positive for the coronavirus. “We pray that the situation remains the way it is,” he said. Omar said the administration is working to set up 300 isolation beds as directed by President Uhuru Kenyatta. “This does not mean that we should relax. We all need to adhere to the guidelines provided by the ministry of health in curbing the spread of this deadly virus,” he said. Moses Atuko, the head of emergency health at Red Cross praised the county government and health workers for preventing the spread of Covid-19. "We want to contribute to the county's efforts in fighting against this pandemic and hope that this donation will make a difference in helping Garissa county triumph in the battle against Covid-19,” he said. “This is a disease which none of us was prepared to handle. It is therefore collective responsibility and unity that will help in containing its spread.” Edited by Frank Obonyo
