Funyala MP Wilberforce Mudenyo has condemned a move by Busia Woman Representative Florence Mutua to declare herself the county spokesperson. Mudenyo said the action should be considered misleading and ill-intended as Busia leaders and residents have not anointed anyone in that capacity. Addressing journalists in his constituency on Monday, Mudenyo said the last Luhya community meeting was about development and not positions. But Mutua said she was endorsed in the caucus last week. The Funyula MP said that Mutua was made deputy coordinator to spearhead the region's development, not to speak for them. Mutua said she is not desperate for positions as she was already nominated to represent gender. Mudenyo said the purpose of the gathering was to lobby the national government to allocate more funds to Western in the next financial year especially after the region was hard-hit by floods. "The development caucus was triggered by the massive damage by floods in Budalang’i, Funyula and other parts," Mudenyo said. With such an agenda on the table, he said, declaring oneself the county spokesperson is not just misleading but utter nonsense. The MP regretted that they have not even achieved what they are geared to get in the next financial year “yet some leaders have started misleading the public to divert the development agenda”. Mudenyo told the woman MP to focus on how she can help Busia residents get a long-term solution. "Those in the development caucus have been taken aback by the attempts by Mutua to self-declare as Busia spokesperson," Mudenyo said. Even if the position was to be created, the lawmaker said, it would never be a roadside declaration “the way Mutua wants it to be”. "The position can only be created at the right time through the involvement of all Busia residents, leaders in active politics, opinion leaders and so on," Mudenyo said. Edited by R.Wamochie
