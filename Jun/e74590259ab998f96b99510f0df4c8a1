Treasury is yet to release Sh15 billion belonging to the National Government Constituency Development Fund (NG-CDF) days to the end of financial year, a House team heard on Thursday. The delay means a number of constituencies will not be able to implement new projects or complete of ongoing ones within the time frame. Appearing before the Special Funds Committee of the national Assembly, the NG-CDF board said only 67.12 percent of the 2019/20 budget has been disbursed to date. In the current financial year ending June 2020, the Fund had a budget of Sh41.71 billion for the 290 Constituencies. The NG-CDF Act, 2015 allocates 2.5 percent of the total national revenue raised to the Fund and is equally among the 290 constituencies. Out of the 2019/20 financial year budget, each of the constituency was allocated Sh137 million for development in the year to June 2020. But according to documents tabled before the Committee by the Board, only Sh28 billion has been disbursed for project implementation to date. “The Board has been and continues to follow up with the ministry for the release of the balance of Sh15.7 billion,” read part of the Board’s presentation before the Committee chaired by South Imenti Kathuri Murungi. The current financial year ends on Tuesday next week implying the balance might cross into 2020/2021 financial year. The Fund was also underfunded to the tune of Sh4.9 billion arrears for the past financial year 2018/2020. The Board was appearing before the Murungi led committee to brief it on the progress of various projects as per the recommendations of the Committee on the status of fund management and implementation in various reports. The Committee raised concerns on the delayed approval on certain projects leading to delayed complications. The lawmakers directed that the Board come up with proper approval processes to ensure effective administration of the Fund.
