Leaders need the support of residents to succeed in their development plans, Vihiga Deputy Governor Patrick Saisi has said. He said the Luhya nation has lagged behind in development due to continued witch-hunt against elected leaders. He spoke at St Clare Girls Secondary School in Mbale town where Governor Wilber Ottichilo launched the second facelift of the municipality. Saisi urged residents to embrace development for the growth of Vihiga. Development would never be achieved until residents sacrifice for it, he said. He said the county government faced lots of hiccups in implementation of infrastructure projects. “We were to build Moses Mudamba Cultural Centre here in Mbale but the piece of land we were to use was grabbed," Saisi said. "We went to build our garage at Chango but the public denied us the chance. Here in Mbale town, we wanted to build a modern market, still the same people went to court." He said the people who were blocking development were the same complaining that the governor was not working for them. “Change will never come if we don’t embrace that change ourselves,” Saisi said. Ottichillo urged the residents to accord necessary support to the contractor to ensure the municipality gets the facelift. Edited by Henry Makori
