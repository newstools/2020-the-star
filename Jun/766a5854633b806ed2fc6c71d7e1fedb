A motorist was on Tuesday charged in a Kibera court with raping a woman and infecting her with HIV. He is accused of luring the woman from a bus stop, driving her to his house and committing the offence. The man whose name is withheld denied the charge before chief magistrate Joyce Gandani. He was accused ofÂ committing the offence on May 27 at Kuthi rental houses along Magadi Road. He was charged with rape, committing an indecent act with an adult and deliberately transmitting a sexually transmitted infection to the complainant whose name also was withheld. According to the police report in court, the woman was at the bus stage at the Catholic University of East Africa waiting to board a matatu to her house in Rongai when the accused approached. The police report says that the accused person then offered her ride. The man drove up to a Total Petrol Station where he stopped and told her that he wanted to greet his friend at the adjacent pub. The woman decided to accompany him, the report reads. When she too got inside the bar, there was no friend and the man just bought beers which they indulged in, the police report reads. The woman allegedly got worried and requested the man to drop her off at Rongai or she would take a boda boda there. But the accused told her that riders are immoral and dangerous at night, it reads. The report seen by the Star also states that he advised her to go with him to his house until the next day as it was almost curfew. They agreed on it and ate supper around 10pm before they went to bed and he raped her, the police report states. It also states that he used protection both at night and in the morning. But the woman checked the condoms and realised they had holes. She insisted they go for an HIV test and he refused, the report reads, but he later accepted and tested positive. Gandani released him on Sh200,000 bond or Sh50,000 bail. She directed the case to proceed on August 10. Edited by R.Wamochie
