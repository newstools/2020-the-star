Former Prime Minister Raila Odinga’s daughter has told politicians to stop hiding behind the dynasty narrative and sell their policies to Kenyans. Speaking during an interview with K24 on Sunday, Rosemary Odinga, in a message apparently targeting DP William Ruto’s camp, said leaders will be elected on account of their achievements, not their families.. She dismissed the politics of dynasty as cheap, adding that they would not shape the 2022 contest. Ruto’s Tangatanga camp has been fashioning its 2022 politics around dynasty, urging Kenyans to inject fresh blood into the country’s political system. His allies have branded the 2022 election 'a contest between dynasties and hustlers'. The Tangatanga team has been branding President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga as dynasty candidates since they are scions of founding President Jomo Kenyatta and first Vice President Oginga Odinga. “It is unfortunate that it has found its way into our politics. It should be about your policies and how your plans will impact people's lives,” she said. Rosemary, who in 2017 was taken ill during the campaign, declined to confirm whether she would vie for a political seat in the next election. In 2017, she was poised to run for Kibra parliamentary seat before she was hospitalised for months, including being flown to South Africa for treatment. She is visually impaired to some extent. “It is still too early to talk about running for office. The country is going through tough times with Covid-19. There is still politics happening but now is not that time,” she said. Rosemary also praised Uhuru and Raila for agreeing to work together. “I commend both men [Raila and Uhuru] for putting their differences aside for the sake of our country,” she said. “I told the leaders to come together for the sake of our country. I told them that they were holding the instruments of power today but come tomorrow, they will hand them over to someone else.” Edited by A.N
