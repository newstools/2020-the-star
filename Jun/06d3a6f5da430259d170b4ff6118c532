The Building Bridges Initiative task force on Tuesday announced it had completed writing the final report and awaiting availability of President Uhuru Kenyatta to present it. In a statement signed by joint Secretaries Paul Mwangi and Martin Kimani, the task force said the report has recommended proper implementation asking the public to ignore false reports already circulating. Uhuru had given the 14 -member task force that is chaired by Garissa senator Yusuf Haji until end of June to submit the final report. Due to the current Covid-19 global pandemic, the task force said the proposed time and venue of handover is subject to change in line with the county's control measures. The committee said the final reports has all the proposed administrative, policy and constitutional changes that may be necessary for the implementation of it's recommendation in the report. "The steering committee, since the date of the gazetting,has successfully conducted validation of the Task Force Report BBI through consultations with citizens, civil society, faith-based organisations, cultural leaders, private sector and experts," the task force said. A referendum on constitutional amendments likely to be proposed by the BBI  team could be held in November. Two weeks earlier, Uhuru and ODM party leader Raila Odinga are said to have visited the BBI secretariat at their offices in Nairobi’s Runda Estate where they were briefed on the progress. It is emerging that the team has retained the initial proposal of a non-executive prime minister, a bone of contention between Uhuru-Raila and DP William Ruto camps. The BBI team was constituted by Uhuru and Raila following their March 2018 handshake and was given a nine-point agenda of issues to propose how to address them. The initial report that was unveiled in November 2019 before being taken to Kenyans to validate had recommended the return of the position.
