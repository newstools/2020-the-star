Regional low-cost carrier, Jambojet has introduced a raft of measures to ensure its passengers and crew are protected from contracting the novel COVID-19 during travel once operations resume. The measures taken include thorough sanitisation of aircraft with industry approved detergent before and after each flight paying extra attention to all touch prone areas. Additionally, the aircraft have been fitted with High-Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filtration system that refreshes the air every 3 minutes. “We remain committed to ensuring the safety and well-being of our employees and customers from the moment they arrive at the airport to the time they land at their destination,” said Jambojet acting CEO, Karanja Ndegwa. “Once we resume operations, we will ensure that we continue to follow the set guidelines by the Ministry of Health, WHO, IATA, and other relevant bodies,” he added Additionally, temperature checks will be done on arrival at the airport and hand sanitisers will be provided at all customer touchpoints. All passengers and crew will be required to wear facemask throughout the journey and observe social distancing on all queues and at the lounge. The Cabin Crew will assist passengers with opening and closing of the overhead bins to reduce touch. “We are encouraging our customers to check-in online on www.jambojet.com to minimise queues at the airport. We have also updated our boarding procedures, where passengers will be boarded by zone starting with those seating at the rear of the cabin,” he said. Jambojet halted operations on April 7 2020 after the President’s directive on cessation of movement by road, rail or air in and out of Nairobi, Mombasa, Kilifi and Kwale counties to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Operations are set to  resume once the ban is lifted.
