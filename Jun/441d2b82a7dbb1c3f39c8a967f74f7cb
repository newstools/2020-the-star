Actor Abel Mutua has narrated how Jua Cali saved him in Eldoret after his first gig flopped. Mutua had been invited to an event where Jua Cali was the headlining in 2009 . In a You Tube video, Abel says that while Jua Cali was given all the privileges of an aeroplane, a hotel room and ample time, he was treated as a "normal guy" by the event organiser , who happened to his classmate in high school. "I left Nairobi very hopeful that I was going to make good money. I went by bus and when I got there, I asked about a hotel room to relax before the event started," he said. "They told me to just chill around because the event was about to start," he added. After he asked if there was something he could eat, they gave me money to buy ‘chips mwitu’ as he waited for the gig. "While there, I met Jua Cali, who felt very sorry for me. He told me he came on a plane. He told me to relax and sleep in his room. He was so kind. Be blessed, you inspired me that day," Mutua said. After the gig, Mutua, who was supposed to be paid Sh30,000, only got Sh1,000. "That was 2009 and to date, they have never given me my Sh29k," he said.
