Deputy President William Ruto has promised to fund 5,000 small enterprises that have been hit hard by the Covid-19 crisis. He said on Thursday that he will give phased support in four months to avoid the spread of the virus and allow small investors to remain in business. Ruto will be targeting car wash businesses, mechanics, matatu operators, laundry outlets, farmers and welders. He said this will go a long way in complementing the government's economic stimulus programme. “Small businesses are vulnerable groups. They include single ladies, single mothers, orphans and youths who do not have the power to borrow from banks. The pandemic has also affected them that much to use up to the last coin and they can’t run their businesses,” Ruto said. He was addressing small-scale entrepreneurs and Nairobi legislators at his official residence in Karen, Nairobi. “What we are doing is to support government projects. We have 10,000 youths who will be employed by the government stimulus programme, for which we have set aside Sh57 billion. We will also employ 10,000 teachers across the country,” Ruto said. He said the funds provided by the government will be pumped into tourism, transport, banking and all other sectors of the economy to address the adverse economic effects of Covid-19. “I urge everyone who can help, to do his part. The government can’t help everyone and so we can do our part to change lives,” Ruto said. “Let us come together as well-wishers, development partners, civil society groups and religious organisations to build the nation. Our role as leaders is to change lives and that is what everyone should do.” The DP urged Kenyans to follow government directives to reduce the spread of the contagion. “I urge you to follow government directives such as social distancing, washing hands and putting on masks,” he said. "I also call upon you to protect those with preexisting conditions whose immunity is not strong to handle Covid-19.”  Edited by F'Orieny
