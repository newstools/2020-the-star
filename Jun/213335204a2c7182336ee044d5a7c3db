Kenya's fight for independence and the journey to multi-party democracy was marked by many sacrifices. Many lost their lives, others were detained, displaced or scarred for life in the independence and later Second Liberation struggles. The liberties we currently enjoy were not handed over on a silver platter and it is therefore disheartening when these are selectively applied. Focus currently is on fighting the fast spreading Covid-19 pandemic and all energies and resources should be channelled towards this. However the Public Health Act has been turned into a political tool against those not currying favour with the government. State-friendly leaders are allowed to continue with public meetings without disruption while perceived enemies of the government have to contend with teargas anytime they try to assemble. Court orders are disregarded with abandon, bodies like the Nairobi Metropolitan Services are created in total disregard of the law and spurious charges are levelled against 'state enemies'. The Judiciary and Legislature are under siege, hallmarks of a one-party state  perfected by the Kanu regime. The opposition is all but dead because its leaders are in bed with the government. Kenya is a beacon of democracy in the region and any attempts to erode the gains must be strongly resisted.
