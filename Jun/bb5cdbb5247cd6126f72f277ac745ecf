Fast-rising forward Henry Meja says he joined Tusker because he wanted to play alongside his elder brother and Harambee Stars trialist Sammy Meja. The former Green Commandos star pulled a surprise after declining to take offers from AFC Leopards and Kakamega Homeboyz who were chasing his signature. Instead, he headed to Ruaraka in January where he inked a three-year long deal, joining his brother who is the club's first choice left back. “It was an easy move as Tusker is a good club. They promised to offer me playing time despite my age and lack of top flight football experience. This was unlike other clubs who most of the times go for experience Besides there is no intense pressure from fans at Tusker,” he disclosed The rookie thanked Kakamega Senator Cleophas Malala for organising an annual Super Cup which he noted gave players the platform to express themselves. Meja was named the Most Valuable Player during last year's edition, thanks to his 11 goals. “I want to thank Senator Malala for supporting my former club and assisting me to make the right decision that will see me realize my dream of playing for big clubs in Europe,” he said He added: “I want to assist Tusker win titles by scoring goals but it's all about the teamwork and not chasing individual success,” he said in a telephone interview e Meja also attributed the strides he has made  to former Kakamega High School coach Brendan Mwinamo and other coaches who handled him along the way. Malala meanwhile tipped the youngster to shine locally and beyond the borders,  saying he has what it takes to become a great hit and successful. “I was pleased to see him join one of the top sides. I believe he has what it takes to shine in Kenya Premier League. I wish best of luck,” said the football enthusiast
