The employment court has ordered a consultancy firm to pay its former employee Sh450,000 for sacking her while she was in a coma in hospital. Justice Mathew Nduma said Sheer Logic Management Consultants Limited illegally terminated Natasha Kafara’s employment with no valid reason. “The respondent (Sheer) acted in an inhuman and cruel manner towards the claimant,” Nduma said. Working for Airtel Limited as a shop manager in Kericho, Kafara was involved in a road accident while travelling to Bungoma on a personal errand in September 2015. She sustained injuries to the left arm and the spine, among other areas, and was admitted to the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital, where she was in a coma for four days. She was discharged on October 25, 2015, when she was informed by her doctor that Airtel had since terminated her employment. Upon discharge, Kafara visited the Anniversary Towers, Nairobi, where she was offered a cheque and later offered a termination letter from the Kisumu Airtel office. Aggrieved, she moved to court in February 2018, sought a declaration that her termination was unlawful and demanded damages. On employment, the claimant was paid a monthly salary of Sh81,000 and she had only worked for four months when she was dismissed. In response, Sheer Limited denied unlawfully terminating the contract. However, Justice Nduma declared the termination unfair and unlawful. “The claimant had served for four months with about five months left to complete the fixed term contract… It was not demonstrated by the respondent that the claimant could not any longer continue to work on account of her injuries,” Nduma said. He added that the accident that caused the injuries to the claimant was not self-inflicted, hence she did not contribute to the termination. She was not paid terminal benefits and was not compensated for the job loss. The court thus awarded Kafara Sh450,000 as compensation for illegal dismissal, untaken leave and four months' salary.
