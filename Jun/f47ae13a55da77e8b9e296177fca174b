A man arrested for defilement has died in a Bungoma police cell. Josiah Namunyu, 34, was beaten by an angry mob before his arrest. Bungoma South OCPD Wilson Nanga denied police beat the suspect in the cell. "We suspect he might have died from injuries sustained when he was beaten by the angry mob. He was not beaten by police officers as alleged," he said. Reports indicate that Namunyu developed breathing difficulties before he collapsed and died. Nanga said the suspect did not die due to congestion in the cells. He said there is enough space in the remand prison. "Men use both female and male cells, women were transferred to the children's cells," he said. Namunyu, who is from Mayanja in Kanduyi subcounty, was beaten by a mob for allegedly defiling a 16-year-old. After the beating on Friday, he was taken to the Bungoma County Referral Hospital, where he was treated and discharged. The body was taken to Bungoma County Referral Hospital mortuary for postmortem.
