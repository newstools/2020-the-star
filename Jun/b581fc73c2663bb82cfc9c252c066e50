Huduma centres will begin providing high demand services in phases, Public Service CAS Rachel Shebesh has said. Huduma centres had reduced the services provided to two - collection of IDs and birth certificates. However, Shebesh said there has been demand for NHIF cards, ID replacements among others, necessitating a phased resumption of services. "Due to increasing demands for other end to end services in this time such as NHIF and replacement of IDâ€™s, Huduma Kenya is preparing to provide more high demand services in the Huduma centres in a phased approach, keeping in mind the safety of staff and customers as the top most priority," she said. The CAS spoke on Tuesday when she visited Huduma Centre GPO to take stock of the safety measures in place to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. She said safety measures will be observed as services resume, including ensuring all staff wear masks, providing sanitizers and installing hand washing stations for customers. Shebesh said staff will have PPEs and that strict measures on social distancing will be implemented inside the Huduma Centre halls. Furthermore, Huduma Kenya will in the coming weeks work on rolling out least 25 end-to-end services online in a bid to ensure citizens can access services from anywhere. "During this Covid-19 season, customers can continue accessing Huduma Kenya assistance via the Huduma contact center, 020 6900020 and the Huduma Kenya social media channels," Shebesh said. The CAS was accompanied by the newly appointed Huduma Kenya CEO, James Buyekane.
