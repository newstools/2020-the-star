A clergyman has told greedy people not to sell donations of food for people suffering from the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. Pastor Sylvester Achola of the Baptist Church in Parklands, Nairobi, said on Sunday the habit was discouraging donors and people of goodwill who were giving donations to help those in need. “We are aware some people have been receiving and selling food meant to assist those who have been badly hit by the effects of the pandemic. It is morally wrong and even criminal to do so,” the cleric said. He spoke while distributing food rations to families at the Project Lucas Rescue Centre in Ruiru, Kiambu county. Achola also appealed to institutions and well-to-do people to make contributions to alleviate the suffering of people who lost their jobs because of the coronavirus. Since the onset of Covid-19, he added, the Lucas Rescue Centre that sheltered 200 orphans has been closed. However, it has been supporting orphans and destitute families through donations. Achola who is the church's youth pastor, praised President Uhuru Kenyatta for extending the cessation of movement between Nairobi and other counties as well as postponing the reopening of churches and schools. “The President’s decision not to open up the country was the right one at this time when the infection figures have continued to rise. Let us abide by the rules and continue staying at home," he said. Thika-based Calvary Chosen Centre Presiding Bishop David Ngari said he was shocked by Kenyans who were eagerly awaiting relaxation of the rules “so that they could go out and celebrate”. Rev Ngari, who is also the leader of the Covenant Clergy Alliance, said Kenyans should take the Covid-19 pandemic seriously and stop behaving casually. (Edited by V. Graham)
