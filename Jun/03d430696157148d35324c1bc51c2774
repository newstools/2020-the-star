The courts reopened on Monday after three months of scaled down operations following the coronavirus pandemic. Chief Justice David Maraga had on March 16 announced the scaling down of operations, after the first few cases of Covid-19 were reported. On Monday, some proceedings were still being conducted at the parking lot. Green signs were put on the ground to indicate the one metre social distancing rule to be observed. Tents have also been set up with seats, as opposed to before when cases were being heard in the open.
