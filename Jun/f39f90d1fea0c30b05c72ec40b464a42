Mathare United coach Salim Ali has commended the current Football Kenya Federation regime’s efforts to nurture and develop age-group talent and women’s football in the country. The federation re-introduced the FKF women’s Premier League and Division One Leagues in 2016, giving life to Harambee Starlets, who have achieved a lot over the last four years. They closed the year 2019 as champions after winning the Cecafa women’s Championships in Tanzania for the first time ever. At the start of 2019, FKF actualised the National Centre of Excellence which brought together 20 young players under the age of 15, on a homeschooling program. The U-15 boys took part in the 2019 Mediterranean International Cup in Spain, bowing out in the quarter-final. They also took part in the Cecafa U-15 tournament in Eritrea, where they reached the finals of the inaugural junior competition. “The current federation has made it their agenda to give priority to women’s football and nurture young football talent,”said Salim Ali.
