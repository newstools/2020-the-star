President Uhuru Kenyatta and Chief Justice David Maraga should look for common ground to end their strained relationship, Gem MP Elisha Odhiambo has said. He said the duo's relationship was key in helping the country's economy recover. “The President and the Chief Justice should focus on steering the country forward both in terms of judicial services and in terms of the common goals of Kenyans,” Odhiambo said. Maraga has accused the Executive of ignoring court orders and refusing to appoint 41 judges recommended by the JSC.  MP Odhiambo said this was not the time for the President or the Chief Justice to flex their muscles when the country is hurting due to the coronavirus pandemic. The two should be consulting on how institutions like the Judiciary could be reopened by observing health guidelines. Attorney General Kihara Kariuki on Monday turned the heat on the head of the Judiciary, accusing him of seeking public sympathy to hide his failures and mismanagement of the Judiciary. But Odhiambo said the time to assess the Chief Justice's scorecard is yet to come and asked all stakeholders not to escalate the war between Uhuru and Maraga but instead look for a solution. Kariuki, the chief legal adviser to the President, said it was immoral for the CJ to rant in public about his frustrations with the Executive when he had a direct line to access the Head of State. The Gem MP said public attacks against the President by the Chief Justice were unwarranted as there were many mechanisms for Marag to address his grievances amicably. Odhiambo said MPs would investigate the dispute that has poisoned the relationship between the Executive and Judiciary . Edited by Henry Makori
