Veteran public relations practitioner Gina Din-Kariuki is set to receive an Outstanding Individual Achievement Sabre Award this year. The Sabre (Superior Achievement in Branding, Reputation and Engagement) Awards are the world’s largest public relations awards. Gina ran her firm Gina Din Group for over two decades. She is being recognised as a trailblazer in African public relations, a pioneering woman entrepreneur, a mentor to other female professionals and a philanthropist through her charitable organisation 'The Gina Din Foundation'. The group has managed communications and stakeholder engagement for several blue-chip organisations, including Safaricom, KCB, Kenya Red Cross, Samsung and General Motors. The firm also handled major crises, including the 2007 Kenya Airways plane crash in Doula, and was behind the ‘Kenyans for Kenya’ initiative, a response to hunger and famine that was ravaging some parts of Kenya in 2011. Before launching her firm, she was the head of corporate affairs for Barclays Bank of Kenya. Since then, she has provided strategic counsel to 80 per cent of the corporate market in Kenya and has been a leader in shaping conversations in Africa. Gina Din Group was for many years an affiliate of Burson-Marsteller. For the past three years, it has been an affiliate of Edelman until it was fully acquired by the global agency in February this year. Gina has been named one of the continent’s 100 Most Influential People by New African magazine and in 2015 was named East Africa Businesswoman of the year.
