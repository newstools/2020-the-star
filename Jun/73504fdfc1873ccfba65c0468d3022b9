Football Kenya Federation (FKF) South Coast branch chairman Gabriel Mghendi has tipped national body’s president Nick Mwendwa to take the country’s football to the next level in the next four years. Mghedi said the federation’s record in the last four years speaks volumes and can not be compared to the  former regimes. “ We now have Odibets on board as grass-root county leagues partner after FKF sealed a three-year deal that includes provision of playing kit to all clubs,” he added. He also said the under Mwendwa’s regime, FKF Women’s Premier League and Division One Leagues have been revived and continue to breathe life into Harambee Starlets, who have achieved a lot over the last four years. Starlets won the Cecafa women’s championships in Tanzania for the first time ever last year . Mghedi said the national office also actualised the National Center of Excellence which brought together 20 youths under the age of 15, on a home-schooling program. The national boys’ U-15 took part in the 2019 Mediterranean International Cup in Spain, bowing out in the quarterfinal. They also took part in the Cecafa U-15 tournament in Eritrea, where they reached the final of the inaugural junior competition. “I would especially like to appreciate the current office under Mwendwa for giving a voice to women’s football and actualising the Kenya U-16 boys team that nurtures young football talent,” he said.
