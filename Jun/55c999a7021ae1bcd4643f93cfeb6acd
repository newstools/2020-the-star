Two Sarova Stanley IT officers are seeking President Uhuru Kenyatta's statement in a case in which they have been charged with intercepting CCTV footage showing his entourage on June 2 along Kenyatta Avenue. Patrick Rading and Janet Magoma were arraigned on Wednesday but released on Sh10,000 bail. Their lawyer Danstan Omari told magistrate Bernard Ochoi that taking such a footage is not a security risk as his clients may just be patriotic Kenyans. Omari said they will be demanding the footage and the statements of the President’s and former PM Raila Odinga who are alleged to have been on the entourage on the night of June 2. He said they will use them as evidence adding that his clients have since lost their jobs. The two were charged under the Computer Misuse and Cybercrimes Act. It is alleged that on June 2 around 8pm in Nairobi county, the two intercepted without authorisation a security footage capturing the President’s entourage along Kenyatta avenue. The state did not oppose their release on bail but challenged the defence to produce evidence showing they have indeed lost their jobs as alleged. The magistrate directed the state to provide the defence with all the witness statements and documentary evidence they intend to use during trial. The case will be mentioned on July 2.
