Nairobi Senator Johnson Sakaja on Wednesday lauded DPP Noordin Haji, a day after he called for the arrest of a policeman accused of fatally shooting Yasin Moyo when enforcing the dusk-to-dawn curfew. The 13-year-old boy was fatally shot by police on his home balcony on March 30 in Kiamaiko, during the curfew implementation. The incident caused an uproar. Yasin was a standard eight student at Ndururuno Primary School and was at home after the government closed all learning institutions. On Tuesday, Haji approved the arrest and prosecution of an officer- Duncan Ndiema Ndiwah in connection with shooting. Sakaja commended Haji for the move towards ensuring justice for the family. "We must not relent until we finally get justice for Yasin Moyo. We continue to stand with his family. Thank you @ODPP_KE for moving ahead on this, as promised I will continue following this up," the lawmaker tweeted. Following the incident, Sakaja who also chairs the Senate ad-hoc committee on his visit to the family in April spoke condemning the manner in which Police were enforcing the curfew. "I promise you, even if it means using my own resources, we must get justice for Yasin so that tomorrow another officer doesn’t assume they can do things anyhow thinking they will go scot-free," Sakaja told the family at the time. The Senator has since taken to the Senate floor to prosecute the matter, effectively putting pressure on the relevant institutions to see that justice is served. Sakaja has further pushed that IPOA table a report to the Senate by June 15 indicating police officers who have been prosecuted, the actions taken against them and the charges. Yasin was killed 20 minutes from the onset of the first day of the curfew on March  27. On Tuesday, the Independent Policing Oversight Authority said that 15 people have been killed since the onset of curfew order. Ipoa said the 15 deaths are among 87 complaints against the police it has received since March 27.
