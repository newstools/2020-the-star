Children will have a chance to sit with top government officials and air their issues in commemoration of the Day of the African Child. Events to mark the upcoming Day of the African Child that is commemorated every June 16Â  were launched on Tuesday. Children in Kenya have national and county assemblies where they have a chance to discuss issues affecting them and learn to respect and appreciate their diversities. The Kenya Children Assembly was established in 2011 and has since then acted as a unifying organ that brings all children from diverse backgrounds. Speaking to the Star, CEO National Council for Children Services Abdinoor Sheik Mohammed said the assemblies have advanced child participation and have chapters in all 47 counties. "We use the children themselves as their own advocates, their own whistleblowers. We believe protected, empowered children can stand for themselves and resist. The key to the whole thing is community enlightenment and sensitisation," he said. The children elect themselves to positions such as president, governor and member of the assembly. The assemblies offer children an opportunity to understand government policies and development plans down. This year's theme is 'Access to child-friendly justice in Africa'. In Kenya, one of the ways the government is trying to improve access to child-friendly justice is by seeking alternative conflict resolution mechanisms for children. Some of the methods include diversion, plea bargaining and meditation. "These alternatives are to ensure children take less time in the justice system and do not suffer in detention," Mohammed said.
