Kenya Sevens vice captain Jeffrey Oluoch will be out for for two and and half months after undergoing wrist surgery. The Homeboyz's back has had a recurring injury in the course of the season and management thought this was the best time to have him undergo surgery with sport activities currently on a break. Kenya 7’s physiotherapist Lameck Bogonko said the surgery was their best option under the circumstances. “I think the timing is good and with sports suspended, we hope to have him fully recovered fully and in good shape by the time we head to September,” added Bogonko. Should the Covid-19 situation ease, Kenya Sevens will be lined up to play the final four legs of the circuit in Paris and London Sevens in September and the Singapore and Hong Kong in October. Bogonko was hopeful that Oluoch may be part of the series. “I hope he will be fit to play especially for the October events. He is one of our key players who offers leadership and has the ability to score tries and create chances for his teammates,” he added. Bogonko said the squad has been sent individual coaching programmes to keep them busy for the remainder of the season.  By the time the season resumes, Kenya Sevens are expected to have a new coach after the union parted company with New Zealander Paul Feeney due to uncertainty over the Coronavirus pandemic. Feeney had guided the side to the 2020 Tokyo Olympics after winning the Africa Cup Sevens title in South Africa. He, however, had a mixed bag of performances on the World Sevens Series with Shujaa ranked 11th on 36 points with only two Main Cup quarterfinal appearances out of six tournaments played. A decision on the head coach position will be done by the end of month.
