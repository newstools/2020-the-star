Two Kibuye Market traders have obtained court orders restraining the Kisumu administration from carrying out further demolitions. The county last week demolished stalls to pave way for a Sh479 million upgrade of the market to accommodate more traders and offer modern facilities. Juma Odeyo and Joseph Bollo had moved to court through Kibuye Market Traders Association and Kibuye Market Traders’ Welfare Association. Kisumu senior principal magistrate Robinson Ondieki stopped the county and city manager Dorice Ombara from further demolitions. Ondieki ordered that both parties appear before the court on June 23 for further directions. Last week, hundreds of Kibuye traders woke up to find their stalls flattened to the ground. The traders said the county had taken advantage of anti-coronavirus rules to punish them since they could not leave their houses at night due to curfew to salvage their properties. Local leaders criticised the demolitions, saying traders should have been engaged and given time to remove their goods. Kisumu Senator Fred Outa faulted how the exercise was carried out deep in the wee hours of the morning. "What is the need of destroying small businesses in Kisumu, yet there is no food given to those who are affected?" he asked. Outa said he has received complaints from the traders that they were not given any notice of demolition. He said traders depend on selling their goods for daily livelihood. “Nobody is opposed to development in the county, but we must undertake it in an organised and humane manner,” he said. Ombara said that they will not relent until an upgrade of the market is realised. She accused cartels of disrupting the development of the markets and said some politicians are funding traders to go to court and stop the construction. (edited by o. owino)
