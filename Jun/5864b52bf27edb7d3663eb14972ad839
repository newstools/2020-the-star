Maasai leaders and technocrats on Sunday reacted angrily to reports that the World Bank had deleted the community from the list of indigenous people. Rianto Mpoke, a prominent intellectual from the Kajiado, said the decision will have a serious implication on the lives of more than 2 million people in East Africa. “We must take this matter with the seriousness it deserves,” Mpoke said. Neighbours Initiative Alliance chief executive officer Kenny Matampash said the decision by the World Bank is “despicable”. “I term it colonial mentality coupled with capitalistic greed aimed at standardising the extinction of a people's history,” Matampash said. Matampash said the capitalistic and alien approach to privatising pastoralist lands in Kenya has led to the unprecedented and uncontrolled land sale and poor land-use policies. The World Bank revised the benchmark standards for indigenous people a week ago and deleted the Maasai from the list. The standard qualifications used by the World Bank say that indigenous people are supposed to be culturally distinct societies and communities. Indigenous people also often face impediments to their access to natural resources, basic services, the formal economy, and justice, as well as their participation in decision making.
