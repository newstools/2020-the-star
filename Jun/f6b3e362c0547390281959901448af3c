Covid -19 was first reported in the country in March leading to the closure of learning institutions and work places. This led to the government to announce measures for protecting oneself from the virus by washing hands frequently, stop shaking hands, wearing masks and staying at home. The pandemic has affected many people in the world including in Kenya where many have been infected while over 100 have died. ln offices, buildings, supermarkets and other business places, security companies have been tasked to monitor the temperature of people entering buildings and to offers sanitiser to ensure that all who access the building. But something important seems to be forgotten and that is security. It is now common to enter buildings without being frisked. Instead, the security personnel is tasked with the job of taking the temperature using thermal guns and offering sanitiser, forgetting to check visitors for weapons or contraband. Nowadays, no one is frisked or asked for ID. This provides an opportunity for criminals to plot their evil and execute it. Let security personnel continue the work of frisking people entering buildings and also use metal detectors as they take temperatures and give sanitiser. This will ensure Kenya's business premises are safe.  Mombasa
