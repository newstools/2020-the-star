ODM eader Raila Odinga is recovering well after undergoing minor surgery, party communication chief Philip Etale said on Monday. Etale said that the doctors at a Dubai-based hospital identified the problem on his back. " It was minor and a procedure carried out successfully. He is now on bed rest like every other patient who gets out of the theatre would. He is recuperating and will be back home soon," Etale said. Raila flew out of the country on June 21 for the United Arab Emirates. ODM deputy chair and Mombasa Governor Ali Hassan Joho had earlier said that Raila was progressing well. "We continue to pray for him. I have no doubt that within the shortest time possible, baba will be back in Kenya," Joho said. Via Facebook on Friday, Joho said that Raila, like any other human being, underwent a procedure. "Let us not forget that even our leaders are still human beings. They have to deal with issues that man goes through. Let us pray for him. I feel happy that he is recovering well," he said.
