More than 150 victims of floods in Nyatike have received relief food and other items from the Rotary Club of Suna Migori. The club’s president Joseph Ayieko distributed sugar, maize flour, cooking oil, blankets, reusable sanitary pads and water treatment drugs on Wednesday at Kabuto Primary School. Ayieko called on residents to “start taking personal steps to relocate to higher grounds where the effects of the annual torrential rains would not hit you again.” “Rotary Club of Suna Migori or any other organisation or people of goodwill will not always come to your aid in times of calamities hence your security should first start with you before it comes from outside,” Ayieko said. Several people in Nyatike and especially in Kabuto, Nyora, Aneko and Angugo villages always face perennial displacement by floods. The floods destroy homes and sweep away livestock almost every year. Ayieko urged residents to strictly observe the Ministry of Health and government protocols on Covid-19 in order to avoid contracting the disease. The people must help the government stop the disease from spreading further to communities, he said. He urged residents to wash their hands with soap and water, wear masks and keeping a social distance to stay safe from the coronavirus. (edited by o. owino)
