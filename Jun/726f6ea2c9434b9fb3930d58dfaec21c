Leading pro-golfer David Wakhu has been keeping tabs on his swings and putts ostensibly to keep fit and ready for action as government seek ways to contain the Covid-19 pandemic. Golfers have continued with non-competitive play albeit stringent restrictions since the first case of coronavirus was reported in country in March. The golfers  are allowed a maximum of three players per flight amid self-caddied play. Wakhu has, therefore, taken advantage of the opportunity to stay in his best form. The soft-spoken golfer finished fifth overall in the 2019/2020 Safari Tour standings behind Dismas Indiza, Thika Club’s Simon Ngige Muthaiga’s Greg Snow and Eric Ooko of Golf Park. He was hoping to represent the country for the umpteenth time in Kenya Open before the event was cancelled. “I was hoping to play in the Kenya Open again this year. But after the cancellation, I have had to keep in good physical condition just in case things improve. Every cloud has a silver lining and although we have lost quite a lot in terms revenue, good things may be in the offing,” he said. “I have been working very hard since the pandemic restrictions were announced and I have never stopped practising. I’m planning to play well during the Kenya Open and other international assignments. The essence is to keep my swing where I can play at my best and also do well in the short game.” Wakhu is currently training at the nine- hole Golf Park course. “As a result, I have improved a lot and I’m looking forward to feature prominently for the country in Kenya Open and other events to come.”
