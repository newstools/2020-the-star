The government plans to ban the importation of milk products and eggs to cushion farmers and protect jobs. Trade PS Johnson Weru said on Monday that CS Betty Maina and CAS Lawrence Karanja will next week issue the ban. “We are going to invoke the Kenya Trade Remedies Agency Act to the fullest for the benefit of our dairy and poultry farmers,” he said. Weru said the President wants farmers protected and that is why he increased the price of milk from Sh17 to Sh34. But such increment will not benefit farmers if products from outside continue to be allowed into the country. Weru urged farmers to take advantage of the new law and ensure they produce quality milk. “Imported eggs are also killing jobs in our country. We want to end this noise as Parliament has given us the powers,” Weru said. He spoke in Ol Kalou during the handing over of the site for construction of potato cold storage to the contractor. The project is being undertaken by the national government. The PS was accompanied by CAS Karanja. Ol Kalou dairy farmers said this is the best news, especially at this time when the economy has been dealt a big blow by Covid-19. “It shows President Uhuru Kenyatta has the interest of the small farmer at heart. The ban will open a wider market for local products, increase prices and create more jobs,” Bishop Francis Karara said. Edited by A.N
