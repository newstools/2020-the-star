 Residents of Bissil town in Kajiado on Thursday blocked the Kajiado-Namanga road in protest against the arrest of former Matapato North MCA Lesalaon ole Seki for allegedly inciting the public against wildlife. Police lobed teargas at the protesters who were burning tyres and demanding the unconditional release of the politician. Kenya Wildlife Service Kajiado boss Muteru Njauuini confirmed Seki's arrest. “We have taken him in and the police are processing charges for his arraignment,” Njauuini said. He claimed that he was not aware of what was happening in Bissil. Motorists were stranded for close to three hours before the police put off the fire and unblocked the highway. Kajiado Central police commander Daudi Lornyokwe said they cleared the road after 1pm "although pockets of demonstrators" were still giving his officers a hard time. Residents accused Seki’s successor Dickson Nkaloyo of colluding with KWS against the former ward representative. But Nkaloyo denied any part in Seki’s arrest. “I have been at the forefront of Kajiado Central people against stray wildlife,” he said and asked the KWS and the police to build more cells to accommodate those with similar views. “I am repeating now that we shall kill, without seeking permission from anybody, all wildlife destroying our farms. We have the right to defend our property,” Nkaloyo said by phone. Seki had not been taken to court late in the afternoon.  - mwaniki fm
