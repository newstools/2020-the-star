Any customer found with more than four bottles of beer on the table in an eatery will be arrested and quarantined, a government officer has warned. Nyeri Central deputy county commissioner Joseph Mwangi said the the operating licence of the eatery involved will also be revoked permanently. Speaking to the media on Monday, the DCC said some of the 28 eateries allowed to operate in Nyeri town have been taking advantage to sell beer to customers, thus operating like bars. Anyone found with more than four bottles of beer will be assumed to have visited such outlets to drink, he said. The administrator said people have been pretending to be going for food in the eateries but end up drinking more than 10 bottles of beer pretending to be waiting for food. “All bars remain closed. But we have realised there is this tendency of people getting into eateries and ordering 10 bottles of beer while pretending to wait for food,” he said. He said the subcounty security surveillance committee will conduct spot checks and take action against businesspeople who allow customers to access their premises without washing their hands. Others to face action include eatery owners who will be operating beyond 7pm and people who do not wear face masks. “If we find anyone walking around town without a mask, then we will assume that the person is Covid-19 positive and is out to spread the diseases and arrest them,” he said. Mwangi said people have dropped their guards and are now disregarding guidelines, including handwashing, wearing of face masks and keeping social distance. He said when the first case was confirmed in the country, people followed the containment measures by the government religiously but they now seem to have relaxed, despite a surge in the number of cases. “It is very unfortunate that people have gone back to their normal ways of life, despite Nyeri recording 10 cases and one death from the disease,” he said.
