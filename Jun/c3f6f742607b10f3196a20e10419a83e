Earlier on, Waluke's lawyer Cliff Ombeta pleaded with the court to have mercy on the legislator. "He can be a better person today. If you side with us, then you will understand that he needs leniency. Please your honor," Ombeta said. Ombeta said they are not demanding but requesting. "We are begging that you give us the most lenient sentence. It is provided for in the laws. Look at his age, he is not a young man," he said. "He has come to court religiously and respects the court. He knows his duty. Is that the kind of person we would want locked for ever? This is a good man." Ombeta said Waluke has worked in the civil servant because he was effective and had no bad record.
