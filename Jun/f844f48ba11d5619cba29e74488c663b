A man suspected of impersonating a doctor and obtaining goods worth Sh5.7 million from a businessman by false pretence has been charged in court. David Ambuku aka Dr Lugonze was accused of fraudulently obtaining the money from Ibrahim Aden pretending he had been awarded a tender by the Ministry of Health to supply 1,000 non- contact infrared thermometers valued at Sh5.7 million. He also purported that a local purchase order dated May 4 from the Ministry of Health was genuine to enable Aden supply the goods to the ministry. Ambuku allegedly committed the offence on May 8 at Digital Marketing Limited at Dunhill Building in Westlands. It is further alleged that between May 4 and 20 at Afya House in Nairobi, Ambuku falsely presented himself as a procurement officer at the Health ministry thereby making Aden believe that a tender was genuine to enable him to supply the thermometers and 20,000 boxes of gloves to the ministry. Ambuku is facing five other counts of obtaining goods by false pretence, forgery and impersonating a public officer. He denied the charges before magistrate Muthoni Nzibe who released him on Sh2 million bail. In the same court, Ambuku also denied obtaining Sh1.6 million from John Kiarie by pretending a tender to supply 200 anti-lock jam pins to the Ministry of Interior was genuine. He allegedly committed the offence on dates between November 2019 and March 19 at National Police Service offices at Jogoo House. Ambuku is further charged with impersonation by presenting himself to be a staffer of the Interior ministry. He was released on Sh200,000 bail pending mentioning on July 30. Edited by R.Wamochie
