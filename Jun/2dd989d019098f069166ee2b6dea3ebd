Machakos county government has shut down Shalom Hospital in Athi River after Covid 19 patients died at the facility. The hospital was sealed off on Friday evening out of fear that some other patients might have been infected with coronavirus. Four Covid-19 patients were announced dead on different dates after being referred to Kenyatta National Hospital. Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua in a press statement said the county government held consultations with the Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Council and the Director General of Health and decided to seal off the hospital following the deaths. Mutua said other inpatients have also tested positive for coronavirus and it is feared the patients contracted the virus while in hospital. A health worker has also tested positive. "The hospital is now a quarantine facility and, therefore, no one is allowed to get in or leave the hospital," Mutua said. The governor said screening process and testing for Covid-19 has started and might take several days. "Further decisions will be undertaken according to evaluation of the relevant agencies involved in the provision of healthcare and combating Covid-19," Mutua said. Locals are now being urged to be patient as the county ensures all health facilities are safe so as to avoid hospital-based infections. Edited by EKibii
