@robertomollo3 A hippopotamus on Sunday evening killed a boy on Lake Victoria's Seka beach in Karachuonyo constituency. Ebenezer Oketch, 9, was attacked by the animal as he bathed at the lakeshore. Eyewitnesses said two children who were with the boy escaped unhurt. “The hippo mauled the boy and broke his ribs. The animal approached the children from behind and attacked the boy,” the witness said. Millicent Odundo, the Kenya Wildlife Services officer in charge Homa Bay, said the hippo attacked and dragged the minor inside the lake where he died. She said the boy succumbed to injuries he sustained after the attack. “We’re appealing to children and residents to avoid going in areas frequented by hippos,” Odundo said. The officer said they helped the family retrieve the body and took it to Gendia Mission Hospital mortuary. Attacks by hippos and crocodiles on people have increased in beaches along the lake since water levels began to rise. Odundo called on the residents to stop washing clothes and utensils at the lakeshore to prevent attacks by the animals. “Most of the times the animals are attracted by food remains people dispose near the lake. They are likely to attack to get the food,” she added. (edited by o. owino)
