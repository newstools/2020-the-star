Health CS Mutahi Kagwe has made it clear that the directive to close bars has not been lifted. "Some are saying they want to order 1 ‘Kagwe special’. So if you are caught selling alcohol or opening any bar, your license will be withdrawn permanently," Kagwe said. President Uhuru Kenyatta on Saturday announced that he has extended the ban on opening of bars for another 30 days. Uhuru said bars will be closed for 30 more days as the country continues to fight the Covid-19 pandemic. He also extended the nationwide curfew for another 30 days.
