When Education CS George Magoha received the Education Covid-19 Response Report, he told parents to engage in training and guiding their children. Teaching the children kindness, positivity, patience, persistence, believing in themselves and working hard are excellent virtues to impart in children. In the 90's and 2000s, there were very few vehicles to take children to school. Most children went to school on foot. But nowadays, some teachers have said that when they take pupils or students for trips, the children say they forgot the way back and the teachers have to take them back to school. They should be taught how to use maps and directions from home. Parents can teach their children cooking and making basic food like cooking tea. The environment is also good for parents to teach their children skills like gardening, planting trees and cleaning. Communication skills are also essential for children, hence they should not be allowed to drown their time in video games. Home chores like washing dishes and cleaning the house are also important for children to learn now that they are stuck at home. They should also be taught how to make clean money and save it as opposed to spending the whole day in front of a screen.Â  It would also be a good break from studying and a constructive activity that can shape their lives. Not many children cross the road alone, most are collected by buses, vans and status. This would be the best time for the to be taught how to cross the road and practise it. The children were not used to playing with neighbours and here they will learn skills of sharing, love and friendship. The children should also be taught how to plan for their lives and relating with other adults in the neighbourhood. They should be taught how to protect themselves from misleading influence and how to make good use of the internet.  Social commentator Mombasa
