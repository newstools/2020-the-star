Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana on Friday declared that his name will be in the ballot to succeed President Uhuru Kenyatta come 2022. Kibwana who is serving his second and last term as governor said, “I have listened to the voice of Wanjiku asking me to run for presidency in the coming election.” “I am available, ready and willing to be Wanjiku's President. Will go all the way to the Ballot Box with Wanjiku in 2022. We must ensure devolution works for our communities,” Kibwana announced his candidature in a twitter post. It is not the first time Kibwana said he had “listened to the voice of Wanjiku". Last year in August, while attending the annual Tobong’u Lore Festival in Turkana, he again said he will be running for the top seat. Kivutha’s candidature is premised on his good track record as the governor, his humility and dedication to public service. However his critics say much of it is just but public relations stunts. He resigned last year as the chaiman of Kalonzo Musyoka’s Wiper Democratic Movement party citing “issues within the party”. His position was taken over by former Matuga MP Chirau Ali Mwakwere. Kivutha now joins the likes of Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua and Kalonzo who have also expressed interests to run for presidency from the Ukambani region.
