Narc national chairman Miltonic Kimanzi has called for the dissolution of the Kitui county government. Kimanzi said on Monday that Governor Charity Ngilu and Kitui MCAs have become incompatible and there is a plot to impeach the governor. “Since the MCAs have ganged up with Kitui Senator Enoch Wambua to impeach Governor Ngilu, she should act with speed by pre-empting the move and writing to President Uhuru Kenyatta to ask him to dissolve Kitui county,” Kimanzi said. Kimanzi, who was in the company of Ngilu supporters, said Kitui MCAs, most of whom are in Wiper, had vowed to frustrate the governor’s development plans. “MCAs have been shooting down and failing to approve Ngilu’s development plans and have of late held two meetings, one in Mwingi and another elsewhere, to plan the governor's impeachment,” he said. But county assembly majority whip Stephen Musili on Tuesday dismissed those calling for the dissolution of the county government as misadvised puppets of Governor Ngilu. “If Ngilu has found the going tough, she should just resign so that the county can get a more efficient governor to run it. The call for dissolution is a smokescreen from people who want to stir confusion to protect a person who has failed in her role,” he said The Kyuso ward representative, however, confirmed that Kitui MCAs have resolved to impeach the governor. “For the two years she has been the governor, our county had not realised any tangible development save for pilferage of funds,” Musili said. He defended Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka and Senator Wambua against accusations they were inciting MCAs against Ngilu. “We are independent-minded leaders with the capacity to make worthy decisions when things are not going right,” Musili said.
