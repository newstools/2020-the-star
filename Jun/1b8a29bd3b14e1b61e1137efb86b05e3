One Vibe Africa has unveiled the sixth annual Madaraka Festival, which will be streamed on One Vibe TV on YouTube on June 27. The concert money will support 500 small businesses run by women in Mathare, Manyatta and Nyalenda slums in Kenya. The festival will also bring Africaâ€™s finest musicians and creatives together with world-renowned artistes and innovators for a celebration of music and civic purpose. In a statement, the organisers say, "The $50,000 we are hoping to raise through Panga Bizz after corona pandemic will be used to provide grants of $100 to each female-owned business. " We will be telling the stories of the women we are supporting through this initiative throughout the campaign to help connect them to the audiences and supporters of this campaign."
