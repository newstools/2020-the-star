While the country marked Madaraka Day in an unprecedented manner - virtually as President Uhuru Kenyatta led celebrations from State House with under 20 invitees - it was just another ordinary day at Gikomba market. Kenyans who might have ordinarily gone to mark the country's obtaining self rule at a stadium complete with pomp and colour from choirs and a speech by the President instead went for shopping at the busy market. A sea of clothes were on display for sale, while other traders sold food - including fried fish. Kenya is close to reaching the 2,000 mark of coronavirus infections with the government continually drumming in the importance of maintaining social distancing and staying home. Nairobi is a hot spot for the virus with the highest number of cases, followed by Mombasa.
