This was confirmed by Health CS Mutahi Kagwe in a letter to the Council of Governors chairperson Wycliffe Oparanya. Kagwe said in the renewed deal, counties  will continue to meet their obligations as per the Memorandum of Understanding signed in May 2018. According to the MoU, the ministry will pay the doctors’ salaries, while the counties will cater for their accommodation, ground transport and other work-related expenses. "This is to notify you that the ministry has renewed the bilateral agreement between Kenya and the Republic of Cuba on provision of specialised healthcare services, through the deployment of Cuban doctors.The continued services of the doctors in the counties is therefore assured," Kagwe said. He said during the renewed period, the ministry will be reviewing the specialisation mix to respond to the health needs within the counties. The initial MoU stated that the specialists would work for two years, while 50 Kenyan doctors train in Cuba for two years. The MoU obligates the ministry to ensure the specialists are paid their salaries by the tenth day of every month, to pay for their flights to Kenya and back to Cuba during annual leaves and final departure.
