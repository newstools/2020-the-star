Machakos county government has closed eight market places for 14 days following reports of Covid-19 cases in the county. The county said the markets in Kangundo and Mwala subcounty will remain closed to allow fumigation and to prevent further spread. This comes after three Covid-19 patients sneaked to their residential homes and interacted with people in different towns before being taken for isolation. The three were later tested and found to be positive before being taken to Kinianie isolation centre for treatment. In Masii, Mwala subcounty; Ilinge, Mitheu and Katheka markets were closed on Friday after it was reported that a man who sneaked into the county from Nairobi interacted with locals in different liquor joints. In Kangundo subcounty, Kithini market was closed on Thursday. Decentralised units CEC Titus Kavila said movement of people is still allowed but cautioned residents to be cautious and follow the government’s directives to prevent further spread of coronavirus. Speaking in Machakos on Friday, Kavila urged residents to be extra vigilant and report to chiefs any suspicious individuals who might have returned from other places. He warned those who will be found violating the containment measures put in place by the government that they will face the law. The county, Kavila said, has learned that people were becoming reluctant and were not following the rules which might trigger more infections if action is not taken. Last week, the county also closed three markets in Katheka Kai, Chai Moto and Kaani after a coronavirus patient was buried in Katheka Kai. The CEC said some people who attended the burial refused to self-quarantine and instead interacted with others prompting the closure of the markets place to allow fumigation. Two more Covid-19 cases were reported on Thursday in Katheka Kai. However, Joska town, which was closed two months ago remains closed until further notice. Edited by R.Wamochie
