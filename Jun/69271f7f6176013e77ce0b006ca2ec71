@magatinews Sand dealers in Kisii and Nyamira counties have sued to force a suspension of the new levies imposed on the commodity by Homa Bay county authorities. In a case filed Friday at the High Court in Homa Bay under a certificate of urgency,Â  the traders want the county to revise the tax rates downwards to sustain their business. The orders were sought by the traders through Dominic Mariga. The dealers, in the court papers, say they are already hurting and may be forced out of business because of the new tax regime. "We thus seek the County Executives to be restrained by the Court to stop collecting the new taxes until this matter is heard and determined," the traders said. The dealers have been crossing to Homa Bay to harvest sand for sale to builders in Kisii, Nyamira, Jericho and Transmara. Homa Bay had scaled up the levies imposed on the commodity in this fiscal year's Finance Bill 2020. The dealers are now required to pay between Sh1,000 and Sh2,000 which they consider punitive. A five-tonne truck haulage, for instance, will cost Sh1,000 while a 10-tonnne truck will cost the dealer Sh2,000. The hike in taxes means that even the costs of putting up houses and structures will also go up according to Mariga. "Already, the cost of transporting raw materials is on the highest side because of the distance. Increasing taxes in such a manner means even investors in the construction industry will have to dig more into pockets in an already a hurting economy," they said. The court is due to give direction on the matter.  (edited by o. owno)
