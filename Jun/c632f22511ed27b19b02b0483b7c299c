Kilifi North MP Owen Baya has called on the government to investigate the alleged killing of two civilians in separate incidents by police enforcing curfew in Tezo ward. The MP said on Saturday it is ironic the Covid-19 pandemic has not killed anyone in Kilifi but police have killed two. "What should be declared a pandemic? Is it the Covid-19 or police?"  Baya asked. Addressing angry villagers, Kilifi OCS Hassan Kochalle urged the public to observe the curfew to avoid confrontations with police officers. He did not comment on the two deaths but said there would be no police harassment. Two weeks ago, a man was allegedly beaten by police officers at Tezo Mbuyuni and left by the roadside. He died two days later at a Kilifi hospital. On Thursday night, Kaisa Ngowa, 32, from Kibarani drowned in a shallow dam at Mtondia along the Kilifi-Malindi highway at about 7.30pm. Amani Katana said she and Ngowa were stopped by police and Ngowa was beaten before he dived into the water. Katana said they were heading home from work when their motorbike ran out of fuel. She said they were confronted by police at a petrol station. "They harassed us and started beating my colleague riding the motorbike. I ran away to save my life but later returned and found he had thrown himself into the water,” she said. She said she and the family reported the matter at Kilifi police station. “We found the body, one arm was broken, and he had several marks on his back. He had bruises on his knees and blood was oozing from his mouth and nose,” Katana said. A witness, Mary Nzai, said she had watched from a distance as police kicked the man. She said he jumped from his motorbike into the water. “The police officers stood there for a while before they took the motorbike and went away with it,” she said. Kibarani MCA called for action against the police officers involved. (Edited by V. Graham)
