Traditional football archrivals, AFC Leopards and Gor Mahia have something to smile about after signing a three-year shirt sponsorship deal with Betsafe. The two clubs have been struggling financially following the exit of SportPesa in August last year. The new agreement is part of Betsafe’s entry into the Kenyan market. However, the deal is expected to take effect in the subsequent months and the details of the amount the two clubs will be pocketing per season remain scanty. “We are very proud to announce this new major deal with the Betsafe brand, especially to our fans. For us, this sponsorship means everything as it gives us a sense of security and work peace to be able to focus even more on becoming the best team in the country. With Betsafe, we have a reliable partner with strong focus on responsible gaming and passion for football,” said Leopards chairman Dan Shikanda. “’We are happy to announce this deal with Betsafe. A very welcomed message to all our fans that we have secured long term financial support from a strong and a safe partner,”’ said Gor chairman Ambrose Rachier. “We will be launching in the Kenyan market very soon and our top priority is to support Kenyan football. Being a responsible gaming provider since the very beginning, we aim to bring more engagement and excitement together with Leopards SC in the near future,” said Tom Bwana who is the firm’s PR & Partner manager.
