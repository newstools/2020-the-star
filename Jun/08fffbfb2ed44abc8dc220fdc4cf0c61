Seven healthcare workers at the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital, have been quarantined after coming into contact with a Covid-19 patient. MTRH boss Dr Wilson Aruasa said the nurses and doctors are suspected to have handled a patient who was scheduled for surgery. The patient, an 18-year-old college student from Langas was diagnosed with the coronavirus during a routine testing a day before the surgery. He did not show any Covid-19 symptoms. Aruasa said the medics will be tested after 14 days to ascertain their status and if  found to be negative they'll return to work. He, however, told residents that there was no cause for alarm as the hospital is attending to patients normally. "Residents should not fear to seek treatment at MTRH over the incident as all the necessary precautions to ensure their health safety is in place," Aruasa told the Star. He noted that all patients who visit the facility  must have their temperature checked. The nurses and doctors exercised caution and were in their protective equipment,  he said. He dismissed reports that there was panic at the hospital after the patient tested positive. “There was no panic as is being rumoured, and work is going on as usual in all wings at the facility”. He noted that nobody would be denied services just because they are positive for the virus. Edited by EKibii
