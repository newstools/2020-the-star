A total of 212 attended the Jubilee Parliamentary Group convened by President Uhuru Kenyatta at the State House, Nairobi, on Tuesday. This, despite Uhuru's government banning gatherings of more than 15 people in a bid to contain the spread of the coronavirus. The past week has seen politicians flout government regulations. Last week, Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli was criticised for holding a meeting at his Kajiado home with tens of attendants with the agenda being discussing the elusive Luhya unity. The meeting was attended by more than 40 people. Health CAS Rashid Aman on Tuesday urged politicians to lead by example in adhering to the directives given by the Ministry of Health. Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen took the opportunity to criticise politicians with a post on Twitter, saying churches and mosques should be allowed to resume gatherings. “212 politicians assembled today in State House to do their thing with masks and social distance. How is it impossible to open churches, mosques, temples with similar protocols?” he said. Church leaders have also been heard in the past urging the government to reopen worship places saying that they will observe the measures set by the government. Anglican Church of Kenya Archbishop Jackson ole Sapit appealed to the government to allow churches to reopen with a condition of operating under the guidelines set by the Ministry of Health. Sapit said that churches should also be allowed to operate since the government allowed restaurants and eateries to reopen under some conditions.
