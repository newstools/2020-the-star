Mombasa Senator Mohamed Faki on Friday commended Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru’s husband Kamotho Waiganjo for not leaving anything to chance to defend his wife. Making his contributions on the report tabled by a Senate special committee that investigated allegations into the impeachment of Waiguru on Friday, Faki noted that Waiganjo had to save his marriage. “We saw the importance of family during such times. There was a moment when lawyer Waiganjo took charge of the matter to ensure that his marriage does not disintegrate by the governor being impeached,” Faki said. Waiguru who was cleared of all allegations levelled against her by the Kirinyaga MCAs exchanged her vows with Waiganjo in July last year at a colourful wedding attended by President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga . Waiguru on Wednesday said she was being hunted for solidly supporting the Building Bridges Initiative. In her closing remarks before the Senate Committee probing her case, Waiguru said that she is being accused for supporting the Handshake between President Uhuru and Raila. Waiganjo was among the lawyers who defend the governor in the Senate as she fought her impeachment charges. The governor survived the impeachment motion after the Senate dismissed the motion seeking to remove her from office on grounds of abuse of office and gross misconduct. The committee cleared her of all the charges stating in their report that they were not substantiated.
