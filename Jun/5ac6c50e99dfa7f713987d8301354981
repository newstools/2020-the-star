Kenyan duo Alphajiri has released ‘Kolea’, which is a collaboration with Jovial. The song tells the dynamics of love in relation to money. Group member Brandon said, "The lyrics by the three great writers are well arranged in the context of rhyme, flow and poetry. The lyrics also provide us with a catchy and simple beautiful bridge." The club banger is a beautiful fusion of Afropop and Zouk genres. "It is well-paced, making it danceable and nice to chill to. There is a distant sound of guitars in the instrumentation. Both their vocals are well laid down," Brandon added. Alphajiri Music comprises Brandon Ochieng' and Paul Kalbanaz, who formed the group in 2015. They are vocalists, songwriters and performers.
