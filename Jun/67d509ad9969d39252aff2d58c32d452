Athletics Kenya (AK) Nyanza South Chairman, Peter Angwenyi, says the only way to win the war against doping in Kenya is by criminalising the vice. Angwenyi said the four-year ban being imposed on drug cheats is not enough. “The measures being taken by Anti-Doping Agency of Kenya are welcome but we need stiffer penalties to deter doping because it’s getting out hand,” said Angwenyi. The former AK public relations officer spoke at Embaro Primary School where he visited athletes training at the institution. “Dopers who work in the Kenya Defence Forces, Kenya Police, Kenya Prisons or any government institution should lose their jobs if found guilty of doping,” he added. He asked Parliament to come up with legislation to criminalise doping. “Jailing dopers will help in the war against the vice which has tainted the country. Most Kenyan athletes run clean but we have a few rotten apples who taint our image. We need an Act of Parliament to deal with this menace,” he said. More than 60 Kenyan athletes have been banned for using performance-enhancing substances in the last five years. Last month, the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) provisionally suspended Mikel Kiprotich Mutai and Alex Korio Oloitiptip.
