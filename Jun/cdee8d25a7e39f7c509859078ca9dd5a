An Embu man who built a house using Sh800,000 mistakenly credited to his account has been charged with theft. Morris Murangiri was on Wednesday charged with theft of the money deposited into his Family Bank account by a person who was buying land from the complainant. He was charged with committing the offence on diverse dates between December 5, 2019, and January 2 at Family Bank branch in Embu. The money was intended for John Munene Njeru. The prosecution said the money was credited when Njeru unintentionally gave the buyer the wrong account after mistaking one figure. The suspect, on realising the money had been deposited in his account, withdrew all of it on diverse dates before the complainant could discover. He was traced and arrested. Murangiri pleaded guilty before chief magistrate Maxwell Gicheru and applied to be allowed to pay it back in installments from his salary. But Gicheru declined saying it would take years while he had stolen the money intentionally and thus, has pay quickly or be jailed. He granted the accused a Sh200,000 bond and a surety of a similar amount and ordered him to return on June 22.  Edited by R.Wamochie
