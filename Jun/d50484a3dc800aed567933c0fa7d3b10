President Uhuru Kenyatta's extension of the curfew by another 30 days while relaxing the time from 9pm to 4am from the earlier 7pm to 5am schedule has been met with cheers and jeers. Those for the opening of the economy believe in an everyone for himself and God for us all scenario while the proponents of partial opening want everyone to be their brother's keeper. As the President said, advocates for lives and those for livelihoods both have strong cases. His decision was therefore greatly informed by expert advice and the different scenarios in view of the rising numbers of Covid-19 community infections. However a survey released yesterday by research firm Infotrak shows that failure to adhere to set guidelines, lack of awareness about the disease and corruption are some of the major hindrances to the fight against Covid-19. When leaders talk about social distancing, they must lead from the front. But because of their political interest and scheming they have been hosting huge delegations. Acting Health director general Patrick Amoth was at a burial in Nyeri attended by hundreds of mourners yet the ministry's guidelines are clear that not more than 15 people should be present at burials. Those in positions of authority must equally subject themselves to authority not only in the fight against Covid-19 but in all spheres.
