The Directorate of Criminal investigations has summoned 10 individuals over misappropriation of funds at the Supreme Council of Kenyan Muslims. The 10 are expected to appear before the DCI for questioning and statement recording between June 11 and June 15. They include Hassan Ole Nado, Ambassador Mohamed Mahad, Mundhar Khitami, Bakari Chemaswet and Abdullahi Salat. Others are Abdallahi Ali, Mohamed Washala, Yusuf Mwarabwa, Yusuf Nzibo and Ali Golicha. "They should report to the undersigned at the Directorate situated along Kiambu road, serious Crimes Unit without fail," read part of the summon signed by Kuriah Obadiah. The summons come after one of the embattled officials requested the DCI to launch investigations into the dealings of the council. In a letter to the DCI, Secretary to the Council based in Narok County Mustaapjha Tobiko Ole Tampul asked the detectives to conduct a joint comprehensive investigation into activities by the acting chairman, secretary general, treasurer, organising secretary and members of the National Executive Committee against the suspension of Ambassador Yusuf Nzibo as chairman. Tampul said there is evidence that personal crimes were committed against him and his office. "... I request that your investigations delve deeper into allegations of constitutional violations, Dr Nzibo's illegal ouster from the post of chairman, human rights violations, threats and intimidation, misuse of the council's resources, theft of property, fraud and impersonation," reads part of Tampul's letter.
