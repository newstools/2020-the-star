The much-anticipated solo debut album by Steph Kapela is finally out. Vikky Secrets explores issues no one likes to talk about in a personal and vulnerable way through themes such as intimacy, the other woman, sex addiction, chasing fantasies and regret of lost love. Kapela said he needed to find himself and find love again. “I wanted to hold nothing back and deal with all of it, love, lust and longing, and I feel many people need that right now, especially being isolated with their loved ones,” he said. “It’s good to explore how things go right and how they go wrong and just maybe find a way through it.” Vikky Secrets is was produced by Ivan Odie of Callivan Creatives.
