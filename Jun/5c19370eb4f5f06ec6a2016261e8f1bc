Moments after landing a new shirt sponsor, AFC Leopards are keen to raise Sh120 million in readiness for the new season. Leopards received a boost last week after Betsafe committed to give the club Sh40 million per season for the next three years this filling in the void left by SportPesa in August last year. Besides raising the huge budget, the club chairman Dan Shikanda also said the team was in advanced talks with four new players identified by the technical bench. “We are putting several structures in place for the team as we await the resumption of the league after the coronavirus pandemic.  The big task now is to raise a budget of sh 120 million for the next season and the other is bringing in new players to strengthen the playing unit. We are talking to about four players whom I will not reveal now but we are optimistic they will join us,” he said in a telephone interview. Shikanda rubbished the idea of restructuring the technical bench in the wake of calls by several fans and former players to keep trust with the current head coach Anthony Kimani following his achievements since taking over from Andre Mbungo at the start of the year. “We will cross the bridge when we reach there but for now, we have not thought of adding any one on the technical bench. Kimani is fit and has done a very good job and when it’s not broken you don’t fix it,” Shikanda stated.
