NCBA Bank is rationalising its branch network following the successful conclusion of the merger between NIC Bank Kenya PLC and Commercial Bank of Africa Limited. The rationalisation will see 14 branches that are co-located or in close proximity merged into another branch. Of these branches, seven had been temporarily closed on April 1 due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.  The staff members of the affected branches will be redeployed appropriately across the banks network and business unit. The Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) has approved the rationalisations strategy that will see the Banks network in Kenya stand at 68. In a statement to media houses, NCBA Group managing director John Gachora noted the process of rationalising a number of branches was started earlier in the year with a view to streamline operations for the enhancement of efficiency and service delivery. “The rationalisation has been made with careful consideration of customer impact, and will ensure a smooth transition of those affected,’’Gachora said. He revealed that since the merger, they have been looking at branch network and have plans to open 15 new ones as part of increasing footprint across the country. ''This plan is currently under review in light of COVID-19. We remain optimistic that once the economy begins to recover, we will roll out this expansion strategy,” Gachora said. He noted the business had seen an increased use of alternative channels such as online and mobile banking since the start of the pandemic in Kenya.
