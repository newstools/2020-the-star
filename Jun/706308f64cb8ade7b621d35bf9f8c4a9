Britam has launched Telehealth services, dubbed Britam Afya Mikononi, with an aim of providing its clients with remote healthcare during the Covid-19 pandemic. The healthcare services are to encourage the public to follow the government directives on social distancing and staying at home as the pandemic continues to affect the country, and indeed the world. Dubbed Britam Afya Mikononi, the service is accessible to existing microinsurance and corporate medical covered customers on an outpatient basis. Users can access the service by sending the word ‘Britam’ to a 0777 012021 after which they will receive online diagnosis and treatment from qualified doctors. The doctor will issue a prescription to the patient, who has a choice to have the medicine delivered or collected from a designated nearby pharmacy. To access the telehealth services, clients will not be required to have smartphones, as prescriptions will be sent as an SMS link, which can be downloaded at the pharmacy. This is expected to minimize the cost of accessing health care for the Small and Medium Enterprises and Micro customers. Britam unveiled the product in conjunction with Strathmore University to offer the locally developed innovative service by Health-E-Net, a social enterprise incubated at the University. ''During this unprecedented period we are able to leverage our top-class IT capability and partner with Strathmore University to provide seamless medical services to our clients said Acting CEO Britam General Insurance Jackson Theuri said. He added that the launch is in line with the company’s promise to be with its customers every step of the way as well as the corporate strategy whose pillars are innovation, customer experience, partnerships and profitable growth.
