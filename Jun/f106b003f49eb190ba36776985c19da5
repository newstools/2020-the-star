Physical exercise can help fight Covid-19 alongside the guidelines issued by the Health ministry, Harambee Sacco CEO George Ochiri said Tuesday. Ochiri spoke when the sacco officials and board members met Central regional commissioner Wilfred Nyagwanga and Nyeri county commissioner Loyford Kibaara in their offices in Nyeri town. The sacco officials donated costumes for physical exercises. They also donated masks, gloves, handwashing equipment which includes basins, water system and sanitiser to be used by the office of the commissioner and the people supporting him. “These are some of the items that we have been advised are necessary for the fight against the pandemic,” he said. They also donated T-shirts and umbrellas, among other items. Ochiri said they will go all over the country donating protective clothing and handwashing kits to the sacco members to help in the fight against Covid-19. The CEO said they started with Nyeri county office of the president before proceeding to other regions. “We intend to do this throughout the country and we will reach out to all the counties. We will also reach out to all the units under the office of the president, a number of Kenya Defence Forces units, police installations and wherever we have member,” Ochiri said. Harambee Sacco is a financial institution for people working in the Office of the President. Ochiri said where they will not be able to reach physically; they will send the donations through courier services to deliver to their branch officials across the country. “Hopefully, we should be able to participate in our small way in fighting against the Covid-19 pandemic,” he said. Kibaara thanked the sacco for supplementing what the government is doing in the fight against Covid-19 by donating the items. He said the items will help members of the sacco to obey the guidelines set by the Ministry of Health. (edited by o. owino)
