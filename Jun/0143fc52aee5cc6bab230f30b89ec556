More police stations, more administrative units and more permanent anti-livestock theft units are needed along the Narok-Nakuru border to end cattle rustling and ethnic clashes. Those are the recommendations Kuresoi South MP Joseph Tanui and other leaders submitted to the government after MPs recently visited the volatile border area. Tanui wants the government to swiftly act on recommendations they submitted to end the Olposimoru ethnic clashes along Nakuru-Narok border. Speaking to the Star in Nakuru on Saturday, the MP said, “We offered our recommendations but nothing has been done so far, we need swift action so locals have officers to handle their conflicts.” The government should not wait for a conflict to erupt in order to deploy police officers, he said. “We need them here permanently because this particular section is perceived sidelined and is inaccessible to the Nakuru and Narok leadership." The MP also asked the Interior ministry to transfer local security officers for fair delivery of services. The MP  urged the county government to murram roads to facilitate movement of farm produce and security personnel. Last month, the ethnic clashes left least nine people dead and at least 13 others injured. Speaking in Nakuru after the recent clashes, Rift Valley regional commissioner George Natembeya said  Rapid Deployment Unit (RDU) camps will be built in Olengape and Teegat. He said more officers will be deployed to the Olpusimoru police station for quick response. (Edited by V Graham)
