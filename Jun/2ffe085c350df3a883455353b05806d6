Aman warned Kenyans against using face masks as 'chin guards' and wearing them below the nose. A number of Kenyans pull down the masks down to the chin. "It is disturbing that  a few  of  our  people have reverted to business as usual. A casual walk down the streets of Nairobi Central Business District reveals that some of  our  people are  not  wearing  masks, or  are wearing  them  improperly.  This  is   unacceptable," Aman said. Mobile labs on the Namanga border and Mai Mahiu have been operationalised to serve truck drivers, Aman said.
