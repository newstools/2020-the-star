Some 30 students from Safaricom Youth Orchestra have graduated in a virtual ceremony, marking their 6th graduation. Among the graduates from the weekend event were 12 students from Ghetto Classics. In a statement, Art of Music Foundation director Elizabeth Njoroge said, “It is sad that for the first time, we are not able to celebrate this milestone with our late founder, Bob Collymore. But we find solace in knowing that we are realising his dream.” Safaricom CEO Peter Ndegwa congratulated this year's class for showing commitment and passion for music. "We understand the fundamental role music plays in our daily lives, and it is our promise that we shall continue to support the lives of the young people with initiatives such as the Safaricom Youth Orchestra.”
