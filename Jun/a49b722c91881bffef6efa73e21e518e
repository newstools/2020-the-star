The Insurance Regulatory Authority (IRA) has assured policyholders that insurers will pay for coronavirus related treatment both in public and private hospitals. The regulator was responding to earlier reports that that insurance firms will only pay for coronavirus disease treatment in public hospitals on fears of increased expenses related to the respiratory disease that could push them into losses. IRA said its chief executive Godfrey Kiptum was quoted out of context, reiterating that it had in fact issued a guidance note that requires the insurers to expeditiously process and settle all claims and payments related to the COVID-19. ''We would like to clarify that insurance companies are settling medical insurance claims as per the policy documents/contracts with their clients. This includes treatment in the private hospitals provided in their list of service providers,’’ IRA said in a statement. The Authority further called upon any policyholder whose Covid-19 medical claim has  not been settled to report the matter to its consumer protection office.
