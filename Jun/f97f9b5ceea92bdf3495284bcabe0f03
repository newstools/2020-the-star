Kenya Wildlife Service rangers in Lamu county have captured a stray lioness that has been killing livestock and scaring residents of Lake Amu area in Mpeketoni, Lamu West. Numerous traps had been set by the rangers at the various points before one of the traps finally went up on Saturday morning. Lamu County KWS senior warden Mathias Mwavita confirmed the capture. The lioness had killed four cows in the last three days. “The traps were laid a few days ago and we managed to capture the lioness. This marks an end to the reign of terror as we will now transport it back safely to its habitat,” said Mwavita. He said the lioness is currently being held at the Jamhuri KWS camp, a proposed animal orphanage in Hindi town, awaiting to be transported to the Tsavo National Park. The lioness is believed to have strayed from inside the Boni forest in search of easy prey. He lauded members of the public for their cooperation in ensuring the wild cat is safely captured and not killed. He said the rangers had also successfully captured hyenas in Mkunumbi, Bargoni and other areas and transported them back to their habitats in Tana River county. More other lion traps have been set in Lamu Island, Manda Island, Faza, Bargoni, Mkunumbi and Lake Amu as expectations of more stray lions rise. “We are appealing to residents not to kill these animals when they spot them. Kindly inform so we can move in and move them out,” he said. In September, 2019, tens of goats and donkeys were mauled to death by three stray lions who invaded the Manda-Maweni village in Lamu West. They were later repatriated back to their habitat at the Boni-Dodori national reserve by KWS rangers.
