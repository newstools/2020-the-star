Four State House staff have tested positive for the coronavirus, spokesperson Kanze Dena has said. Dena said President Uhuru Kenyatta and the first family were free from the virus. She said Monday the infected officers were admitted to the Kenyatta University Teaching, Referral and Research Hospital in Kiambu county. The four were discovered during mass testing conducted at State House on Thursday last week. "As part of proactive measures being implemented to contain the spread of Covid-19, State House staff are regularly tested for the disease. The tests are conducted on all staff including His Excellency the President and members of his family," she said. Dena said the families and close contacts of the affected officers were being attended to accordingly. "To strengthen Covid-19 containment measures, extra access protocols for State House staff residing outside the compound and visitors have been rolled out. State House would also like to remind Kenyans that every person is at risk of contracting Covid-19. No one is immune to the disease," Dena said. The spokesperson said all Kenyans must endeavour to fully adhere to the Covid-19 containment protocols as set out by the Ministry of Health. Earlier, ODM leader Raila Odinga announced that he took the test and the results were negative. Edited by Henry Makori
