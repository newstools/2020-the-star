Attempts by 10 MCAs to stop the advertisement of a tender for construction of a dam in Eres Teno in Wajir county have failed after a judge declined to issue temporary orders. However, High Court judge John Mativo allowed the MCAs to challenge the tender. The MCAs in their suit papers claim the government’s decision to construct the dam was not subjected to public participation. The dam is to be constructed along the Kenya-Ethiopia border and will only benefit a minority clan, they claim. Those opposing the current proposed site want the dam be built at Gurar. They say Gurar is easily accessible to the majority of county residents as opposed to Eres Teno. In an affidavit in support of the case, Gurar MCA Abdikadir Hussein says Eres Teno is at the border and most residents are not able to access it. It is also said to be prone to banditry attacks. For example, in 2004 an Ethiopian militia attacked the area and killed or kidnapped security personnel. If the construction is not stopped there is a high likelihood that the dam will end up benefiting very few people who come from a single clan, the court heard. According to the MCAs, the lack of consultation with members of the public was already causing tension among the residents. “The act of ignoring the local residents has already generated tension and conflict and is likely to become a grave security matter if the court does not intervene and halt the process,” the petition said. The MCAs expressed their fears that if the implementation of dam construction goes ahead without factoring in the sensitive concerns of the residents, it will trigger serious underlying community conflicts amongst them as had happened before.
