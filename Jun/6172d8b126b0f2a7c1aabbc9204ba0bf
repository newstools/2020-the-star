A-19-year-old girl has committed suicide in Lamu after she found out her boyfriend was cheating on her. The girl hanged herself inside the family kitchen at their home in Faza town, Lamu East on Friday. Lamu East OCPD Emmanuel Okanda said police believe the girl killed herself over a love triangle. “We are still investigating but we understand the young lady had found out her boyfriend had another girl. She didn’t leave any note.  We also understand she quarreled with some girls shortly before she took her life and we looking into that too,” he said. Okanda urged young people to take it easy in relationships and avoid taking reckless actions, no matter how painful the situation. He advised young people to understand that relationships have numerous ups and downs and that getting through successfully requires patience and a thoughtful approach. Okanda asked young people going through any problem in their relationships to seek help from elders and religious leaders. Elders have urged couples to adopt healthy ways to resolve disputes and not to commit acts of violence or commit suicide. The body was taken to the Faza Subcounty hospital for a postmortem.
