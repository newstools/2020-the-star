The High Court has suspended the implementation of a Gazette notice announcing the removal of Moses Wetang'ula from the helm of Ford Kenya party. On June 8, the Registrar of Political Parties Ann Nderitu gazetted a notice announcing the intended removal of Wetang'ula and replacement with Kanduyi MP Wafula Wamunyinyi. Nderitu also noted that the party’s national organising secretary Chris Mandu had would be removed and replaced with Josephine Waungu. But Wetang'ula moved to the High Court to challenge the changes made. Justice James Makau on Monday directed the Registrar not to acknowledge or transact the party's business with Eseli Simiyu and Wamunyinyi. He directed the party to serve the Registrar, Simiyu and Wamunyinyi with its application ahead of the mention date on June 29. Ford Kenya’s National Executive Council on May 31, 2020 resolved to dismiss Wetang'ula as party leader on the grounds of gross misconduct.
