DJ Soxxy and wife Anne Waichigo thought they were going to lose their son Ethan Kamau after his birth. Anne recently posted about the experience on social media. "I can't promise to fix all your problems, but I can promise that you won't have to face them alone," she wrote. "I have this little boy who stole my heart and he calls me mama. Ethan means strong, firm in Hebrew. "When Ethan was born, his lungs did not pick up and we thought we would lose him. He stayed in the ICU for a few days. And just like his name, he was strong to fight for his little life."
