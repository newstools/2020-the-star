Residents of Mt Kenya East have been urged to reconsider quitting Jubilee Party after Cecily Mbarire and Kithure Kindiki were removed from parliamentary leadership positions. Mbarire was removed as the National Assembly’s deputy Majority chief whip and Kindiki as the deputy Senate Speaker in changes sanctioned by President Uhuru Kenyatta. Joshua Kanake, a former political adviser to Embu Governor Martin Wambora, said Jubilee was degenerating into dictatorship and discriminating against members. Kanake urged Embu, Kirinyaga, Meru and Tharaka Nithi people to rethink their political affiliation with Jubilee in 2022. “It’s disappointing that the two were fired for being perceived to be affiliated to Deputy President William Ruto whose only sin is to canvass for the presidency in 2022,” he said. Kanake said it would be foolhardy for any politician to sit still and wait for the next election without canvassing for votes. The deputy president has not committed any offence to declare his interest for the presidency, he said. He said President Kenyatta persuaded the four counties to fold Alliance Party of Kenya which they used to negotiate for power only to frustrate the people and their leaders. He said Mbarire’s and Kindiki’s senior offices were the only leadership positions that made Mt Kenya East people have a sense of ownership of Jubilee.  The duo's sacking has shoved the four counties to the periphery, he said. Kanake urged for the revival of APK or the founding of another political party for use by the Mount Kenya East residents to champion their issues. (edited by o. owino)
