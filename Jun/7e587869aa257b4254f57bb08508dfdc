The return of the Kenya Hockey Union Premier League is still uncertain but former Butali Warriors skipper Kenneth Nyongesa has warned to avoid  complacency if they are to retain their title. He added that the addition of Kennedy Munialo, Clayson Luvanda and Festus Onyango is an indication of the ambitions that the team have. “It is very unfortunate that we are not playing but it won’t be long before we return to action. Every team will be coming for Butali and, therefore, we will have to play our hearts out on the field in a bid to keep our title," said Nyongesa, a former Stratmore Gladiators player. "Our strategic plan even before COVID-19 struck was to remain dominant and that has not changed. The quality additions is an indication of how Butali are willing to play this season." Long-time rivals Police and last season’s runner up Wazalendo are touted as potential obstacles in the sugar millers’ bid to retain the crown and Nyongesa predicts a tough title race. “Basically, I see a close call. Each team has strengthened making it an interesting affair altogether. Wazalendo did well last season and will still be a threat. Our prayer is to resume normalcy because we really miss playing,” the former Kenyan international observed. Butali were scheduled to play returnees Parkroad Badgers on April 4, in their first match of the season before the league was suspended.
