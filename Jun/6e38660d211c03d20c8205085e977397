Council of elders from Marsabit and Wajir have urged their communities to respect resolutions arrived at to restore peace. Clashes between the Borana and Degodia communities broke out in Badanarero last week, leaving at least 20 people dead and livestock stolen. The communities are fighting over pasture and water. On Saturday, governors Mohamud Ali (Marsabit) and Mohamed Abdi (Wajir), regional police chiefs and administrators from the two counties held meetings in Sololo town to restore peace between the communities. As the meetings were ongoing, four people were killed in Saku when a gunfight ensued at a watering point. After the meeting, local leaders from both sides with the help of elders came up with binding resolutions, which they both signed as a commitment to ending the conflict. They agreed to the immediate cessation of hostilities and formation of inter-ethnic social cohesion and integration. Other agreements include the national government ensuring that all criminals are apprehended, installation of Safaricom booster and the return of all stolen livestock. The national and county governments should identify and build security roads along the common border of Wajir and Marsabit counties, they agreed. It was also agreed that political leaders should support the national government in promoting good relations between the two communities. Speaking to the press in Sololo town on Monday, Hussein Kadida, the chairman of the Borana council of elders, and his counterpart Salat Mohamud from Degodia said the two communities must show commitment to the resolutions. “We are committed to ensuring that our respective communities maintain peace. Anybody who goes against them will face the law,” Kadida said. He said they were optimistic that the government will cooperate and fulfil its part in the resolution. Mohamud said elders will meet after every six months to track progress and possible challenges. Edited by Frank Obonyo
