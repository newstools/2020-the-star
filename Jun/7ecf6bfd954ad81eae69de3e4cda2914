 Jubilee MPs from Western have been warned against attending ANC party functions with the intention to market Deputy President William Ruto's presidential ambitions. ANC deputy party leader Ayub Savula on Saturday said the MPs use the functions to peddle falsehoods about party leader Musalia Mudavadi, claiming he (Mudavadi) has agreed to work with the DP. Savula said the Jubilee MPs have been hijacking ANC functions to market Ruto's agenda. He said the trend must stop. "They must stop this narrative that Mudavadi has accepted to deputise Ruto in 2022. Mudavadi will be on the ballot and Ruto should support him if he wants to work with him. Mudavadi will not play second fiddle to anyone, " Savula said. The Lugari MP said ANC agreed to work with the Jubilee MPs to consolidate the region's block and then release Mudavadi to go and look for friends in other parts of the country. He said that the Jubilee MPs were not courted but attended the functions on their own. He said the party will not allow Jubilee MPs allied to Ruto to use their meetings to sell the DP's agenda. Mudavadi has in past weeks been meeting a number of elected leaders from across the political divide at the Mudavadi Communication center in Nairobi in what is seen as part of his preparations for the 2022 General Election. Among those he has met are close allies of DP Ruto from both Rift Valley and Western regions. Some of the DP's allies who have met Mudavadi include Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago and MPs Oscar Sudi, Justus Murunga, Didmus Barasa, John Waluke, Ben Washiali and Dan Wanyama. The meetings have fueled speculations that Mudavadi is planning to team up with Ruto for the 2022 elections. Savula said Mudavadi is strengthening the ANC party for the 2022 elections and that he will not be distracted.  Edited by P.O
