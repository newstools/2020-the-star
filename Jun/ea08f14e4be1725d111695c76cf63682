Mediamax Ltd will not implement the salary pay cuts that had been announced to its employees in April this year. The company had communicated that every employees was to get a salary pay cut due to the financial constraints brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic. However, on Wednesday, Mediamax and 117 employees who had moved to court to challenge the decision reached an agreement and signed a consent. Lawyer Danstan Omari for the employees told the court they had come to an agreement with the company and asked court to adopt the consent. Parties have agreed that the existing contracts before the pay cuts for each employee will be preserved and cannot be tampered with. Secondly, they both agreed that there will be no salary cut by consent for any of the Mediamax employees. However, on the notice for redundancies issued by Mediamax, they are free to declare redundancies pursuant to the Redundancy Law. The 117 employees had moved to court to block the employer from slashing their salaries by between 20-50 per cent due to the effects of Covid-19 on the business. Justice Byram Ongaya adopted the consent by both parties and marked the matter as withdrawn. “With no orders on costs, and with further orders that the contract of service between parties is preserved with no pay cuts - but affected staff may go on redundancy along with prevailing contracts. The contract is in place without pay cuts and the law says when they should be paid,” the consent reads. Edited by R.Wamochie
