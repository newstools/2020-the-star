Betty Kyallo has acquired a white 2019 Porsche Cayenne SUV days after she quit her anchor job at K24. The car goes for $66,750 (Sh7.1 million), including the $1,050 destination charge. “Gotta move differently if you want different! Another One is home! This time White,” she wrote. A while ago, Betty owned a similar car, which was the reason why she remained the talk of the town for a good number of times. Rumour had it that the car belonged to one of the politicians in Kenya but was taken away for his campaign, which forced Betty Kyalo to buy a BMW X6. She also owns a Mercedes Benz, which she has been flaunting on her social media.
