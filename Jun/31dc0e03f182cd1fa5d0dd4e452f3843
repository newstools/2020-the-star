 German striker Timo Werner marked his RB Leipzig swansong with two well-taken goals to guide his side to a 2-1 victory at Augsburg in the Bundesliga over the weekend. Leipzig full back Nordi Mukiele and midfielder Emil Forsberg spurned glorious opportunities before Werner, who will depart for Chelsea at the end of the season, put his side in front in the 28th minute. The 24-year-old latched on to a defence-splitting pass from Amadou Haidara before rounding Augsburg goalkeeper Tomas Koubek for his 27th league goal of the season. Augsburg, who had a red card for Philipp Max overturned by VAR in the second half, hit back through Ruben Vargas, whose long-range effort proved too powerful for Yvon Mvogo to keep out. Werner added a second eight minutes from time, latching on to Angelino’s cross-field pass and firing into the bottom corner. “Firstly, it makes me really happy that we won our last game of the season,” said Werner, who will leave Leipzig as their all-time top scorer with 95 goals. “The fact that I am the record goalscorer makes me really proud. I will miss the club and the city.” The result means Leipzig end the season in third place with 66 points, one shy of their record Bundesliga tally achieved in 2016-17, while Augsburg finish in 15th with 36 points, five clear of the relegation zone. “We played well overall. We were more energetic and better than in recent weeks. So it’s a deserved win and an important third-place finish,” Leipzig manager Julian Nagelsmann said. “It feels really good to be in the Champions League, especially after such a long season.”
