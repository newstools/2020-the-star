A political honcho from Rift Valley inclined to Kanu Chairman Gideon Moi's political camp is a worried man. This is after his political sponsor allegedly smoked him out over claims of irregularly leaking some sensitive political strategies to Deputy President William Ruto's camp. The MP was last week claiming in Parliament Buildings how he has come under fire from the Gideon camp over espionage. However, he pleaded his innocence claiming that he was being fixed by rivals. The MP is said to be broke and with political trouble looming, his political fortunes appear to be fast plummeting.  A judge and an influential governor are said to be at the heart of the tribulations of an influential cabinet secretary said to be on the chopping board in the impending cabinet reshuffle. The two are said to have met at a social joint within Nairobi West area two weeks ago where they discussed the conduct of the CS in detail. It is said that the judge had asked the help of the governor, who is seen as being close to the president, to push for the sacking of the minister. The judge is keen on having the sent CS packing for allegedly failing to honour pledges he made to their family prior to his appointment as minister.  A former influential MP from Nyanza who was beaten by a youthful MP in the 2017 polls is on the spot. Why? The man was recorded by a journalist threatening a former constituent and the current MP. He vowed that he would in broad daylight slit the throat of the two and swore that he would indeed do it. The ex-lawmaker is said to have been angered that the current MP visited the home of his former supporter. The incident has left the county confused. How low can politicians sink?
