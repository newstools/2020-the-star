DP William Ruto has joined Kenyans in condoling with former managing director of the defunct Kenya Post and telecommunication Jan Mutai's family and friends as they mourn the death of the engineer. He mourned Mutai as a polished engineer with drive and vision adding that he generously shared knowledge in corporate governance and strategic management. "He was humble, inspiring and a spectacular role-model to many. Our thoughts and prayers to Engineer Mutai’s family, relatives and friends in this time of grief. Rest In Peace," Ruto tweeted on Thursday. Mutai is a younger brother of veteran politician Philomena Chelagat Mutai. He died at a Nairobi hospital after  a long battle with cancer. Mutai, who hails from Terige village, O’Llessos, in Nandi was the last MD of KPTC who presided over the splitting of the giant parastatal into three units. He saw the creation of the communication regulatory body, Communication Commission of Kenya, now the Communication Authority, Telcom Kenya and Postal Corporation of Kenya. Former President Daniel arap Moi had picked him from Shell and BP company where he was in-charge of marketing and corporate affairs.
