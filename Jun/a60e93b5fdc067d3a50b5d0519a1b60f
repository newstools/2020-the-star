Low-cost carrier Jambojet has reported rising flight inquiries ahead of the  planned resumption of local flights. During his Covid-19 update on June 6, President Uhuru Kenyatta directed the Ministry of Transport in conjunction with health to look into modalities to resume domestic flights. “The ministry of transport is directed within seven days from the date hereof, to engage all key stakeholders and develop protocols to guide resumption of local air travel,” the President said. The carrier plans to fly locally to Diani, Mombasa,Kisumu, Malindi and Eldoret from its Nairobi’s Jomo Kenyatta International Airport hub before going into its regional routes of Entebbe and Kigali. Locally,. “Many have been asking when we shall resume flights,” Jambojet acting CEO Karanja Ndegwa told the Star in an interview. He said the local flights will commence upon the lifting of ban on movement out of Nairobi and Mombasa. Domestic air travel came to a halt with the cessation of movement into and out of the Nairobi Metropolitan area and Coastal counties of Mombasa, Kilifi and Kwale in April. Kilifi and Kwale have since had their bans lifted. “While some passengers requested for a refund, all passengers were advised to reschedule their travel and ticket amount were put on credit for use within one year,” said Ndegwa.  Tickets on the budget carrier are expected to start at Sh4,800 due the limited number of passengers allowed on board in order to maintain social distancing.
