Marsabit Governor Mohamud Ali has been barred from constructing a mosque inside the county's public market. Marsabit judge Juma Chitembwe on Monday gave temporary orders stopping any further construction of the mosque that was being put up in the public market. This is after a group of pastors in Marsabit moved to court challenging the building of the mosque, saying it's discriminatory. Through lawyer Shadrack Wambui, the pastors claim that the county and the governor have maliciously on the basis of selfish agenda aimed at giving the Muslim faith prominence by converting space that was initially intended for six market stalls into a mosque. Wambui further argues that his clients are disturbed by the proposal since the county is cosmopolitan and it would be impossible for the public market to have a space available for every religious or spiritual organisation. The case will be heard on July 8.
