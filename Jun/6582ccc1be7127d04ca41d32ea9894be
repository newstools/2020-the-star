 The Siaya County Public Service Board has been to pay four former casual employees Sh300,000 for illegal dismissal. Employment and Labour judge Mathews Nduma Nderi  noted that the four were unceremoniously sacked via an SMS. He said they had shown that they were neither given show cause notice, any hearing nor reasons for termination. Nderi said in his May 28 ruling that the workers were dismissed because they were casuals in the eyes of the Siaya public Service Board. “The termination of the employment of the claimants violated the Employment Act.  The terminations were therefore unlawful and unfair and the claimants are entitled to compensation,” he ruled. Michael Osino, Moses Odero, Carren Auma and Elias Okello were dismissed in 2014 as garbage collectors. Osino, who testified on behalf of his colleagues said he was employed in 2005, Odero  in 2009, Auma in 2002 and Okelo  in 2010. None of them had written contracts of employment. They worked as garbage collectors. He was transferred to the slaughter house in 2012. William Oyayo, for the service board, said the four were  only entitled to earned salary and nothing else. The claimants sought to be paid accrued leave days, unpaid house allowance and severence pay.  - mwaniki fm
