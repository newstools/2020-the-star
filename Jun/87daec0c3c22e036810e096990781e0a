Water, Sanitation and Irrigation CS Sicily Kariuki has expressed frustration over stagnation of water projects in Embu county started over a decade ago. Gachoka cluster irrigation and Mukui domestic and irrigation water projects in Mbeere South subcounty started seven and 10 years ago respectively but stalled. Kariuki blamed lack of money and disputes between communities who own the sources of the water projects and the targeted vulnerable beneficiaries. She said the government had adopted a policy in which landowners who accommodate water sources and whose land the distribution pipes passes shouldÂ  be provided with water to avert disputes. Several other projects countrywide have been marred by such disputes, the CS said. Kariuki said the projects will be completed in a few months so that the residents can realise their dreams of getting clean drinking water and being food secure. The CS who toured the projects on Friday to assess their progress assured the residents that the projects will be completed within months . Kariuki said the Gachoka cluster irrigation project will benefit 300 farmers. The project whose water is sourced from Nyamidi River in Kirinayaga county has been provided with Sh270 million and only about two per cent of the work remains fto be done. She said the project will be officially opened in July. Mukui project in Mbeti South ward which has been allocated Sh60 million will be completed by December. She said the National Irrigation Authority which is finishing the projects has excavated 600 water pans in the subcounty for provision of drinking and irrigation water. Kariuki said 400 more water pans will be excavated in the area as the government looks for money to construct four mega-dams in the county . Edited by Henry Makori
