The Vihiga government is setting up an ICU centre with at least five beds in readiness to combat the coronavirus. Governor Wilber Ottichilo said the ICU would end Vihiga's overreliance on neighbouring counties of Kisumu, Nandi, Uasin Gishu and Kisumu in treating their patients. Health executive Amos Kutwa had earlier said there was an urgent need for an ICU in the county to help fight the coronavirus. The facility is being set up at Mbale County Referral Hospital. Ottichilo on Tuesday said his administration has put all mechanisms in place to keep Vihiga residents safe from the virus. He, however, urged residents to protect themselves and observe the guidelines issued by the government because the pandemic "is here to stay". “We must adapt to the new culture amid Covid-19. We are not sure when this virus will free us or when a vaccine will be found,” Ottichilo said. Ottichilo’s call comes a few weeks after Vihiga Woman Representative Beatrice Adagala urged residents to abandon their culture for a while because of the pandemic. “Our health workers have done us proud. We shall forever be indebted to your kindness, hard work and resilience,” the governor said. Ottichilo promised health workers salary delays will soon be addressed and their promotions are being looked into by his administration. The governor further said he will support President Uhuru Kenyatta in amending the Constitution through the BBI, saying this will allow more funds to flow to counties and create an opportunity for the devolved units to come up with their own IFMIS systems that will end the financial crisis between the counties and national government. “I am hopeful that Kenyans will support the amendment of the Constitution for a better Kenya,” he said.
