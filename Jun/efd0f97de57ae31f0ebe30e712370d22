Thousands of flood victims in Bunyala, Budalang'i constituency, have expressed fears over waterborne disease outbreak due to poor sanitation. Floodwaters have submerged several homes and contaminated boreholes from which residents often draw water for domestic use. Pit latrines have also been flooded. More than 40,000 IDPs are living in 62 camps across Budalang'i. Those who spoke to the Star on Tuesday appealed to the Busia county government's public health department to treat all the water points to prevent a possible outbreak of diseases. Authorities have however assured the displaced persons that measures have already been put in place to ensure their safety. Bunyala public health officer Edward Mwaimbe said necessary steps have been taken to contain the situation. He said every IDP camp has a community health volunteer whose responsibility is to sensitise the flood victims on the importance of hygiene. The public health officer said the victims were also provided with chlorine and aqua tablets with which to treat the water. Mwaimbe said they were liaising with the water department in Port Victoria to provide clean drinking water to all the IDP camps. He said Bunyala was a cholera hotspot but the public health team was on high alert to contain any outbreak.  Edited by P.O
