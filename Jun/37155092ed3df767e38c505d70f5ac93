TikTok content creator Antony Siajabu, 25, is currently living his dream. He’s able to share his passion for music while promoting the African culture to a global audience. But how did he get there? Speaking to Word Is, Antony said he has always had a passion for creating music-themed videos. However, only a handful of friends actually saw his content and were able to support his unique skills. His best friend introduced and encouraged him to join short-form mobile video app TikTok, then known as Musically. “I have such a passion for music, African music specifically. All I wanted to do was share this passion with the world,” he said. "I was inspired to join TikTok because the platform allowed me to do just that as well as create great videos which I loved to do." The professional banker, known by his TikTok handle, has more than 61,000 followers. He says he loves the video-editing tools on the app as he’s able to make dance and transition videos using cool effects. He loves the platform because it gives everyone a chance to showcase their talent, not only to a local audience but to the whole world.
