Fire has engulfed a section of Gikomba market cereals and 'mitumba' section. Some traders were seen trying to salvage what was remaining from the burnt buildings. Another trader Farida Auma was seen searching for her valuables after fire gutted her 25 years old business. With a sad face written all over her face, Auma said the fires have remained a nightmare to them. "Why is it that the mall behind us is not affected and yet all of us are in Gikomba?" One woman asked. "What kind of game is being played here?" The cause of the fire that started at 2am is yet to be established. Mysterious fires in the market are a norm and no one has been arrested in the recurrent arson. On February 1, a fire once again razed stalls and buildings at the populous Gikomba Market. Merchandise of unknown value was destroyed in the fire that started at around 4 am. County officials launched investigations to establish the cause of the fire.
