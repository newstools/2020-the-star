The tarmacking of roads in Kiambu county will boost horticultural farming and trade in Lari, MP Jonah Mburu has said. He said more than 100 lorries of vegetables from the constituency are sold in different markets in Nairobi, Mombasa, Kilifi and Malindi every day. The legislator on Tuesday praised President Uhuru Kenyatta for the construction of the 540km Mau Mau road, which will pass through Lari. Of the 540km, some 85km will pass through villages and trading centres in his constituency. “Lari residents are happy that 85km will pass in our area. Movement will be easy. This is history since we do not have a tarmacked road in this area. The one we had, was done in 1984 by the Moi regime and it has never been repaired,” Mburu said. He said the 85kms will connect Maai Mahiu, Kijabe, Matathia, Kimende, Githirioni, Nyambare, Gitithia, Kagaa, Kamahindu and Gataka. Mburu spoke at deputy county commissioner Aaron Koros’ office in Kireita where he hosted China Wu Yi and Ministry of Road officials. China Wu Yi is the contractor. The lawmaker thanked the contractor for accepting to give 60 per cent of casual jobs to residents. He urged the contractor to set up several handwashing units for the workers. Edited by A.N
