Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua on Monday found himself in trouble after he claimed a Senate oversight committee was being used for political expediency. Appearing before the Senate county Public Accounts and Investment Committee, Mutua said he skipped the panel's invitations last year after the learnt that area Senator Boniface Kabaka was using it to "advance his political agenda". "We could not appear (because) of the way it was orchestrated. It appeared it was political. We looked at some statements that had been made especially by senator Kabaka," Mutua said. The remarks landed him in problems with senators Samson Cherargei (Nandi), Fatuma Dullo (Isiolo) and chairman Sam Ongeri (Kisii) demanding he substantiates the claims or withdraws them. "An allegation that this Committee is used for political expediency is very serious. It should be withdrawn or substantiated," Dullo said . The lawmakers prevailed upon the governor forcing him to expunge the remarks. Senator Kabaka had raised a preliminary matter seeking to know the status of a court order the governor obtained last year to skip the committee meetings. Last year, Mutua was forced to move to court after the committee, then chaired by Homa Bay Senator Moses Kajwang, directed Police IG Hillary Mutyambai to arrest and compel him to appear before the Committee. The governor had twice snubbed the panel's invitations. Mutua explained that the case was still pending in court but he was in the process of withdrawing it but decided to honour Monday's invitation because "I respect the Senate and I did not want to hang on the court order forever.
