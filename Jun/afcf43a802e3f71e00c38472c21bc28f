Jomo Kenyatta Sports Ground in Kisumu has been renamed Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Sports Ground. The ground located at the Kisumu CBD will be a recreational centre after a planned upgrade. Sports CS Amina Mohamed said this is following a directive by President Uhuru Kenyatta in honour of Jaramogi who is one of the nation’s founding fathers. “We all recognise the historical roles that Jaramogi played in the struggle for Independence, contribution to the development of the country and the region,” she said in Kisumu. “There is a need to make sure our children and grandchildren remember all the roles played by all our founding fathers.” The CS lauded Governor Anyang' Nyong’o for coming up with a vision to rehabilitate the grounds. “We are doing this to honour Jaramogi and the promise he had for football and youth empowerment,” the CS stated. She urged residents to take care of the projects so that generations can use them. “I don't think any of us thought that two years ago or months ago that this would happen but we thank God for both Uhuru and Raila.” “I can promise that if it well maintained and kept clean, we can go back to Unesco and request recognition as a heritage site,” Mohamed added.
