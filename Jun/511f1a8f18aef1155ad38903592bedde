Distributer of wines and spirits, Galina Kenya, has introduced Ramborn Cider to the Kenyan market due to demand of quality brands from sophisticated consumers. This comes at a time when the firm seeks to tap into the bourgeoning market for premium ciders. “Kenya’s cider market is growing in popularity driven by consumers who are increasingly preferring high-quality brands. Ramborn is a perfect match for this promising and niche market,”  Galina Kenya CEO, Judy Ngene said. Ramborn Cider is produced by Luxemburg-based Ramborn Company which targets consumers looking for natural and quality ciders, a promising market Galina Kenya noted. Last year, the firm took home five medals at the international brewing and cider awards in London. The Ramborn company has a variety of ciders consisting of an original medium dry cider which contains 5.8 per cent of alcohol by volume (ABV), a cascade hopped cider at 7.4 per cent ABV and finally a farmhouse dry cider at 6.5 per cent ABV. The wines and spirits distributor also added that the firm has been appointed as the exclusive importer and distributer of Ramborn Cider. Ngene also added that the newly introduced cider is available at the Galina Kenya outlets with plans to increase availability through other retailers and online suppliers. Galina Kenya already has partnerships with Naivas and Chandarana Supermarkets to sell brands at liquor stores located at the retailer’s capital centre and ciata mall branches. Ramborn cider has grown to the expanding portfolio of premium drinks.
