Gospel singer Wahu says as a teenager and into her early twenties, she had terrible self-esteem issues. She wishes she could go back in time and tell herself that everything is going to be okay. "I felt ugly, unintelligent and unworthy of being loved. I never thought I'd amount to anything much in life," she wrote on Instagram. "I wish I could go back in time and tell 17-year-old Wahu that everything's gonna be more than okay. That God is on her side and she will overcome." Wahu was encouraging young people to understand that God's love is always unconditional. "I don't know who needs to hear this but don't believe the lies the devil will throw your way. God's love is unconditional," she said.
