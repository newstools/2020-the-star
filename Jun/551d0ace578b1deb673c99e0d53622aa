A police officer in Kiambu county is planning to release an album before the end of this year as he cultivates his talent. Constable Alex Kinaichu, 30, has also vowed to become a peace ambassador. His songs advise people, encourage the youth and educate the society. Kinaichu is working on a 10-songs album titled 'Makarao'. The album will have Kiswahili songs. “I'm used to singing the songs I have written for myself and for other singers. Singing is something in me. I cannot stay without singing,” he told Word Is. The officer, who is stationed at Lari police station, recorded his first song 'Makarao' in 2014. That was after police officers were attacked by cattle rustlers in Baragoi, Samburu county. The November 2014 attack left 38 police officers dead and scores injured. The attack came one year after Kinaichu passed out and was posted in Baringo, which neighbours Samburu. He says the song was received well at the police service and is still being searched on YouTube. Other songs he has recorded are played on radio stations and viewed on YouTube, including 'One Day', 'Wadamu' and 'Ndingimaka', a Kikuyu song. Kinaichu discovered his singing and preaching talent at JG Kiereini Secondary School, where he sat his KCSE exam in 2008. He used to lead in Christian Union praises. He says writing, recording and shooting music videos as one is working as a police officer under pressure is difficult. “You have to know that as a police officer, you are working for the society. It is challenging to balance between your work and your talent, no matter how you want to get the best results,” Kinaichu said. Kinaichu, who was born in Kinale, says he aims to inform and educate the society through his talent and work. He is a fan of Samido's and also get spiritual assistance from his colleague constable Marcus Maina.
