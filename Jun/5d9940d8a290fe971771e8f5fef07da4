 Gregory Dow, a US national charged with molesting underage kids at a children’s home he ran in Bomet, is set to be sentenced on September 29. Dow, 61, pleaded guilty to the four counts of engaging in illicit sexual conduct in foreign places during a teleconference hearing on Monday with US District Judge Edward Smith, federal prosecutors and federal defenders, Lancaster Online reported. It means the accused might spend up to 16 years jail. Under the plea agreement between the prosecution and defence, the accused would serve 15 years and eight months in prison. He must also register under the federal Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act. Dow is accused of sexually assaulting four girls between 2013 and 2017 while running Dow Family Children's Home in Boito, Bomet county, which he established in 2008. He, however, fled the country in 2017 after police were tipped of the illegal acts at the orphanage which has since been closed. “Dow hid behind his supposed faith on the other side of the world, hoping no one in the US would know or care about the children he abused. He was wrong,” said US Attorney William McSwain. He added, “Holding accountable those who sexually abuse children, no matter where their crimes occur, will continue to be a top priority of my office and the entire Department of Justice.” The orphanage received financial support from Lancaster county churches and other non-profit institutions. Dow's wife, Mary Rose Dow, who was charged in a Sotik court with cruelty to the children by implanting birth controls in the kids, was released on a fine. During the plea hearing, Assistant US Attorney Timothy Stengel said Dow engaged in grooming behaviour by providing things of value to his victims such as cell phones. Dow was arrested in East Hempfield Township in July last year and has been in federal custody since then because he was considered a flight risk.  Edited by P.O
