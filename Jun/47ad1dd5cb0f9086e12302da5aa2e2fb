Over 10,000 Turkana residents will benefit from Napuu water project built by the National Water Harvesting and Storage Authority. Turkana deputy governor Peter Lotethiro said last September the Turkana county government and NWHSA signed an MoU to construct Napuu water project to benefit residents who have been struggling to access clean water. “The Napuu water project which we launched last year in September had faced delays but the reasons for the holdup had been solved and residents will soon access clean water,” he said. The water project includes installation of an elevated 3,000-litre steel tank in Narewa, which will supply water to Narewa, Lokitela, Ekaales, Masewan, Kasarani, Juluk and Trans Africa villages. It will also supply institutions such as Turkana University College. Turkana has underground water aquifers at Lotikipi plains and Napuu in Turkana West and Turkana Central. The largest population in the county depends on borehole water. NWHSA chairman Erick Okeyo said the county government contracted them to do the Napuu water project that will serve more than 10,000 residents. He spoke while assessing the Napuu water project, which he said is nearly done. Okeyo said out the 47 counties, Turkana was the first to engage them on such a project. Edited by Henry Makori
