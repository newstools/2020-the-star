The National Cohesion and Integration Commission has warned political leaders against inciting people into war over land and boundary disputes. Commissioner Dorcas Kedogo said that about 30 cases are under investigation, linking some politicians with various levels of incitement. She spoke on Saturday at Samba Sports Youth Agenda’s office in Kombani within Matuga subcounty. Kedogo said politicians take advantage of the pending land wrangles to gain political mileage raising tension among residents. “It is so sad that when it is nearing elections the old wounds come back and people are used as vessels of war for the benefit of few individuals,” she said. She said that stern action shall be taken against the perpetrators and residents to avoid being driven astray by malicious people. The commissioner said soon, some leaders will be arraigned to answer for their crimes. Kedogo also urged residents to keep title deeds, adding that tycoons and land cartels take advantage of them. “It is important that you get the required documents to prove ownership of your land because we have learnt that people get deprived of their rights and get evicted from ancestral acreages,” she said. Kedogo condemned some leaders for frustrating women in political seats. Her remarks came a few days after Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru survived impeachment. Kedogo said women are attacked to intimidate them from vying for political posts. She said the Constitution empowers women to seek equal opportunities in leadership and men should let them exercise their rights freely. “My message to those people who target women in elected seats kindly keep off because you won’t like when we fight back,” Kedogo said.
