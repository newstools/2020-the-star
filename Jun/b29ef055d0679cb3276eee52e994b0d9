 Three people were on Monday charged with fraud and obtaining money by false pretesse after they failed to pay a bill of Sh126,450 in a Nairobi hotel. Emmanuel Bwire, Jackson Oketch and Damian Sangawe were accused of checking into Melili Hotel in South B on May 5 and leaving without notice on May 12 after accruing the bill. The trio stayed at the hotel, dining and wining for seven days before they left without settling their bills. They were accused of obtaining services at the hotel by falsely pretending they were in a position to clear the bill. The suspects approached the hotel management claiming to be technicians hired by a European investor to repair a fuel station along Mombasa Road. "The three produced documents to show they had been cleared to travel into Nairobi by the National Emergency Response Committee on coronavirus as essential services providers," court documents indicate. They requested to stay at the hotel for nine days and were charged Sh173,800 for the period as they had requested. They paid Sh47,000 and told the management that the balance shall be cleared by the investor. But the investor later informed the hotelâ€™s management that he had also been conned by the three and the matter was reported at Industrial Area police station. The suspects denied the charges before Makadara senior principal magistrate Angelo Kithinji. They were granted a bail of Sh50,000 each. Hearing of the case starts on August 20.  Edited by P.O
