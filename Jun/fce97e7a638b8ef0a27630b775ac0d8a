KCB RFC assistant coach Dennis 'Ironman' Mwanja believes the side have room for improvement after finishing second in the group phase of the Kenya Cup league. The former international Sevens star believes the bankers have had slow starts in their big matches and will be seeking for quicker starts once the season resumes. "If you look at our three games against Kabras and the two against Homeboyz, we had slow starts and that's one area I believe the squad must address," said Mwanja. The seven-time champions lost for the very first time to rivals Kabras, losing 19-6 in November. The bankers were due to face the winner of the Homeboyz v Menengai Oilers semifinal clash but the season was stopped following the coronavirus pandemic and Mwanja said a repeat match against the deejays will be tough. "They are a good side. They have given us problems this season but we know our strengths and and know their weaknesses and if the season can be still be salvaged, it will be a good game,‚Äù said Mwanja. Mwanja does not see the bankers bolstering their squad in the coming transfer window. "I believe we have a good squad from the forwards to the backs. The investment we did last season will keep us going for the next two to three seasons. But if anyone wants to join the team, they are welcome but competition for places is very stiff," he added. Last season, the holders signed prop Patrick Ouko, playmaker Johnstone Olindi and utility back Levi Amunga and the trio was an instant hit. Mwanja said the players in the team have individual training regimes and are being monitored by the strength and conditioning coach and himself. "We are monitoring the players every week and ensuring they hit their targets so by any chance the season resumes, we are ready and raring to go," he observed.
