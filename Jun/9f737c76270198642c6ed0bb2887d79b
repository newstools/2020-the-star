President Uhuru Kenyatta has directed the ministries of Interior and Education to work on guidelines and protocol on the gradual reopening of places of worship and schools. Uhuru said the Ministries should consult religious institutions on a resumption of church services without putting the lives of Kenyans at risk. "Education sector should finalise the consultations to give us an appropriate calendar for the schools to guarantee not only the safety of children but also parents," he said. "This disease is here with us and every Kenyan must take the responsibility to ensure that all is well." Uhuru further invoked the spirit of Tom Mboya as he pitched for Constitutional reforms to “improve the 2010 Constitution.” "...It is not a moment to replace it but to improve it. A moment that will correct what we did not get right in 2010," he said. He was speaking in State House during Madaraka day on June 1. "We need one that will bring an end to cycles of violence that we have witnessed since 1992. One that will deepen our democratic credentials and lead to an  inclusive society," he said. Uhuru said that we cannot move on without changing political architecture.
