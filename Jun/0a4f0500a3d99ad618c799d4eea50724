A group of youths from Kangemi, known as Yoga Heart Kenya, has come together to help the families most vulnerable due to the coronavirus pandemic. The team last week donated 250 food packages to needy families in Kangemi. It aims to donate 10,000 food donations to needy families and has so far distributed more than 3,000. The members get food donations from Team Pakaj, well-wishers and their own savings.
