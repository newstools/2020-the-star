Police are holding three suspects in connection with the chilling murder of a woman whose body was cut into pieces. The three pieces were found stuffed in a sack and dumped near Amani Court, Umoja Estate, in Nairobi on Sunday. On Monday, Buruburu police boss Adamson Bungei said two garbage collectors and a landlady had been arrested in connection with the murder. He said the garbage collectors may have been used to collect and dispose of the body. The third suspect is a landlady of the house where the deceased is said to have been living with an unidentified man. Police are now seeking the man who was cohabiting with the woman who has since fled and switched off his mobile phones. “This man was dealing with many women. We cannot tell whether they were married or just friends,” Bungei said. The man is being treated as the main suspect behind the gruesome murder. “They will help us net the main suspect. The landlady must be knowing her tenants,” Bungei added. The house where the couple lived has now been vacated. On Sunday, Bungei ruled out claims the woman might have fallen into the hands of criminals, saying that it might have been a case of domestic misunderstanding. On August 2016, a similar case occurred in the area after a woman was murdered and her dismembered body parts dumped in a thicket. The woman's hands, head and legs were found near Fadhili Primary School stuffed in a plastic bag. The torso was missing. In early May, a woman stabbed and killed her boyfriend in Umoja after a furious domestic row. In another case, a woman killed her two children and attempted suicide after a disagreement with her mother-in-law in Kayole. Edited by Henry Makori
