Nicholas Kirui, a 43-year-old tea farmer from Nakuru County is the first punter to bag the Sh15m Betika midweek jackpot. Kirui, was announced the winner by the National Super League sponsors after predicting 15 games with a stake of Sh15. The latest millionaire said the windfall quenched his thirst to make a living from betting. “When there were no games, once a week I’d entertain myself with virtual and casino games on the Betika platform. However, there is nothing like live games, the adrenaline is different. So on May 16, when Bundesliga returned and Betika announced they will be airing all the games on the live section of their website, I was happy that there was a glimmer of hope in these tough times,"said Kirui. He added: “But the English Premier League is where I knew my luck was. I love the EPL. To be honest, I spent many hours a day just analyzing the weekend games. I took a chance on some teams." "I am a Manchester United fan but I’d sell them out if it means earning myself the Sh15 Million. I stayed up all night watching the games at home with my kids, until they went to sleep and I was left dozing off ticking my wins. On the 95th Minute, with that last goal by Brighton, I was a second away from being Sh15m-richer.” Kirui plans to use part of the money to secure his family’s future by investing in farming and building some rental houses as his retirement plan.
