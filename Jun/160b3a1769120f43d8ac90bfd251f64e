The row over President Uhuru Kenyatta's refusal to appoint 41 judges escalated Friday with his two legal advisers targeted by the advocate's lobby. Attorney General Kihara Kariuki and Solicitor General Kennedy Ogeto will be expelled from the Law Society of Kenya next month. LSK accuses the two members, both advocates of the High Court, of failing to promote the respect for the rule of law and administration of justice. Kihara and Ogeto will be expelled during the Ordinary General Meeting of LSK to be convened via videoconference on July 23. The duo was given until Friday next week to tender their written defence which will be heard during the meeting. LSK president Nelson Havi said the two had brought ridicule, shame, disrepute and dishonour to the office of an advocate and as members of the lobby. “Their conduct is so gross that it warrants their expulsion from the Law Society of Kenya,” Havi said. He said Kihara had advised the President to disobey court orders over the judges approved by the Judicial Service Commission. “Kihara categorically stated that the 41 judges will not be sworn-in notwithstanding the decree of the High Court which has not been set aside or stayed,” he added. Havi revealed that LSK requested Kihara and Ogeto to ensure the swearing-in of the 41 nominated judges within seven days from May 13 but the two did not respond. A meeting of the LSK on May 11 resolved that the lobby initiates an expulsion process for the two should they fail to ensure compliance of the February 6 court orders. Havi noted that Kihara is a member of the JSC which okayed the appointment of the 11 Court of Appeal and 30 Environment and Land court judges. “Kihara being the AG and a commissioner of the JSC sat through and participated in the interviews of the 41 judges,” he said.
