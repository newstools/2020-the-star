Sports stands to benefit handsomely after the government proposed to allocate a historic figure of Sh14 billion to the  Sports Fund. Finance Cabinet Secretary Ukur Yatani recognised the role of sports in the social-economic development of Kenya when announcing the allocation. “Sports, Culture, Tourism and Arts contributes immensely to the economic development of our nation by boosting job creation for our youth and generating foreign exchange to support this sector. I propose the allocation of Sh14 billion to the Sports, Culture and Arts Fund,” said Yatani in his budget statement presented to Parliament yesterday. Last year, several federations complained about the difficulty they had in securing cash from the Sports Fund which  was established through the enactment of the Sports Act 2013, Section 12. Sports Ministry officials led by CAS Hassan Noor had advised federations to hand in their budgets early enough for consideration to avoid last minute search for government funding. According to the Sports Act, the main goal for establishing the Fund is to raise money to facilitate growth and development of the sports industry in the country. In addition, the resources from the Fund will be used to train the necessary sports personnel and support the cash award scheme for the purpose of enhancing competitiveness among the country’s sports men and women. Football Kenya Federation received the biggest government support in 2019 with a budget of Sh252 million for just preparations for the African cup of Nations.
