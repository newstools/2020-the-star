P-Unit has signed Halisi the Band amid confusion on whether Boneye has left the group. Halisi comprises Galvin Leting, Lucky Misoi and Elly Okoth. Speaking to Word Is, Frasha said Halisi's discipline inspired the group to sign them. "I have signed Halisi, now called Halisination, purely because of their talent, discipline and hard work," he said. "I have watched them for some time now. We will be working together to create content that is locally accepted but internationally acclaimed." On why Boneye left P-Unit, Frasha did not want to comment, but when we reached out to Boneye, he said he is still under the group. "Just to be clear, I am a director at Decimal Records and P-Unit Kenya Limited like anybody else, but if you are speaking about a specific project, yes, because I chose which projects to work on," he said. "I have a different strategy on different projects. Like the one they are releasing, I am not there, but we are still working together as P-Unit." P-Unit will be releasing a new hit featuring Prezzo. Frasha said the song, 'Hop and step', was done at Kompact Records. It was a collaboration of many people and the product is amazing, can't wait to drop it," he said. On Gengetone taking over the industry, Frasha said it is a revolution by young artistes due to non-progression of the industry. "They have created their own sound and audience. But they need to work on content if they are to benefit from it," he said. Like any other person, Frasha says the pandemic has hit him. "Corona has come with new opportunities, we need to adapt. How we used to consume music is also going to change, so everyone needs to re-evaluate themselves," he said. "We can make money on live shows, playlists from music download platforms, creating podcasts and others."
