The Inspector General of Police Hillary Mutyambai has ordered the immediate arrest and suspension of a police officer involved in Lessos killings. In his statement, Mutyambai said that the chaos erupted after police arrested a bodaboda operator for carrying two passengers, against the measures issued to curb the spread of coronavirus. Mutyambai said the scene attracted about 50 bodaboda riders who tried to fight and snatch a raffle from the officer while escorting the bodaboda rider to Lessos Police Station. In that commotion, the IG said that a 40-year-old man who was identified as Lazarus Tirop was fatally shot. The Independent Police Oversight Authority had also launched its investigations on the same matter. Chairperson Anne Makori said the authority has dispatched its Rapid Response Investigations team to the scene in Nandi county. "IPOA learned of an incident in which police this morning allegedly shot a man dead at Lessos Trading Center in Nandi County," Makori said. She added that "Consequently, on its motion, IPOA dispatched its Rapid Response Investigation team, which is already at the scene and has initiated investigations into the matter with a view of establishing how the shooting happened and if the force used was necessary."
