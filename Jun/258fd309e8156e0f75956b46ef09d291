Bomet Governor Hillary Barchok has asked all those wishing to donate food to the needy to seek clearance from the county commissioner to ensure it is not tainted. Barchok said advance clearance will avoid "unnecessary politics" about donations as occurred recently in Kiambu county when unsafe food was distributed. He said while making donations was noble, especially during the Covid-19 period, politicians should first be mindful of the lives and health of the people. "We want all contributions made through a coordinated channel to ensure all the foodstuffs donated are fit for human consumption... Those wishing to distribute their donations directly to the people must liaise with the county commissioner," he said. He added, "We want to avoid a scenario where some individuals politicise the issue and that is why as a county government we will not authorise distribution of such donations." The governor spoke on Friday when he sought financial support from well-wishers to collect food and supplies for more than 10,000 vulnerable people. Barchok said the coronavirus has hurt the socio-economic well-being of Bomet people and they need resources to alleviate their suffering. The county has already identified the neediest people and only they will be supported, he said. Barchok said the county has so far set aside Sh50 million to sustain families who are facing starvation. "We have identified a selection committee made up of chiefs, county administrators, representatives of women, youth, people living with disabilities and church leaders," the governor said. He said the list of beneficiaries will be made public to ensure transparency and accountability. (Edited by V. Graham)
