Some Nairobi MCAs on Wednesday night camped at the assembly alleging that MCAs allied to Nairobi governor were planning to pass the 2020/21 budget. The MCAs who spent the night at the assembly accused their counterparts of wanting to pass the Financial Year Budget without the approval of the entire House. Nominated MCA June Ndegwa said the MCAs wanted to pass the budget in favour of governor Mike Sonko. “The pro- Sonko team wants the budget allocated to Nairobi Metropolitan area be split by half. They had planned to come early and block the rest of us from accessing the assembly,” she said. But, Nominated MCA Mary Njambi refuted the claims of the intended budget changes. “Nobody intended to pass the budget.How can a budget be passed without proper sittings. All these are lies,” she said. The Impasse led to the arrest of former Clerk Jacob Ngwele. He was taken to Central Police Station. As at Thursday morning, the sergeant at arms has barred anyone including the MCAs from accessing the assembly. Budget reading is supposed to be read next Tuesday. But the estimates ere supposed to be passed today. More to follow
