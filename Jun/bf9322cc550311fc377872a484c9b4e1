Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong, Devolution Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa and Busia assembly Speaker Bernard Wamalwa on Sunday visited Nangina in Samia subcounty to assess rehabilitation of an airstrip by the national government. The site is among many the Kenya Airports Authority proposed ahead of its elevation to an international airport with construction of a 2.8km runway and control towers. KAA had carried a feasibility study in the county. Among the sites they visited were Nangina in Samia, Bugengi and  Nasewa in Matayos and Kokare in Teso North. According to their report, the authority ranked Bugengi top for meeting the threshold. The minimum requirements for an airstrip include a site which should be at least 5km from the border and 10 hectares with prospects of expanding it to international airport status. Other requirements are access to a tarmac road, water, electricity and proximity to a railway line. The prospects of the Standard Gauge Railway passing through  Kwangamor in Teso South en route to Malaba border is suitable for most of the sites. The national government has so far given Sh220 million for rehabilitation of Kitale airstrip and Sh174 million for Kakamega airstrip. Edited by Henry Makori
