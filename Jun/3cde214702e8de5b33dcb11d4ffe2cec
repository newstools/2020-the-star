Nakuru County government wants locals to be given priority in jobs and business opportunities in the planned Special Economic Zone in Mai Mahiu. It is projected that that the hub will create over 40,000 jobs directly and the county administration wants local companies and traders given opportunities to supply materials and operation of logistics companies. Nakuru County Trade and Industry chief executive officer Raymond Komen said the special economic zone is divided into the Inland Container Depot (ICD), Standard Gauge Railway terminus and the industrial park. Speaking after touring the business hub, Komen said that the county was working closely with the 11 ministries involved in the works around the special economic zone. “The Governor is fully behind this project as it will transform the county, offer investment to our local traders and employ over 40,000 people directly,” he said. He said the county has already petitioned Transport Cabinet Secretary James Macharia on areas they want addressed. “Under the petition we expect the locals to get the casual jobs and in terms of logistics like clearing and forwarding it should be conducted by local companies,” he said. The CEC said that the county is working on supporting infrastructure like hospitals and planned trading centers that will accommodate the tens of truck drivers. “Already the supply of water and sewerage services is at an advanced stage and this project will be a game changer in our county,” he said. Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry Naivasha branch chairman Stephen Thuo said project would create job opportunities and uplift business in the county.
