Traders in Kwale have asked Governor Salim Mvurya to extend the period of tax waivers to salvage a weakening economy. The 60-day waiver issued by Mvurya is coming to an end this week. The traders say the business environment is still not conducive for the county government to withdraw the waiver. Led by Omar Mwarachuo, they said their businesses hardly make profits. "We are in no position to pay taxes because whatever we get is very little," Mwarachuo says. He spoke on Monday in an interview in Matuga. Mwarachuo said the cessation of movement and curfew continue to pose a major hindrance to doing business. Kwale is among five counties where cessation of movement is in place to curb the spread of the coronavirus. The trader said a lot of money is lost in restocking and transportation of goods. He said customers have declined because many people are unable to raise surplus money to buy more than just food. According to Bintihamis Kadide, the Kwale government should wait until the economy is revived before it can withdraw the waiver. "Mvurya should wait for things to get better because if the taxes are bought back, many activities will stop," Kadide said. Kadide said Mvurya should give incentives to young entrepreneurs and create a more enabling environment for businesses. Abdallah Said asked the governor to talk to President Uhuru Kenyatta to ease some restrictions.  Edited by P.O
