Eng Silas Kinoti has been appointed the Director General of Kenya Urban Roads Authority. He has been serving in an acting capacity since September 2015. In statement on Thursday, Transport CS James Macharia said the appointment of Kinoti followed a competitive and transparent recruitment process conducted by the board of KURA. “I am pleased to announce the appointment of Silas Kinoti as the Director General,” he said. CS Macharia said Kinoti has over 20 years experience in the public sector, and has overseen the implementation of many key road projects across Kenya. Kinoti joined Kura in 2009 as a manager. He was later promoted to general manager planning and environment, a position he held until 2015, when he was picked as acting director general. He took over in 2015, following the exit of Peter Mundinia. Mundinia left Kura after he was appointed the Director General of the Kenya National Highways Authority (KeNHA). Kura was established by the Kenya Roads Acts, 2007, with the core mandate of management, development, rehabilitation and maintenance of national urban roads..
