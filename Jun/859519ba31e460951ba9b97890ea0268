 The Busia county government has defended the purchase of a Sh60 million fire engine to be stationed in Malaba for quick response to outbreaks. Chief officer in the office of the governor Ezekiel Okwach said the department had budgeted for the fire engine in the 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 financial years, but the budget was cancelled via an executive directive. Appearing before the budget and appropriations committee flanked by the director of communications Winston Mbanda and disaster management officer Levis Achoka, Okwach urged the county assembly to approve the fire engine's budget since Malaba town has a high risk of fires. The budget committee chairman Linus Asiba said they will ensure funds are allocated for the fire engine. Okwach said following the creation of the liaison and service delivery units, his department had requested for Sh20 million more to cater for office operations for the two directorates. They have also requested for a further Sh10 million to boost emergency relief and refugee assistance. Achoka said they will require Sh12.7 million for disaster preparedness, Sh12.3 million for lightning arresters in Teso North and Samia subcounties and Sh11.5 million for completion of disaster management centres. Mbanda urged the committee to approve the communications budget to enhance visibility and information dissemination. He said the directorate needs a vehicle fitted with requisite communication equipment to facilitate information transmission and enhance the ability to gather information across the county. Other plans for the communications directorate include production and broadcast of documentaries, purchase of communication equipment and the setting up of a bulk short message service (SMS).
