West Pokot county has rolled out massive vaccination of goats and sheep against peste des petits ruminants (PPR) disease across the county. The drive was disclosed on Wednesday by Governor John Longyangapuo, who said livestock contribute greatly to the county's economy. “To tap on this potential we need to vaccinate our livestock against diseases despite the Covid-19 pandemic before we lose our livestock,” he said. “This financial year we are targeting to vaccinate all animals in the county to prevent deaths,” he said. Lonyangapuo said the disease has no cure and can only be controlled through vaccination. He urged farmers to get their animals vaccinated for free. Symptoms of the disease are wounds in the mouth, mucous, diarrhoea and fever. The governor said the county supplies meat to various towns and cities and wants to ensure the animals are healthy. “We want to protect our consumers since we are among counties that sell a larger percentage of meat in this country,” he said. Vaccination will protect farmers and pastoralists from huge losses. Elimination of livestock diseases is a preparatory process ahead of opening the Nasukuta Export Abattoir, which is 70 per cent complete. “This is a crucial step in making our county a disease-free zone and ensuring we supply quality meat to all markets," he said. Lonyangapuo said they are investing heavily in increasing livestock and controlling disease since they don't want the abattoir to lack livestock. The governor said farmers have been exploited by middlemen and his government is committed to ensuring farmers reap good profits. “Soon the abattoir will be operational and farmers will longer be exploited by middlemen,"  he said.
