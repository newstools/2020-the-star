A woman is fighting for her life at a Makindu hospital after her car was sprayed with bullets on defying police orders to stop on Emali-Loitokitok road on Sunday. Police said the woman was driving towards Loitokitok on the Kenya-Tanzania border when she defied orders to stop. An officer opened fire on her vehicle. Makindu Level 5 Hospital medical superintendent Dr David Kasanga confirmed the receipt of the patient. Kasanga said the woman was shot several times; on the left thigh, hands, and had another gunshot on the stomach. "There is a consultant surgeon who is trying to save her life since she has lost a lot of blood following these injuries. He is currently assessing the damage on the stomach, to repair that first to stop more loss of blood,” Kasanga said. Kajiado county police boss Beatrice Gachago told the Star her officers had received a report of a stolen car that bore similar registration numbers and colour. “The officers stopped the woman as she approached a police roadblock in the Mashuuru subcounty jurisdiction but she refused,” Gachago said. This, she said, prompted the police to open fire on the car in a bid to demobilise it. The county police boss said the woman received several gunshots wounds, and that her officers were yet to provide full information by Sunday night. An eye witness earlier told the Star the woman was driving towards the roadblock when she was flagged down but refused to stop. (edited by o. owino)
