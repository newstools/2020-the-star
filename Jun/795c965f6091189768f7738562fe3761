The Police Service has reinstated John M’mbijiwe, the former Rift Valley provincial police officer who was interdicted in the notorious Waiganjo fake cop saga. M’mbijiwe has been appointed to the rank of Assistant Inspector General, retroactive to October 1, 2014. In a letter dated June 19, the National Police Service agreed to lift the officer’s interdiction. M’mbijiwe was interdicted and charged alongside Joshua Waiganjo who was famously accused of masquerading as an assistant commissioner of police since 2012. Waiganjo was said to have flown in police helicopters and was chauffeured around in the service’s vehicles. He disciplined junior officers, engineered transfers, arrested suspected offenders,  led police operations and even inspected guards of honour in full uniform with the insignia of an assistant commissioner of police. However, May this year, a court in Nakuru cleared him of the charges after the prosecution failed to produce sufficient evidence. M’mbijiwe too was cleared. The court said the evidence could not sustain a case. (Edited by V. Graham)
