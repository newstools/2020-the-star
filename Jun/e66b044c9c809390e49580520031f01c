Chief Justice David Maraga has suspended all court operations in Mombasa after 11 staffers tested positive for Covid-19. In a statement on Friday, the CJ said 180 of the staffers' contacts have been identified and will be quarantined. The affected courts are the Main Court Building, the City Court and the Tononoka Childrenâ€™s Court," Maraga said. "In view of these developments, we have suspended all open court activities in Mombasa until further notice. We shall, however, as much as possible, endeavour to offer online and other virtual services to court users," Maraga said. Kenya on Friday recorded 117 new cases of Covid-19, raising the country's total number to 4,374. Maraga had in March announced a slowing of operations following the confirmation of the first cases of the coronavirus. Sessions were to be heard virtually where possible. The courts had just started resuming normal operations on Monday.
