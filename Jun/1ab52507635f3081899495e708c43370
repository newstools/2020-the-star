Health CAS Rashid Aman has cautioned Kenyans against using unapproved kits purporting to test Covid-19 in the country. Aman warned that only one coronavirus test has been approved by the Ministry of Health and that is the PCR test, which is based on detection of nucleic acid of the virus. He said this is the only test that should be administered for diagnosis of coronavirus in the country. The CAS was speaking during the daily Covid-19 briefing on Wednesday when he announced 184 new virus cases bringing to 4,044 the total number of infections in the country. He warned that other tests which have been developed are not sufficiently sensitive and specific to detect what they have been developed for. "Their use for diagnosis of Covid-19 are still uncertain," he said. "Antibody Rapid Diagnostic Test are based on detection of antibodies that a person may have raised as an immune response to exposure to the virus. They do tell something when they work but it does not tell you whether the virus is active and present within that individual". According to Aman, these tests are usually 15 minutes long, a blood is drawn from a finger tip, put on a cassette and then you see a band. Somehow similar to the malaria tests. He said tests of this fashion are only authorized to be used for surveillance and research since they can identify level of exposure of the virus in communities.
