More than 200 widows and orphans in Ngungani, Mumoni subcounty of Kitui, are  benefiting from free food donations every week. The food aid has come at a time of great difficulty for the widows and orphans. Pastor Peter Muthui has been distributing maize and wheat flour, bars of soap, sugar and cooking fat since April. He called upon well-wishers to extend a helping hand to residents of Kitui who are struggling to put food on the table because of the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. Beatrice Kathanze,  a widow who looks after her five orphaned grandchildren, said her family has been receiving the food donations from April. Kathanza said she had seen the hand of God as her large family hardly ate three meals in a day. “Ever since this pandemic struck Kenya, we have been disadvantaged as I mostly depended on casual jobs but even our employers were affected by the pandemic and told us to stay a home,” she said. She pleaded with the national and county governments to also step in and donate food to them. “If a pastor is donating food, I am sure the government is also able to cushion us during this time the nation is battling Covid-19,” Kathanza said. Agnetta Mutindi, another beneficiary, said women had been most adversely affected by the pandemic as children stay at home amid the coronavirus outbreak. Josephine Mutuku Mwinzi was grateful to receive the donations which would last her a week. “Poverty levels have risen as we cannot work anywhere to fend for our families,” she said. Kukia Mwenze who previously sold illicit alcohol for survival said she was grateful to receive the food aid. Kukia said after her arrest and release from police custody Pastor Muthui told her to collect food donations from his home. “Getting food here every week has helped me to stop the illicit brew as it is what I sold to buy food,” Kukia said.
