The Education ministry has been directed to prepare for reopening of schools beginning September subsequently hinting on the postponement of KCPE and KCSE exams. President Uhuru Kenyatta on Saturday said the reopening will be gradual but remained silent on the fate of the exams. However, President Kenyatta further directed a new school calendar be made and released by mid-August. So too, the Education ministry has been tasked to ensure safety protocols that will guide the reopening of schools. All learning institutions remain shut since March 15 as measure to stem coronavirus spread. This will mean primary and secondary schools will have lost 17 weeks when they reopen. For universities, the institutions will be ushering a new academic year in September. It will also be a reprieve to the KCSE class of 2019 that is set to report to schools in September. The Education ministry on Friday presented a report to President Kenyatta whose recommendations are in line with Saturdayâ€™s announcement. The report further advised national exams scheduled for November will be administered in February 2021. Edited by R.Wamochie
