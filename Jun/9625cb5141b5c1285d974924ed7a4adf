More than 48,000 flood victims in Tana River county have begun receiving more than Sh13 million relief food from the national government. Interior Ministry Chief Administrative Secretary Hussein Dado said the food will be distributed countywide. The former governor spoke during the launch of food distribution by boat at Manono in Tana Delta subcounty for victims who have been completely cut off by floods in Kipini West ward. Everyone will get a share, Dado said. He said Tana Delta subcounty was targeted first since residents were inaccessible by road. Other food will be distributed in camps which residents complained were infested by snakes and wild animals. Dado said food distribution previously was not handled properly, so he decided to oversee the process himself to avoid complaints from victims. "Today, I came so every village affected by floods gets a share, we don't want anyone to be left out," he said. The first villages to benefit included Arango Kareiyu, Handaraku, Onworde, Lailoni, Mwanja, Odhole Samicha, Shirikisho and Manono, among others. Other relief food was sent to Hola and Bura, which were severely affected. Dado said relief food will be distributed immediately to save lives and will not be kept in stores. "We will follow up and ensure people get the relief food on time. Even if it’s a little amount, there is no need to clash over food because everyone will get their small share,” he said. He thanked the farmers from Shirikisho for welcoming pastoralists from Odhole to shelter in their homes as a show of brotherhood. Dado also reminded the flood victims that the coronavirus was real and urged them to follow government protocols to prevent spreading the virus. "One infected person can spread the virus to over 100 people. Some are immune but those at risk are old and have ailments such as diabetes," he said. . Present were MCA Musa Wario of Kipini West ward and other local leaders. (Edited by V. Graham)
