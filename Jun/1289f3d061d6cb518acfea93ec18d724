Public Service and Gender CS Margaret Kobia has said women in leadership in the country are facing trials following a looming impeachment of Kitui Governor. Kobia said on Saturday that an alleged impeachment motion from Kitui MCAs seeking to remove Charity Ngilu from office over poor performance confirms that women are an easier target. She has urged the society to support effective leadership for inclusive governance, hoping that due process will be followed. "I note women leadership is again on trial.  Gvn Charity Ngilu of Kitui impeachment threat due to alleged poor performance confirms that women are easier target to remove from high office. The society need to support effective leadership for inclusive governance.  I expect due process and justice." Waiguru and Ngilu are the only female governors in the country out of the 47 governors. Recently, the CS defended the impeachment of Kirinyaga governor Anne Waiguru, which attracted varying reactions from Kenyans. Defending Waiguru, CS said in her statement that the impeachment was an 'indicator that some do not value strong women leadership. The CS said Waiguru's impeachment during the Covid-19 global pandemic is a major injustice to women's leadership. Some of the Kenyans accused the CS of being selective in her comments on charges facing some top leaders in the country. Waiguru was impeached by 23 MCAs out of 33 and is set to appear before an eleven-member Senate Committee to defend herself. The hearing will take place on Tuesday and Wednesday before the committee retreats to write a report for tabling on Friday. Ngilu was among the women leaders who defended Waiguru impeachment, saying that the travesty visited upon Waiguru is one of the many crooked ways that 'PhD machinations' are using to pull her down. "We strongly condemn it. My sister Anne, take heart, hold your head high and continue serving the people of Kirinyaga. You will be vindicated," Ngilu tweeted.
