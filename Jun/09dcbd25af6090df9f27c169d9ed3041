President Uhuru Kenyatta has said that the security forces and the community should be brought together in order to end police brutality and unnecessary murder associated with racism. The president made these remarks on Thursday via a virtual meeting with the Atlantic Council. Uhuru said that the bodies concerned with the matter in Kenya have already kick-started a probe into police brutality. He said some of the officers involved in brutality have already been prosecuted. "We are trying to ensure that all the necessary oversight bodies that have been charged with the responsibility of overseeing the police forces are empowered to the degree that they are now able to take action,"Uhuru said. The president added that all countries are still struggling to end police brutality. "We do acknowledge that there must be a situation where policing and community are brought much closer than they have been at the past." Commenting on the killing of African American George Floyd that sparked worldwide protest, Uhuru said it has catalysed the need to bring together the police and the community. He added that the emerging issues causing conflicts between the police forces and the citizens pose challenges to the government, which has to review its curriculum to prevent such vices from repeating itself. Kenya will know the fate of its bid for 2021-2022 Non-permanent seat in the UNSC today following the retake of votes. Kenya gained 113 votes on Wednesday against Djibouti which gathered 78 votes but could not be declared the winner for failing to rise two-third votes.
