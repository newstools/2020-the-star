Garissa residents have been encouraged to donate blood often to help patients in need of transfusion. A blood donation campaign to relieve shortages in Garissa County Referral Hospital was organised by Udgoon Foundation in partnership with the county Department of Health, Kenya Red Cross and Garissa Leaders Forum. Health executive Ahmenadhir Omar said residents should feel free to visit health institutions and donate blood. "Our people should adopt the practice of donating blood often instead of waiting for a whole year to do it," he said. Omar who led a team of health professionals to donate blood commended the altruistic gesture of the residents and encouraged many more to come out and donate blood at their convenience. He said pregnant mothers and road accident victims formed the largest segment of patients in need of blood in local hospitals. He thanked the residents who volunteered to donate blood during the weeklong event. He said Garissa County Referral Hospital catered for patients from across the county and neighbouring Wajir and Tana River counties. The hospital needs an average of 300 to 350 pints of blood per month. Amina Siyad Kuno, the lead organiser, said voluntary blood donation preserved the spirit of solidarity and that it was the best form of charity. "We all need to stick together and help each other. If you give to others, it will come back multiple times," Amina said. "By donating blood, you become healthier and save lives. It could be that of your mother, father, sister or a close relative,” she  said. Red Cross regional coordinator Mohamed Abdikadir called on residents to make to donate blood throughout the year. "By donating blood, we give back to society in the form of saving lives, not just of people that you know, but those in dire need of help," Abdikadir said. Edited by Henry Makori
