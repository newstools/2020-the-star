Leaders from Mwingi North constituency, home of Wiper party leader Kalonzo Musyoka, have come out to defend him. The former Vice President has been accused of ineptitude by former Machakos Senator Johnston Muthama Muthama accused Musyoka of being self-centered and disregarding the needs of Ukambani to serve his own interest. He said Kalonzo pushed for the nomination of his son to the Eastern Africa Legislative Assembly (EALA). But Mwingi North MP Paul Nzengu accused Muthama and his allies of undermining the Wiper party leader even after riding on his name to acquire a lot of politically. Speaking at Kamuwongo market, Nzengu said he was astonished at how Muthama could turn against Kalonzo after previously brokering many political alliances for him, sometimes against his wish. “Wiper Party leader has done a lot for his electorate in the many years he was the MP for Mwingi North and up to date his works as the Ukambani kingpin can never be downplayed,” Nzengu said. David Muema, an opinion leader from Mwingi, said residents of Mwingi North and Ukambani at large understand well what the former VP had accomplished for them including building roads and providing water. “We cannot accept someone who got political mileage through Wiper Party to disrespect our leader,” Muema said. Mary Kimanthi, a youth leader, said Kalonzo’s detractors came too late as the Ukambani kingpin had already made his name and his leadership in the region was exemplary. “Muthama is not Kalonzo’s equal and should stop talking ill of him,” Kimanthi said.
