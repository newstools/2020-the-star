ANC nominated  MP Godfrey Osotsi has denied fighting party leader Musalia Mudavadi or Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang'ula. He said he and the two politicians only have divergent views but he is not satisfied with their leadership. "Politics is all about ideologies. You may agree or disagree and when you disagree on ideologies, that does not mean we are disrespecting our leaders," Osotsi said. “Our leaders in the region must learn how to accept fresh and new ideologies from younger leaders of this country. If not, then there is no need to have youthful leaders in this country if their ideologies will be treated as being disrespectful to their seniors.” The lawmaker was reacting to Wetang’ula’s remarks at the funeral of Sophia Monyo, mother of Luanda MP Christopher Omulele. “If you are a leader and you don’t respect  your seniors and you walk around throwing words anyhow, it will come a time what you are doing will happen to you as well,” Wetang’ula said. "Don’t allow yourself to be used by our political nemeses to disrupt the ongoing Luhya unity." His sentiments were echoed by Kiminini MP Chris Wamalwa, Sabatia MP Alfred Agoi and Vihiga Woman Rep Beatrice Adagala. However,  Webuye West MP Dan Wanyama and Charles Gimose of Hamisi stayed clear of politics. But Osotsi asked Wetang'ula to stop muzzling alternative opinions in the region as disrespect. “Raila Odinga, James Orengo, Paul Mwite and Kiraitu Murungi, the 'Young Turks', came out strongly to address the ills in this country during Moi’s era and demanded a new constitution and multiparty democracy. Why was it not treated as disrespect to Moi?"  he said. All leaders must be treated equally with respect, regardless of their political ideologies, Osotsi added. "Respect is earned and you don’t force people to respect you," he said. Edited by Henry Makori
