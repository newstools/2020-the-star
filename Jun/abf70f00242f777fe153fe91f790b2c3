A former Nairobi county official has failed in his attempt to challenge the admissibility of a search order in a corruption case. Stephen Osiro wanted the High Court to quash orders granted by a Kibera court in 2015 authorising the Ethics and Anti-corruption Commission to search his bank account held at NIC. Osiro challenged the legality of the undated order and not its existence nor when it was issued. Also sought was an order restraining the EACC and the Director of Public Prosecutions from effecting the order. But High Court Judge John Onyiego ruled that Osiro did not meet the threshold for the court to grant the orders he had sought. Onyiego said admission of exhibits before a trial court is the duty of the presiding magistrate. Whether the documents are properly  admitted or not is a matter for the trial court to determine, he said. “There was nothing irregular, improper or illegal in issuing the orders sought to be quashed. I am of the view that notice was not necessary and that no prejudice was suffered,” he said. The judge also said Osiro failed to prove or establish how his rights were violated when a lawful process was executed. He said the EACC and DPP have an obligation to investigate crime and prefer criminal charges against any person suspected of an offence. “Carrying out investigations is a lawful duty and it's upon the court to reasonably balance individual and public interest triumphs over private interest. In this case I do not find any specific private interest violated or threatened to be violated,” he said. Osiro who served during former Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero's administration earned monthly salary of about Sh90,000 but amassed Sh340 million in wealth in five years.
