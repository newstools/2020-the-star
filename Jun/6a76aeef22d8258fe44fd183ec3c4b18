Football fraternity in Vihiga County is mourning the passing on of soccer administrator Albert Alfayo Mujivane who passed on last weekend after a short illness. The late Mijivane will be remembered for the part he played in the rapid growth of soccer in Vihiga county and the introduction of Super League outfit, Vihiga United and Kenya women's Premier League giants Vihiga Queens. Vihiga United chairman Kahi Indimuli eulogised the late Mujivane, popularly known as Guji, as a great soccer and hockey figure in Vihiga and beyond. “It's with deep sorrow that I have learnt of the untimely demise of my mentor and great soccer advisor who passed on in his home in Ikumba Village at the time we needed him most. He has played a key role in promotion of soccer in the region and we will miss him,” said Indimuli. He said the former Vihiga High School principal was a very selfless and generous individual who sacrificed a lot to ensure the right structures are in place for the development of the game. “We regret the untimely death that has robbed us a great football brain, a mentor and a supporter of soccer,” mourned Indimuli. Vihiga Queens' coach Alex Alumira also condoled to the family, saying: “We have lost a great pillar in football development in this region. Sadly,  we have lost him at the time when his support and advice was greatly needed. We pray for strength and encouragement to the family and soccer fraternity,” Alumira condoled.
