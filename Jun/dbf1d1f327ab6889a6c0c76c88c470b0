The pilot of a private light aircraft narrowly escaped death in Lamu after the plane crashed at Kiunga airstrip in Lamu East on Saturday. The plane which belongs to My.Kenya Company was transporting 500kg of miraa from Isiolo to Kiunga. The pilot of the aircraft registration number 5Y-BAF Cesna 310 identified as Joseph Mativo is said to have been trying to land at the Kiunga airstrip at around 2pm but miscalculated, leading to the mishap. The accident was confirmed by Lamu county commissioner Irungu Macharia who revealed that the plane touched the runway at a shorter distance of about 700 metres at a higher speed than normal for a safe landing. “He was trying to reduce speed as he had come to the end of the runway yet the plane was still in high speed which isn’t supposed to be the case. To avoid crashing into the bushes, he swerved the plane to the left side and crashed into an electric pole which stopped it from further movement,” Macharia said. The pilot escaped unhurt and was arrested for interrogation. Police investigations indicated the left and right wings and the aircraft’s propellers were badly damaged. “The pilot claimed to have an authorization document that allowed him to come to Kiunga. As per our investigations, we found that he didn’t have even the Kenya Airports Authority (KAA) clearance certificate for the same. He also didn’t have the cargo permit to allow him to ferry miraa to this place, “ Macharia said. Edited by Henry Makori
