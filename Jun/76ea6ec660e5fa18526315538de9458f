National Olympic Committee of Kenya has planned a number of activities to mark the Olympic Day. Contrary to the one-day event which usually features a number of races, this time activities will run for the next two weeks because of the current Covid-19. To highlight the event will be an Arts and essay competition, who winners were announced yesterday. The theme for the arts and essay competition was “My Olympic Dream” as NOCK sought to promote the ideals of Olympism among young Kenyans. The competition attracted a lot of entries from youngsters all over Kenya as NOC-K partnered with lecturers from Kenyatta University Linguistics and Arts Departments to do the judging. The overall winners in the essay competition (14-18 years old) were Sandra Hawi Awuor (Nairobi), Shirleen Wanjiku (Muranga) and Monica Wanjiku Ngugi (Nyeri). The arts competition (6-13 years) saw Ridhi Somaiya (Nairobi), Pasha Haria (Nairobi) and Mahi Chaya (Nairobi) took the honours in the girls category while Dhara Vishaal, Abizer Khanbai and Benji Mkenya dominated the boys cadre. Besides the arts and essay competition,  Nock will also feature Olympic Day workout competition. The event is aimed at encouraging people to keep fit during this difficult period. The event dubbed NOC-K ‘Get Into Running Kenya’ started yesterday  and will run until July 5. This is the equivalent of the Olympic Day run, except this time, people will run remotely and post their personal best time in 5km, 10km or 21km distances. This is in line with the global Olympic Day objectives which encourages people to stay active, strong and healthy. The campaign seeks to increase participation in sport and encourage everyone to improve their personal best.
