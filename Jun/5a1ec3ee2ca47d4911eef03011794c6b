The Anti-Corruption Court has allocated seven days to the hearing of a Sh8 million graft case against Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong and eight others. Chief magistrate Douglas Ogoti of Milimani Anti-Corruption Court ordered the hearing to start from July 8. The magistrate fixed the hearing for the accused persons to defend themselves after they were found with a case to answer on June 5. The accused will be given sworn evidence and allowed to call two to four witnesses. The magistrate had said in his ruling that the prosecution had established grounds for the case against all the accused persons to warrant them to be put on their defence. He said the evidence and witnesses had convinced him the governor, Busia finance executive Bernard Yaite, chief finance officer Leonard Obimbira, head of treasury Samuel Ombui, Allan Omachari, Edan Odoo, Renish Omullo, Sebasian Hallensben and Madam R Enterprises were in 2018 involved in fraud. Immediately afterÂ  Ogoti ruled that the governor has a case to answer, Ojaamong said that he would give a sworn defence and call several witnesses to assert his innocence. His co-accused also said they would give sworn testimonies to prove they were not guilty as charged. Ojaamong had denied abuse of office charges. He was also accused of conspiracy to commit an economic crime and engaging in a project without proper planning. Testimony made in court was that the Busia governor and the other officials engaged a company known as Madam R Enterprises to conduct a feasibility study on waste management yet the project had not been budgeted for. In the process, the county lost Sh8 million, the court was told. They were also accused of willful failure to comply with the law on the management of public funds and fraudulent acquisition of public property. Edited by Henry Makori
