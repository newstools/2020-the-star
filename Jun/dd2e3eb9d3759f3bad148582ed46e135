Former Karachuonyo MP James Rege and six others are being sought by EACC over Sh2 million procurement of telemedicine equipment. Rege is currently the chairman of Kenya Electricity Transmission Company (Ketracoo). According to the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission, the telemedicine equipment which was to be purchased from the CDF kitty was paid for but not delivered. EACC on Friday confirmed that a warrant of arrest have been issued against Rege and the six suspects. Four of the suspects have already been arrested but two, including the former MP are still at large. Those already arrested include former Karachuonyo CDF Manager Michael Ocholla, ex-CDF Chair Pacifica Adero Kobe and Samuel Okuta Lieta, a Homa Bay based businessman. Also arrested is Rege’s former personal assistant Festus Kennedy Ochieng. EACC  Spokesman Yassin Amaro said the suspects are wanted in relation to allegations of corruption and violation of procurement laws in the award of contract to Alliance Logistical Centre. The firm was awarded the contract by Karachuonyo CDF for the supply of telemedicine equipment at a cost of Sh2,190,709 which was paid for but not delivered. “Out of the four suspects arrested this morning, three were arraigned at the Anti-Corruption Court in Homa Bay and were released on bond,”Amaro told the Star.
