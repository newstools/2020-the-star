The Court of Appeal has suspended proceedings before a tribunal appointed to investigate the conduct of High Court Judge Lucy Waithaka. Judges Martha Koome, Aske Makhandia and Agnes Murgor suspended the proceedings pending the hearing and determination of an appeal filed by Waithaka. The judges said should the proceedings before the tribunal go on, the outcome will be irreparable despite the appeal. “At the end of the day, her image in the public eye would have been destroyed for good. These fears are certainly genuine and well-founded,” they ruled. The judges observed that Waithaka has made a case for them to grant the order sought. Waithaka was an Environment and Land Court judge based in Nyeri until her suspension on June 4 last year. She then filed a petition before the same court in Nairobi to challenge the constitutionality of her removal. The judge said her fundamental rights and freedoms would be violated should the tribunal proceed with the hearing. She lost the case at the High Court before filing a notice of appeal on December 17 last year. The Judicial Service Commission accused the judge of issuing two conflicting judgments in a land dispute pitting Jonathan Kimutai against Philip Lelei. The conflicting judgments suggested impropriety, the commission said. Edited by R.Wamochie
