The court has pushed ethnic contempt case against Narok Senator Ledama Ole Kina to Wednesday morning. Milimani chief magistrate Martha Mutuku deferred plea taking after defence lawyers led by George Ojackoya informed the court that the charge against Ledama is defective. The lawyer applied to be given more time to  file formal application opposing the taking of plea in the alleged defective charge against their client. However, the prosecution, led by Joseph Riungu, opposed the defence application, saying it had been brought in bad faith, adding the charge sheet was properly drafted. Riungu told the court that the office of Director of Public Prosecutions received the file after completion of investigations into the alleged offence, upon which the charge was approved based on evidence contained in the file. The magistrate directed that the defence file its application by Wednesday and the prosecution respond by Friday. On May 19, Senior principal magistrate Kennedy Cheruiyot issued summons against Ole Kina to appear in court to answer charges of ethnic contempt on comments he made in February 19, 2020 during a live TV show. The senator is accused of uttering words that were intended to incite feelings of discrimination against non-Maasai communities living in Narok county. The charge against the senator states that “on February 19, 2020 at  Jeff Koinange Live Citizen news TV Channel, in Nairobi within Nairobi county, uttered words to the effect that Maasai issues will be articulated by Maasais! Not Manje...” According to the prosecution, the charges against Ole Kina are contrary to the National Cohesion and Integration Act No 12 of 2008.
