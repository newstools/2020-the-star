Both the East African Community and the Kenyan flags shall be flown at half-mast from Saturday until the burial date of Burundian President Pierre Nkurunziza. In a presidential proclamation on Friday, President Uhuru Kenyatta said all flags in public buildings, grounds and wherever else throughout the entire territory in the country and at all of Kenya’s Diplomatic Missions abroad shall heed the directive. "In solidarity with our brothers and sisters in the Republic of Burundi, the wider EAC and the whole of Africa who are in deep mourning at the loss of a Great Son of Africa I, Uhuru Kenyatta, under the authority vested in me as the President of the Republic of Kenya, do hereby order and direct that in memory of the Late President Pierre Nkurunziza, and in solemn solidarity and mourning; the Flag of the East African Community and the Flag of the Republic of Kenya shall be flown at half-mast from dawn on Saturday, 13 until sunset on the day of his interment," Uhuru said. The outgoing Burundi Head of State died of Covid-19 on Monday, according to diplomatic sources in Bujumbura and Nairobi. The Burundi government had said Nkurunziza’s sudden death was a result of a heart attack. The 55-year old was due to stand down in August following elections on May 20. Uhuru, in his condolence message on Tuesday, described Nkurunziza as an outstanding regional counterpart who served his country with distinction as Head of State and Government, and worked tirelessly for the peace and stability of his country and the Great Lakes Region. The President said, "Death has robbed East Africa of a prominent leader whose contribution to the integration and progress of the region shall be sorely missed."
