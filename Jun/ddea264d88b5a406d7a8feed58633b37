Police officers have arrested several motorists at the Blue post roadblock in Thika for offering bribes to manoeuvre their way into and out of Nairobi County. The Inspector General of Police Hillary Mutyambai made an impromptu visit to the erected roadblock on Wednesday to assess how the police are going about their work. He said 10 motorists and four police officers manning the roadblock were arrested for facilitating the bribes. Mutyambai said that he visited the area following complaints raised by Kenyans during his interaction with Kenyans on social media. He said Kenyans had complained that police officers are receiving bribes from the members of the public to allow them to cross the border. The IG has said that the restriction measures are put in place to help curb the spread of coronavirus in the country. He added that the police and the members of the public should adhere to them. During the engagement with Kenyans, the IG asked the members of the public to avoid giving money to the police officers. There have been reports that people are easily crossing roadblocks provided that they give the police some little cash. President Uhuru Kenyatta had earlier this month declared a cessation of movement in Nairobi, Mombasa and Mandera counties. Uhuru also had extended the curfew order for 30 days days following the increases in the number of virus cases. The president also lifted the order in Kilifi and Kwale counties and revised the curfew hours across the country. On Wednesday, the Ministry of Health confirmed that 254 new cases were recorded in the last 24 hours, raising the total number of cases in the country to 5,206.
