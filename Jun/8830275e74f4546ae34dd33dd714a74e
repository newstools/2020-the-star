Public hospitals remain deserted with patients left on their own as the healthcare workers strike in Kisumu enters its third week. Patients in most public hospitals have been discharged, some asked to seek alternative medical services or go to private facilities. The more 3,000 health workers, including doctors, are demanding prompt payment of salaries, implementation of promotions and payment of Covid-19 hazard allowances. They insist they will not return to work until their demands are met. Since the beginning of the strike, locals have been calling Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o to personally sit down with the health workers and end the strike. Erastus Otieno noted that for residents who only have the Universal Health Coverage card, they can only resort to pain killers or traditional medicines. Last week on Wednesday, they dared Governor Anyang' Nyong'o to make good his threat to relieve them of their duties. Union officials, led by Kenya National Union of Nurses Kisumu branch secretary Maurice Opetu, said no amount of threats will make them call off the strike, which entered its second week. Opetu, at a press briefing, accused the Nyong’o administration of disregarding the welfare of healthcare service providers, noting that their grievances were long overdue. “We're not going to be cowed by sacking threats. Our issues are legitimate and we will listen to nothing short of addressing them,” he said. At the same time, the health workers demanded the governor take action against those believed to have misappropriated funds meant for health workers' promotion. They claimed Sh250 million was allocated in the current budget and another Sh38 million in the supplementary budget, but the money has not been paid out. Nyong'o has said earlier the strike by health workers is being fanned by politicians not concerned with medics’ grievances that are being resolved.
