Kisumu Governor Anyang Nyong'o has threatened to remove the names of striking health workers from the county's payroll. Nyongo in a statement on Thursday said he will effect the move should the health workers fail to report to their work stations by Friday, June 12 at 8.30 am. He said it was clear that the strike is frivolous, unjustified and meant to defeat the ends of justice. The governor said the strike which is in its third day, was unreasonable and is subjecting innocent citizens to unwarranted suffering. "I declare that the strike is baseless and in bad faith, contrary to the ethics and call of duty of health workers in particular and civil servants in general," Nyong'o said. He stressed there was absolutely no genuine reason to proceed on with the strike by the health workers. "Any health worker who will not have reported to their work station as directed shall be deemed to have absconded duty and will be removed from the county government's payroll with immediate effect," Nyongo said. On Wednesday, the health workers pledged not to relent until their grievances are met. They demand promotions, redeployment, payment of salary arrears and Covid-19 ‘hazard’ allowances. Doctors who had given their strike notice on June 2 joined the walkout, making the same demands. A spot check by the Star at various facilities revealed many empty beds. Some patients were waiting for relatives to pick them, others were assisted by security guards manning the wards. At Kombewa Subcounty Hospital, only the medical superintendent was present; otherwise, the facility was empty. At the county hospital, patients were being taken home if they could not afford private hospitals. Nyanza branch KMPDU chairman Kevin Osuri told the Star they were disappointed with the county government. "Despite saying they were ready for negotiations they had received no communications from the county," he said.
