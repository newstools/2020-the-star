Kenya national basketball team coach Cliff Owuor is looking at the possibilities of having some training sessions for a few players in the wake of the current government restrictions that have been extended by 30 more days. He, however, noted that a good number of them will continue training at home ahead of the Afro-Basket qualifiers in November. Owuor said despite the extension of the curfew by President Uhuru Kenyatta, there is need for the players to keep training on daily basis in a bid to keep fit. “They must be engaged in their constant work outs and I will try to see if we can organise a physical meeting with them to forge a way forward,” he added. He said he is exploring ways to have a possible training sessions with a small group of players since this is the only way he can observe their output. “I believe it is possible to have few players train while they observe the social distancing. This will really help. But I will consult first,” he said. Owuor, who plans for friendly matches against Uganda, Rwanda and DR Congo when things open up, is upbeat about his team’s chances in the qualifier. “We have a chance to make it to the final round but we must work really hard considering the opponents we face in November,” he observed. Kenya will play continental giants Angola Mozambique and Senegal in a four-team, two series rounds. The venues of the matches are yet to be confirmed. Captain Griffin Ligare said they meet on zoom regularly to follow training workouts from the coach as well as check on each other. “For training, we are still on home workouts with the available spaces at our respective homes,” Ligare said. He added: “ We were hoping to resume physical training but it is better we wait until we have this Covid-19 under control.”
