Mwingi residents from Burrow Pit near Kiambere dam have decried oppression by Embu police officers located at the border of the two counties. The residents said the police were stationed at Kiambere Dam in Embu to provide security. However, the officers allegedly demand Sh100 from every motorist from Kitui county to be allowed entry into Embu county. On Thursdays, movement of people across the border is high as it is the market day at Kiambere in Embu. A motorist at Burrow Pit who sought anonymity said he was sent by his wife to buy cabbages among other household items at Kiambere market. When he tried passing the border point, he was allegedly asked for Sh100 by police officers. “I am a licensed motorist and the officers did not point out what offence I had done to stop me from crossing to Embu county,” he said. After his attempts to go to Embu failed, he turned without the items he had been sent by his wife. Mumoni subcounty police commander Maurice Gunda said he had been informed and would visit the place during market days to investigate the matter. Francis Mwasya Manzi, another resident, said the officers were initially meant to guard the dam at the spillway but had resorted to oppressing motorists crossing to the other side. “From Burrow Pit centre to Kiambere market in Embu county, a motorist charges Sh100. On reaching the border, a police officer asks the motorist for Sh100. What sort of business is that, honestly?” Manzi said. Paul Mathembe urged the government to intervene and erect a police post at the spillway to solve the wrangles at the border. “If there was a police post at the border, then we would be served by Kitui officers and we would be promoting our economy,” Mohamed said. Gabriel Maluki, 68, stated that it was unfair for people to be troubled in their own land and urged the government to intervene. Edited by Henry Makori
