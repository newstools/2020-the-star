Commercial International Bank (CIB) has contributed $100,000 (Sh10 million) to the coronavirus emergency fund. The fund was launched by President Uhuru Kenyatta on March 30. “It is important that we stand with the people of Kenya at this difficult time for all of us," chairman and managing director of CIB Hisham Ezz Al-Arab said. He added that the task of fighting the pandemic is huge and no single entity can do it alone. "My hope is that this contribution will assist the government as it works with the medical services and front line staff to save lives in Kenya," he said. The Central Bank of Kenya in April announced the acquisition of 51 per cent of the shares of Mayfair Bank Limited by CIB. The central bank’s approval was followed by that of Treasury CS Ukur Yatani. Building on the global experience and technical know-how of CIB and Mayfair Bank’s local network and reach, the combination is expected to set the foundation for building a world-class institution that caters to the needs and evolving expectations of SMEs and large corporates in Kenya and beyond. The Covid-19 Emergency Fund has received more than Sh2 billion to date.
