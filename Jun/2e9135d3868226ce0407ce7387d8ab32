The pilots of the Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) flight that crashed last month, killing 97 people, were distracted by a conversation about Covid-19, a minister has said. The Airbus A320 was flying from Lahore to Karachi on 22 May when it came down in a residential area while trying to land at Jinnah International Airport. An initial report into the disaster, released on Wednesday, said the pilots and air traffic control were at fault for the crash, because they did not follow protocol. Presenting the findings to parliament, Pakistan's aviation minister, Ghulam Sarwar Khan, said the aircraft was "100% fit to fly" and there was no technical fault. "The pilot and co-pilot were not focused and throughout the conversation was about coronavirus," Khan said, adding their families had been affected by Covid-19. The crash came just days after Pakistan began allowing commercial flights after coronavirus restrictions were eased. Pakistan has recorded almost 190,000 coronavirus infections to date, one of the highest caseloads in the world. The death toll in the country reached 3,755 on Wednesday. New cases are reported to be declining in the country, after authorities imposed localised lockdowns in dozens of hotspots across 20 cites in mid-June.
