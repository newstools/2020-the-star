Brescia are set to terminate Mario Balotelli’s contract after the Italy striker failed to return to training ahead of Serie A’s restart this month, Italian media reported. Balotelli, 29, signed a three-year contract with his hometown club last year after they earned promotion to the top flight for the first time since 2011. Balotelli has earned a reputation as a troublemaker during a career in which he has played for Inter Milan, Manchester City, AC Milan, Liverpool, Nice and Olympique de Marseille, and won 36 international caps. Sky Sports reported Balotelli was involved in a row with Brescia president Massimo Cellino after the striker did not return to training when COVID-19 restrictions were eased in the country. The report said Balotelli was offered a consensual termination, which he refused, and the club then sent a letter to his lawyer saying his contract would be ended. Balotelli has scored five league goals in 19 appearances this season for a struggling Brescia side who are bottom of the league standings—nine points from the safety zone with 12 games left. Serie A, suspended on March 9 due to the coronavirus pandemic, is due to resume on June 20. Elsewhere, there were no positive results for coronavirus from 1,195 tests in the latest round of Premier League testing. The sixth round of twice-weekly screening of players and club staff took place on June 4 and 5. One person tested positive in the previous round, and 13 in total from 6,274 tests since they began. The Premier League— suspended since 13 March— is set to resume behind closed doors on June 17 when Aston Villa host Sheffield United at 18:00 BST. Manchester City entertain Arsenal at 20:15. Liverpool are 25 points clear at the top of the table, while Bournemouth, Aston Villa and Norwich City are in the relegation zone. There are 92 games remaining this season.
