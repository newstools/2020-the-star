 The government on Friday released Sh4.37 billion to be paid to beneficiaries enrolled in the national cash transfer programme. Social Protection PS Nelson Marwa said a total of 1,094,323 beneficiaries will each be paid Sh4,000 for the months of May and June. The programme targets beneficiaries enrolled under the three Inua Jamii cash transfer programmes which include, orphans and vulnerable, older persons, and persons with severe disabilities. Marwa said the funds will be paid from Tuesday through Cooperative Bank, Equity Bank, Kenya Commercial Bank, and Post Bank. “The money has been disbursed promptly to cushion these vulnerable groups from the negative effects of Covid-19,”Marwa said in a statement. The PS said the amount will remain in the beneficiaries’ accounts for a period of 6 months. “Therefore, beneficiaries are advised not to rush to the banks in what could make them break health protocols meant to control the spread of coronavirus,” the PS said. He said the four banks have been prepared thoroughly to ensure they maintain the Ministry of Health protocols. Marwa said the Labour and Social Protection ministry was working closely with the Ministry of Interior and Coordination of National Government to ensure all the health protocols are strictly adhered to.
