Shalom Hospital in Athi River was on Friday sealed off after reports of deaths of several patients from Covid-19. Several other patients and healthcare workers are also said to have tested positive for the virus. The decision was arrived at after consultations between the Kenyan Medical Practitioners and Dentists Council, the County Government of Machakos and the Director General of Health. The hospital will now act as a quarantine facility until the process of screening and testing for Covid-19 is complete. That means no one is allowed in or to leave the hospital until the process is completed. “We have a team on the ground but I will be able to give an updated report by midday. We have sent teams there we want the samples taken and I will be able to give an update,” KMPDC CEO Daniel Yumbya told the Star on the phone on Saturday. Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua said the facility will remain sealed off for several days since the screening and testing process might take time. “The process of screening and testing for Covid-19 may take several days and has already started,” Mutua said through his twitter handle. “Further decisions will be undertaken according to evaluation of the relevant agencies involved in the provision f healthcare and combating of Covid-19.” The county boss urged members of the public to be patient as the effort to ensure all health facilities are safe so as to avoid hospital based infections
