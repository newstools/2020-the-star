The Kenya Copyright Board (KECOBO) has clarified an earlier directive requiring disc-jockeys to have a special broadcast licence to livestream their performances. In an earlier statement, Kecobo said any time a DJ creates a live stream and starts broadcasting music to the Internet, they become a radio station, a reason they need licences from copyright owners or Collective Management Organisations. “Anyone who violates the exclusive rights of the copyright owner is an infringer of that copyright,” the board said. The annual licence fee of Sh10,000, or Sh750 per event, was imposed. This sparked protests from the DJs, who are heavily depending on live streams during the corona pandemic lockdowns. Kecobo responded to the complaints, clarifying that DJs attached to licensed business premises are not required to pay. “The licence requirement applies to deejays who are not attached to licensed business premises,” Kecobo director Edward Sigei said. "Deejays who perform at a venue that has obtained a CMO licence are not required to pay." The copyright board added that freelance DJs who are not attached to licensed business premises or have not paid are required to pay Sh10,000 annually or Sh750 per event, payable to CMOs. As for live streaming, Kecobo warned that performances containing recorded music are subject to terms and conditions of the platforms DJs use.
