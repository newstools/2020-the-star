At least 54 people in Kisii who interacted with Covid-19 patients have been placed in quarantine. The county has registered two more cases. One of the patients travelled from Nairobi to Bobasi, where villagers raised the alarm. Residents have been urged to continue observing preventive measures. "We request our people to continue wearing masks and maintain social distance. It is no time for a honeymoon," Governor James Ongwae said on Wednesday. He spoke at a youth function. Ongwae said health officers are prepared to handle cases but residents should play their part to prevent the spread of the virus. Kisii has reported four cases while Nyamira has one. In the neighbouring Migori, one Covid-19 patient has died. In Kisii, the two initial cases were a hotelier from Tanzania and a traveller from Malindi. They have recovered. Ongwae said the county has prepared 400 beds in isolation wards. He said an additional 450 beds will be used for quarantine. "There are people who are saying that we are not prepared. With all these facilities put in place, surely we cannot talk of lack of preparedness," he said. Ongwae said ongoing works at the new 250-bed child and mother hospital are in advanced stages. The hospital, once complete, will be the largest specialised health facility in the region. Youth Bunge Sacco leader Asha Moronya said young people have a major role to play to prevent the spread of the disease in villages. He said they received donations from USAID which will be distributed by the youth to the elderly. They include sanitiser, 16 thermal guns and 1,000 face masks. Edited by Frank Obonyo
