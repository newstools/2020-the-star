Health CS Mutahi Kagwe has asked the law enforcement officers to apply the restriction measures imposed to curb the spread of the virus without ant bias. The CS said that no one is above the law and the same should be applied while dealing with any forms of gatherings arranged by politicians. "Irrespective of the person, irrespective of the size or any other gatherings, no gatherings should be allowed anyway in this republic," Kagwe said. He has also asked Kenyans to avoid any kind of gatherings in the country organised by politicians. The CS said the virus does not choose a person depending on the political party or a group. "This virus does not have a political party. This virus does not have a good side or a bad side. This virus does not know this side or the other side. This virus will kill you irrespective of whom gathering you have gone to," Kagwe said. He added that " No matter who calls you... do not attend these gatherings." The CS saidÂ  that the politicians who calls people to attend such gatherings will not be around if they are infected by the virus. "When your family is suffering, I guarantee you that whoever had call you will not be with you. You will be on your own." The country has marked its 100 days since the first case of the virus was reported ion March 13, 2020. Kagwe said that the government has made progress in handling the virus from escalating since the first case was reported on March 13. In the last 24 hours, the country confirmed 260 new cases of the virus, becoming the highest figure to be reported, bringing the number of cases confirmed in the country to 4,738.
