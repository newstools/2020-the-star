Gospel singer David Wonder has released his most anticipated song Rehema. The singer said he was in a dilemma on whether to name it ‘Rehema’ or ‘Neema’ but settled on the former. Speaking to Word Is on Sunday, Wonder said the song is meant to encourage his listeners. “Rehema means mercy and Neema is grace. At this time, with the coronavirus pandemic, I wanted to encourage people,” he said. “The song is being received well and to be honest, it’s not a surprise because it’s my favourite on my catalogue of unreleased songs. I spoke my heart out and poured everything at that time when I was writing it. It’s just me in my zone.” Wonder said it feels good that the song has been well received. He said his goal is to reach as many people as possible. Part of his music video looks borrowed from Diamond Platnumz’s Baba Lao video, but Wonder said  it is an idea that is used by many artists. “About the video, there is a part where I am kidnapped. I did that video in that way to symbolise the act of kidnapping. I am not the only one who does similar videos,” he said. “That idea has been done by a couple of people.” David Wonder asked his fans to expect better projects. “Expect even bigger projects. People should continue praying for me. I know the rest of the year is going to be good to me whether there is corona or not.” He urged Kenyans to keep safe during this pandemic. “Remember to stay at home if you can, sanitise or wash your hands to make sure you protect yourself from this virus,” Wonder said.
