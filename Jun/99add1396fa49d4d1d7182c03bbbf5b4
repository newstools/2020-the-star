Kamariny Stadium in Iten will be completed in the next four months, according to Hassan Noor, the Cabinet Administrative Secretary in the Ministry of Sports. Speaking over the weekend when he inspected the facility, Noor said the government is committed to providing adequate facilities to sportsmen and women who have tirelessly continued to fly the country’s flag. “We now have a reliable funding source from the national government and we hope to complete the remaining construction works at Kamariny in the shortest time possible. This being the ‘Home of Champions’ we are determined to make sure this facility is up and running,” said Noor. He added that they are doing all they can to secure the legacy of sportsmen and women. “We know the champions who come from here are from humble backgrounds. They have not been mentored by anybody, not in sports academies; never had the best coaches in the world but they have gone ahead to give us accolades that we can never forget,” the official said. Meanwhile, over 200 athletes and officials benefited from free masks distributed by Athletics Kenya (AK) western region in the wake of coronavirus pandemic. The athletes were drawn from the four counties of Bungoma, Kakamega, Busia and Vihiga. The western region chairman, Patrick Kipsang, said the current situation has made lives difficult for athletes and that they need every help they can get.
