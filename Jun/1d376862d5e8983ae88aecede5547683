Sauti Sol's Bien and his wife Chiki Kuruka tied the knot in an invite-only wedding in March. Only close friends and family were present, and no wedding photo has been shared with the public. Bien says he did not post the photos on social media because he didn’t want negative comments. He and Chiki wedded at the AG’s office and later held a private reception at Pallet Cafe in Lavington. The theme was vintage. In an interview with Radio Jambo’s Massawe Japanni, Bien said, "The vibe there was so good and it is still the best day of my life." He added that the event's photos were not meant for social media as people would not understand why his guests chose to wear what they did. "Everyone will start having their opinion on what people wore. Why I was not in a suit. I do not want to give foolish people a chance to criticise anything about my wedding," Bien said. "Nitajiwekea, ndio msiniharibie hiyo siku na comments za kijinga. Sitaki ufala, vitu zangu ni vitu zangu." The artist said he gets angry easily and he did not want to respond to haters. "Mimi ni mtu nacatch feelings haraka sana. I will find myself insulting people." Bien said that part of his life is private. "Let them forget about photos." Edited by Josephine M. Mayuya
