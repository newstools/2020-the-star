Migori Governor Okoth Obado on Friday launched the fourth phase of a dairy farming project. The programme is called ‘One dairy cow per sugarcane and tobacco farmer’. “This project has improved farmers' livelihoods due to improved quality and quantity of milk,” Obado said. The governor gave out 470 dairy calves and 104 Sahiwal bulls. “The project will go a long way in increasing milk production to ensure food security and boost the economy,” Obado said. When the cows produce, farmers are given the calves through organised groups. “So far we have shared 152 dairy calves and 78 Sahiwal bull offsprings to farmers,” Obado said. The governor warned farmers against selling or relocating their cows without authority from county livestock officials. Agriculture executive Valentine Ogongo said food insecurity is a challenge due to the current pandemic. “Tobacco and sugarcane growing have all collapsed and that is why we offer alternative sources of income like dairy farming,” she added. Obado said Migori has the best climate for dairy farming and crop growing. Edited by Frank Obonyo
