For the love of God, reopen the churches, clerics have implored government. Garissa Pastorâ€™s Fellowship blamed moral decay among the youth on lack of spiritual guidance. The clerics urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to reopen churches. They addressed the press in Garissa town on Monday. Places of worship, among others, were closed in March when coronavirus was reported in the country. Since then the number of infections has continued to rise alongside the voices calling for the reopening of churches. In his address to the nation on June 6, the President said an inter-faith council would be constituted in seven days to work out the modalities and protocols for reopening places of worship. It was to be set up by the Health and Interior ministries. Uhuru did not give a date for reopening places of worship. The 10 Garissa clerics, led by chairman David Matolo, said the Church is ready to comply with all the measures put in place by the Health ministry to curb the spread of Covid-19. "We are urging the president to prioritise reopening of places of worship during his address to the nation this week," Rev Matolo said. He said most churches have secured the necessary facilities as suggested by the government. Matolo said Kenya will only develop economically if the church, which is the source of spiritual nourishment, is part of decision-making. Bishop Fred Mumo said ever since churches were closed, clerics have been unable to meet their family obligations as well as help vulnerable groups. Pastor Shalom Kennedy questioned the rationale behind the reopening of restaurants while churches remain closed. Edited by Frank Obonyo
