Equity Group foundation in partnership with MasterCard foundation are supporting over 14,600 students with solar powered devices to enable them access online teaching during the COVID-19 lockdown. The more than 14,600 students are part of the Wings to Fly and Elimu scholarship programs which started in 2010. “Advancing equitable and inclusive access to education remains a top priority for the foundation and this is the opportunity to seek out and promote innovative technology-driven solutions,” Regional head, eastern and southern Africa at MasterCard Foundation, Daniel Hailu said. The students have been provided with a solar powered device to ensure continued access to their lessons currently being aired on government-owned radio and TV stations. The device contains a radio, and a mobile charging unit for cell phones as well as a lamp that can allow studying after dusk. “With the majority of the scholars not having access to electricity, we opted for solar powered gadgets. We believe that the Scholars are now well-equipped to keep up to date with their lessons,” Equity chief executive James Mwangi said. Additionally, each of the 13,800 secondary school students and 800 alumni of the Wings to Fly scholarship program currently in Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) will receive a Sh3,000 monthly stipend for June through August for food and other essentials. Working with an average of five to six to  students per household, it is estimated the program will reach 70,000 learners. The equipment was distributed through Equity's branches and agencies countrywide.
