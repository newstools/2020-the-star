President Uhuru Kenyatta should lock down Busia county to contain the spread of the coronavirus in the Western region, Vihiga Governor Wilber Ottichilo has said. Ottichilo said most of the cases that are reported in Busia are truck drivers who cross through Kakamega, Bungoma Trans-Nzioa and Vihiga while heading into or out of Uganda. “By locking down Busia we shall be protecting areas where this virus has not spread,” Ottichillo said. The county chief said if Busia continues to run its activities normally, the virus will spread faster and wider in the area. Busia county has 217 Covid-19 patients out of the country's 2862 reported by Monday. The governor also said that a case identified to be resident in the county was from Kisumu. “The patient has got roots in Vihiga yes but is based in Kisumu county. All those who were in contact with the patient have accepted to self-isolate within their home in Emuhaya,” Ottichillo said. Ottichilo made the clarification at Izava Lyaduywa ward in Sabatia subcounty following social media reports that Vihiga had recorded a case. (edited by o. owino)
