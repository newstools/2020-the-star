Residents of Igembe South in Meru county are up in arms over rising insecurity and impassable roads in the area. Villagers from Antuamuo, Kinoe, Aithu, Kiumwene and other surrounding areas said they also want to be connected to electricity. They dismissed as fake, promises by area MP John Paul Mwirigi to connect them to power, upgrade roads and improve security. Vitalis Muthomi told the Star they were surprised by national government claims that 98 per cent of Kenyans have been connected to power through the rural electrification programme. “The MP’s office is spreading propaganda that people here are connected to power whereas there are no poles or wires. The Kiegoi-Athi road is impassable and Antuamuo Bridge is also a risk to the people,” Muthomi said. Peter Kaberia said the risk of the coronavirus won’t prevent them from exercising their right to demonstrate. Eric Mwirigi from Amwamba said they have been in dark villages, a situation he blamed on increasing insecurity. He said children were at risk of being raped. “There is escalating theft and attacks and our lives are at stake. Our school-going children cannot follow online lessons and suffer smoke emissions from lamps and lanterns which are a health risk," he said. Boniface Gikundi said the sick can’t get emergency services. He demanded development just like other Kenyans, saying "we also pay tax." “A woman drowned at the bridge recently. Those who have done technical jobs can’t do welding and electrical works due to a lack of electricity. We also need to have a day secondary school at Kambene Primary because our children trek for more than 7km to the nearest secondary school Attempts to get a comment from MP Mwirigi were futile because his phone was off.
