Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang'ula has withdrawn a case he filed against Ford Kenya secretary general Eseli Simiyu. He appeared before the Political Parties Dispute Tribunal on Friday. Wetang'ula had been represented by lawyer Nelson Havi in the case. The senator moved to the tribunal on June 10 after the National Executive Council removed him as party leader on May 31 and replaced him with Kanduyi MP Wafula Wamunyinyi. Wetang'ula then had a parallel meeting in which he removed Simiyu as the secretary general and replace him with Kiminini MP Chris Wamalwa. Simiyu had said Wetang'ula was being ejected for gross misconduct, having allegedly failed to unite the party and for moral impropriety. Wetang'ula's faction on Wednesday told the tribunal that Simiyu further announced Wafula Wamunyinyi had taken over as the new party leader position in an acting capacity. “Simiyu intends to register a purported list of purported ‘new officials’ for the party with the Registrar of political parties,” the Tribunal heard. Wetang'ula sought an injunction against the Registrar, stopping her from receiving, acting upon or entertaining any documents purporting to be from the party and emanating from Simiyu and Wamunyinyi pending hearing and determination of all charges facing them  by the party's internal disciplinary machinery. Also sought was an order stopping the Registrar from effecting changes in the office of Ford-K recognizing Wamunyinyi as the Interim party leader and Simiyu as the SG. The Registrar of Political Parties Anne Nderitu this week gave notice of the intended changes by Ford Kenya party to its party officials. In the Gazette notice dated June 8, Wetang'ula was replaced by Wamunyinyi in the new line-up. The new changes also list Josephine Maungu as the new National Organising Secretary replacing Chris Mandu.
