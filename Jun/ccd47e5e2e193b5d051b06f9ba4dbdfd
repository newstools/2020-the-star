Just imagine for a moment if we understood lion talk! ... Cleo the little lion cub lay on her back with her mother in the long, soft green grass, under the tall leafy trees, almost next to the main gate. As Cleo lay there for some time, a low, grumbling noise could be heard occasionally. “Mama! What is that noise we keep hearing?” Mama replied in a knowing tone. “Well, my cub, we know them as 'grumble-shines'. They have strange, rolling legs and always seem to be in a mood as they growl wherever they go. They do not smell good and are filled with humans.” Cleo thought for a while and then said, “But Mama, why do so many 'grumble-shines' go past us all the time?” “Well, my cub, there are many theories. But the baboons seem to know the main reason after listening carefully to the humans talking. I listen to the baboon jabber-jabber-jabber every day, and my understanding is that the many humans go through the gate in their 'grumble-shines' to 'look for lions! "They are known to rumble around for hours in the heat and dust, just to try and find one of us, then when they see us, the humans behave very strangely. They point funny things at us that click and sometimes flash brightly, and some of them even climb on top of their 'grumble-shines'.” "Wow, Mama! That is really crazy!” said Little Cleo. “We relax here all day in the cool shade, while they must get so hot in their 'rumble-shines'.” Seeing lion cubs is always a cute moment. However, very few of them survive the struggle to grow up as adults. Life in the wild depends on the survival of the fittest.
