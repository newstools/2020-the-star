ODM leader Raila Odinga has denied meeting Kirinyaga governor Anne Waiguru over the night. This was after a local daily reported that Raila met Waiguru in a bid to save her from Impeachment. But in a statement on Sunday, Raila said there was no such meeting with Waiguru or the other governors as reported in the Sunday Nation. "The matters around governor Waiguru and which the Sunday Nation purports to be analyzing and reporting on are critical with regard to strengthening Devolution," he said. " They require objective and deep reporting, based on verifiable facts, which is hard work, and not a collection of rumors and trivia from anonymous sources, which is the epitome of lazy journalism." Raila said there can be no reason whatsoever why politicians attending a meeting would be unwilling to talk about. "I routinely update the country on any such meetings and this would not be different if it had happened," he said. In the report, the local daily said that Waiguru sought the support of Raila to fend off the impeachment threat in the Senate. It says that the two met on Thursday evening in efforts to help save her job, which is hanging by a thread after she was impeached by the county assembly last week and failed in her bid to block the move in court. According to the report, Raila met Waiguru at an exclusive club in Karen, Nairobi, alongside a few aides, with the key agenda being whipping ODM and other “friendly” senators to defeat the motion, according to a source who spoke in confidence.
