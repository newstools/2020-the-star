@robertomollo3 A couple has been arrested for allegedly stealing a baby boy from Ndhiwa Subcounty Hospital in Homa Bay on Tuesday last week. Janet Achieng, 25, and her 32-year-old husband were arrested after they were found with the child in their house in Rongo town. The two-months-old baby is said to have been stolen from his mother Beatrice Achieng’ when she took him for a post-natal clinic. Beatrice, 20, said Janet approached and asked to assist her to carry the baby while they were on a waiting bench at the hospital. “She then disappeared with my child after I left for a short call in a latrine within the hospital compound,” Beatrice said. Beatrice said she tried to trace the suspect but did not find her. It is said Janet left the hospital on a boda boda. Beatrice reported the matter at Ndhiwa police station after informing her husband. “The suspect pretended she was going to greet her boyfriend with my child before she disappeared on a boda boda,” she said. On Sunday, Beatrice received a call from Central Kamagambo senior chief Silas Adika that they had arrested a couple in Rongo whom they suspected had stolen the child. She was asked to go and confirm if it was her baby. Adika said the couple has never had a child since they got married and people became suspicious after they were seen with a baby because the wife had never been pregnant. “Throughout our interrogation, Janet told us that she was expectant and delivered the baby at Ndhiwa hospital last Tuesday. However, when we checked, the baby was found to be two-months-old and not a week as she had claimed,” Adika said. The administrator said the couple was handed over to Ndhiwa police for more investigations. Ndhiwa subcounty police commander Robert Aboki said they have reunited the child with his mother. “We’re finalising our investigations before we arraign the couple,” Aboki said.  Edited by P.O
