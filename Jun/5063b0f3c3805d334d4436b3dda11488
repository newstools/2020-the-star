Law student Halima Hussein, 21, has launched a natural cosmetic lip gloss. Her red-tinted and natural lip gloss, Sanguine Kisses, is all the rage. It has been launched under her company HH Glam. Speaking about the cosmetic, the university student studying law said her brand offers a unique function for each product and it is 100 per cent made in Kenya. She said even with the pandemic, young people need to be creative. She looks forward to working with various social media influencers and media personalities, such as Wabosha Maxine, Sheila Mwanyigha, Yvonne Okwara and Amina Abdi. "I have always liked what they do," she said. "We are so happy to be launching the Sanguine Kisses to the market and I hope that it will be well received. This is a dream come true for me.” She said her love for natural and organic products prompted her to venture into the exciting world of cosmetics, focusing on healthy and natural products. Her product is for women from all walks of life. "Let us continue looking good even with our masks on," she said. Halima’s goal is to have HH Glam products on all major shops locally and internationally. Halima’s inspiration is Kylie Jenner, 21, who started her own cosmetics line years ago. She hopes to have various all-natural cosmetic products, from eye shadow to foundation, that will cater to different markets. HH Glam is currently supporting “For the Love of Girls” by providing them with reusable pads. This week, through her brand, Halima will be launching her three-ply reusable Covid-19 masks, which are Kebs-certified.
