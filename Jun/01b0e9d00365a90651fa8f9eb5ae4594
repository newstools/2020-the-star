He also extended the nationwide curfew for another 30 days. However, Uhuru relaxed the curfew hours, which will now be from 9pm to 4am starting on Sunday, June 7. The curfew had been from 7pm to 5am. "In accordance with the advice of the National Security Council, the cessation of movement into and out of the Nairobi Metropolitan Area, Mombasa and Mandera has also been extended to also another 30 days," the President said. The President lifted cessation of movement into and out of Eastleigh, Nairobi, and Old Town, Mombasa, from 4am on Sunday, June 7. "We must speak truthfully to each other. The rate of infection in Kenya would have been very high had we not taken the measures we took,” President Kenyatta said. He said if the country had not taken the measures it did, then the rate of infections would have peaked and by the end of August approximately 75,000 Kenyans would have lost their lives and 800,000 people would have been infected.
