The Kwale government has warned Taita Taveta against claiming ownership of Mackinnon Road town. This week Taita Taveta Finance and Economic Planning executive Andrew Kubo said they plan to collect revenue from two disputed border towns—Mackinnon and Mtito Andei. Mtito Andei is administratively under Makueni county, while Mackinnon Road is under Kwale. Taita Taveta lays claim to both towns. Addressing the media on Thursday in Matuga, Governor Salim Mvurya opposed the move to collect taxes. He said Taita Taveta Governor Granton Samboja’s actions might ignite animosity between the border communities. “The idea that Taita Taveta will send officers in our land is a great provocation and I strongly condemn it. My brother should be wise enough not to cause disunity among the people neighbouring Kwale,” Mvurya said. The Kwale governor said he was shocked that his Taita Taveta counterpart would revive an old fight that had been resolved. The last time the issue came up, in 2018, numerous meetings were held to find an amicable solution. Mvurya said the two counties agreed to maintain peace. He urged leaders to use proper channels to resolve land disputes to avoid creating unnecessary tension. “We agreed to rely on different task forces that have the capacity to address boundary wrangles peacefully,” Mvurya said. He said colonial maps should be revisited for clarification. Mvurya asked residents in the two counties to hold their peace as the issue is resolved. “I ask both Kwale and Taita citizens not to be carried away by anger or be incited to do anything. Continue to be each other’s protector and definitely we will solve this issue,” he said. Edited by Josephine M. Mayuya
