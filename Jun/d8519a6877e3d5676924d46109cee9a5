 A group of activists in Garissa has written to the Senate Public Accounts Committee to investigate "wanton corruption in the county." Led by their chairman Hassan Aden Gumo, the group wants the Senate committee to make public findings of its last probe on the county's financial management. Governor Ali Korane had been summoned by the panel to respond to financial queries relating to public procurement regulations. The activist said mismanagement of public funds has continued unabated, hindering development. "We request your honourable committee to make public findings of your last summon of Garissa governor,” reads the letter that was seen by the Star. Attempts to get a comment from the county were unsuccessful as both the governor and the county secretary could not be reached. In the letter dated June 18, the group wants the committee to also share the findings with relevant government agencies for further action. The Garissa Community Development Watchdog has also written to the Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji requesting for information on a report in which he had directed police to investigate financial misappropriation in the county. On July 21 last year, the DPP directed the Inspector General to conduct comprehensive investigations into alleged misuse of public funds and report to his office within 30 days. “The members of the public of this county are concerned about lengthy, unexplained delay in publishing the finding of the reports based on the investigations,” reads the letter which was copied to IG Hillary Mutyambai, the DCI and the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission. The activist said members of the public have the right to know the outcome of the investigations. The county has previously fought off claims of misappropriation of public funds,.  Edited by P.O
