A man who was on Tuesday night mauled by an unknown animal in Bomet town has died, complicating investigations by the police into what could have been attacked him. The 78-year-old, according to Bomet Central subcounty police commander Musa Imamai, succumbed to the injuries on Saturday morning at Tenwek Mission Hospital. Imamai said his officers will rely on the postmortem report to establish what may have killed him. Imamai said investigating officers were hoping to question the man to give an account of what happened but that is now impossible. “We shall now have to wait for the postmortem report from the doctors to help us in the probe,” Imamai said. The death now brings to two the number of people who have been killed by the "unknown animal" in the area. Two other people were mauled last September in a similar scenario at the same spot, next to Kings Outreach Church near Bomet town. One of them recovered. Bomet Governor Hillary Barchok pledged to support the family in footing the hospital bill and ensuring investigations were expedited. He said his administration will eliminate all stray dogs as part of the ongoing exploration by security officers into the matter. “My administration will do its best to find out what could have mauled the deceased,” Barchok said in a message.
