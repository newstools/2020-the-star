Kenya Cup outfit Nondies have relocated from the Jamhuri showground to the Jockey Club of Kenya at the Racecourse. “On behalf of the club, we are delighted to announce that we have signed a 10-year renewable deal  with the Jockey Club of Kenya and we will be moving to the racecourse,” a statement from the club read in part. Nondies’ general manager, Kevin Were, termed the move as strategic for the club. “We have outgrown our current ground. But while it has served us well, the new site will provide a better quality pitch in better location and more importantly, with increased opportunities to generate funds to support the club,” he noted. Were observed that the Agricultural Society of Kenya are developing show-ground to be a business hub  and the club has had to look for an alternative ground. Were termed the pitch and clubhouse as a world class facility. “The pitch which will be located inside the race-track is currently being levelled and being made match ready. There is adequate space for a full-size pitch and a good sized training ground for the players,” he added. Were noted: “The new club house is located within the main racecourse buildings and overlooks the show ring. We are grateful for your continued support but we will need even more support in the coming months.” This is the fourth time that Kenya’s oldest club is moving. Nondies played for over 13 years at the Parklands Sports Club before moving to St Mary’s School for another five years. In 2003, the club moved to Jamhuri Park Showground, where they shared with Homeboyz. The club last month bolstered it’s technical bench by bringing in former international and current Kenya under 20 coach Micheal Aung as a consultant forwards’ coach. Kenny Andola was appointed as backline coach and Hillary Itela (scrummaging coach). Head coach Willis Ojal has expressed confidence that his team will qualify for the playoffs next season. The club finished eight in the current campaign.
