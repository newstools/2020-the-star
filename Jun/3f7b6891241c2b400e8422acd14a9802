President Uhuru Kenyatta has said that he prefers Tusker to White Cap. Uhuru was responding to questions from Katrina Manson during a virtual meeting with the Atlantic Council on Thursday. Manson said that members of the public wanted to know what the Head of State prefers between the two beers. "Without a doubt Tusker goes first but don't tell Kenya Breweries that," Uhuru said between a laugh. In 2017, Uhuru had to part with some thousands of shillings in order to quench his thirst for Senator Keg. This was during the launch of the Sh15 billion EABL bottling line in Kisumu. He was accompanied by Deputy President William Ruto, CSs Charles Keter (Energy) and Adan Mohammed (then Industrialisation Cabinet secretary). Uhuru was offered a sip of the brew after he inspected the facility with Kenya Breweries Limited MD Jane Karuku and area MP Ken Obura. It is said she asked Uhuru to just take a sip but to the surprise of everyone, the president asked her to fill the mug. He took the mug with his left hand and swallowed several gulps of the brew amid laughter from those who had accompanied him. He paid a few thousands of shillings to show his gratitude. He noted Senator Keg is a safe, affordable beer that has helped the government fight the menace of illicit brews.
