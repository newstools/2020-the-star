Enterprise Cup champions Kabras will bolster their squad by signing four players for the 2020-2021 season. Speaking yesterday, club chairman Phillip Jalango said three of the players will be in the forwards and one in the backs as they look to consolidate the gains made this season. “Our planning for next season has started in earnest and we can’t rest on our laurels. We are looking at getting better and better with each and every season,” added Jalango. He said their aim is to develop younger players for the team. “We are looking at getting younger players to fit into the club and learn the culture of the team as we seek to dominate the scene for the next five to 10 years,” he added. He noted the additions of winger Alfred Orege from Mean Machine and inside centre Walter Okoth from Nakuru last season were useful in the campaign. “They are young vibrant players who brought competition in their respective positions and it gives the technical bench options to look at various matches,” noted Jalango. The transfer window is yet to be opened as the union and the clubs discuss ways of finishing the 2019/2020 season which was suspended due to coronavirus pandemic. The Kakamega-based outfit topped the standings with 74 points following the end of the group phase.  They suffered single defeat to Homeboyz in December and were on course for a league and cup double before the season was suspended. Jalango expressed confidence that the league season will be completed despite the challenges caused by the pandemic. “I’m confident we will be able to complete the league and have a winner for this season,” he added. Kabras bagged their maiden Kenya Cup crown in 2016, beating Impala in the final 22-5 but have lost four Kenya Cup finals in 2015, 2017, 2018 and 2019 to KCB.
