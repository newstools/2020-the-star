President Uhuru Kenyatta allies have moved to appease Deputy President William Ruto's backyard using projects. Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Peter Munya on Friday toured Baringo county to launch projects and sell President Kenyatta’s BBI agenda. “Receive greetings from President Uhuru and Senator Gideon Moi. They said they are coming soon to visit you. They love and care about you,” Munya said. He was accompanied by Agriculture CAS Linah Jebii Kilimo, Baringo Governor Stanley Kiptis, Tiaty MP William Kamket, Mogotio MP Dr Daniel Tuitoek and county commissioner Henry Wafula. Jubilee MPs allied to Ruto among them William Cheptumo (Baringo North), Charles Kamuren (Baringo South) and Moses Lessonet (Eldama-Ravine)  were absent. Munya landed in a chopper at Emining to commission the multi-million vaccination World Bank-funded programme targeting about 10,000 livestock  against pneumonia, foot and mouth and rabies diseases. He later opened animal pasture hay sheds in Chemoling’ot and Kamar in Tiaty and Baringo South subcounties respectively. “The national government is committed to supporting the agendas of the county governments to enhance projects aimed at bettering the lives of the people,” Munya said. He said the Building Bridges Initiative proposal on constitutional amendment ahead of 2022 elections is good as "it is genuinely aimed at bringing the interests of Kenyans together". He said the BBI agenda is aimed at unifying and bringing Kenyans from all corners of the country together. “There is no point of saying the people of Mogotio cannot work with the people of Tiaty. The people of Meru can as well work with the people of Baringo and what is wrong with that? That’s all about BBI” he said. Baringo is the home turf of Senator Moi, who is also the Kanu chairman. Kanu has entered a post-election coalition with Jubilee.
