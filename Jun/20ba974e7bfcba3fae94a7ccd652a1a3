Four legislators from Kirinyaga have appealed to the Senate to be open-minded when debating the impeachment of Governor Anne Waiguru. Senator Charles Kibiru and MPs Robert Githinji (Gichugu), Kabinga Wathayu (Mwea) John Wambugu (Kirinyaga Central) promised to accept the verdict if the process is fair. In a statement, the four legislators maintained that they do not hold any personal vendetta or ill will against the governor. “It is our earnest request to the Senate to adjudicate the matter informed by the issues that guided the overwhelming desire of the MCAs, who are the bona fide representatives of the people of Kirinyaga, to impeach the governor,” they said. Speaker Kenneth Lusaka will call a special meeting of the Senate Business Committee to decide the fate of Waiguru who was impeached on Tuesday. Lusaka has already received communication from Kirinyaga assembly speaker Anthony Gathumbi informing him of the resolution of the motion on the impeachment of the governor. Lusaka indicated that he will communicate the MCAs’ resolution to the House on Tuesday next week. Both majority and minority parties in the Senate can form an 11-member committee to hear the allegations and file a report to the House within 10 days. Should the plenary reject the composition of the committee, the governor shall appear before all the senators with the speaker as the judge and argue out her case before a vote is taken. The four legislators said the Speaker and the House Business Committee should settle on most democratic and representative method of adjudicating the proposed impeachment. “In our opinion, the most ideal method is the plenary and not the select committee route, that will involve the entire slew of senators,” they added.
