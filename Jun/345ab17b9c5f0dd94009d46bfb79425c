Brazil has withdrawn its bid to host the 2023 Women’s World Cup due to not being able to fulfil the financial guarantees needed by world football body FIFA because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the country’s football confederation (CBF) has said. The CBF said in a statement that the Federal Government had concluded that “it would not be advisable” to sign the guarantees requested by FIFA to ensure they were in a stable position to host the 32-team tournament. The withdrawal leaves Australia and New Zealand, Colombia, and Japan as the remaining bidding countries. Meanwhile, the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) has set up a $20.74 million relief fund to help top-flight clubs mitigate the financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Clubs in Brazil’s second tier have been allocated R$15 million, the governing body added in a statement. Football has been suspended since March due to the pandemic and clubs have struggled to cope with the loss of matchday revenue and ticket sales. The CBF had previously allocated R$19 million to clubs in Brazil’s third and fourth tiers, as well as the top two divisions of the women’s league. Brazil has South America’s highest death toll from the novel coronavirus, with over 37,000 fatalities.
