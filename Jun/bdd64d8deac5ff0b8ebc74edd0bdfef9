Kenya Mountain Running Association (KMRA) has no mandate to handle mountain running matters in Kenya, the Sports Disputes Tribunal has ruled. SDT chairman John Ohaga ruled that it’s only Athletics Kenya who have the mandate to handle mountain running activities in the country by virtue of being the registered sports organisation in charge of athletics. “A declaration is hereby issued that by virtue of not being a national organisation in charge of athletics and not being affiliated to either IAAF (now World Athletics) and World Mountain Running Association, the KMRA has no mandate to run or organise mountain running events in the country,” ruled Ohaga. The tribunal further ruled that the Registrar of Sports can't register any other organisation to handle sports matters since AK is registered as such. “The Sports Registrar can't register any other sports organisation to concurrently run the discipline of athletics in Kenya,” stated Ohaga. AK moved to the tribunal through advocate Elias Masika to challenge  David Wainaina, Jacob Yator, Julius Ndegwa and Anthony Kiprono, who are the officials of KMRA. KMRA, a registered as a Community Based Organization (CBO) in Ngong, Kajiado North constituency, was restrained from interfering with the mandate of AK in organising teams and athletes to take part in athletics events which include mountain running. On April 27, 2018, KMRA moved to court and obtained an injunction stopping the inaugural national mountain running racing trials earlier scheduled for April 28 in Longonot, Nakuru County. The race was being used to select athletes for World Mountain Running championships scheduled for September 16 in Canillo, Andorra. According to Athletics Kenya, the actions of KMRA occasioned them substantial financial loss and irreparable harm.
