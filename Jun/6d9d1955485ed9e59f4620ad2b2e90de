Kiambu residents are planning protests to compel the government to remove roadblocks at Chunga Mali and Uplands on the Nairobi-Nakuru highway. They say Limuru and Lari constituencies are locked and residents are unable to travel to Nairobi or beyond Uplands. Limuru and Lari constituencies are under the Nairobi metropolis region. On Monday, angry residents blocked Interior CS Fred Matiang'i from passing while he was on his way to Nyahururu. Matiang'i urged the protesters to be patient with the government. "You have to be patient as we are aware of the negative impact police roadblocks have on our economy," the CS said. However, matatu operators on Tuesday said they will be holding protests every Monday until the roadblocks are removed. Driver Michael Njogu said they are unable to pay rent or feed their families. "We want the government to listen to us and remove one roadblock either at Uplands or at Chunga Mali. We do not understand why there are roadblocks at Chunga Mali and Rironi since they are less than two kilometres apart." Limuru MP Peter Mwathi urged the government to look into the matter and address it quickly. "Our businesses have also been affected since traders cannot go to town to buy stock. Only vehicles ferrying food are allowed to pass through these roadblocks," he said. The lawmaker appealed to Matiang'i to come up with a strategy of vetting motorists and people who are passing through the area.  Edited by A.N
