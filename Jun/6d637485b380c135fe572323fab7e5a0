Youth and people living with disabilities must get a share of tenders advised by the devolved government, Kisii County Contractors Association has said. KCCA chairman Wilfred Bosire said that vulnerable groups have a right to be awarded tenders so that they can earn a living. “Our association is determined to fight for the youth and people living with disability to get a share of tenders advertised,” Bosire said. He advised the youth and persons with disability to establish firms and pitch for the tenders from both the national and county governments. “We are ready to assist them to prepare the bids,” he added. Bosire said that the special groups can easily access loans from banks to enable them to do their work with a lot of ease. The lobby chairman said that they will not allow members who do shoddy jobs because taxpayers have to get the value of their money. “Those who will be found doing substandard work will cease to be members of our lobby,” Bosire said. He said that they will not also allow dishonest members to make them miss out on future tenders. “We do not want a situation where we cannot be trusted because of dishonest members. We need to get tenders based on our performance,” the chairman said. He reiterated that they will not pressure Governor James Ongwae to pay pending bills considering the health crisis the country is facing. Bosire praised Ongwae for clearing some pending bills and urged him to pay up the remaining ones after the coronavirus pandemic is contained. (edited by o. owino)
