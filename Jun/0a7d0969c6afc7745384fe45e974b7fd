The Ladima Foundation, in partnership with the DW Akademie, is excited to announce a short-film competition aimed at African women during the world-altering corona pandemic and related lockdown. The competition is open to African women content creators and filmmakers of any age or experience level living in Africa. It aims to document the circumstances women in Africa currently find themselves, including domestic violence, altered access to opportunities and increased burden of care. This film competition invites women to share these experiences, be they challenging, positive or simply questioning. The stories should be honest, personal and specifically related to the current corona situation. Entries across genres are welcome, from animation and fiction to documentary or interview style, just as long as the content is two minutes or shorter.
