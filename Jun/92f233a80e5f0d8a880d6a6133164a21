The late Kikuyu Benga musician Jimmy Walter Githinji, popularly known by his stage name Jimmy Wayuni, will be buried today at Kiamwangi. Speaking to Word Is, Jacksam, the fellow musician he was with when the accident happened, said the burial preparations are going on well. "We have done our best to stand with the family despite the corona pandemic, and we will lay him to rest today," he said. Jacksam said Wayuni was exiting the superhighway at Kahawa Sukari past Kenyatta University to join the service lane that leads to Githurai 45 when the car hit a lorry transporting tomatoes. The two musicians lost consciousness and were rescued by police on patrol and taken to St Johnâ€™s Hospital in Githurai 45, where Wayuni died while undergoing treatment. "I'm still not able to recall the whole incident as it happened so fast and he was pronounced dead," he said. Wayuni is survived by his wife Rosemary Wambui and two children.
