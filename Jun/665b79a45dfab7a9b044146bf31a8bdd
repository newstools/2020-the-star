Kenya Simbas head coach Paul Odera says the technical bench will focus on mental and physical fitness following the cancellation of the 2020 Africa Cup. The former international said as the technical bench, they will concentrate on areas they can handle while off the field, then gauge players once they are allowed to get back on the pitch. “We are now concentrating on matters that we, as the technical bench, can manage including mental and physical fitness of our Kenya 15’s players during this period. This will help players to remain strong  in both areas when we resume contact training before gauging their progress,” he added. Odera’s charges were earlier scheduled to play Morocco on May 30 in Mombasa and Ivory Coast (June 27) in Abidjan. The Simbas were also to play Uganda in Kakamega (July 11) and Zimbabwe (July 18) in Nakuru. Simbas finished second last year in the Victoria Cup,  losing out to eventual winners Zimbabwe.  The coach also confirmed that Ian Njenga, John Okoth, Samuel Were and Dominic Coulson will not be eligible to feature for the Under-20 team come 2021 season. “The quartet will be past the age bracket and so will not be involved with Chipu. I hope to see them being involved with the Simbas as a sign of progression in their careers,” added Odera. The Simbas will be hoping that regional tournaments such as Elgon Cup and Victoria Cup will be played later in the year. Odera decried that for the second year running, they will not face Powerhouses Namibia. “Namibia are the benchmark we would have loved to test ourselves outside world champions South Africa. They are the team that has been going to the World Cup for the last 20 years and it would have been good opposition for us,” added Odera.
