Mathare residents took to the street on Monday to protest against police brutality and extrajudicial killings. Carrying placards condemning the death of Kenyans at the hands of police, they marched the streets. The placards had messages including'I can't breathe' - the words uttered repeatedly by African American George Floyd as a white policeman put his knee on his neck for close to nine minutes. Floyd died in police custody. Among the protesters was Hadhija Hussein, the mother of 13-year-old Yasin Moyo, who was shot by police at his home balcony in Kiamaiko during curfew enforcement. The DPP last week called for the prosecution of the cop involved in the killing. Under the banner' Mothers of Victims and Survivors Network', those affected directly and indirectly marched through Mathare slums.
