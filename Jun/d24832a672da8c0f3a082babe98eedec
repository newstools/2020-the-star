Former Kenya Sevens coach Benjamin Ayimba has been appointed technical director of the Rugby League Federation. Ayimba, a former Shujaa captain, will be responsible for developing Kenya Rugby League technical status at all levels thus grassroots, community and club rugby. His job description will include formulation of high performance plan for players, coaches, referees and officials. Ayimba oversaw the first rugby league tournament in the country that was won by Wolves in February at the Railway Club. RLF chairman, Nyakwaka Quicks, said Ayimba's acceptance as the technical director, will be a big motivator and a big asset for rugby league, owing to his achievement in the sport. “He has a distinguished record in the sport and will bring experience and leadership to the sport which is growing tremendously in the country,” added Nyakwaka. Kenya are due to play South Africa later in the year in a Test match with recently appointed rugby legend Edward Rombo as national team coach. Ayimba guided Shujaa to the Singapore Sevens tournament win in March 2016 and captained Impala to three Kenya and Enterprise Cup titles between 2000-2002 and a host of Sevens titles in his distinguished rugby career. His last posting was an assistant coach at Harlequins.
