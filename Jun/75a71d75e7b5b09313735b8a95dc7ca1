Siaya has increased isolation ward beds to 50 after President Uhuru Kenyatta announced on Saturday the county only had 10. The county has converted a 50-bed ward at Urenga health centre in Ugenya subcounty into a Covid-19 isolation ward. Deputy Governor James Okumbe made the announcement on Sunday evening. The 10-bed isolation centre is at Bondo Subcounty Hospital. His communication came a few hours after Uhuru, in his address to the nation on Saturday, said Siaya had a 10-bed isolation centre with nine confirmed cases. Okumbe said they had begun converting Urenga to an isolation centre long before the President's announcement. He was flanked by Health executive Dorothy Owino and Health director Ken Orwenjo. Okumbe said there are only four Covid-19 patients in the isolation ward. Four others have fully recovered while one died before admission at Bondo. Owino urged residents not to panic but to follow health guidelines to control the spread of the virus. "Let us continue washing hands, wearing face masks and observing social distance," she said. The team was in Bondo to oversee fumigation, which was rolled out in the entire county by Governor Cornel Rasanga. President Kenyatta will meet all the 47 governors on Wednesday to discuss modalities of ensuring that each county has at least a 300-bed capacity Isolation centre as the country prepares to ease restrictions on movement.
