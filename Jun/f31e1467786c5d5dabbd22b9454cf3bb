A man has been arrested after a dismembered body of woman was found at Tumaini Pry School playground in Umoja II. The body parts were found in a sack after the odour from its decomposing parts became unbearable on May 31st 2020. David Migwi Kariuki 42, was arrested at a house nearby Amani Estate where he moved after the heinous act, DCI director George Kinoti said. "This is where the occupant had since moved from, having kept the body therein for several days," Kinoti said. Kinoti said that on April 27, 2019, the same suspect was captured on CCTV walking out of Green Club along Latema Road in Nairobi CBD with a lady. "A few hours before the dismembered body parts of a woman were found dumped in different locations," he said. "The head, arms and legs had been dumped at Umoja dumpsite and the torso later found along Landhies Road." DNA analysis on the body parts matched that of 36-year-old Penina Wairimu Njeri, the woman he had walked with from the club. The suspect disappeared and has been on the run until today when DCI officers pounced on him. Kinoti said he has been placed in custody pending arraignment, as forensic examination of the recovered body parts (aimed at revealing the woman's identity) continue.
