Baringo Central MP Joshua Kandie ignored the Covid-19 prevention rules to launch multi-millions-shilling projects in his constituency on Friday. Kandie presented bursary cheques for Sh36.8 million from the National Government Constituency Development Fund (NG-CDF) to secondary schools. “Provided my people observe the rules set to curb the Covid-19 disease then I don’t see any reason for failing to deliver my duties on time” he said. Besides, the MP distributed some 10,000 mango and macadamia seedlings to  local farmers. “I am grateful to our MP for donating the seedlings. I urge my fellow farmers to use this Covid-19 season to cultivate their farms and grow crops to enhance food production,” famer Joseph Noti said. While handing over the goodies at his constituency office in Kabarnet town, Kandie urged residents to embark on their normal economic activities as long as they keep social distance, wash and sanitise their hands to stop the spread of coronavirus. “Nobody whatsoever, even the government, shall always manage to provide your basic needs or feed your families if you don’t get up to work for yourself. Everybody in his or her senses should have that in mind,” Kandie said. He pledged to set aside Sh1 million towards buying equipment for the beauty salons and barber shops operators in Kabarnet town. Most elected leaders have kept off development projects due to the coronavirus pandemic. Kandie appealed to the county government to complete the construction of stalls in Kabarnet markets and other towns to create more space for food and clothes vendors. “Our traders must get sufficient space to maintain social distance while selling their goods” he said. Last week he distributed 30 bags of maize to Kabarnet traders and appealed to the government to allocate more funds to feed jobless and hungry citizens. Edited by Henry Makori
