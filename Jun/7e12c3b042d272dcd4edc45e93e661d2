ODM party leader Raila Odinga who doubles as African Union envoy has called upon the world to consider Kenya for the United Nations Security Council post. Through his Twitter post on Wednesday, Raila said that Kenya has played a critical role in humanitarian which should be considered during the voting. He said the country has been hosting refugees in its land for years as well as sending its peacekeepers to restore peace in the troubled lands. Raila also said that Kenyan athletes are a shared pride across the world, hence the world should stand with Kenya at this time. The outcome of the vote will be known today as 193 UN members will cast their votes. Kenya is competing with Djibouti for the post to represent Africa for a one-year term which is currently being held by South Africa. Kenya launched its campaign for the seat in November 2019, lobbying several countries in the continent and the world to back her for the seat. African Union endorsed Kenya for the seat in August 2019. The five new members elected this year will take up their seats on January 1, 2021, and serve until December 31, 2022. Kenya has served at the council twice — 1973-1974 and 1997-1998. Djibouti has had a stint from 1993 to 1994. Kenya has positioned its bid on the themes of building bridges, regional peace and security; peacekeeping and support operations as well as counter-terrorism and prevention of violent extremism. The country is also positioning humanitarian action — women, peace, and security; youth empowerment; environment and climate change; as well as its commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals agenda.
