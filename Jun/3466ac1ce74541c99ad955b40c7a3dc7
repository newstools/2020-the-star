Migori county assembly has faulted Governor Okoth Obado for failure to implement community projects on time. This was in a report tabled by deputy speaker Mathews Chacha and compiled by four committees: Liaison, Ward Development Fund, Finance and Implementations. In a press statement on June 10, the assembly said the committee was tasked to find out if community projects were implemented in a timely manner as scheduled in 2019-2020. North Sakwa MCA Timon Mbogo said the committee observed that no community project was implemented despite the fact that the year was already in its third quarter. Mbogo said they interviewed senior officers from six departments to arrive at this conclusion. “The Finance and Economic Planning department does not disburse funds to facilitate the full implementation of community projects based on departmental work plans,” Mbogo said. The committee found that it takes too long for funds to be disbursed and the procurement process delays, hindering development. Members urged the governor to strictly follow timelines for project implementation. On Thursday morning, Kaler MCA and Budget and Appropriation Committee chairman Thomas Akungo thanked members for the observations in the report, saying it has come at the right time when the assembly is encouraging public participation. “We have advertised in both traditional and social media calling upon people’s involvement in the budget process. The information is also in the clerk’s office and views will be collected on Friday,” he said. Akungo said they will add ideas on community initiated projects to ensure tenets of devolution are met. The committee was formed after North Kanyamkago MCA George Omamba sought clarity on implementation of projects initiated by citizens through community participation as enshrined in the Constitution.
