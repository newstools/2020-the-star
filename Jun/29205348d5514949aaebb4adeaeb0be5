The reopening of schools and colleges has been the subject of heated national debate for weeks. Education Cabinet Secretary George Magoha appointed a team of experts to advise the ministry on how and when it would be safe to let the school system back to life. The debate is passionate because a considerable group of parents and schools, especially the private ones, take the view that students should get back to class because the livelihood of teachers and the billions invested in private schools is under a major financial threat. The danger of a major wave of infections in schools and even the possibility of a huge number of students who might die as a result of an unwise and ill-considered decision to re-open might haunt the education chiefs for the rest of their lives. That is why we support the cautious approach by Magoha, who has stubbornly maintained that safety is and remains the only major factor when considering whether to open schools or not. A number of misguided parents and schools have pushed for KCPE and KCSE candidates to be allowed back to prepare for exams. These exams, though key in the lives of the students, cannot be more important than life or good health. News from South Korea, in the past week, will have bolstered the view that sending students back to class without a proper plan can have grim and devastating effect. The back to school plan must be staggered and well thought out.
