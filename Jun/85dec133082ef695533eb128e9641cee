Buildher Community Centre, based in Baba Dogo, recently held a charity programme in partnership with Ghetto Foundation in Mathare. Young single mothers, the elderly and the physically challenged were some of the identified groups facing harsh economic times during the coronavirus pandemic. "We know most residents here depended on daily wages from Eastleigh, which is under lockdown, and we are here to ease the burden," said Buildher Community officer Esther Waikuru.
