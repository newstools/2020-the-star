The government has proposed a full exam fee waiver for all 2020 KCPE and KCSE candidates. "We shall allocate Sh4 billion for the examination fee waiver for KCSE and KCPE candidates," Treasury CS Ukur Yatani stated. A total of 7.4 billion has been allocated towards improving the education sector. During presentation of the 2020/21 Budget in Parliament on Thursday, Yatani said this year's objective is to get more unemployed teachers into schools as interns. This is a deviation from previous year's reading where the government set aside Sh.55.4 billion to facilitate free day secondary education and Sh13.4 billion for free primary education. Out of the allocated amount, Sh2.1 billion will be used in construction of additional classrooms in secondary schools. Some Sh1.9 billion used in provision of at least 250,000 locally fabricated desks for both primary and secondary schools. "Sh700 million for capitation and improvement of infrastructure in low cost boarding schools in arid and semi arid lands," Yatani said. Another Sh2.4 billion will target recruitment of 10, 000 intern teachers to support the 100 per cent transition from primary to secondary school. Another Sh300 million will be for recruitment of 1.000 ICT interns to support digital learning in public schools.
