Seven robbery suspects have been detained in police custody as investigations on their activities in Kilimani and Kileleshwa are concluded. The prosecution told Milimani principal magistrate Muthoni Nzibe that the seven were captured on CCTV robbing residents of the two city estates. Humprey Minyata, Jahan Mzami, Mary Wambui, Ali Musa, Collins Munanga, Adan Ali and Ibrahim Hussein will be held at Kilimani Police Station for seven days. The seven, who the police linked to a series of robberies, were arrested in different parts of Nairobi. Last week,  two men were captured on CCTV robbing Paul Omanyi at knife and gunpoint before speeding away on a motorbike. The incident, which went viral on social media, happened in Kilimani at 6am. “They have been captured on the scenes of crime in different CCTV footages,” investigating officer Stephen Kibei stated in court documents. The court heard that the suspects and associates still at large have been terrorising the public using assorted weapons and fleeing on motorcycles. “They have been on police trail for some time. They commit crimes and go into hiding. They resurface and again commit crimes,” Kibei said. “Four mobile phones were recovered from them at the time of their arrest and they might contain information to assist the police with investigations,” he said.  - mwaniki fm
