Bandari assistant coach Ibrahim Shikanda will know his fate at the club on Tuesday next week. Shikanda has been rumoured to be on the verge but a source at the club said that the board will convene a meeting next week to deliberate on his future. Shikanda joined the dockers in August yearÂ  to deputise Bernard Mwalala but, according to a source who sought anonymity, the former Nzoia Sugar head coach has fallen out with Bandari honchos. It is understood that Shikanda's troubles at the club began after the suspension and consequent sacking of Mwalala in January. While it was expected that Shikanda would fill in Mwalala's shoes, the management picked veteran tactician Twahir Muhiddin to take over albeit on interim basis. Muhiddin was later replaced by Ken Odhiambo, who rejoined the outfit in April. "The board will have a virtual meeting on Tuesday next week to discuss on his future at the club. The management may either extend his stay or retrench him," revealed the source Meanwhile, Odhiambo says the decision to extend Shikanda's stay at the club lies on the management. The club's Chief Executive Officer Edward Oduor said he was not in a position to comment on the matter. "I have heard rumours touching on my assistant but I as far as I am concerned, he is still with the club. His fate lies in the hands of the board," said the former Harambee Stars assistant coach.
