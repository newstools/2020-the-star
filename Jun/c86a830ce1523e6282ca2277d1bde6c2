Did a Cabinet Secretary prevail on a Member of Parliament to drop a statement he had sought touching on a ‘sensitive’ matter in the ministry headed by the CS? Well, Corridors understands soon after the youthful lawmaker requested the statement on the floor, the CS called him to his office and asked him to drop the statement. The Minister is said to have told the lawmaker to go slow on the matter saying what he was seeking was a ‘sensitive’ matter. Since the two met, the legislator has never attended a meeting of a committee that has been looking into the matter. Several calls made to him by the committee chairman have gone unanswered. *** It seems some Members of Parliament are not happy with the new reality of sitting arrangements in the extended chamber. Last week, some members were heard lamenting about the move, saying they have been reduced to ‘mere followers’ of House proceedings. They claimed that they have never set foot in the debating chamber since the Covid 19 pandemic hit the country in early March. One of them suggested that they should petition the speaker to allow members to sit in the chamber on a rotational basis to enable them to participate in parliamentary proceedings. The extension was created to allow for the required social distancing to beat the spread of the contagious virus. *** Still on matters of the extended chamber. It seems there will be a real scramble for the 28 sitting slots in the Senate's main chamber. On Tuesday, Speaker Kenneth Lusaka directed that the seats be occupied on a first-come basis, save for the ones set aside for the Majority and Minority leaders, the Whips and their deputies. The directive triggered jubilation among some senators who have been sitting in the extended room. Some said they were ready to check in as early as 10am for the 2.30pm session provided they get spaces in the main chamber. Only 28 out of the 67 senators have been sitting in the chamber since Covid 19 came knocking.
