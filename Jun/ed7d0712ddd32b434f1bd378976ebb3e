Results for two out of nine Covid-19 patients at Mt Kenya Level Four Hospital in Nyeri have turned negative, Governor Mutahi Kahiga has said. He said one more test will be done on them within 24 hours and if the results are negative again, the two will be discharged. The two were taken to the isolation centre three weeks ago. “This is something we really appreciate, and we want to encourage our people that getting Covid-19 and turning positive is not a death sentence,” Kahiga said. The government, the county chief added, has also provided more testing kits. “I thank the Ministry of Health because they have boosted our capacity to test in excess of 2,000 people within Nyeri county.” Kahiga said this will involve targeted testing in specific areas like prisons, among others, where positive cases have been reported. The county chief said only three people remain in quarantine facilities in Nyeri county after all the others who were in quarantine tested negative and were discharged. He said health workers who have come into contact with positive cases have been housed in hotels where they are being provided with all the facilities that they need. They are also provided with PPEs. The health workers have been leaving the hotels to go to work then returning there instead of their respective homes. The governor also announced on Tuesday that all those working in his office were tested. Nyeri county has so far tested 459 people. Kahiga spoke when he launched a programme to feed needy families in the county. The governor said the food distribution will be rolled out in all the eight subcounties.  Edited by A.N
