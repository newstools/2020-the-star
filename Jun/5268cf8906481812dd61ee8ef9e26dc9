A critic of Deputy President William Ruto's coronation ceremony in Nandi county two weeks ago has been expelled for opposing the rites. Christopher Koiyoki,84, was defrocked from the position of Talai clan Council of Elders  vice chairman and stopped from conducting any ceremony after opposing Ruto’s  coronation a week ago. Talai Council of Elders, under the chairmanship of the Rev James Basi, secretary Moses Saina among others, made the announcement at Kapsisywo chief’s camp on Tuesday. The elders took exception to a statement by Koiyoki that those who carried out the ceremony were “unclean” and that they needed to be cleansed. Saina, who read the statement signed by 22 out of 25 elders, said the rites performed on Ruto were in line with others done to previous leaders, among them late Mzee Jomo Kenyatta. Others who have undegone the rites are late President Daniel Moi, former President Mwai Kibaki, President Uhuru Kenyatta and now William Ruto. Koiyoki had told the Star that crowning Ruto in such a ceremony was like trying to disinherit President Kenyatta while still in office. He was replaced by his cousin Lawrence Nganai, who now becomes the clan elders vice chair as they reaffirmed that no other ceremony would be carried out on any other person. “We are aware that elder Koiyoki was planning to have another person installed to rival Ruto, and that’s why we have decided to make it clear that no other Kalenjin will undergo such a ceremony,” Saina said. The Talai clan members are the descendants of the legendary Nandi leader Orkoiyot Koitalel Samoei, who led the Nandi resistance against the British occupation of their land between 1895-1905. The community is credited with having produced among others former Eldoret North MP the late William Saina, former Chesumei MP Elijah Lagat, athletes Eliud Kipchoge, Patrick Sang, among others.
