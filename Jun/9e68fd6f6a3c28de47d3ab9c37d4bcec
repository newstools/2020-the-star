Kajiado county has more than 50 Covid-19 patients and the numbers are rising, Governor Joseph Lenku announced Monday. Governor Lenku said new infection reports have been made almost every day since the first Covid-19 case in March. Lenku spoke to county residents during the Madaraka Day anniversary celebrations through FaceBook live. He said most of the people who turned positive for the coronavirus were truck drivers from Tanzania and government employees at the Namanga border point. “The country is facing a trying moment during this Covid-19 pandemic as more cases of infection are being reported daily. It is my appeal to the people of Kajiado to stick to provided rules and regulations to keep infections at bay,” Lenku said. The country chief said Kajiado is highly threatened by the infection because of her porous border with Tanzania. “I am aware of what the people of Kajiado are undergoing through at this time of the pandemic owing to job and business losses. We are also trying in our small way to distribute food to hunger-stricken families in urban and rural areas through our new e-platform,” he said. He said his Health department has put up some 500 beds in isolation centres in readiness for any eventualities related to coronavirus infections. (edited by o. owino)
