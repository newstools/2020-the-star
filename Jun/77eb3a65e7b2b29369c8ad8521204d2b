Kwale County Assembly Women Caucus has accused Deputy Governor Fatuma Achani of mobilising county officers to collect signatures to have MCAs thrown out of office through recall petitions. Led by their chairperson Fatuma Masito — a nominated MCA, they said Achani has initiated a door-to-door campaign specifically meant to turn the public against their ward representatives — a claim dismissed by the county executive. “It is very heartbreaking that the deputy is moving around advising county workers to keep taking signatures to remove ward representatives from power,” she said. Masito spoke on Wednesday as the county assembly team briefed the media in Matuga constituency. She strongly condemned the act, saying women in power must set a good example to the people looking up to them. “Achani is representing women in leadership and it is such a shame that she has gone off course and become the problem instead of being the problem solver,” Masito said. She added that the role of women in society is very broad and one of them is to bring peace and harmony whenever there is a dispute. Masito cautioned the deputy county chief that residents are monitoring her moves and they might lose confidence in her leadership if she persists in her quest to sow discord. She warned Achani that it won’t be easy for her to get rid of MCAs, whom resident elected willingly. She said the assembly is guided by law and not by mere propaganda, adding that they will stick to their mandate. However, county director of communications Daniel Nyasi rejected the claims, saying Achani has no power to force people to impeach MCAs. He told the MCAs to carry their own cross and stop dragging the deputy governor into their mess. “They should leave Achani alone and instead harvest what they planted; she is not involved and she will never be,” Nyasi said. He said that if the electorate is planning to remove the MCAs, then it is because they have failed to deliver what they promised.  Edited by F'Orieny
