Zumba is considered a fun and great fitness programme. The Nursing Council of Kenya has turned to it to buoy the spirits of its members on the frontline of the Covid-19 war. The council held its third Zumba session for nurses at Mathari National Teaching and Referral Hospital on Friday. The session was the brainchild of Digital Humanitarian Philip Ogolla, who is one of the Covid-19 frontline workers. The objective of the Zumba classes is to give nurses space to work out and boost their morale. "As we know, nurses are the backbone of our healthcare, hence, are more at risk of stigma because of the risk to exposure and the mental strain. So the Zumba classes come in as therapy sessions in form of fitness workouts," Ogolla said. The idea has been supported by the Ministry of Health and the national government. "Besides the nurses there are other health professionals working in the hospital environment in this difficult time such as doctors, cleaners, gardeners, cooks, watchmen and police officers, hence, the Zumba classes are not limited to nurses," Ogolla added. The council is looking into holding the sessions in the counties and probably making them monthly or weekly to reach as many nurses countrywide as possible. Zumba was created by Colombian dancer and choreographer Alberto "Beto" PÃ©rez in the 1990s and sessions are typically about an hour long. ''This idea is a welcome intervention as it encourages the nurses to perform duties efficiently and I would encourage other professions and companies to do the same with their workers,'' said Dr Simon Kibias, acting director-Health Standards. Those who attended the Zumba session at Mathari hospital included Nursing Council of Kenya chairperson Eunice Ndirangu, head of mental health Simon Njuguna and Mathari hospital nursing services director Paul Mwove.
