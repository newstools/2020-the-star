Nairobi Senator Johnson Sakaja on Tuesday admitted before a Kasarani Court that he flouted the government's curfew orders. Appearing before chief magistrate Roselyne Onganya, Sakaja pleaded guilty to breaching curfew orders on July 18 at 0100 hours at Ladies lounge bar along Dennis Pritt Road in Kilimani. He was fined Sh15, 000 or serve three months in prison. He is accused of having not been listed on the schedule to the Public Order 2020, and was found drinking alcohol in contravention of the state's curfew orders. Through his lawyer John Khaminwa, Sakaja said he was remorseful. Khaminwa told the court that on Monday, Sakaja apologised to Kenyans for flouting the government's curfew orders. "He was at Kilimani Police Station on Monday and directly admitted that he had committed an offence. He heavily apologised to the entire nation. It is commendable of a leader to apologise," Khaminwa said. "As a senator he has to meet people and talk to people on various matters including Corona virus." Sakaja has since resigned as the chairman of the Senate Adhoc Committee on Covid-19. The senator said he had decided to step down from his position in the committee in order to set an example and take responsibility for his actions. The lawmaker said he will abide by the law and had already paid his cash bail for his actions. The senator urged Kenyans to follow the government's directives on curbing the spread of Covid-19.
