A family in Rusigetti village in Kikuyu subcounty is trying to come to terms with the rape and murder of their 18-year-old daughter. The body of the Form 4 student was found on Tuesday evening dumped on a maize farm with her eyes gouged out. The girl had been sent by her mother to the shop on Sunday, but she never returned home. The family and neighbours started searching for the missing girl on Sunday night. The search ended on Tuesday evening when the owner of the farm found the body. Ruthigiti chief John Kahiu said the farmer discovered the body when he went to check on his crops. Police were called and investigations have started. Kikuyu OCPD Namutali Kutima said on Wednesday the case is being investigated by DCI officials. Residents have urged the police to hasten investigations. “This is very bad. Whoever did this should be punished for this heinous crime. They should be taken to court so that the family can get justice,” resident Tabitha Wanja said. The body was taken to PCEA Kikuyu Hospital mortuary. Edited by A.N
