Fifteen out of the 83 Kenyan students who arrived in Mombasa from Sudan on Saturday have tested positive for Covid-19. Mombasa Health chief officer Khadija Shikelly on Thursday said the 83 students were part of the 129 Kenyan learners who had been stranded in various universities in Sudan since the outbreak of the virus. Some 46 others were from Nairobi and other regions. The students arrived on Saturday onboard a chartered Kenya Airways flight from Khartoum to Moi International Airport, Mombasa, where the 83 disembarked. The rest continued with the journey to Nairobi. Shikelly said the 83 were taken straight to Kenya School of Government for quarantine. “All of them were tested, unfortunately, 15 tested positive and had to be removed from the other lot. The 15 have since been taken to Technical University of Mombasa Covid-19 Treatment Facility,” Shikelly said. The students had been stranded in South Sudan for months since the Kenyan government suspended international flights on March 22 to curb the spread of Covid-19. Each student was expected to pay about Sh51,900 for the flight. Governor Hassan Joho, Mvita MP Abdulswamad Nassir, Lamu East MP Athman Shariff, Malindi MP Aisha Jumwa and businessman Suleiman Shahbal raised the funds for the students. Some 76 parents raised half the fare for their children. Joho paid full fare for 25 students and half for 68, Nassir full airfare for 19 students, while Shahbal paid half for 37. Shariff paid full fare for 20 students and Jumwa half for four. Another 62 Kenyan students are still in Sudan. Edited by R.Wamochie
