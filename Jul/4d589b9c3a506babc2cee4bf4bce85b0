Kenyan Scrabble have dropped to third place in Pool 'C' of the ongoing Virtual Scrabble World Cup following their loss against Canada. The Word Warriors lost 7-18 against second-seeds Canada over the weekend after they failed to build on their first win against Singapore in the opening Pool C encounter last Sunday. A win against Canada could have guaranteed the Kenyan team a slot in the quarterfinals but the Canadians are now top of the group ahead of Singapore, who whipped Ghana 21-4. Scrabble Kenya chairman Bernard Amuke remains optimistic that they will qualify for the quarters with a win against continental rivals Ghana in their last pool match this weekend. "It was a tough outing but we can still progress from the group by beating Ghana and hope Canada will have a solid game against Singapore" said Amuke. Playing in a round-robin format, Kenya lost all their rounds with 1-4, 1-4, 2-3, 1-4 and 2-3. In the opening matches, Canada defeated Ghana 13-12 as Kenya beat Singapore. Amuke said that in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, ScrabbleÂ  has not been left behind in reinventing the wheel.
