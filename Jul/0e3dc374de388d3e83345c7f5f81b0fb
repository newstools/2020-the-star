Government Spokesman Cyrus Oguna has confirmed he has tested positive for the coronavirus. In a statement on Friday he said, "Recently having come from an assignment out of town , I developed mild coronavirus symptoms and got tested." "The results came back positive for coronavirus and I am now receiving medical care and responding well to treatment at an isolation and treatment facility." Oguna said contact tracing is ongoing, adding that his family is fine. Early this week, Oguna had dismissed reports he had been admitted. He took to Twitter to say, "We have noted reports on social media purporting that I have been admitted in hospital. I wish to clarify that I am well and just got back from an assignment out of town.” Oguna has been a regular fixture during coronavirus briefings conducted by the Health ministry daily. He also accompanied ministry officials, including Health CS Mutahi Kagwe, during some county tours to assess the level of preparedness of the counties to handle Covid-19.
