Kenya Hockey Union (KHU) are ready to support teams representing the country in the African Cup of Club Championship scheduled for later this year in Blantyre, Malawi. Kenyan teams have in the past, including last year, given the show a wide berth, owing to the financial challenges. Men’s defending champions Butali Warriors and Kenya Police are to represent the men’s category while Blazers and USIU Spartans qualified in the women’s category. Speaking during the launch of M-changa support platform launched by Wazalendo Club at the City Park Stadium on Sunday, KHU secretary general, Wycliffe Ongori said for hockey to grow, it is only be fair for the teams to honour the annual Africa club show. “We know clubs are facing hard economic times but we can sit down with their respective managements to see how best they can be assisted to participate in the competition. There’s a way the host nation can provide cheap accommodation and also avail alternative means of transport if we speak to them.” “Last year’s scenario painted a bad picture. It beats logic to qualify and not be part of the competition. We have tried to desist from punishing clubs and we are willing to provide solutions where necessary. It’s good to compete with the best from other countries and that’s the only way we can grow the sport.” Wazalendo will be making their debut in the tournament this year if they succeed in soliciting for funds from well wishers. Butali, Blazers and Spartans are also legible to play.
