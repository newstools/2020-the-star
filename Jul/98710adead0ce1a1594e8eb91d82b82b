A man who allegedly posted on social media that Interior CS Fred Matiangi was admitted at the Aga Khan Hospital's ICU battling Covid-19 has been detained for two days at the Muthaiga police station pending investigations. Isaac Kibet was arrested on July 25 in Eldoret following the Facebook post. The prosecution led by Jacinta Nyamosi on Monday told court that they needed 14 working days to complete their investigations. "The nature of investigations will require the investigators to get reports from forensic experts since some of his gadgets have been seized," the prosecution said. She added that the investigations are aimed towards a publication of a false information to social media and the forensic experts needs time to prepare a report. The prosecution argued if released, he is likely to access his Facebook and Twitter accounts and may likely interfere with the investigations. Milimani chief magistrate Martha Mutuku however ruled that 14 days were many considering the prosecution already had the suspect's gadgets. Kibet, 33, was arrested along with Emanuel Kimutai 19. The DCI also confiscated a laptop and two mobile phones suspected to have been used in the processing and dissemination of the misleading information. DCI boss director George Kinoti warned any person who out of malice or sheer morbid hatred for another person to desist from committing any act or attempt against the law . Matiangi said he had invited the DCI to establish the rumours of his admission. The CS said the claims of his hospitalisation had subjected him and his family to a lot of distress, forcing him to switch off his phone. He said as a result he has filed a formal complaint with the National Police Service to establish the source of the rumours.
