The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has urged the conflicting groups within the Kakuma camp to end their dispute. This comes following conflicting reports to UNHCR from different communities in the camp who have been accusing each other of causing violence. The UN body said that the conflict cannot be ignored and that it is concerned by the rising tensions inside the camp. The statement said that the small group of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or Intersex (LGBTI) refugees and asylum-seekers have been reporting incidents of violence against them for the past weeks. “Members of other refugee communities and LGBTI refugees and asylum-seekers living in other parts of the Kakuma camp have reported threats and violence perpetrated by individuals belonging to this small group,” part of the statement reads. The camp has an estimated 300 refugees and asylum-seekers who self-identify as LGBTI. It said that the majority of the LGBTI group who are dispersed across the camp have reported a limited number of security incidents over the past several months. Following the complaints from the small group of LGBTI refugees and asylum -seekers, police and local authorities have enhanced the security measures in the areas of the camp where they reside. The organisation has said that it understands the increased challenges that vulnerable refugees and asylum seekers, including some with an LGBTI profile, are facing due to the impact of coronavirus “UNHCR works alongside partners to identify those most in need to offer assistance, psycho-social support and counseling. This includes mental health assistance and regular home visits.” It has said that enough mechanisms have been put in place to quell the antagonising groups as well as bringing all refugee groups together to openly discuss challenges that they are facing inside the camp. The camp hosts more than 500,000 refugees and asylum-seekers.
