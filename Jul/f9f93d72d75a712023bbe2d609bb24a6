Police in Busia are investigating an incident in which a truck driver was found dead inside his vehicle in Busia town. The body was discovered at 1am Thursday by security guards but was removed from the truck at dawn, sources said. The unidentified trucker’s body was found reclined on the driver’s seat. County health authorities took the body to Busia County Teaching and Referral Hospital mortuary, approximately one kilometre from the scene. The man had parked his vehicle outside Governor’s Lodge opposite Barclays Bank premises along the Busia-Kisumu Highway. County police commander John Nyoike confirmed the incident. “A body of an unknown person has been found outside the lodge. We are yet to confirm his identity and the cause of death,” Nyoike told the Star. County Health chief officer Dr Isaac Omeri said samples have been picked from the body and have been taken to the Alupe Covid-19 Testing and Treatment Centre for analysis. Omeri said the health department is keen on establishing whether the man died as a result of coronavirus. He said the results of the tests will be released to the press. Hundreds of truckers cross the Busia border into Uganda every day. Others rest in the town before embarking on long journies to Rwanda, Burundi, South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo.
