One of the two soldiers who died in a helicopter crash in Masinga, Machakos, last Monday was buried in Miumbuni, Mwingi East, Kitui. Majors Robert Mumu and Jacob Agunda were headed to Garissa from Nairobi when the accident occurred around 10am. They died on the spot in Kanyonga area of Kivaa ward. Until his demise, Major Mumu, 32, worked as a squadron pilot at the Joint Helicopter Command (JHC) in Embakasi. He had been deployed to Somalia for African Union Mission to Somalia (Amisom). According to his friend in Mwingi town who did not want to be named, he had called her to say he would pass Mwingi town heading to Garissa then later go to Somalia for official duties. A few hours after his call, the news of a KDF helicopter crash broke and photos of the two lifeless soldiers inside the wreckage started circulating online. Minutes after his call, Mumu’s friend could hardly believe he was the one in the pictures lying in a pool of blood lifeless. He was the lastborn in a family of four and was the family’s breadwinner. Sources revealed that Mumu separated from his wife following domestic wrangles but months before his death they had reconciled. Edited by Henry Makori
