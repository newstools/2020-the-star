Panic has gripped the Kakamega county headquarters after one of the CECs tested positive for Covid-19. The official is admitted to the new Mumias Level 4 isolation unit in Mumias town. County staff who have been mingling with the CEC are in great fear they could have contracted the virus. The official’s close friends said he sought treatment at a hospital in Kisumu after he fell ill on Friday. “They carried out all tests and they were negative. They then decided to do the Covid-19 test, which turned out positive. He was then ferried in an ambulance to the isolation unit in Mumias where he is admitted but he is not in critical condition,” a senior government official, who asked not to be named, said. Anxiety has also permeated the political circles because the affected official has been attending meetings being convened by Governor Wycliffe Oparanya and Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa in western to champion the region's development agenda. This means the contact tracing web could be wider given the number of people who have been attending the meetings, including elders. Some meetings have breached the social distancing rules. County health officials could not confirm or deny the case only saying, “We cannot comment on the matter.” Governor Oparanya said he was aware that one of his CECs was admitted to hospital, but wasn’t aware what he was suffering from. “I was just told that he was taken to the Mumias hospital. If that is the case, then all my staff will have to be tested for the virus. I wasn't aware that the officer, though young had high blood pressure condition,” he told the Star on the phone. The new virus case comes at a time Oparanya is under fierce criticism for announcing that his administration had identified two parcels of land for mass graves should there be a spike in the Covid-19 infections in the county. Politicians have been blamed for violating the Covid-19 protocols in public gatherings they convene during the pandemic period. Edited by A.N
