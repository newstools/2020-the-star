A Kitui cleric on Thursday warned Kenyans against taking the Covid-19 disease for granted, saying the contagion is a merciless killer. Bishop Charles Kimolo of Kitui Potters House Church said more deaths are likely to be reported across the country if people do not abide by the safety protocols issued by the Health Ministry to contain coronavirus spread. He warned Kenyans against flirting with the disease. The country has recorded 14,805 confirmed cases of Covid-19 as of Wednesday with 260 deaths. Kimolo said the numbers could rise astronomically unless Kenyans religiously adhere to containment protocols. He cited widespread disregard for masking, warning that such behaviour could be dangerous. Speaking to the media at his church in Kitui town, the bishop said the reopening of the economy by President Uhuru Kenyatta on July 6 did not mean the pandemic has been contained. “I want to tell fellow Kenyans to be careful because Corionavirus pandemic is not yet over. If we do not adhere to the Health Ministry protocols on the fight against Covid-19, our people will perish in large numbers,” Kimolo said. He said he was worried by the carefree attitude Kenyans have adopted. “Corona is real and is a killer. We must always put on masks, observe social distancing and wash and sanitize our hands regularly to keep the virus at bay," he said. “Those who wish to live long must put on masks. Do not take Covid-19 casually. It is real and is killing people. I come across people putting on masks while many others do not wear them at all. Wearing masks should be mandatory to save lives." He said the disease does not have a cure yet and asked Kenyans to trust in God for a vaccine to be found. “We must trust in God and pray earnestly because it is Him who has the power to eliminate Covid-19.”  Edited by P.O
