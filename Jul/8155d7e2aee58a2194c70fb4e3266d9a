Media personality Anita Nderu says she will not apologise for hosting members of the LGBTQ community on her cooking show, 'The overdressed cook'. The video, which was meant for viewers over the age of 18, caught the attention of many, which led to her trending for days. Speaking to Massawe on Radio Jambo, Anita said she respects people's opinions but she will not apologise. She said she has always been open about different things happening around, and so this being pride month, she decided to invite some of her friends on the show. "They were just being themselves and nothing on the show was scripted," she said. "What I know is they won't love you all the time, some things you do, they will celebrate you, others, they will not. It is a right of expression and so I respect people's opinions," she said. "I refuse to apologise for choosing to allow my friends to be who they are and for airing the episode 'coz it is my channel and I am allowed to do that. I just hope people will be open-minded." On whether she is a member of the LGBTQ, Anita said that is private. "When I'm ready to share, I will," she said, adding she will have another episode on the same.
