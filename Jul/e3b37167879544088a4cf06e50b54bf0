The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission is probing the alleged misuse of Covid-19 funds in at least five counties. Chief Executive Officer Twalib Mbarak said on Thursday the commission may  arrest suspects in the coming month. “We are probing the misuse of Covid funds at the national and the county level. In the next one month, you may see the arrest of another governor,” Mbarak said. He said that the commission was determined to ensure the funds are properly accounted for. "We need to be proactive. We know there is a probability the funds are being misused at the national and county levels. That is why you have read in the papers that we are investigating the likes of Kemsa (Kenya Medical Supplies Authority),"  Mbarak said. He did not identify the counties under investigation. "You do not need to know now. You only need to know that one of the 47 governors may be arrested in the next month," he said. He was speaking after a courtesy visit by the Turkish Ambassador to Kenya, Ahmet Cemil Miroglu. The envoy affirmed his country's commitment to strengthening the EACC's capacity to fight corruption by modernising its ICT infrastructure. "We mutually recognise that leveraging on technology is at the core of a more responsive, efficient and effective commission," he said. Mbarak's announcement came on the day Kenya Bureau of Standards Managing Director Bernard Njiraini was arrested by EACC detectives for not cooperating with investigations into procurement irregularities at the agency.
