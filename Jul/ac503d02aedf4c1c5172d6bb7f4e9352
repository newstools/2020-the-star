The government on Friday launched the cancer policy document. CAS Rashid Aman made the announcement as he spoke during his daily briefing. "I want to urge our cancer patients to embrace and utilise the cancer centres and facilities. The number of Kenyans seeking treatment abroad will reduce," he said. "Cancer care can now be accessed in county facilities. Every household has been affected by cancer. Recognising the burden of cancer, Uhuru directed the ministry to develop cancer policy," he said. "The ministry has put in place chemotherapy centres and we will continue to support these centres with grants to continue service delivery." Ten chemotherapy centres were established in January. Aman said there will be an additional five radiotherapy services in five counties. The hospitals are in Eldoret, Nakuru, Mombasa, Garissa and Kisii. Aman said the ministry will also launch a breast cancer screening pilot report. He further urged parents to take their young girls for the HPV vaccine, saying the vaccine is safe. The ministry has disseminated cancer screening guidelines to all 47 counties. The National Cancer Institute estimates that 47,887 Kenyans are diagnosed with cancer every year and 32,987 patients die annually. The National Non-Communicable Diseases Alliance, a local lobby that promotes action against NCDs, confirmed the 10 new chemotherapy centres are operational. NCD Alliance vice chairperson David Makumi said this could be a game-changer for Kenya.Â He urged the Council of Governors to incentivise the private sector to set up radiotherapy centres outside Nairobi. Cancer is the third leading cause of death in Kenya, contributing to seven per cent of all deaths. By August last year, the country had at least 35 qualified oncologists and 20 others under training. At that time, there were 35 oncology nurses and 10 clinicians trained in cancer management.
