The counties revenue allocation formula continues to draw varying reactions from leaders and political parties. The Service Party leader Mwangi Kiunjuri on Monday said the proposed third basis formula is one pathway towards fairer and more equitable distribution of resources. “As a service party, we are committed to equitable, people-centered resource allocation as a major enabler of service delivery. We therefore must face issues of systematic distribution, however unpalatable, with the courage they deserve,” Kiunjuri said. The former Agriculture CS has also asked Kenyans to continue debating on the same issue by expressing their views. Kiunjuri has further asked political leaders to be honest and pass the Bill if they fully support the BBI, which he said promised to send more resources to counties. Deputy President William Ruto had earlier asked Senators to end their unnecessarily divisive debate on the same. Ruto said that the Constitution envisages fair and equitable sharing of all our resources and that senators “must as per its mandate structure a win-win formula that is sensitive to proposals made without hurting any county.” ODM leader Raila Odinga said the Senate should allow the country to move forward by adopting the CRA report even as it considers the the voices that have been raised regarding the same. Raila also said that there is a need to encourage counties to raise their own revenue from the economic activities.
