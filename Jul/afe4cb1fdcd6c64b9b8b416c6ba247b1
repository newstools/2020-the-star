The public has been urged to show love, mingle and freely mourn with the family of Baringo Woman Rep Gladwel Cheruiyot, whose husband died of Covid-19. Kiambu Woman Rep Gathoni Wa Muchomba said Cheruiyot and her two children were tested for coronavirus and turned Covid-19 negative. “I am Cheruiyot’s closest friend. Our samples were taken at the same time to the Kenya Medical Research Institute and results proved us, with all our family members, negative” Wa Muchomba said. She spoke during the burial of Cheruiyot’s husband, Isaac Cherogony, at his Kapkiamo home, Baringo North subcounty on Friday. He succumbed to breathing complications while undergoing treatment at Eldoret Hospital on July 4. Samples that were taken later showed he died of Covid-19. Wa Muchomba appealed to the members of the public not to stigmatise the bereaved family saying, “it is time they need your love and closeness most to mourn together over the loss of their beloved member". Others who attended the burial included Murang’a Woman Rep Sabina Chege, Nominated Senator from Isiolo Abshiro Halake, Baringo North MP William Cheptumo, William Kamket (Tiaty) and Baringo Deputy Governor Jacob Chepkwony. Cherogony is the third Covid-19 victim to succumb in Baringo after two others were buried last month in Eldama Ravine subcounty. Governor Stanley Kiptis also condoled with the family. Edited by EKibii
