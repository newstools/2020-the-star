Two churches in Budalang'i constituency have begun resettling persons whose houses were swept away by floodwaters. The Free Pentecostal Fellowship in Kenya and St Carjetan Sirimba Catholic Church led by Bishop Gabriel Ouma and Father Chris Barasa are leading the efforts. The majority of the beneficiaries are widows whose houses were destroyed in Ruambwa sub-location in Siaya county. Others are from Bunyala subcounty. "My church disaster preparedness committee toured all the 62 IDP camps and identified needy persons to be assisted," Ouma said. The FPFK leader said his organisation is providing iron sheets, buying all building materials and meeting the labour costs. Ouma told the Star that his church will identify more flood victims both in Budalang'i and Alego Usonga constituencies for assistance. Sirimba Catholic Church priest Chris Barasa appealed to both the national government and Busia county to help resettle the flood victims. Barasa said the resettlement of the flood victims is costly hence the need for a joint effort. He also said the Sirimba Catholic Church disaster committee would identify more needy persons to be assisted. (edited by o. owino)
