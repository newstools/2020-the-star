Kisumu county leaders, led by Governor Anyang' Nyong'o and Senator Fred Outa have sent a condolence message to the family of fallen musician Maureen Achieng, fondly known as Lady Maureen. The 36-year-old queen of Ohangla music died on Saturday morning around 3am in Uriri where she was staying while recovering in her sister's house. Her sister, Bella Achieng, confirmed the death to the media. Nyong'o said Maureen's death was a great loss to the Ohangla fraternity and the Luo music community coming just weeks after the passing on of two Luo musicians Benard Onyango (Abenny Jachiga) and Erick Omondi Odit ( Omondi Long Lilo). He said Lady Maureen will be remembered for her musical talent that gave benga music a modern twist warming many hearts. "The Luo music community will miss her great musical messaging technique championed by careful selection of words in her songs," he said on Saturday. Senator Outa remembered the late Lady Maureen as a song bird who composed numerous political praise songs. He said  Kisumu county is mourning for the second time after the death of another Ohangla maestro Abenny Jachiga who died nearly a month ago. Senator Outa condoled with the music fraternity in the county while assuring them of his support. He said musicians should not be slowed by the misfortunes that continue to befell them but soldier on by composing songs that unite the community. Since 2018, the vibrant musician  has struggled with sickness and has been in and out of hospital. Early this year, Lady Maureen was admitted at Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital after being transferred from a hospital in Migori. She was discharged on February 20. Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital Medical Superintendent had Peter Okoth said then that the singer was discharged because she “was responding well to medication and was getting stable.”
