Parents are increasingly moving their children upcountry from the city to manage the cost of living, boredom and escape the virus. Even fuelling the exodus of children from the city is the fact that the government announced schools will remain closed until January next year, a situation that has resulted in idling among the young ones. Many parents who spoke to the Star confirmed that they had either dispatched their children or were planning to send them to their relatives or homes in rural areas to ease off the pressure by the high cost of living in the city. Shelmith Kimathi, for example, sent her 10-year-old son Alex to his grandparents in Nanyuki "because it is very tough on me economically with him around". The single mother said she believed having the child upcountry would minimise the chances of him getting the highly infectious coronavirus as the prevalence in the city has been higher than that in the countryside. Julius Wanjala sent his three children to Kitale on Tuesday, just a day after President Uhuru Kenyatta announced an end to the travel restrictions imposed to contain the spread of the virus. “We are barely surviving and the pressure was even more with the kids around,” the 43-year-old engineer said. “At home right now, people are harvesting and hence getting food is not as hard as here in the city. Let them be home with their grandparents.” At home, Fredrick Omondi - a father of two - said children are safe because of collective parenting, unlike in the capital where everyone is for himself or herself. “I feel my kids are safer at home even when I’m not around because of communal parenting,” he said, explaining that the straining economic realities make it hard to maintain a househelp to watch over the children. Long-distance PSV operators are reported to have hiked the fares from the city, with moving to the western part of the country costing in the upwards of Sh3,000, double the usual price owing to the high demand.
