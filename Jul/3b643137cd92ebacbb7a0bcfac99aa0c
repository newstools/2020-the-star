Breshy Worships, a new gospel artiste, has released her first single Umeinuliwa Juu. Speaking about the song, Breshy told Word Is, “Umeinuliwa Juu is a song about praising God for the things He has done in my life and that of every other person. “It is meant to inspire and encourage anyone going through sickness, depression, loss of jobs, amongst other challenges, during this season.” Breshy said she has been through a lot in life but God has come through for her.  “I urge everyone to look unto Him as His name is above every other name.” Breshy is a praise and worship minister at her local church and a banker by profession. She is also the brains behind The Cloud platform for pure and authentic worshippers in Kenya. She looks forward to launching more singles before her much-anticipated album in December.
