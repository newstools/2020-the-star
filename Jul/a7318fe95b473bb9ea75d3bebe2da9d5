Anti-drugs agency NACADA has cautioned parents against consuming alcohol in the presence of children. The authority has appealed to Kenyans to report such incidents for immediate action. Those who consume alcohol and drugs through organized groups drinking bouts in homes in the presence of children are targeted. NACADA chair Mabel Imbuga in a statement on Saturday said they are concerned about the growing trend of people consuming alcohol from home. “…which is exposing children and young people to underage drinking,”Imbuga said. “Drinking at home also undermines the protective home environment for the pupils and students who are staying at home to in measures to prevent spread of Covid-19.” “We appeal to members of the public to report such cases to NACADA through our toll-free line No. 1192(Monday to Friday during working hours) or to any national government administration officers,” she said. Nacada wants parents to “take advantage of the situation to create an alcohol-free home environment as well as build closer relationships with their children.” Imbuga cited surveys by the authority which attributed the high prevalence of drug abuse in primary and secondary schools to drug use at home. “This clearly shows the home environments have increasingly become a risk factor as many of the respondents indicated they were initiated into alcohol and drug use at home,” she said. The Ministry of Health intends to ban the sale of alcohol to sit-in customers at various joints. Restaurants, eateries, bars, food courts, entertainment joints, supermarkets, wines and spirits; or any other business establishments will be targeted. The proposals were in a draft regulation, which if implemented, would have a great bearing to the alcohol industry. And with NACADA now targeting homes, the end of beer parties could be here. “It is our hope that these restrictions do not leave the home as the main alternative to those wishing to indulge in drinking,” Imbuga said.
