Nakuru County Government on Friday closed its procurement office after a member of staff in the department tested positive for Covid-19. Governor Lee Kinyanjui said his administration had commenced tracing all the contacts of the county employee. The governor said the county government was in the process of mandatory testing for its staff when it identified the case. “In a bid to mitigate, monitor and prevent the spread of Covid-19, the county initiated mandatory testing for its staff including staff workers,” he said. In his press statement, Kinyanjui said procurement services will be handled virtually until all the staff are certified free of Covid-19 and the office fumigated. He added that in order to safeguard its workforce and reduce the spread of the virus, the county would carry out periodic mandatory testing of its staff across all cadres. “With the escalating cases of infections, the county shall be issuing guidelines on provision of critical services that may be interrupted by the temporary closure," the governor said. Kinyanjui said offices that will remain open shall only accept visitors on appointment. He added all the necessary measures to protect the county workers and their families would be taken because their well-being was paramount.
