The Asset Recovery Agency has secured orders stopping the Shanzu law court from interfering with Sh1 million and Sh300,000 seized from a heroin trafficking suspect. The money, believed to be proceeds of an illegal business, was recovered from Ruweida Bwanahamad Fara’s house in July last year. The wife of notorious drug trafficker Ahmed Said Bakar, aka El Chapo, was arrested alongside Abubakar Yahya Abubakar – a relative. The court also allowed the assets agency to preserve a Toyota Allion belonging to the suspect. Several packets of heroin were also seized during the sting operation carried out by a multi-agency team from Nairobi. “The Sh1,017,600 and Sh300,000 were produced as exhibits in senior principal magistrates court at Shanzu vide Criminal Case No. C.R. 1126 of 2019 and deposited in the courts bank account No. 1183564473 held at Kenya Commercial Bank,” ARA boss Muthoni Kimani said in a gazette notice. The notice was to inform the suspect and the court of the preservation orders. “That the order be and is hereby issued prohibiting the interested party from transacting, withdrawing, transferring using and any other dealings in respect of funds,” the notice reads. The suspect is also prohibited from the sale, transfer or disposal off or dealings with the said vehicle. The preservation orders will be in force for 90 days. Edited by R.Wamochie
