Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru spent the better part of Wednesday at the Ethics and Anti-Corruuption Commission (EACC) being queried over alleged misappropriation of imprests by her office. The governor arrived at EACC’s headquarters at 10am and came out of the revolving doors minutes after 5pm. Kirinyaga MCAs had accused the governor of awarding herself Sh10.63 million in imprests ostensibly as travel allowances for foreign trips she never made. During her impeachment, MCAs claimed Waiguru was irregularly paid travel allowances amounting to Sh10.6 million “yet she did not make the trips”. The Senate, while acquitting her, concluded that “there exists a well-orchestrated and complex web of corruption in the tendering process at the county government of Kirinyaga.” But addressing the press on Wednesday, Waiguru said she was only grilled over the Sh10.63 million imprests and not the tendering process at the county. She termed what she was going through as a well crafted witch-hunt by Members of Kirinyaga County Assembly. “I was called here on the issue of imprests. I am happy the truth is finally going to come out,” said Waiguru expressing satisfaction with the manner the anti-graft body is handling the matter. “You can make all manner of allegations but you must provide the evidence.” The Governor has maintained some MCAs accompanied her to trips they accuse her of not going for.
