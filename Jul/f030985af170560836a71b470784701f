 Garissa will soon unveil a modern market with capacity for over 500 fresh produce merchants who are currently based at Orahey open-air market. Lands executive Abdi Omar said the market, which is among Governor Ali Korane’s flagship projects, is 75 per cent complete and will be unveiled by October. Speaking during a tour of the project, Omar urged the contractor to ensure it is completed on time. "We are determined to ensure this mega project is delivered on time despite previous opposition by the governor's political detractors," Omar said. "I am impressed with the progress and quality of work. Unless something unforeseen happens, the traders will occupy this place by October.” He said government houses adjacent to the new market will be demolished to create a spacious parking space for traders and their customers. The CEC also visited the drainage and footpath project along Kismayu Road, accompanied by Housing chief officer Abdi Farah. Farah said the drainage and footpath scheduled to be complete in three weeks will improve the drainage system in Garissa town. He noted that poor drainage has been a challenge when it rains and that many buildings have been damaged by floods. Traders who spoke to the Star while welcoming the construction of the market urged the administration to ensure the market is occupied by those whose stalls were demolished. “It is one thing to construct and another thing to give them to the right people. We don’t want to see outsiders allocated stalls at the expense of those who have been in the market for years,” Mama Halima Yussuf said. Last year, Governor Korane urged the traders to allow for construction of modern stalls assuring them that no one would be displaced. Edited by R.Wamochie
