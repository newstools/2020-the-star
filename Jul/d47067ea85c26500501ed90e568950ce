Residents of Kiambu are set to get a new 104-bed Covid-19 isolation unit in Tigoni by September. Mabati Rolling Mills has partnered with the Kiambu government and the Kiambu Covid-19 Emergency Fund to construct the Sh25 million unit. “We have some of the best technology in pre-engineered steel buildings which allows us to deliver the isolation unit within tight timelines and at the best quality and value,” Mabati Rolling Mills CEO Andrew Heycott said. "The need for speed is critical in order to increase the county’s capacity to handle the growing Covid-19 cases." Heycott said the pre-engineered steel technology allows for the fabrication of the building offsite. It is then quickly assemble on site reducing the construction time by at least 50 per cent. Mabati Rolling Mills Limited is the largest company within the Safal Group. Kiambu Governor James Nyoro thanked Safal Group for its contribution towards the hospital project, adding that it had come at a time when the county was registering increasing numbers of Covid-19 patients. “Kiambu’s proximity to Nairobi, the epicentre of Covid-19 pandemic in Kenya, means that we continue to receive patients from Nairobi and this is putting a strain on the capacity of our health facilities," he said. The county chief said the expansion of Kiambu Covid-19 Centre in Tigoni will allow other health facilities to handle other patients.
