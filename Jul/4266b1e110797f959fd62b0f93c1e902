Former football star Boniface Ambani wants AFC Leopards’ management to get rid of cartels whose intention is to pull the club down. “The club need to deal with the rising issue of cartels who are out to ruin the good progress club chairman Dan Shikanda and his team have made," he noted. He said AFC Leopards are a major brand and shouldn't be relegated to mid-table or even be seen to be fighting relegation as long as the right structures are put in place. The former AFC Leopards' striker expressed delight with the commitment of players, who he said have shown great character by winning matches despite the cash crunch the team has been experiencing. “I’m impressed with the structures being put in place, especially the investment in young players. We now have the winning mentality in the team that has been lacking.  Anthony Kimani and his technical bench have also done good work,” he added. He lamented that despite commanding massive following in the country,  cartels have manipulated even the gate collections that are supposed to help the club. He said the same cartels have spread their roots into the clubs scouting system and were interfering with the process of recruiting players. "They are opting to go for the expensive international rejects hence burdening the club even more," he said.
