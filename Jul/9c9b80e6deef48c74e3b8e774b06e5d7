North Imenti MP Rahim Dawood says quarantine centres should have good conditions that guarantee the safety of people suspected to have contracted coronavirus. He said on Sunday many complaints have been lodged with him over the pathetic state of some facilities.  This comes after 22 workers of a popular eatery in Meru town were quarantined at Meru KMTC. The employees of Kajim Butchery and Kitchen are complained about poor treatment at the facility. "We were bundled into a health department vehicle on Thursday morning and dumped at KMTC. We were not told why but the previous day, we were told we would be holding a meeting,” an employee who did not want to be named said. Kajim Butchery and Kitchen is famous for its nyama choma and other meals and is frequented by many residents. Reports indicate the owner tested positive for Covid-19. His employees lamented that they should not to be subjected to suffering at the quarantine facility as some of them are diabetic and others have high blood pressure. They are offered poor-quality meals, they said. "We have not had any tests done. We are only told that one of us has tested positive and we will stay in quarantine for about 21 days,” the employee told the Star on the phone. Contacted, however, Meru county executive Misheck Mutuma said they are trying their best to care for those in quarantine. He said those who are not satisfied with the services can opt for hotel accommodation at their expense. He said they have to take measures to prevent Covid-19 cases from surging. For Dawood, the county government should put in place more resources in testing for Covid-19 so residents do not pay Sh5,000. He said the county should do more  now that the ban on movement into and out of Nairobi has  been lifted. “Purchasing PPE alone is not enough, we need to motivate health workers and give them enough PPEs,” he said.
