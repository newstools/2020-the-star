Thousands of traders at Nairobi’s Muthurwa market are now better equipped to fight Covid-19 after Kenya Pipeline Company donated 30 water tanks on Friday. While handing the 500-litre tanks valued at Sh285,000, KPC chairman  John Ngumi said the company is repaying Kenyans for the support given to the company for many years. “As a state corporation, we make profits on behalf of the people of Kenya and so it is our responsibility to give back to society,” he said. He added that the company will continue donating hand sanitiser and face masks countrywide, especially to vulnerable Kenyans. “So far, we have distributed about 1.5 million litres of hand sanitiser to all 47 counties and also donated Sh55 million to NYS, which has supported the production of 1.5 million face masks for poor Kenyans,” Ngumi said. Muthurwa Traders Association chair Nelson Githaiga thanked KPC for the donation, noting that it will cure them of headaches associated with accessing water for their business activities. “The market already has a borehole and what we were lacking was the water distribution strategy. The tanks will enable the market operate even more optimally and generate more revenue for the city," Githaiga said. Accompanying Ngumi was Nairobi Woman Representative Esther Passaris, who urged the traders to maintain stringent hygienic measures. “You can see how the cases in Nairobi are rising very fast. We can see that our hospitals can't cope with the case load hence the only viable alternative is to prevent the disease through washing of hands," she said. KPC has been one of the corporate bodies in the frontline battle against the pandemic since the first positive case was recorded in March. In March, it commenced production and distribution of free ethanol-based hand sanitiser to all the 47 counties.
