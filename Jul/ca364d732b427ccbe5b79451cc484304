Celestine Ndinda and her husband Njugush have denied claims they are expecting baby number two. They were responding to people who sent congratulatory messages to them after sharing photos of her first pregnancy. In a comment on Instagram, Celestine said, "The photos are for my first pregnancy." This, she shared in line with her recent YouTube discussion ‘Celes’ Pregnancy’, where they have been opening up on their journey as parents. Celestine had earlier said she was disappointed after getting pregnant just four months after the wedding since they were unstable financially. She was, however, quick to add that around the fifth month, blessings started flooding. "We were wondering how we would manage with a kid but everything changed. He opened doors for us and we became many," she said.
