United States-based ex-Kenyan international star Peter Kiganya is concerned about the dwindling standards both in the region and on the continent. Kiganya is, however, optimistic Kenyan basketball will pick up as long as it gets the necessary support from both within and in the diaspora. The former Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) and Co-operative Bank of Kenya brash forward reiterated that Kenya has immeasurable talent that must be continuously tapped and developed. He said if this is done, the standards will shoot to a level that will be unrivalled in East and Central Africa. “I was in Yala the other day and could not believe what I saw. We have kids with good basic skills that only needs to be developed. These are boys and girls in the rural areas,” he observed. He said the same applies to Kisumu and Nakuru. Kiganya, one of the finest local players who worked his way up the ladder while playing for Abilene Christian University (ACU) in Texas, said the development programme will get better in the coming years. “I want to give kids hope. I will do all that I can to provide them with balls, shoes and playing kit from next year. I will also try to visit many places when I return next year.”
