Raila Odinga's ODM party won big from the parliamentary committee changes after its members landed plum posts. Raila's allies took charge of at least four crucial National Assembly committees, viewed as the last in his and President Uhuru Kenyatta's bid to tighten the grip on Parliament. Raila's allies also control committees set to play key roles in implementing the Building Bridges Initiative proposals meant to actualise the handshake. Homa Bay Woman Rep Gladys Wanga chairs the powerful Finance and National Planning Committee, the first woman to hold the post. Wanga said her election to the the post was a major win for women's leadership in the country. "I thank HE Uhuru Kenyatta for his magnanimity and my party leader Raila Odinga for his faith in me," she said in a statement. The position gives her unfettered access to crucial government agencies and departments as the committee is charged with approving government revenue measures. She will be deputised by Roysambu MP Waihenya Ndirangu. Another Raila ally, Busia Woman Representative Florence Mutua has been elected to chair the Education committee of the National Assembly. Nyeri Town MP Wambugu Ngunjiri will deputise Mutua. Rarieda MP Otiende Amolo is the vice-chair of the Justice and Legal Affairs Committee. He serves underÂ Kangema MP Muturi Kigano. Amolo, who served in the committee of experts that crafted the 2010 Constitution, is expected to offer his legal expertise in pushing for the BBI bills. Homa Bay Town MP Peter Kaluma is now the vice chair of the Constitutional Implementation Oversight Committee. The committee exercises supervisory role over all state agencies on the implementation of the Constitution. The panel is chaired by Ndaragwa MP Jeremia Kioni. (edited by o. owino)
