"We wish to take this opportunity to wish our muslim bothers and sisters around the world and all those of other beliefs who will join them in celebrating Idd." Id ul Azha is the single-most important feast of the Islamic year. It falls on the 10th day of the final month of the Islamic calendarÂ  also known as Dhu al Hijjah. The date moves on the Gregorian calendar by around 10 days per year. The background of Id ul Azha is the Islamic account of Ibrahim willingly offering up his son Ishmael as a sacrifice before an angel intervened and stopped the hand in which he held the knife. Muslims normally go on pilgrimage to Mecca to re-enact the sacrifice and take part in ceremonies held in the very places where the events are thought to have transpired.
