A former house help was on Wednesday charged with stealing four dogs from his employer’s compound. John Omukata Nyamwethi pleaded guilty before Kibera senior principal magistrate Philip Mutua. Nyamwethi allegedly stole the German Shepherds on June 28 and 29 in Kuto Road in Lang'ata, Nairobi. The dogs are all valued at Sh180,000 and belong to Jorum Thuo Gikonyo. According to the police, the accused stole the dogs a day after the employer fired him. He climbed over the perimeter wall to access the compound, police said. The complainant was called by Nyamwethi’s replacement informing him about the missing dogs. Nyamwethi was arrested in Thika after days of searching. Prosecutor Jane Gitahi asked the court to suspend sentencing to Friday. The magistrate granted the request. Edited By R.Wamochie
