Knut has dismissed reports it is behind a lawsuit challenging the reappointment of Nancy Macharia as TSC chief executive officer. The report appeared in a section of the media. In a statement, Knut secretary general Wilson Sossion said, "The union has not filed a petition in any court opposing reappointment of Macharia to serve the commission for another term." He said the strained relationship between the union and the teachers' employer is on the mend but such reports may ruin all that. According to the report, a little-known rights group has gone to court arguing Macharia's reappointment was done unlawfully. Midrift Human Rights Network has petitioned Nakuru High Court judge Monica Mbaru to declare Macharia’s reappointment null and void, arguing that the position must be filled through a competitive process. The lobby says the Teachers Service Commission has not shown any evidence that it advertised and competitively filled the position. Macharia's term came to an end on June 30. There's no communication whether she will retain the job for a second and final term. The rights group petition comes days after Nelson Havi, president of the Law Society of Kenya, warned of plans to return Macharia to the helm of TSC. In a letter, Havi says the process of appointing a new TSC chief executive officer was yet to commence. Havi also says he has written to Attorney General Paul Kihara on the issue. “The information we have is that there are plans to renew her five-year contract for a further five years without subjecting the position to a competitive recruitment process,” reads the letter dated June 29.
