 A Meru man has been hospitalised with burns on his face after his drunk wife scalded him with hot water following a domestic quarrel. Stephen Mwenda, 40, said he had disagreed with his wife over earnings from their casual jobs before she poured hot water on him. The man had demanded that the wife accounts for the cash they earned. The two have had domestic wrangles but it has never escalated to the levels that threaten another's person's life, Mwenda said. The incident happened at Kianjai market in Tigania West. "I came home from my manual job and gave her some money for shopping. She bought the necessary foodstuff but came home drunk. We then quarrelled. She boiled the water outside on our Jiko. I didn't know what it was meant for but she threw the boiling water on my face. She also burnt my clothes. I am in pain,” he said. Neighbours Edward Mutuma and Jaxt Mark who rushed the victim to Meru Level 5 Hospital condemned the act and demanded justice. "If it was a woman, so many tongues could be denouncing this satanic action. Men are no longer considered as important creatures. Women receive government money but men do not. We need a boy child rights defender agency because reports show many men are beaten, some even castrated but keep quiet to avoid stigma. Men are dying like insects because of women,” Mutuma said. Area chief David Nabea said he got a report that Mwenda was burnt with hot water by his wife and that he was struggling at his home. “We came with officers and found him in a bad situation. They have been in frequent fights but not to this extent. I had advised him to be extra vigilant because his wife had shown she could do any crime. She has been an illicit brew manufacturer. We have jailed her not once,” Nabea said. Nabea said they are waiting for Mwenda to heal before he records a statement so that the woman is arrested.  Edited by P.O
