Tourism CS Najib Balala has reduced park entry fees for Kenyans and International visitors by 50 percent. This means that instead of paying Sh300 to visit parks, you will pay Sh150 only. Speaking on Thursday, Balala also announced a moratorium for free rent for all lodges in Kenya Wildlife Parks. This is together with a 50 percent reduction fee for film makers who are normally charged by KWS when they film documentaries in the parks. All the three measures apply from 1st of July 2020 to 30th June 2021. More to follow
