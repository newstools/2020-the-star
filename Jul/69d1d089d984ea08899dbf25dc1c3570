Singer Chris Kaiga and Kahu$h have teamed up to release 'Mastingo'. In Nairobi slang, Stingo means style, “Like that’s my style that’s my stingo. That’s how we do” explains Chris. The video has cool dance moves. Speaking about the song, Chris said it marks the first of many collabos with Kahu$h. "I am so excited we could link up. 'Mastingo' is a song for all our fans, hope you all vibe to it. I also want to credit Roya Entertainment for connecting us for this collaboration and making this possible,” he said. His message to fans is that they can enjoy the song wherever they are. Chris is known for 'Zimenice', 'Niko On' and 'Chain Chain', while Kahu$h has been riding high with his banger 'Mi Siwezi', following the release of his EP ‘Trial and Error’ (2019) and album ‘Niko’ (2020).
