A Mombasa man who threw himself off Nyali Bridge into the Indian Ocean had expressed fear for his life, the Star has learned. Hassan Kirogu committed suicide on Tuesday morning and mystery still surrounds what might have pushed his death. Family members who didn’t want to be named said unknown people had been trailing him and he was worried for his life. Some sources said that he might have been an al Shabaab returnee and that associates were stalking him after he turned over a new leaf. But Coast DCI boss Washington Njiiru and an Anti Terror Police Unit (ATPU) police told the Star they could not confirm the allegations. However, the reports have been given weight by the fact that unknown people have warned the family not to speak about Kirogu's death. Meanwhile, police have rubbished claims that he is the man seen demanding pay from his boss while armed with a panga on a video that has gone viral on social media. A postmortem report at Coast General Hospital mortuary showed that he died from drowning. While documents show that he hails from Juja, Kiambu county, family members say he had been living with his wife in Bamburi in Mombasa. He also stayed in Mpeketoni where his mother lives. About five people have recorded statements at Urban police station. “The links with terror claims didn’t come out as they recorded statements but the mother said the son had been mentally disturbed for some time,” a police officer privy to the matter said.
