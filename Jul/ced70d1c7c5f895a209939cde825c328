Police in Embu are looking for two suspects after the body of a businessman who had reported threats to his life was found dead along a road. Police commander Daniel Rukunga told the press on Thursday that Dennis Mawira was murdered on the night of June 30. He said Mawira worked in Embu town where he ferried gas cylinders for customers on his motorcycle after refilling them. On Monday, Mawira went to Embu police station to record a statement that his life was under threat but was referred to Itabua station. He said his phone had been stolen by the people he claimed were after his life but he did not give out their identity, the police boss said. Rukunga said they have started investigations promising that the suspects will be brought to book. Itabua assistant chief Sammy Njagi said he was alerted by residents who came across the body in a pool of blood. Njagi said the residents, on moving closer, saw serious injuries on the body and informed him before he informed the police. The body was taken to Embu Level 5 Teaching and Referral Hospital Mortuary. Edited by R.Wamochie
