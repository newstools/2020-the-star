Residents of Nyeri are set to receive better health services following the commissioning of a new ICU unit and CT scan at PCEA Tumutumu Hospital. Hospital administrator Kinyua Mukindia said the CT scan equipment cost at least Sh35 million which was raised internally. The ICU cost Sh27 million excluding the oxygen plant. The cash for the ICU was raised by local and international donors. Mukindia spoke during the commissioning of the new ICU and CT scan unit. "The need for these projects could not have come at a better time after the hospital marked her 110th birthday since inception,"Â  he said. The hospital is currently prioritising the cancer diagnostic centre, which will be operational by the end of the year. Also being prioritised is the endoscopy and colonoscopy tower which is at the concept stage while laparoscopic surgeries, which focuses on examining organs inside the abdomen, are already being done at the hospital. While speaking on behalf of donors, Madison Life Assurance Company managing director Githua Ngaruiya said the new facility will go a long way in uplifting health services in Nyeri and the neighbouring counties. Ngaruiya, whose group donated Sh500,000 for the new equipment, challenged the hospital to continue working closely with Mathari Hospital, noting that the close collaboration between the two largest hospitals in Nyeri county had helped in dealing with complicated health problems. He said Madison Group has for the last 18 years been partnering with PCEA, which runs Tumutumu Hospital. He said the group is committed to assisting the hospital in offering high-quality medical services to more people in Nyeri and neighbouring counties. Edited by A.N
