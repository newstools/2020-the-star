Taita artiste Dennis Manja, alias B Classic, is back with another single, #Yakikukataa, a song that speaks of a one-sided relationship. He says the song is about being in love with someone who does not appreciate you, despite all that you do. “Tired of fighting, he gives up on love and ends it all, hence the title #Yakikukataa,” B Classic said. He is the first artiste to be signed by Champion Studio. B Classic was raised by a guardian, a Somali woman who took him in after being neglected by his mother at a tender age. He has graced notable stages across East Africa, with top acts such as Sudi Boy, Ally B and Jua Cali, among many other stars.
