A man was on Tuesday evening fatally shot by forest officers in Kipsigon in Mt Elgon subcounty while collecting firewood for sale. Daniel Kibet, 23, was a father of two. His father, John Kaye, said his son was shot in the chest by three forest officers on Tuesday at 4pm. He died while being taken to Bungoma Referral Hospital. “My son was shot by the forest officers who did not mind asking what he was doing,” he said. Mt Elgon subcounty has poor infrastructure, especially during the rainy season, which makes it difficult for residents to reach health facilities for the emergency services. "Because of the severe injuries and bleeding, we decided to take the patient to Bungoma County Referral Hospital, since we know there are theatre services there," Kaye said. The grieving father said Kibet was the family breadwinner and the forest officers should have arrested him instead of shooting him. Deputy county commissioner Wesley Koech said Kibet was shot during a confrontation between forest officers and suspected loggers in the forest. He said a forest officer also sustained injuries while struggling to arrest the suspected loggers. The officer was treated and discharged. "On Tuesday evening there were confrontations in the forest and a suspected logger was shot dead, one escaped and four others were detained at Kopsiro police post," he said. Job Bwonya, the executive director of Western Kenya Human Rights Watch,  condemned the incident and assured the family that he would follow up to ensure the culprits were apprehended. Human rights officers and family members of Kibet are camping at Kipsgon police station to demand justice. Edited by A.N
