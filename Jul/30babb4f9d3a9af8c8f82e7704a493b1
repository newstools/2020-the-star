Athletics Kenya Nyanza South chairman Peter Angwenyi has expressed concern over the deplorable state of playing grounds in Kisii and Nyamira counties. Angwenyi also raised the red flag over the  encroachment and grabbing of some of the playing grounds in the two counties. “I want to make a special request the two county governments and national government to move with speed and secure the public playing grounds,” he said. The AK official noted that most playing grounds in the two counties are in a pathetic state and challenged Kisii Governor James Ongwae and his Nyamira counterpart to allocate funds for the rehabilitation. He cited venues like Riosiri, Nyanturago, Nyamache, Sameta, Nyamarambe, Nyamaiya, Ensoko and Ekerenyo among those under land grabbers threat. Angwenyi also appealed to the Kisii County Government to rehabilitate the Cardinal Otunga High School, Mosocho’s running track which is currently in a bad shape. “Cardinal Otunga is the only school with a standard marram running track in the country. However, it’s in bad shape due to negligence and county should assist in rehabilitating it so that our athletes who can’t access Gusii Stadium can train there,” said Angwenyi. Angwenyi also asked Governor Nyagarama to speed up works at Manga Stadium and ensure it’s done to required standards. “The construction started in 2014 but the contractor has not covered much ground. We want this facility completed because we don’t have a standard 400m running track in Nyamira currently,” Angwenyi noted. “We are impressed with the works done at Gusii Stadium and we appeal to the county government to install a tartan track,” concluded Angwenyi.
