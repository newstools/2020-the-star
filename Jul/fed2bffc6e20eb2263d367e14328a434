Officials from the National Environment Management Authority have arrested a landlord for directing waste from his rental houses to the Nairobi River. The landlord is alleged to have been discharging waste into the Kirichwa Kubwa River in Dagoretti. The authority has been cracking down on individuals and businesses polluting the river. On Wednesday, Nema began inspecting establishments along Kirichwa Kubwa River following orders from Environment CS Keriako Tobiko. Nema acting director general Mamo Mamo said they will shut down culpable establishments and prosecute their owners. Nema has asked the public to report cases of pollution and aid in efforts to rehabilitate the river. On Monday, Tobiko and Nema officials took part in a cleanup of a section of the Nairobi River at the Michuki Park.
