Travel restrictions will soon be lifted following the launch of the Tourism and Travel, Health and Safety Protocols. Interior CS Fred Matiang'i on Wednesday said the country is now safe for travel resumption. "Kenya is ready for travel. Kenyans should know that," he said. Speaking during a meeting with other tourism stakeholders, Matiang'i said the country will continue to provide security for both locals and foreign travelers to curb the risk of accelerated infections. "It's now a reality that the virus could become endemic and we must all be prepared to live with it and resume normalcy under the prevailing circumstances as global efforts to find a vaccine continues," he said. Matiang'i reiterated that the sector continues to be among top priority in the government measures to restore the country's economy. "We can't sit back, play dead and wait for some magic so we can begin to live normally. There is no country that is an example of what we ought to be doing. Therefore we have to learn for ourselves," he said. His sentiments were echoed by Health Cs Mutahi Kagwe who said Kenyans need to learn to live with the virus. In April, the government suspended all international travel in a raft of measures to control virus spread. Consequently, major events across sectors including hospitality, design, sports, technology among others were cancelled to stem the spread of the disease.
