The High Court has temporarily suspended cuts effected by MCAs to the Kirinyaga county budget estimates for 2020-21. Justice Weldon Korir said the Kirinyaga County Appropriation Bill 2020 shall not be published until a case filed by the executive is heard and determined. The judge further directed the Controller of Budget not to authorise withdrawals from the County Revenue Fund based on the estimates passed on June 30. The court also forbid the National Treasury from authorising withdrawals from the fund through the Integrated Financial Management System. The Kirinyaga administration moved to court under a certificate of urgency after MCAs passed the estimates. The county assembly and its speaker were listed as respondents. Through Advocate Salome Muhia, the county government says the assembly illegally made changes to the County Fiscal Strategy Paper when passing the estimates. It says the assembly did not consider the views of Finance county executive Moses Migwi before altering his version of the CFSP. (edited by o. owino)
