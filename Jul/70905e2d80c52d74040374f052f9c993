Residents of Bunyala North in Busia will get relief from water shortages after the county allocated Sh16 million to supply the commodity in the area. Scores of residents from Namalo and Nambengele have been fetching water from a nearby dam while others from River Nzoia almost five kilometres away. Bunyala North Ward MCA Fred Musirimba said residents had given first priority to the project during a public participation forum held at Mudembi Trading Centre. "The water project once completed would be a big relief to residents who have been facing acute water shortage," Musirimba said. The contractor will lay pipes and construct water kiosks at strategic points for easy access. The Ward Development Fund committee has also spearheaded the installation of solar-powered boreholes in areas far from rural access roads. "Before this solar-powered borehole was built here, we used to trek or cycle all the way to Mudembi Trading Centre, five kilometres away to draw water," a resident told the Star. Julius Onyango, a resident of Mumonyi village in Mudembi Sub location commended Musirimba and the county government for the water project.
