Fast-rising gospel singer Sifa Favour is back with another single, 'Mshindi', a song about winning. The song is aimed at inspiring people who feel they have hit rock bottom during these times. Speaking about the song, he said, “I have seen so many Christians go through rejection, depression and some end up committing suicide. This song is to give hope and urge them not give up on God as He is able. “I hope this song will minister to all of us, especially those who are dealing with various illnesses. Uur God remains the winner, just trust in Him.” Sifa, who was once a street boy in Nandi Hills, is also the founder of a Street Feeding and Rehabilitation programme that feeds and provides necessities for street children. He mixes this advocacy with spreading the gospel to those in the streets.
