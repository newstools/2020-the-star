There are fears of an outbreak of Malaria in Tana River following floods that displaced more than 48,000 people in the county. Reports indicate that the number of cases is rising by the day and residents fear to seek medical attention thinking they will be tested for coronavirus. Interior Chief Administrative Secretary Hussein Dado, who has been on a tour of the county, said there are also fears of an outbreak of cholera and other water-borne diseases among those living in camps. Speaking in Tana Delta, he said the outbreaks are also feared in Lamu West, Garissa, Tana North and Western Kenya, which were all affected by floods. He urged residents to seek treatment warning that malaria kills. "After the floods as is normal with Tana River, there will be a very serious outbreak of malaria," he said. Dado said already, people have started showing signs of malaria, warning that it kills even more than Covid-19 which they are afraid to be tested for. "Not everything is corona, there are other diseases that have been with us that are more dangerous." The CAS urged the affected counties to set up mobile clinics in the camps. So far, he said, floods are subsiding and people will soon return to rebuild their homes. He said the government would do its part but appealed to humanitarian organisations and well-wishers to also intervene and help in the reconstruction. Dado said the biggest challenge faced by the victims is rebuilding the houses and crops which were submerged. The most affected areas in the county include Tana Delta and the upper Tana, Dado said, urging counties to monitor the areas using boats in case of any outbreaks. Edited by R.Wamochie
