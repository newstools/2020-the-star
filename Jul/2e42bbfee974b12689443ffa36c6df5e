Tanzanian singer Zuhura Kopa, aka Zuchu, was left in tears after President John Pombe Magufuli stretched his hand to greet her. This happened over the weekend, when Magufuli invited different artistes for lunch after he launched a campaign to run for presidency for another term. Zuchu later took to Instagram on Monday, saying meeting the President was a dream come true. "My mother always told me patience is key. These are the fruits of patience if today the President knows me. I thank God for a loving President who values everyone. "Dreams do come true, believe it. I want to encourage young girls that don't know when they are going to make it in life, I want to tell you that your day is coming, do not give up. "Three months ago, I wouldn't believe that I would meet the President. This is unforgettable." The Tanzanian general elections are set for October 25. Other artistes invited to the event include Diamond Platnumz, Ali Kiba, Harmonize, Mbosso, Billnass, Lava Lava and Shetta. Zuchu was signed under Diamond Platnumz' record label WCB early this year. Since then, she has released a couple of hits, among them 'Wana', which has gained millions of views on YouTube. She is set to release her debut EP, "I AM Zuchu' this month. Zuchu is the lastborn of legendary Taarab singer Khadija Kopa. She is the second female artiste under WCB after Diamond's half-sister Queen Darleen.
