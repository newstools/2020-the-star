Universities across the world have moved their courses online due to the pandemic, and this is set to impact students who were hoping to study abroad later this year. That's because those foreign students planning to study in the US will not be allowed to stay in the country if their universities have moved classes fully online, unless they switch to a course with in-person tuition. The students may also transfer to a different college that offers in-person teaching. The US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency said students could face deportation if they do not comply with the rules. Large numbers of foreign students travel to the US every year and they are a significant source of revenue for universities as many pay full tuition.
