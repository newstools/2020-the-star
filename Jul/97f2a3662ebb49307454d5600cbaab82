Mathira MP Rigathi Gachagua has welcomed the reopening of churches, saying  they will play a major role in guiding boys and girls to prevent teenage pregnancies. He said though children need to be talked to by their parents, the church also helps to mentor them. “Once the parents talk to them, these children always like hearing an alternative voice and that alternative voice we have entrusted to the church,” the MP said. He said the church will also help a lot in talking about the guidelines put in place to prevent the spread of Covid-19. “The church leaders have a lot of credibility and people trust, obey and listen to them. So the government should partner with them so that every Sunday they continue reminding churchgoers about the protocols,” he said. The lawmaker spoke at Mathira Technical and Vocational College in his constituency on Monday when he distributed over 4,000 revision books to KCPE candidates from private and public schools. The books were prepared at a cost of Sh2 million from the Mathira NG-CDF kitty. The books were given to the director of education, and chairman of teachers’ organisations, teachers and education officials who looked at them and were satisfied that they had the right content. Rigathi said grassroots leaders will work in tandem with national government administrators to distribute the books to candidates in their homes. “We are hoping that parents will guide them and will supervise them so that they continue revising.” He said the books will keep students busy until schools reopen. Parent Maureen Nyokabi said children have not been following classes online due to lack of electronic gadgets such as computers, phones, radios, televisions or even internet connectivity. Abigail Wanjiku, a candidate from Kiriko Primary School, thanked the MP, saying the books will help them revise for their exams. She said they left most of their books in school.  Edited by A.N
