One police officer in Kiambu county has died of Covid-19, two more have tested positive and six more are in quarantine. A least 36 remandees are in quarantine. "Currently, the situation is bad," Kiambu police commander Ali Nuno said as he disclosed the numbers. Most police stations in the county are overwhelmed by the many people in cells, some of whom should be in remand prison, he said. "We do not have anywhere to take people when we arrest them. Some of the people in our custody are Covid-19 positive," he said. "I have two officers who have been admitted at Tigoni Covid-1centre. I also have 36 remandees who are quarantined at Thika Medical Centre," Nuno said. He said many people arrested cannot afford cash bail, so officers must decide whether to book them into police stations or let them go. “I appeal to the commissioner general of Prisons to create a quarantine centre within the prisons because I do not have the funds to feed those in our police cells,” Nuno said. Disguised as a mechanic, Nuno came face-to-face with the extent to which bars and restaurants in the county are violating the 9pm to 4am Covid-19 curfew. He toured recreational centres and parks where people were not wearing face masks or observing social distancing. “I want elders in Kiambu county to understand clearly that if we continue with the trend, things will get out of hand. Please, let's all come on board and stop taking things lightly,” he said. Nuno called upon the county government to revoke the licences of bars and social joints that violate curfew and other Covid-19 containment measures. "I am advocating  the closure of all bars. Eateries are also misusing their licences to sell alcohol discreetly," Nuno said. (Edited by V. Graham)
