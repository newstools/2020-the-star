 The Luhya nation must be in government for them to attract development projects in Western region, Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya has said. “For those who are in the Opposition and they are telling people they are going to bring development, they are lying to you,” Oparanya said in Luanda, Vihiga county on Friday. He alluded to his first time in Parliament when he was elected to represent the people of Butere constituency in Parliament. “I was in the Opposition and it was until when we joined government via the nusu mkate when I started registering development," the governor said referring to the grand coalition government formed in 2008. "So let nobody lie to you that they will bring development while in the Opposition.” Oparanya who is also the chairman of the Council of Governors was speaking at Emuli village at the home of the late Nehemiah Ochiel. Ochiel was the father of Sikalo Ochiel who is the ANC chairman for Vihiga county. Oparanya urged residents of Vihiga not to repeat the mistake of choosing the Opposition again. "Central, Northeastern and Rift Valley are often the first beneficiaries of national government goodies and because we are rigid in the Opposition, we are the last to be considered," he said. Political parties are just like Matatus’ on the road, once you have reached the destination you have no business with it, Oparanya said. "We only use political parties to fight for leadership in this country and once elections are over, we remain as Kenyans not ODM, Jubilee or ANC or Ford Kenya." Political parties should not make us behave like antagonist groups that cannot share from the same plate, the governor said. "That is being stupid." He said they have started a journey that is not for ODM, Jubilee, ANC, Ford Kenya or Wiper but for all Luhya people. “Whether we like it or not, we must be in the government come 2022 despite your political party,” Oparanya said.
