Two IT officers working for Sarova Stanley hotel will have to take another plea after the court allowed the prosecution to amend the charges. Patrick Ambongo and Janet Magoma were charged with unauthorised interception of CCTV footage. They reportedly lost their jobs after they were charged. Senior principal magistrate Benard Ochoi on Thursday gave an order allowing the DPP to amend the charges following their successful application. Defence lawyers led by Dastan Omari had argued that the prosecution had not stated why they wanted the charges amended and felt it was because of requesting to be supplied with statements of President Uhuru Kenyatta and former PM Raila Odinga. “The intention to amend the charges is because they want to remove Uhuru and Raila,” Omari said. The magistrate also ordered the prosecution to supply the defence with the original clip that captured the entourage of the two leaders before the mention date. Last week, the court gave the prosecution seven days to record statements from President Kenyatta and Raila. Uhuru and Raila are alleged to be complainants in a case in which the two suspects are charged with unauthorised interception of computer data contrary to the Computer Misuse and Cybercrimes Act. "We had requested statements from the President and Raila who were alleged to have been in the entourage but to date, those statements have not come," Omari had told the court. Raila was allegedly captured touring the CBD with Uhuru in the footage on June 2. It is alleged that the two accused persons on June 2 at around 8.20pm intercepted CCTV footage capturing the entourage along Kenyatta Avenue. The two are out on Sh10,000 bail or Sh300,000 bond each. The case will be mentioned on July 24 for plea taking. Edited by R.Wamochie
