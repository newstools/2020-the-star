How many times have you been charged in court? Well, some seem to have appeared so many times that magistrates even know them. So, a magistrate caused laughter in a Nairobi court after he acquitted a man charged with creating disturbance and told him he expects him back on the dock. "Young man, I have forgiven you but I know you will come back. Go home and see you again," he said. In a rejoinder the man said, “Goodbye, and good to see you, sir”. **** They say you are addressed by how you dress. This is exactly what happened when a lawyer appeared in court in a really tight trouser that simply exposed “the inner parts of the bread”.

"I am sorry your honour, I will not do this again," she responded. “Yes, please. Don't just try to put on decently Ok?” the agitated magistrate said. "Yes sir, I am sorry" she said. The magistrate later gave her the go ahead to represent her client. **** A man who carried a thief on his motorcycle has been detained for 14 days as detectives try to conclude their investigations. However, the man gave one condition before giving in to the investigating officer’s idea of detaining him: That if the investigations prove that he is innocent, he’ll be compensated for the days he’ll be in custody. "If at all it comes out that am innocent, I need to be paid for the days I have been in the police cells," he told a Nairobi magistrate. "So you simply want compensation?" asked the magistrate. The man said he was in dire need of that compensation
