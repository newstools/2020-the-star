Gender Chief Administrative Secretary Rachel Shebesh has accused some health workers of frustrating the fight against Female Genital Mutilation. The government is determined to eradicate the cultural practice by 2022 and has succeeded in forcing circumcisers out of the practice. But Shebesh said some professional medics have replaced them. “The health workers have been secretly carrying on the practice in public and private hospitals in cahoots with parents of the girls and thus contributing to the delay in ending the vice,” the CAS said. Shebesh spoke at the Kenya School of Government, Embu Campus on Wednesday during a meeting with national administrative officers, senior security officers and elders among others. She said the government will punish any medic who will be found abetting the practice. Shebesh said the anti-FGM law provides for sentences against anybody who plays any role that is responsible for the continuity of the practice including people who fail to report on FGM activities and even any Kenyan who do in a foreign country thinking he is secure. She said they are carrying out a campaign to ensure the practice is gone by first concentrating on counties which have high prevalence including Embu where 30.7 per cent practice it. She was accompanied by Embu county commissioner Abdullahi Galgalo and Anti-FGM chair person Agnes Pareiyo. Shebesh said there is no room for compromise in the fight against the practice. Pareiyo said the prevalence of the practice in Embu is 30.7 per cent but the government is out to ensure it goes to zero cases. She said the fight has taken momentum by including law enforcers in the fight. Galgalo said his administration is committed to ensuring the practice is stoped in Embu by 2022. Edited by R.Wamochie
