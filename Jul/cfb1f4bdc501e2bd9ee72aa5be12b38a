The acting secretary general of the Kenya Medical Practitioners Pharmacists and Dentists union Dr Chibanzi Mwachonda has tested positive for Covid-19. In a statement on Friday, Mwachonda said he was infected while dispensing hisÂ  official duties and is currently in stable condition and under self-isolation. "My family is safe, contact tracing and testing of all close contacts is ongoing," he said. The secretary general said the disease is in the widespread community transmission phase and every Kenyan is at risk but that should not be a cause for fear or stigma to affected individuals or their families. "The high number of recoveries gives us hope that we shall as a nation, win this war against the invisible enemy upon us," Mwachonda said. He urged all Kenyans to adhere to the Ministry of Health Prevention Measures of putting on masks, washing of hands and avoiding unnecessary movement and gatherings in order to reduce the spread of Covid-19 to ensure flattening of the curve as a country. "To my colleagues on the frontline, we soldier on in the service to humanity cognizant of the great risk of infection to all of us," Mwachonda added. He again urged the government to provide utmost support to the healthcare frontline soldiers by providing adequate and quality PPEs and unveil the Welfare Package on Work Injury Benefits and Comprehensive Medical Treatment.
