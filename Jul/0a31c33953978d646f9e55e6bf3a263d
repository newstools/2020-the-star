Domestic violence perpetrated by women against their husbands in Kiambu county is on the rise, a lobby has said. Voice of Men and Children (Vomec) chairman James Njenga said the trend was worrying since most men do not report the cases. However, those who know about Vomec seek advice from the group after undergoing domestic violence. Njenga, a domestic violence survivor, revealed that every week, between two and five men report cases of violence against them to his office in Chunga Mali trading centre in Limuru constituency. “Husband battering is a rarely discussed phenomenon because there is a strong stigma against being beaten by a woman. Men feel bad, weak, wasted and even shy. We have helped so many men to approach these issues with confidence, find solutions,” he said. Njenga, who was accompanied by his secretary Josphat Njagi and treasurer Cyrus Koimburi, urged couples to seek advice from counsellors as a way of reducing violence. Edited by A.N
