Nairobi Metropolitan Service Director General Mohammed Badi has dismissed claims of “militarisation” on the capital. Addressing the media on Tuesday at KICC, the Major General said out of 7,500 staff at the NMS only six were from the military and seconded to the new outfit by the Kenya Defence Council. “We did not propose to come here or came by ourselves. Each and every officer in the NMS has been seconded, “he said. Badi further explained that the rest of the officers were recruited by the Public Service Commission “If only six of the 7,500 personnel are military officers, how do you call that militarisation?” He questioned. In May, the Kenya Defence Council, the apex body of the Kenya Defence Forces, approved the secondment of six military officers to join NMS DG Major General Mohammed Badi’s administration for two years. The army men include Brig F Leuria, Maj JV Mbithi, Maj AN Nyakundi, Maj JK Njoroge from the Kenya Army, Lt JK Biomdo and Maj AL Musoma from the Kenya Air Force. However, the move was not warmly welcomed by some who termed the move as a “militarisation” of Nairobi. Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko through his Spokesperson Ben Mulwa criticised the government's move to introduce active military officers in regular public service. “We wonder about the intention of the national government and what it wants to achieve through the NMS. There are many public servants who have been seconded to the NMS," he said. Elgeyo Marakwet senator Kipchumba Murkomen likened the move to militarising a civilian government and said it went against the spirit of the Constitution. “The militarisation of a civilian county government is the worst form of violation and overturn of our Constitution. Nairobi County has been militarised. It is no longer a civilian government,” Murkomen said.
