Residents of Limuru want to build bumps on Ndeiya road to reduce accidents. Salome Wanja said she has started lobbying residents to form a committee to enable them raise money to buy sand, cement and pay labour. She spoke at Mutarakwa after a speeding matatu collided head on with a tipper lorry that was transporting sand, killing two people on Wednesday. Police said the matatu was heading to Ndeiya, but on arrival at Mutarakwa hill, the driver lost control and he could not negotiate a junction that passes across the road. The lorry, which was moving from Maai Mahiu to Nairobi, overturned leaving its driver and loader injured. Police said a passenger of the matatu died on the spot while the other died while receiving treatment at Limuru Nursing Home. Limuru subcounty police commander Joseph Ireri said 10 people who survived the accident are receiving treatment at the facility. Ndeiya MCA Gideon Gachara said he will write a protest letter to Kenya Rural Road Authority to erect bumps on the road. Gachara urged Kerra to visit the road and identify all areas where accidents normally happen so the road can be marked properly. "This road requires bumps. It passes in villages. I will be writing to Kerra so that they can visit this place and see where bumps area needed, road marks and even sign boards" the Kiambu assembly majority leader said. The wreckage of the vehicles were towed to Tigoni police station while the bodies were taken to Tigoni Hospital mortuary. Wanja said the most common areas where accidents happen are Mutarakwa, Tiekunu, Royal, Boloti and Â Thigio. Edited by R.Wamochie
