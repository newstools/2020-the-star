 Uasin Gishu has received a boost in the fight against Covid-19 after the county got support from Amref. Dr Bernard Langat, theÂ  Programme Director for HIV, TB, Malaria and non communicable diseases at Amref, said Uasin Gishu is among nine counties that will benefit from the support targeting Covid-19 isolation centres and frontline health workers. Speaking at the county headquarters in Eldoret when he presented a donation of Personal Protective Equipment, Langat said the support which amounts to Sh20 million per county will also focus on addressing emerging issues like a drastic drop in number of patients seeking treatment in hospital due to coronavirus fears. He said the support will compliment other donors. Uasin Gishu Deputy Governor Daniel Chemno called for more support from donors to enhance the capacity to test more people. Chemno said there is a likelihood that there are more positive coronavirus cases in the county than what the Ministry of Health has confirmed due to low testing capabilities. The county has recorded about 100 Covid-19 cases, majority of who are long distance truck drivers.  Edited by P.O
