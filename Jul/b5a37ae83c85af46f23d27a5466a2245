A garbage collector hired to dump a woman's body at a school in Umoja has been charged with being accessory to murder. Francis Gichanga allegedly committed the offence on May 30, Milimani senior principal magistrate Bernard Ochoi was told on Wednesday. He denied the charge. Gichanga is said to have dumped the dismembered body of an unidentified woman in Tumaini Primary School ground in Umoja. The woman was allegedly murdered by suspected serial killer David Migwi. Migwi has been charged with her murder. The particulars of the case are that Gichanga knowingly assisted Migwi to escape punishment. His lawyer, Kinyanjui Mbuthia, pleaded for lenient bond terms. The court released him on Sh200,000 bond or Sh100,000 bond. The case will be mentioned on July 6. Migwi was on June 25 charged with the murder of the unknown woman after her dismembered body was retrieved from a house he had previously rented, and dumped in Umoja. He denied the offence before Justice Grace Ngenye also of Milimani law courts. The Directorate of Criminal Investigations opposed his release on either bail or bond. Investigating officer John Kanampiu said the woman's body had been dumped by a garbage collector hired by Migwi’s landlady, Nancy Wanja, and her building's caretaker Nicholas Kimanthi. Wanja and Kimanthi were freed on Sh100,000 bail each. The DCI established that the body was removed from Migwi’s formerly rented house also in Umoja. Migwi is suspected to have killed another unidentified woman he had picked up from a nightclub. Her head, arms and legs were dumped at a dumpsite in Umoja while the torso was spotted by hawkers and motorists wrapped in black polythene sack along Landhies Road near Nacico Plaza. The two cases will be consolidated.  - mwaniki fm
