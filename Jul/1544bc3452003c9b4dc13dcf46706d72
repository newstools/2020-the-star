Mandera residents have welcomed the lifting of lockdown measures by President Uhuru Kenyatta on Monday. The President ordered that the cessation of movement into and out of the Nairobi Metropolitan Area, Mombasa and Mandera counties would not be extended. Ibrahim Mohamed said lifting the lockdown would enable residents return to their daily economic activities that were curtailed by the cessation of movement in the region. Mohamed, who works with a local bus company, thanked the government on the new move saying he had been idle. He expressed optimism he would soon catch up and pay pending household bills. “It has been hell on earth for us here in Mandera who depend on transport to sustain our families. It had reached a point where I saw no need to continue living because I had been turned into a pauper since I could no longer provide for my family,” he said. Mohamed was, however, quick to urge Kenyans to adhere to the set measures failure to which lockdown would resume. “I can't imagine another lockdown. It will be disastrous. All I want to ask my fellow Kenyans is to remain disciplined. If it is maintaining social distance in the vehicles as directed let us do that. It is for our own good,” he said. A  cross-section of residents said they would now do business as before and travel to Nairobi and other counties. Mohamed Hussein warned that reopening of Nairobi would increase the rate of infections as many cases have been reported in the capital. He asked residents to observe the Ministry of Health guidelines on preventing new infections. The President in a televised address to the nation eased a raft lockdown measures but extended the night curfew for a further 30 days. Edited by Henry Makori
