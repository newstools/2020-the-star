Vihiga Governor Wilber Ottichilo has finally bowed to pressure from MCAs to reinstate Medical Services chief officer Arnold Mamadi. The MCAs urged Ottichilo to reinstate Mamadi so he can help the county in fighting the spread of coronavirus. Health executive Amos Kutwa confirmed to the Star on the phone that Mamadi had been reinstated. Mamadi was suspended together with his Public Health's counterpart Clement Manyulu in January this year over irregularities in the hiring of health workers in mid last year. The county had budgeted to recruit 149 health workers but 528 staffers were hired. The hiring of the 528 caught the attention of the governor, leading to the suspension of the duo. After the suspension, Environment chief officer Richard Boiyo was named acting chief officer for Medical Services, while Education chief officer Mary Andienda was appointed to serveÂ as Public Health chief officer.
