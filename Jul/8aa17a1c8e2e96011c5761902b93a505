Police in Marsabit are investigating an incident in which rowdy youths from Kituruni in Marsabit Central allegedly attempted to attack Saku MP Dido Rasso on Saturday. Subcounty police commander Johnson Wachira said nobody was injured during the attack as the MP had just alighted from his vehicle and entered the house of a friend. Wachira said the violent youths then descended on the legislator's brand new Toyota Land Cruiser KCW 712H with stones, damaging it extensively. The police boss added that the MP, who arrived from Nairobi early in the morning, had traveled to Kituruni to console the friend - Jeremiah Nakwar - who lost his father recently. "The MP was in the premises of the friend when the unruly youths emerged and on failing to spot the legislator, they started pelting his vehicle with stones," he said. The vehicle which had all its windows, windscreens and lights damaged was towed to Marsabit police station as investigations began. Speaking to the media after recording a statement at the station, Rasso assured his constituents that he was well and asked them to maintain calm. The MP said the motive of the attack was not known adding that the police were going to shed light on the matter. He asked law enforcement agents to ensure the perpetrators of lawlessness were apprehended and punished. This, he observed, would create an enabling environment for both wananchi, government and other players to engage in development. The incident took place as the National Cohesion and Integration Commission, which has pitched camp in Marsabit for the best part of this week engaged peacebuilding activities for the county.
