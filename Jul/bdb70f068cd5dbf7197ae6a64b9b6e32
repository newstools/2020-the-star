There was a light moment during Senate hearings on Wednesday after Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko asked for a bar. Sonko was seeking an adjournment of the meeting convened to grill him over 2015/16, 2016/17 and 2017/18 audit queries. The county chief told the Senate County Public Accounts and Investments Committee that he did not have documents to submit to the panel to explain the queries. He cited the deed of transfer of the county functions to Nairobi Metropolitan Services and the court case that blocked him from accessing his office or interacting with county staff. But after the hearings, the committee chairman and Kisii senator Sam Ongeri invited the governor for lunch. "By the way governor, I am sorry we did not offer you tea but you are free to join us for lunch which has been served...you can take lunch governor," Ongeri said. Sonko, who had stood up already, sauntered back to his seat accompanied by his lawyers and moved to the microphone. "May be if I can ask Mr. chairman where is the bar...the bar for the Senate," he said amid laughter from other committee members. Ongeri who was now laughing then responded: "There is no bar for the Senate this year." Sonko walked away at the response. The governor was accompanied by among others county attorney Lydia Kwamboka, PA Ben Mulwa, chief of staff Brian Mugo and legal advisor Paul Musyimi. The committee is currently deliberating the "the unique" Nairobi situation before making a ruling. Migori Senator Ochillo Ayacko wanted to know whether the governor had sought the intervention of the courts and DPP on his planned appearance at the Senate Majority Chief Whip Irungu Kang'ata recommended a brief adjournment of the session to allow the committee deliberate the governor's submission before making a final determination. In April, Sonko made international news when he distributed a Covid-19 care package to poor residents which included Hennessy.
