A report by the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics has revealed that at least 14.4 per cent of Kenyans changed their main means of transport out of which 62.2 per cent opted to walk instead of using public transport to avoid contracting Covid-19. The survey on the Socioeconomic Impact of Covid-19 on Households Report by the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics was conducted between May 30 and June 6. The report, released on Thursday, also showed that 19.4 per cent of those who defaulted on their means of transport opted to use bodabodas due to the coronavirus pandemic. According to the report, 26.9 per cent of the nationwide respondents reported that they travelled less often, while 26.4 per cent had no change in travel pattern. Some 16.8 per cent of the individuals indicated that they were unable to travel at all. A total of 59.2 per cent of of Kenyans countrywide have been affected by a change in their cost of travel due to the pandemic. This comes as the public transport industry reported losing up to Sh840 million daily owing to the effects of the virus. Matatu Owners Association chairman Simon Kimutai has previously said that on a normal day, over 70,000 matatus and buses in operation rake in an average Sh15,000. But now, with the government directives on social distancing, workers told to operate from home and the nationwide curfew, the public transport industry has suffered a major blow. On top of running costs including fuel, spare parts, tyres, crew, insurance cover and taxes, matatu and bus operators now have to incur the extra costs of providing hand sanitizer for passengers as well as fumigating the PSVs after every trip. The PSV operators, noted that without any form of government assistance, remaining in the sector had become unreasonable.
