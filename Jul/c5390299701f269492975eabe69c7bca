Muslim faithful gearing to celebrate Idd-ul-Adha on Friday have been told to adhere to Covid-19 protocols, including social distancing. Garissa county commissioner Meru Mwangi said as the faithful celebrate one of the most important festivities in their calendar, they should be wary of the dangers posed by the virus. He spoke to the press on Wednesday when he launched a tree planting exercise within his compound. Traditionally, Muslims congregate to share meals among families and friends during such celebrations. Mwangi, however, said we are living in extraordinary times. “We cannot police each and every individual in their homes. It is your moral responsibility to ensure you observe the Ministry of Health protocols,” Mwangi said. Mwangi further cautioned members of the public against reckless behaviours that include failure to wear face masks and ignoring social distancing. “It is unfortunate that we have individuals who will carry their face mask in their pockets and only retrieve them when they see the police. This disease is not about the police but you,” he said. He further issued a stern warning to bus companies going against the set guidelines of carrying half capacity noting that the government will not hesitate to withdraw their licences. On Kazi Mtaani, the county commissioner said over 4,600 youth have been engaged in all the seven subcounties with Garissa taking the lions' share of 1,500. The project, he said, is aimed at cushioning the youth from informal settlement against the effects of Covid-19 by engaging them in cleaning the streets,  public places and garbage collection among others. He said by the end of the six-month exercise, the youth in Garissa will have received a total of Sh300 million. He urged them to spend the money wisely so that they can better their lives.
