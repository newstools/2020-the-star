The Equity Group Foundation has donated Sh3.8 million worth of Personal Protective Equipment (PPEs) to the Machakos Level 5 hospital. While issuing the donation on Monday, Equity Group Foundation CEO James Mwangi said the foundation is fully committed to supporting health workers in the country to ensure they get all requirements needed to save lives. " I therefore call upon all the medics in the country to continue with the great job they are doing in saving lives and in taking away the pain from our people," said Mwangi. The hospital received three types of PPEs in terms of production where the first level is meant to be used by facilitators in the hospital, the second will be used by people who get in to the wards and the third one is meant for doctors who are directly dealing with infected patients. While addressing the press at the Machakos Level 5 hospital, Mwangi called upon the health workers to give feedback about the PPEs in terms of quality and quantity adding that they were made as per the Ministry of Health and the KEBS set standards. Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua who received the donations emphasized the need to use locally manufactured goods to improve our own and create more job opportunities. "Local manufacturing is a viable enterprise and with the right support, we will completely eliminate importation of products that our people can make, increasing employment opportunities, improving the lives of millions of Kenyans and growing the economy exponentially".
