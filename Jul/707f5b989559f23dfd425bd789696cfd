Kenya Rugby Union (KRU) chairman Oduor Gangla admitted that  uncertainty surrounds the resumption of the sport due to the coronavirus pandemic. While addressing the Annual General Meeting on Wednesday virtually via zoom,  Gangla observed that high level consultations were going on with government but was non-committal on the timelines and if at all they will finish the season. "We are in uncharted waters as far the game is concerned. We don't know when we will resume play but we are talking to government and very soon they will make an announcement on the way forward. I therefore ask the fans and affiliates to be patient” KRU had in April cancelled the entire season but later rescinded the decision following an outcry by clubs. The Kenya Cup, championship and Nationwide had all entered the playoff stage at time of suspension. The Ministry of Sports had early this month set up a committee to work on the 'return to action formula'. KCB chairman Xavier Makuba, who leads the Kenya Cup caucus, is still adamant that the the final three weeks of the season can be played either in August or September. "I believe we have time on our side. Let us wait for the committee on the resumption of sports to give us the way forward and then we adjust accordingly,” added Makuba. KRU treasurer Joshua Aroni said finances of the federation will be hit hard this year due to lack of activities. "Due to the pandemic and the tough financial environment we are operating under , we will have to be very prudent with our resources,” observed Aroni. The Safari Sevens, which is the biggest earner for the union and slated for October, is unlikely to go ahead under the current circumstances. Aroni reported that the union had an income of slightly over Sh215million in the last financial year, a slight drop from the Sh 227m realised in the previous year. At the same time, Aroni informed the AGM that the union's board made a decision to invest Sh45m under a money market investment with the Britam Fund.
