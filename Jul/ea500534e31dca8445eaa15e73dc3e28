Three legislators have warned Nyanza residents against laxity in adhering  to preventive measures in the war on Covid-19, saying a majority of counties lack the capacity to handle many patients. Senators James Orengo of Siaya, Moses Kajwang' of Homa Bay and Rarieda MP Otiende Amollo said on Friday the pandemic may kill many residents should they fail to take personal responsibility in preventing the spread of the virus. They spoke during the burial of former trade unionist Were Ogutu in Karachuonyo constituency. “Covid-19 is killing people even in the most powerful nations in the world. Let’s not cheat ourselves that our counties have the capacity to tackle the disease,” Orengo said. Kajwang’ said Homa Bay county has only 300 beds in hospitals, which does not make it have the capacity to handle Covid-19 patients. “It is not only Homa Bay that is not prepared in the war against the virus, many counties in Nyanza and even across the country, are unable to effectively handle many cases. Comply with WHO guidelines to combat the virus,” Kajwang’ appealed. He likened the level of preparedness to someone who fences a home with aloe vera to prevent entry of a hippopotamus. “Don’t relax from observing measures put in place to prevent the spread of the virus,” he added. MP Amollo accused some Nyanza governors of using social media to popularise their preparedness, yet on things are different on the ground. “We know counties in Nyanza which haven’t met the requirement but on social media, they brag as ready to handle patients with the virus. Let us wear masks and other preventive measures,” the Rarieda MP said. He said the virus is likely to spread more in Kenya after the government lifted restriction of movement in Nairobi and Mombasa.
