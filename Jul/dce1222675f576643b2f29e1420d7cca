Kenya Maritime Authority, Major (Rtd) George Okong’o has resigned from the Director General position. Okong’o who was appointed to the position in October 2018, was a retired Kenya Navy major after serving for 20 years. On Wednesday, Maritime Principal Secretary Nancy Karigithu confirmed that Okong’o has tendered his resignation. “Yes, he (Okong’o) wrote a resignation letter. KMA Commercial Shipping Manager John Omingo is now in acting capacity,” said Karigithu in a phone interview. However, the PS did not give reasons as to why Okong’o resigned. According to insiders, Okong’o might have resigned over the controversy surrounding the construction of the Sh1.8 billion 15-storey KMA complex in Mbaraki area. Okong’o took over the position from George Mc’goye, who served as the acting director general for after the exit of Karigithu in December 2015 to become Maritime and Shipping Affairs PS. KMA was established in June of 2004 as the government agency in charge of maritime affairs, under the Ministry of Transport.
