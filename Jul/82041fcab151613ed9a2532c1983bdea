The Intergovernmental Relations Technical Committee will seek to resolve intra-counties wrangles, CEO Peter Leley has said. Leley said there has been a spike in squabbles between the executive arms of county governments and their assemblies. The CEO said that they shall have the law changed to allow them to intervene where wrangles within the counties exist. On June 19, President Uhuru Kenyatta appointed new members to the committee. They include Angeline Hongo, Perminus Ndimitu, Linet Mavu, Alfred Khangati, John Burugu, Alice Mayaka, Saadia Abdi Kontoma and Wilson ole Pere. The team will undergo an intensive induction ahead of tackling 10 disputes between the national and county governments. Among the pending dispute are those between Nairobi county and the Ministry of Defence, Tharaka Nithi and the Ministry of Interior and Taita Taveta and the ministry of Tourism. In 2018, nearly half of the 47 counties were wrangling over cross-border resources valued at hundreds of billions of shillings. “We shall also finish up the asset register from the defunct local authorities. We already have 30 registers complete; we remain with 17,” Leley said. Once completed, the file will be consolidated, a report written and records handed over to the counties for use. “This comes barely as a function of taking over and handling all residue functions left pending by the defunct transition authority,” the statement said. The team shall oversee the implementation and coordination of the resolutions agreed upon by the President and the CoG about the reopening of the economy currently hampered by Covid-19 pandemic. According to Leley, it incumbent on the new team to fight the perception that IGTRC is a part of the State Department of Devolution. “The team has to abandon the low-key operations, raise the profile of IGRTC through increased public engagements, better media relations and communication,” Burugu, a member, said.
