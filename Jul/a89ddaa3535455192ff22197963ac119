Some Kenyans headed to Jamuhuri grounds on Sunday for prayer services despite the ban church gatherings still being in force. President Uhuru Kenyatta last Monday announced places of worship will be allowed to reopen from July 14 but under strict guidelines. While others gathered at the open Jamuhuri grounds and made surrounding stones and tyres their seats after sessions of worship, others met in rooms, beating their drums as they wore face masks and sang. Churches will only be allowed to accommodate a maximum of 100 congregants. However, some places of worship have opted to remain closed, citing the 'small' number allowed and safety concerns.
