Tanzanian singer Harmonize says fame can kill talent. Harmonize became one of East Africa’s biggest musicians after he joined Diamond’s WCB records a few years ago. He later quit the record and started Konde Gang. Many young people aspire to be famous and a number have gone to great lengths just to get noticed. But Harmonize has a word of caution for his fans. He wrote on Instastories: “Fame can seriously kill your talent. Please remember that.” He added that the lack of awards in the Tanzanian music scene has crippled the industry. Harmonize says talent is now judged based on YouTube views, with many musicians being forced to promote their songs on the video-sharing platform. “In case your video does not make it to a million views in two days then that equates to a bad song. Artistes even go the extra mile of using so much money to release and promote a song including paying sponsors just to get a lot of views on YouTube,” he wrote. “This can really affect someone mentally. I believe Baraza La Sanaa Taifaa can start an award ceremony that will have so much value and respect to our art as musicians. The work put out by artistes is so much and generations need to know that we work hard.” Harmonize will be releasing his second album in November.
