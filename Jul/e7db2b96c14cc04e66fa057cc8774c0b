A vaccine manufacturing plant in Kenya is among 15 Covid-19 recovery projects for priority funding by the Africa Investment Forum. Others include a dairy processing project in Angola, a cotton manufacturing project in Mozambique and a proprietary tele-medicine platform in Nigeria. The forum has identified 15 projects across five sectors for priority funding under its Unified Covid-19 Response costing $3.79 billion (Sh408 billion). The sectors include agriculture and agro-processing, energy, health, ICT and telecoms, industry and trade. President Akinwumi Adesina of the African Development Bank said Africa will emerge from the pandemic and build better and stronger economies. “As partners in the Africa Investment Forum, the premier investment platform for Africa, our gaze must be clear -help Africa reboot its economy,” Adesina said on Friday during a two-day virtual meeting for founding, institutional and knowledge partners. The participants expressed confidence in the continent’s potential to rebound from the  health and economic crises, saying increased and decisive investment  will be the channel for economic recovery post Covid-19. Chinelo Anohu, head and senior director of the Africa Investment Forum, said the forum is not a talking shop. “We are focusing our partners' efforts on bankable deals from the 2018 and 2019 portfolio and new ones in 2020. We are concentrating not just on health but also on other sectors to jump-start recovery across the continent,” she said Deals 'more responsive' to the pandemic are being curated to provide much-needed support to the private sector Collectively, the 15 deals from the forum’s current portfolio will increase the continent’s self-sufficiency and resilience against future shocks.
