Nairobi Senator Johnson Sakaja has resigned as chairman of the Senate Adhoc Committee on Covid-19. Speaking on Monday outside the Kilimani Police Station after recording a statement, Sakaja apologised to Kenyans for flouting the government's curfew orders. "I take responsibility for having flouted the Covid-19 rules. I was outside my home past 9 pm. It is regrettable but all of us make mistakes," he said. The senator said he had decided to step down from his position in the committee in order to set an example and take responsibilityÂ for his actions. The lawmaker said he will abide by the law and had already paid his cash bail for his actions. "No one is above the law. I will be appearing in court tomorrow and the entire course of the law will be followed. If it is to be fined or to be jailed, the law will apply to me just like every other Kenyan," Sakaja said. The senator said he had decided to take responsibility and urged Kenyans to follow the government's directives on curbing the spread of Covid-19. However, the senator took issue with the conduct of police officers after the incident claiming that they intimidated his family. "The whole of Saturday and Sunday, more than 50 officers brandishing guns have been at my residence and yet am not a fugitive," he said. "My children have not committed any crime. Why come and intimidate them with guns? I am not on the run." The senator was arrested on Saturday at a Kilimani bar for flouting the government's curfew orders. Sakaja was arrested alongside three others after they were found drinking outside the pub at around 1 am. While in custody, the senator was asked to be given a free bond but he refused to leave the cell. The police later said Sakaja threatened to transfer all the officers involved in his arrest within 24 hours.
