Kenya Covid 19 Fund Board Medical committee will take responsibility if the locally manufactured personal protective equipment (PPEs) donated by the board and Equity Foundation to health facilities fail. The Covid Board Health Committee chairman, also Equity CEO, James Mwangi, on Friday said medics have confirmed the locally manufactured PPEs are of better quality compared to the imported ones. “The feedback we are receiving from the medical staff is that they are superior in quality than the imported PPEs the country has been consuming,” he said. Mwangi spoke at Engineer County Hospital in Kinangop, Nyandarua, where he donated the PPEs. He said the items constitute the first phase of the equipment being distributed to medical facilities across the country, which are worth Sh230 million. A further order of Sh400 million has been placed to ensure enough supply is sustained owing to increasing number of Covid-19 patients. Sh1.4 billion has been earmarked for manufacturing and maintaining the supply. Mwangi said local manufacturing has seen the country stop importing PPEs, gain self-sufficiency and for export, and create thousands of jobs in the process. “I am happy to report that we have received the first order of Sh100 million to export PPEs to the Democratic Republic of Congo. The local manufacturing has so far created 3,700 jobs," he said. He said the donations to medical facilities are a way of appreciating the front line soldiers and associate with the great work they are doing to the society. Evidence, he said, is increasingly showing that even after recovery the virus may be leaving long lasting impact on the core body organs including the heart, the liver, kidney and the lungs.
