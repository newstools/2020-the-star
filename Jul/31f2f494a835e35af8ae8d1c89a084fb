An aviation maintenance firm has sued the Kenya Pipeline Company on allegations of malpractice in the award of tenders for repairs of two helicopters at Wilson Airport. Lady Lori says the award of the tenders to M/S Helint Aviation Ltd and M/S Level Up Ltd is illegal and should be quashed. The firms got the tenders on February 4. The firm says that the procurement process was manipulated and the courts ought to guard public interest in the matter. “As a public body, nothing would satisfy the public interest better than the respondent adhering to the law on procurement and its objectives,” the company said in the petition. The helicopters owned and operated by KPC have been grounded for the last one and a half years. A request by Lady Lori for review of the tender was struck out by the Public Procurement Administrative Review Board (PPARB) on March 19. “The ex-parte applicant, therefore, finds itself in a position where it has a legitimate grievance and no recourse to the PPARB for a redress of its grievances,” Ian Mimano, a director of Lady Lori said. PPARB said Lady Lori failed to demonstrate loss and the fact that the Board had the powers to determine the case. The case will come up for hearing on September 22. KPC and the two firms are yet to file their responses.
