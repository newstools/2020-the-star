Police in Bungoma are pursuing a man who allegedly burnt his daughter’s private parts over a boyfriend. The man is said to have committed the crime in Bukembe village, Kanduyi subcounty. Police reports indicate the incident was  reported by the mother of the 16-year-old Form Two student  at Bukembe SA Secondary School. She was seriously injured at night by her father. The suspect reportedly used an electric iron to burn his daughter on both thighs, buttocks and her sexual organs. Speaking from her hospital bed at Bungoma County Referral Hospital the girl complained of serious pain,  saying she didn’t understand why her father did that to her. “I don’t understand why I had to go through all this,” she said in pain. According to the mother, the  father got information from his neighbours that his daughter was cohabiting with  a young man within their locality. Bungoma OCPD Wilson Nanga  said the victim was treated at a local health centre and later transferred to Bungoma County Referral Hospital. “We have already launched a manhunt for the man and we will arraign him court once arrested,” he said Rebecca Nafula Masibayi, a girls’ advocacy crusader who visited the victim, condemned the assault, saying the father should be apprehended.
