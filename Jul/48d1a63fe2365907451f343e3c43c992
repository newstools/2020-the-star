The National Assembly will not hold sittings on Tuesday and Thursday to contain the spread of Covid-19. The House has been on partial lockdown and is set to reopen Tuesday when MPs resume from short recess. Offices were shut and staff directed to work from home to allow for fumigation of the precincts. Only staff at the office of the Clerk and designated officers from the Serjeant-At-Arms department were spared the directive. Traditionally, the National Assembly holds afternoon sittings on Tuesdays and Thursdays, with Wednesday having morning and afternoon slots. However, the House leadership holds that this would not be possible during the July 30 to August 13 period with the prevailing Covid-19 situation. “Taking cognizance of the recent rise in the spread of Covid-19 in the country, this House resolves to further alter its calendar for the fourth session,” the notice of the intended change reads. In that regard, the National Assembly will hold morning and afternoon sittings this Thursday. “Thereafter, the rest of sittings of the House of Tuesdays and Thursdays shall stand suspended,” the notice reads. “With effect from Wednesday, August 5, 2020, the House will hold its sittings on Wednesdays only - morning and afternoon, commencing at 10am and at 2.30pm,” Covid-19 positive cases in the country rose to 16,268 even as infections hit the public service disrupting services at key government offices. Speaker Justin Muturi suspended committee meetings until Tuesday July 28, with the same to continue virtually should the directive be lifted. MPs were barred from holding any committee meetings except those that are urgent, and the same having to be sanctioned by the Speaker. In the tough rules, Muturi maintained that authorised sittings will only be held in compliance with the Ministry of Health guidelines.
