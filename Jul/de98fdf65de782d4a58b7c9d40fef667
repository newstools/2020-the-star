Residents of Migori town have protested the theft of meters at night and demanded action from police and Kenya Power. Angry residents said the theft of meters, mostly during curfew hours, is done in collusion with Kenya Power agents. Businesswoman Agnes Akinyi said her three meters were stolen at her rental houses in Namba estate. “Most homes and business premises have been left in darkness as the gang always steal the meter box directly from electric poles and walls,” Akinyi said. On Tuesday, the Star visited the Kenya Power offices in Migori town and found many complaints. “I was told to report the matter to police and pay Sh4,000 for a replacement  and to trace my meters,” Akinyi said. Landlords and business people have complained. Natras Kiyai is a landlord at Chamkombe estate. He said his tenants woke up on Saturday and found all six meters stolen overnight. “Faced with paying Sh24,000 for all six meters to be replaced, I feel I have been robbed while the meters can be traced,” Kiyai said. Victor Ochieng, a resident, said they recently installed a meter only for it to be traced to a primary school in Kisii county. Moses Kerich, Kenya Power county branch managing director, said they were working with the police over the matter. “We are aware of the increasing cases of meter theft in Migori. We will trace those buying token with new numbers and have them arrested soon,” Kerich said. Edited by P.O
