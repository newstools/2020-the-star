Joyce Lay, former Taita Taveta women representative, has taken up singing. She released her first song titled 'Najua' on Monday, which was also her birthday. In a series of posts shared on her social media platforms, Lay said it had taken her nearly five decades to find her true calling. “It took 47 years to know what God has assigned me to do. This is because I wasn’t keen to allow Him to guide me,” she wrote. “In 2018, I started on a deeply spiritual journey. To know God more than what a preacher said. I wanted to have a deeper relationship and a wider understanding of who God is and why He created me. I started reading His word more and spending time in prayer. God is faithful.” Lay promised to release up to 32 songs "dropped into my heart" by God.
