A court has found a police officer guilty of raping a woman who had gone to report a case at Lamu police station. The prosecution, led by Eddie Kaddebe, proved how Rodgers Ouma lured the woman to his house at Langoni Police Lines. The court heard that the 26-year-old woman had on December 8, 2019 at 8pm gone to report that her husband was forcing her to take abortion pills to terminate an unwanted pregnancy. The woman braved the rains and was on her way home when somebody stopped her. The person identified himself as an officer (Ouma) from the police station and had perused through her complaint, got her mobile number and was willing to help. After the conversation, the court heard that the woman trusted the officer as a person in authority, genuinely willing to follow the case. The officer asked that they walk together as they were going in the same direction. He offered her shelter before the rains subsided. Reading the judgement, Lamu principal magistrate Allan Temba found Ouma guilty of rape and abuse of his position of authority as a police officer. He will be sentenced on Friday.
