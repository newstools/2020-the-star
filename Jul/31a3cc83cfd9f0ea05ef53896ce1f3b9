The Government is expected to launch a second wave of crackdowns on drugs and illicit alcohol in Murang'a and Kiambu Counties. Interior CS Fred Matiangi on Friday said unlike the initial crackdown which focused more on the consumers, the second wave focuses on dealers,suppliers and anyone else aiding and abetting the illegal trade. Matiang’i warned of tougher and ruthless operations to ensure the menace is caught by the horn. Speaking during a press conference at the Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development (KICD), the CS said all culprits will be arrested and prosecuted. "We want to target the dealers to ensure that this trend does not reoccur. We shall crack on this thing with such ruthlessness that it’ll come to an end. Through thorough investigations, we have been able to find out the people involved with the bhang that is consumed in Murang’a and Thika. We shall arrest and prosecute those who are culpable,"he said. In 2019, there was an outcry by Murang’a leaders over the increased cases of bhang smoking that followed the countrywide crackdown on second-generation brew in 2015. The first wave of crackdown was launched in March 2018 with Matiang'i noting  that some of the businesses are supported by government leaders who are  expected to be responsible. He ordered temporary closure of all  bars both licensed and unlicensed in selected areas. Matiang'i who doubles up as the Chairperson of the National Development Implementation Communication Cabinet Committee(NDICCC), hosted delegates from Murang’a to review the progress of all commissioned National Government development projects. Murang'a Governor Mwangi wa Iria revealed that plans are  underway to build, equip and staff a rehabilitation center. “There is already a building that has been identified to host the centerand is undergoing renovations. We only need NACADA [NationalAuthority for the Campaign Against Drug Abuse] to get on board andhelp operationalize the center,” he said.
