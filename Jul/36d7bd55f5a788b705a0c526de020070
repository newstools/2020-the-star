Gospel singer Size 8 has been receiving requests for counselling since her reality show, Dine with the Murayas, went on air. Speaking to Word Is, the mother of two said the show is simply meant to show what couples go through in marriage. “Realness is better than fakeness. We are a mirror and we portray what people out there are going through,” she said. “We are not sharing too much. We are receiving many calls. It’s like we have become a marriage counsellor.” The most talked-about episode was when Size 8 complained that she was not getting enough sex from her husband DJ Mo, pointing out that he was too busy to meet her needs. DJ Mo retorted that he found it hard to be attracted to Size 8 in her unappealing sleepwear.
