Media personality Betty Kyallo can now confidently talk about the cause of her failed marriage with Dennis Okari. Speaking to Billy Miya on his YouTube channel Billy O’clock, Betty said the thing about marriage at that time, she was young and didn’t want marriage as such, and she didn’t see its meaning. "But right now, I have grown as a woman, I understand myself and I now know what I want," she said. "I’m ready to mend my ways so I also get my ring. But now, I’m not in a hurry. Whoever God will send my way is who I will settle with." The mother of one also said contrary to what people think, she is happy that her ex-husband has remarried. "You don’t need to put a brave face in public but behind closed doors, you two are not okay. I chose to be happy and I’m even happy for him," she said. Betty had earlier said one of the reasons she decided to co-parent with Okari is because no child should lack fatherly love. Okari was invited to Betty’s house to celebrate their daughter’s 6th birthday a few weeks ago. "My advice is, if you do not want to get married, take your time. It’s your life, live at your own pace," she said. Edited by T Jalio
