Forty-five Mombasa health workers have tested positive for Covid-19 since March, county Health executive Hazel Koitaba said on Friday. Ten per cent of the health workers are from public hospitals. The county has about 45 health facilities. Koitaba spoke when she presented Sh8.5 million PPEs donated by Equity Group Foundation to the Coast General Teaching and Referral Hospital. "This donation will go a long way in improving the quality of healthcare for Mombasa residents," she said. The county has two public facilities that handle Covid-19 patients - CPGTRH and Technical University of Mombasa. Coast General has 12 ICU beds specifically for Covid-19 patients. The TUM has a Covid-19 isolation centre with 300 beds. Health chief officer Khadija Shikeli said TUM admits asymptomatic patients and those with mild symptoms. “At TUM you will not find any mortality. When a patient's condition worsens, he or she is taken to Coast General,” Shikeli said. CPGTRH chief administrator Iqbal Khandwalla said there are different departments handling home-based care as directed by the Health ministry. “We have different departments that are taking care of home-based care so that the Coast General Hospital can concentrate on moderate to severe cases,” he said.  - mwaniki fm
