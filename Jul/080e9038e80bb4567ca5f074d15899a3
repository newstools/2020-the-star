Francis Amisi, alias Frasha, says his brother inspired him to do the '90 days without alcohol' challenge. Frasha, the youth leader in Maendeleo Chap Chap, has in the past talked to youths on the importance of staying sober. Speaking to Word Is, he says this year, he is partnering with Nathan Gathegi on a health initiative called DetoxAfrica. "The challenge is all about how to find balance and not judge or vindicate anyone," he said. In an Instagram post, Frasha said people keep asking him why he does 'free of alcohol' challenges every year. "Today I will tell you why my amazing brother is a recovering alcoholic and I have seen him go through struggles I wish he never did," he said. "But the best thing in life is he came out on top. He lost everything, I mean everything, but God had a plan for him. I thank him for lessons he has taught me. He's one of those people who you thank God for having in your life." Frasha then asked his fans to join him in doing the challenge. "Who wants to join me from 1st of August?" he wrote. Frasha is also running the HIV Frasha Foundation, as well as a campaign called Jitambue, which is based on advocacy on HIV issues, especially targeting the boy child and the youth.
