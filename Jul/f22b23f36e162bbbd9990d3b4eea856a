Covid-19 prevention protocols were ignored during the launch of the National Hygiene Programme dubbed Kazi Mtaani in Kitui county on Monday. Jobless youths from across the county thronged the Kitui Stadium, making it impossible to maintain the 1.5-metre physical distancing requirement. Many others wore no face masks, risking exposure to the coronavirus. Governor Charity Ngilu and Kitui county commissioner John Ondego launched the programme. More than 2,800 youths will be engaged in cleaning up Kitui and Mwingi towns. “Through this initiative, youths will carry out projects in and around informal settlements to improve the environment. The project will cushion them from the adverse economic effects of Covid-19,” Ondego said. Ngilu said that the programme will also protect workers whose routine livelihoods had been disrupted by the coronavirus containment measures. “This initiative is a structured economic recovery strategy to restore the economic activities in informal settlements that have been affected by Covid-19 protocols,” Ngilu said. The governor said garbage collection, opening up of clogged drainage and bush clearing will ensure a clean and hospitable surrounding. Better still, she added, the activities would also put money in the pockets of the youths.   (edited by o. owino)
