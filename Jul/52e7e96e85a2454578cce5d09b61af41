While restrictions start to lift, for the most part we're still trying to keep safe and avoid crowded public areas - which means staying home. But just because we are stuck at home, it does not mean we have to eat the same thing every day. If you are looking for some new recipes, welcome to Quarantine Kitchen with Chef Feizal.  Each episode, he will teach you how to make some of our favorite dishes as well as some new and exciting food. This week, we’re tackling Chicken Biryani. This popular rice dish is a Swahili dish, famous for its spices, aromatic rice and tender and marinated meats. While this is a chicken version, you can make it with other meats as well as vegetables. There are a number of different recipes and if you want to take it up a notch you can add more whole spices. Don’t be intimidated by the time it takes to make it, because it is completely worth it, and as soon as you can, you will be dying to make it for your friends and family.
