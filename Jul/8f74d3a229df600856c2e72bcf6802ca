Gikomba traders woke up on Tuesday to find their stalls demolished. This comes three weeks after fire razed houses and businesses in Gikomba market. Many displaced remain homeless, with no money to sustain themselves during the tough economic period precipitated by the corona pandemic. Following the fire three weeks ago, Kamukunji MP Yusuf Hassan had said it had been planned to evict some traders. “This was not an accident. There were several people claiming on social media that they were going to burn this place. So this is something that had been in the works for a while,” the MP said. Interior PS Karanja Kibicho said that several people in the market appeared to have known of the arson in advance. “There is no way that such a thing of this magnitude can happen without certain people knowing. We in government believe that these fires are started by people who want to displace these traders and put up their projects,” Kibicho said. The PS also warned those behind the fires that the Gikomba market will not be privatised per their desires.
