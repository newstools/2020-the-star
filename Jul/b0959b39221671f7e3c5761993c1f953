Ajua has partnered with Kenya Association of Manufacturers (KAM) to drive the uptake of Kenyan made goods and unlock markets for local manufacturers. Through Ajua’s SME Connect digital platform, manufacturers will not only access retailers but also provide them access to feedback that comes from their consumers. This allows them to better enhance their products, market positioning and relevant competitive strategies that are critical for survival in the current market dynamics. “Ajua SME Connect enhances product development by giving manufacturers a platform to close the feedback loop between manufacturers and their customers,” said Ajua’s Executive Vice President, Commercial, Gilbert Saggia. Some of the biggest challenges holding back manufacturers in today’s market include reduced demand for their goods. This has forced up to 42 per cent of manufacturers to cut production to less than half their capacity according to a report by KAM and audit firm KPMG. “This partnership will  promote the uptake of digital platforms by manufacturers to enable them to gain access to local markets and new customers whilst reinventing their business models to align with changing technologies,” said Phylis Wakiaga, CEO KAM. Manufacturers are also struggling to find the necessary tools to understand value chain connections and operate their businesses competitively. As the economy reopens, manufacturers need to quickly identify their key vulnerabilities and establish strong frameworks around their supply chains as they plan for their recovery post-COVID. Ajua’s SME Connect will also enable SMEs to access credit facilities from financial institutions in addition to giving them access to actionable real-time customer feedback. The Ajua partnership furthers KAM’s 2020 objectives of providing market linkages for manufacturers and SME development.
