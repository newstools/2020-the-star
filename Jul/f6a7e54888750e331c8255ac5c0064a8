The national government is doing final touches in rehabilitating Michuki Central Park. Since the 26-acre park was handed to Kenya Forest Service in April as one of the several green spaces in Nairobi, major works have been carried out to transform it. With funds from the Treasury, KFS has erected a perimeter fence, keeping off outsiders and encroachments from the park. A nursey has also been laid out which will be supplied with indigenous trees. Public toilets have also been set up in the park . Plans are underway for a caf√© and amphitheater in the park and a place where worshipers can pray. Once complete, the Michuki Memorial Park will become an urban forest and follow the model of Karura Forest, which has been safe, self-sustaining and heavily frequented by walkers, runners and nature enthusiasts. The park is situated along Nairobi River between the Globe Cinema roundabout and the far end of Uhuru Highway. It is in the neighbourhood of Kijabe Street, Kipande Street, the National Museums of Kenya, Hotel Boulevard, Nairobi University's School of Diplomacy and the Norfolk Apartments. Prior to 2008, more than two-thirds of the land was largely unattended and was used illegally as a dumpsite. With the launch of the clean up exercise, all garbage will be collected and also the river banks will be cleared. The Ministry of Environment in conjunction with Kenya Forest Service, the National Environmental Management Authority, the Kenya Forestry Research Institute, the National Museums of Kenya and the Nairobi Metropolitan Service have been undertaking the rehabilitation works at the park.
