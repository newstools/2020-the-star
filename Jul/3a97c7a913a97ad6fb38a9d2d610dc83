The Senate leadership is seeking the intervention of President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM boss Raila Odinga on the contentious revenue sharing formula among counties. This after the lawmakers failed to broker a deal on the third basis for splitting the national cake among the 47 devolved units. Chief Whips Irungu Kangata (Majority) and Mutula Kilonzo Jr (Minority) have disclosed to the Star that the House leadership had reached Uhuru, Raila and other top political leaders to help resolve the stalemate. “We are now building consensus from above such that when we bring it to the floor, there will be fewer issues and we will just pass it,” Mutula said. Mutula said they are seeking to amend the proposed formula which he termed as divisive, unfair and only meant to disenfranchise certain counties. Kangata said they are consulting the county’s top political leadership because any formula that will be passed on the floor will have an impact on all the 47 counties. “The stalemate impacts all counties and everyone hence our endeavor,” Kangata said. The proposed formula has split the senators after it emerged that 18 counties would lose up-to Sh17 billion if the method is approved. Senators from Northeastern, Coast, Lower Eastern and parts of Nyanza and Rift Valley have mounted spirited campaigns to defeat the formula. Counties from the regions are the biggest losers. Two sessions convened to debate and approval of the formula have been adjourned for fear of nasty exchanges between the two camps – losers and gainers. The contentious formula, dubbed Mithika Linturi formula is an improvement of the one proposed by the Commission on Revenue Allocation, the panel says. It gives the population a weight of 16 per cent, health (20), Agriculture (12), basic share (20), poverty (15), land area (five) and urban (four). Among the biggest losers is Wajir county whose allocation will be cut by Sh1.9 billion. Mandera and Marsabit lose Sh1.8 billion, Garissa faces a reduction of Sh1.2 billion, Tana River Sh1.5 billion, Mombasa Sh1.6 billion, Kwale Sh995 million, Narok Sh887 million and Isiolo Sh879 million. Kilifi will lose Sh878 million, Turkana Sh450 million, Kitui Sh219 million, Makueni Sh302 million, Samburu Sh294 million, Taita Taveta Sh388 million, Tharaka Nithi Sh367 million and Vihiga Sh361 million. Among the top gainers are Nandi (Sh1.4 billion), Uasin Gishu (Sh1.2 billion), Nakuru (Sh1.2 billion), Kakamega (Sh997 million), Kiambu (Sh986 million) and Bungoma (Sh837 million). Others are Kirinyaga (Sh779 million), West Pokot (Sh777 million), Baringo (Sh722 million), Bomet (Sh673 million) and Siaya (Sh642 million). Edited by R.Wamochie
