The anti-terror police are holding a man arrested in Eastleigh, Nairobi, on suspicion that he was preparing to leave for Somalia for training organised by al Shabaab. Idd Seleman Bakari was seized on Wednesday after the Anti-Terror Police Unit received intelligence that he planned to travel to the neighbouring country. It was alleged that he had been involved in illegal activities, including being in frequent communication with the terror group. On Thursday, Corporal Fredrick Ouma of the unit obtained orders to detain him as they conclude investigations. In an affidavit filed before Kibera senior principal magistrate Esther Boke, Ouma  said the suspect had been radicalised by the terror group’s recruiters based in Mombasa town. The court heard that the suspect has the financial capacity to interfere with investigations and even disappear, hence the need to detain him. “He has the financial muscle to interfere with the investigations, the arrest of his associates and obstruct the case,” Ouma said. He added that the investigation was complicated and required enough time to complete. “I wish to state in this court that the investigations are complex and require time and in addition involves a number of agencies and extend to Somalia and Mombasa and Marsabit counties,” he told Boke. He said Bakari's phone was also needed for forensic examination. Bakari is being investigated for terrorism and related offences, which include being a member of a terror group and travelling to a terrorist-designated country in violation of the Prevention of Terrorism Act, 2012. The magistrate ordered the suspect be detained and directed the case be mentioned on Thursday next week.
