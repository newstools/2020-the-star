Members of Parliament have approved the nomination of Janet Gathungu as the new Auditor General. The lawmakers endorsed the report of Finance and Planning Committee which recommended the appointment of Gathungu to succeed retired Auditor General Edward Ouko. Mavoko MP Patrick described the incoming Auditor General as a competent professional who will play crucial role in cleansing government agencies and ministries of corruption. “She holds institutional memory. She is up to the task and I am sure the lady will deliver to Kenyans,” Makau said. North Horr MP Chachu Ganya in endorsing Gathungu said such a critical office should not be left vacant for over a year as has been the case. “The office is critical for our oversight mandate. It is very unfortunate that we had a vacancy for over an year,” he said. The seat fell vacant in August 2019 following the expiry of Edward Ouko’s eight-year tenure. The position was re-advertised after 17 shortlisted candidates initially shortlisted failed to meet the minimum threshold for the final shortlist in December 2019. Public Service Commission Chairperson Stephen Kirogo explained the position was advertised afresh to ensure the right person is recruited for the demanding job. Gathungu who is taking over from Ouko already has a full in-tray of pending audit queries, some dating back to 2014. Gathungu – an insider in the National Audit Office - was the director quality assurance under Ouko. She served as Auditor General’s personal assistant between 2011 and 2015.
