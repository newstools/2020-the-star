KNH said that after investigations, they have established that the patient left the Accident and Emergency area while awaiting transfer to the ward. "Upon realising that the patient was not in the hospital we immediately contacted his next of kin to inform them of the occurrence, " Kamuri said. Kamuri said investigations are ongoing to establish the whereabouts of the patient and upon establishment of the facts, the KNH management will take appropriate action.
