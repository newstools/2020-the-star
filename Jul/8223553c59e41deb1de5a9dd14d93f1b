A Kiambu legislator has defended Kiambu government's decision to convert Tigoni subcounty hospital to a Covid-19 centre. Limuru MP Peter Mwathi asked residents not to politicise the move, saying the hospital was there to serve residents who may develop signs of the coronavirus. Mwathi said some people were angry with Governor James Nyoro’s move since the hospital had a new block which had just been completed. “We should all know that a lot of issues have changed in the country because of this disease. A lot of people have been assisted at the facility who had developed signs of the disease. Again, it is near us the people of Limuru,” Mwathi said. The hospital, the biggest in the constituency, was renamed Kiambu County Covid-19 Centre Limuru. However, the legislator urged the government to assist the Nyoro-led government with the challenges it was facing at the facility. He spoke at the Kiambu County Covid-19 Centre Limuru, where he had accompanied Covid-19 Emergency Response Fund Board chairperson Jane Karuku and Equity Bank CEO James Mwangi to hand over 100,000 PPEs to Nyoro for the facility. Nyoro said their main challenge was ambulances. The governor said the county had 14 functional ambulances but had set aside two for the centre, adding that with the rising number of infected people in the county, they may needed additional ambulances to respond to emergencies. Nyoro revealed that the centre has 230 beds, 14 ventilators and 14 monitors. He added that the centre has 14 ICU beds. Edited by Henry Makori
