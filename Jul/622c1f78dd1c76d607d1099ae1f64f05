The Mombasa county government has started Phase 2 of feeding the vulnerable households to cushion them from Covid-19 effects. The county, which has so far registered 1,520 positive cases of Covid-19, has about 227,400 vulnerable households which were identified for the County Emergency Household Relief and Nutrition Support Programme. The Sh200 million programme announced in April is being implemented in phases. In phase I which went for about two months, the county distributed food to 55,000 households. “In phase II of the programme, we are again targeting over 50,000 households,” Youth and Sports chief officer Innocent Mugabe said. Mugabe said phase II started in Jomvu and will be rolled out in the remaining  subcounties of Mvita, Nyali, Changamwe, Kisauni and Likoni. “In phase I of the project, we encountered so many challenges that we have since learnt from. In phase II, we are hoping to take the shortest time possible,” he said. He said they have mapped, arranged for logistics and put everything in place to ensure the project is successful. “We will continue with the project until all the 227,000 households receive food." The county has identified children's homes that will benefit in Phase 2. The county is implementing the programme in conjunction with civil rights groups and the Kenya Red Cross. Mombasa Red Cross chairperson Mahmoud Noor has been present during all the exercises to ensure transparency. In May, tour drivers, who are among the hardest-hit by Covid-19, were also given food. Last month, hundreds of Kibarani and Kwa Punda slum residents protested after they missed out of the donations. Mugabe said the residents were all sorted after the protest. Edited by R.Wamochie
