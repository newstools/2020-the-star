Interior CS Fred Matiang'i has warned of taking over of Nairobi county assembly following a spate of chaos experienced in the past week. Matiang'i said he was consulting with the National Security Council over the matter in order to take action. “Let us not bury our head in the sand. We know what the right thing is and we know how best to act. Nairobi county has become an area of special interest and it's high time to engage the police,” he said. Speaking during the launch of the National Police Service Book authored by former IGP Joseph Boinett, the CS said placing Nairobi county assembly under watch had become part of their responsibility. “ Thirty-five per cent of the CBD security deployment is always around Nairobi county assembly. This is because most of the activities happening around the area is pure criminality. We cannot go on this way and there are decisions that have to be made on policing the county assembly of Nairobi among other counties following chaos being witnessed,"he said. He said Nairobi county assembly was no longer an assembly but a war zone where members were fighting all the time. Police lobbed tear gas to disperse MCAs following chaos that rocked the assembly over the appointment of Edward Gichana as the County Assembly Clerk by Speaker Beatrice Elachi. “I have asked the Inspector General of Police with the regional security team to disarm everyone around that county assembly who holds firearms. So far they have managed to collect 14 guns but I suspect with the level of criminality around that area there could be more guns yet to be collected,” the CS said. He, however, condemned the way police officers manhandled Mlango Kubwa MCA Patricia Mutheu and called police to exercise the rule of law. The National Police Service Book launched at the Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development documents the milestones of the  security service. Edited by Henry Makori
