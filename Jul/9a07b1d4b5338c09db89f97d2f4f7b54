A man who allegedly impersonated the Nairobi police boss and ordered a senior officer to arrest a businessman has been charged. Zacharia Mwaura denied presenting himself as Reuben Ndolo and directing inspector Samuel Kyulu to arrest suspects in a matter under investigation at Thika police station. Mwaura told Makadara chief magistrate Hestone Nyaga that police officers stole Sh72,000 and a mobile phone from his house. He allegedly called inspector Kyulu on February 20 and instructed him to arrest the suspects mentioned in OB57/20/2/2020 at the station. Ndolo was out of the country on official duty when the incident occurred. Mwaura was arrested two days after allegedly issuing the orders. He claimed around six officers who arrested him searched his house and took away the phones and the money. Detective Esha Buya of Kasarani Directorate of Criminal Investigation said she was not aware of the claim as she was not among the arresting officers. She told Nyaga that Mwaura was arrested by constables Stanley Gitonga and Daniel Nyamuhanga. In an affidavit Â filed at the court on February 24, Buya said that police recovered two phones from Mwaura which they suspected he used in the crime. Nyaga summoned Gitonga and Nyamuhanga to appear before him on July 27 during the mention of the case. The magistrate freed Mwaura on a cash bail of Sh100,000
