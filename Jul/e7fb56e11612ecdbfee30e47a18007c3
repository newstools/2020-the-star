The Nyeri County Covid-19 and Highly Infectious Diseases Response Bill, 2020 gives the governor powers to hire temporary staff if needed. County assembly speaker John Kaguchia said on Thursday the governor can recall experts, including retirees on short term cotracts. Governor Mutahi Kagwa assented to the Bill on Tuesday. It was prepared by the Nyeri assembly health committee. Kaguchia said it would provide local solutions to issues currently being addressed in Nairobi. “The governor will now not need to develop a new policy every time there is such a problem and take it to the county assembly,” he said. The law also allows the county chief to appoint a committee to steer Covid-19 issues, among other highly infectious diseases, directly. “It also gives public health workers the powers to enter premises and execute their mandate. It will ensure that we have a well-coordinated health strategy at the grassroots.” Kaguchia said it would also help in equipping hospitals to respond to emergencies and people who may require life support. Governor Kahiga said Nyeri is the first county to have a highly infectious disease response policy. The policy, he said, will now be a guide during this era of Covid-19 and in the event of any other infectious disease outbreak. Edited by A.N
