A KDF major killed in a military helicopter crash on Monday was preparing to hand over a modern farmhouse to his mother. Jacob Agunda, 34, and his family wanted to use the celebration in Ahero, Kisumu county, to appreciate God’s journey from poverty. The family’s breadwinner and father of one had educated his siblings, secured jobs for them and constructed a four bedroom house for his mother. Younger brother Alfred Agunda said the house, which was to be opened early next month, was self-contained, spacious and had all the amenities of a modern house. “He was here one week ago to ensure the septic tank is completed on time. It’s like he knew we would have visitors sooner and was rushing everything,” Agunda told the Star. “We had planned for visitors immediately things cool but death has brought them sooner. Sad!” Jacob and a colleague died on Monday after the helicopter MD 500E registration Army 539 S/N 0464E crashed in Masinga. The aircraft was delivered in 1981. “I have a cousin who was in Machakos University and my sister who is still at the University of Nairobi. They are among those who were under his care,” Alfred said. “I have seven cousins and six other distant cousins my brother has supported in education.” The family said that Agunda, who loved shorts and sandals, spent most of his time during the lockdown in the village doing final touches to the house. “He also loved fishing and spending time with a number of people in the villages. It is through such connects that he also secured jobs for them,” the brother said. Agunda completed his secondary education at Ngere High School in 2006 before joining the KDF as a cadet. He later trained in China for two years. “He was the family’s breadwinner and I can tell you we have come from far. His job as a cadet really helped us,” the brother said. The father of one had also educated three cousins and secured jobs for seven neighbours. He was married to Berly Anyango for three years.   - mwaniki fm
