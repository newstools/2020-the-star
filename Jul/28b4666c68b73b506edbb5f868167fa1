The government cannot imprison people who are in denial in regards to coronavirus. Health CS Mutahi Kagwe said those who are in denial should wait for it. "Kenyans who are in denial.. you can not take people to start briefing them about coronavirus.. you cannot put them to prison so that they understand," he said. Speaking during his daily briefings on Monday, Kagwe said that the responsibility is in the individual. "It is individual responsibility. There is coronavirus.
