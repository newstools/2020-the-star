Tourists planning to visit Kenya have been urged to apply for visas online. This comes as the country gets ready to resume international flights on August 1. Immigration services director general Alexander Muteshi said on Thursday that those who need to apply for visas should do so online during this time of the pandemic. Transport CS James Macharia announced China, South Korea, Japan, Canada, Zimbabwe, Ethiopia, Switzerland, Rwanda, Namibia, Morocco  and Uganda are on the initial list of 11 countries allowed into the country. He said the countries have mild and limited community transmission. The CS said the list will be reviewed on a regular basis depending on the circumstances on the ground and after a comprehensive global mapping of the intensity of the disease. The Immigration department has been offering online services from May following MoH guideline to reduce spread of the virus. The services that have been available include passport applications, online work permits, online foreigner certificate applications among others. The department had scaled down processing of passports, collection of biometrics among others. All the passengers arriving in the country will be required to produce a PCR based Covid-19 certificate whose test should have been done 96 hours before travel. “Let it be clear that those who will have a certificate of tests done before the stipulated 96 hrs will not be allowed to board in the first place. On arrival the passengers’ temperature should not exceed 37.5 degrees and not display any Covid-19 related signs,” Macharia said. He said only such passengers will be exempted from quarantine.
