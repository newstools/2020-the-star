Airline capacity will not be reduced to factor in social distancing rules when both domestic and international flights resume, Transport CS James Macharia has said. Speaking to the media on Wednesday, Macharia said that if airlines carry less than 75 per cent of the passengers they will go at a loss. "...but these passengers must go with Covid-19 free certificate. I would expect that if you are flying out, it would be prudent for you to be tested because you may not be allowed into other countries," he said. Macharia said those whose flights will be scheduled at night should not fear getting caught up in the curfew as an exception will be made. "If you are flying at night and you show the boarding pass, you will be allowed to go to the airport with your driver," he said. The CS, however, discouraged travellers from having many people escorting them to the airport. There will also be no mandatory quarantine for passengers arriving in Kenya from other countries if they do not exhibit coronavirus symptoms, he said. President Uhuru Kenyatta on Monday announced that all international flights shall resume from August 1. The President also announced the resumption of local flights from July 15 under strict guidelines in the country's planned phased reopening. The move comes after three months of suspension of all travels in and out of the country. The aviation industryÂ  has taken the lion's share of the coronavirus heat with most countries having suspended international flights. The passenger business of the global air transport industry is estimated by IATA to make revenue losses between $63 billion (Sh6.3 trillion) and $113 billion (Sh11.3 trillion) in 2020. Kenya Airways, reported a gross loss of Sh12.98 billion, a 71 per cent drop compared to Sh7.55 billion loss the previous year.
