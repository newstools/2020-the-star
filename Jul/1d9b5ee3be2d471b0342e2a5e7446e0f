 A Kisumu court has dismissed a petition by traders who wanted evictions from Kibuye market, for a planned upgrade, halted. The traders had received court orders restraining the Kisumu county from further demolitions until the matter is determined. Traders Juma Odeyo and Joseph Bollo took the matter to court through the Kibuye Market Traders Association and Kibuye Market Traders’ Welfare Association. They listed the county government and city manager as respondents. Through lawyer Aggrey Mwamu, they accused the county of displacing them without offering alternative places. But senior resident magistrate Robinson Ondieki said the traders had been resettled. “There is a photographic evidence that goes to prove that the traders did relocate to the new sites which in my view was in line with the orders of the court.” Ondieki said the parties had agreed on when relocation would be done to pave way to the government to work on the project. “I find and hold that the second defendant is not in contempt and I proceed to dismiss this application with cost.”. Kisumu city manager Doris Ombara had told the court she had designated Raila Hall in Kibuye market, Posta grounds between Star Hospital and United Mall along Ondieki Highway for the traders as ordered. Ombara accused the traders of pursuing individual interests and being hell-bent on derailing county development projects. However, the city manager said they will not relent until the Sh475 million upgrade of the market is realised.
