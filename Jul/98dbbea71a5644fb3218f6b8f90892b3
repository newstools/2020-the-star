A 20-year-old boda boda rider from Ngano location, Ol Joro Orok, is being held at Ngano police station for allegedly defiling a 10-year-old Class 5 pupil. Nyandarua West subcounty police commander Wanyama Nyongesa said Jason Wamutitu will be arraigned on Monday. He was arrested on Saturday afternoon. Speaking in presence of her mother on Saturday afternoon, the minor said she was sent by her mother on Thursday to buy fungicide to spray potatoes. She did not find the chemical at the shop and as she was about to head back home, Wamutitu offered to give her ride to the nearby Corner Shopping Centre. She did not find the chemical there and Wamutitu offered to give her a ride back home. Wamutitu took her to his house instead, the girl said, and dropped her outside. She asked for a cup of water and he told her to go inside and get it for herself. He followed her and defiled her for more than three hours, the girl said. “After he was done he ordered me out of his house. I dressed and left,” she said. The minor’s mother said she left their home at 11am and was expected back in less than half an hour. But at 2pm she got anxious. She called her elder son, who informed her he could not find the girl, but was informed she had been spotted at Corner Shopping Centre on Wamutitu’s motorbike. Wamutitu was nowhere to be found. As he was heading home, the brother noticed Wamutitu emerge from his home. At the same time, his sister emerged from the same direction, but on a different path. He took her home where she revealed what had happened. The matter was reported to police who took her to Ol Bolo Osat dispensary. Medics confirmed she had been defiled. (Edited by J. Muchangi)
