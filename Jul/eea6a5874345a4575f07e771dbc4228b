 The Wajir county government on Saturday received PPEs worth Shy237 million to be distributed to frontline health workers. The consignment that included disposable gowns, surgical masks, N95 respirator masks, nitrile gloves, head/hair covers, shoe covers and gumboots will be distributed to some 68 public hospitals. The personal protective equipment was donated by the Kenya Covid-19 Fund Board and Equity Group Foundation. Speaking after making the donation, Equity Bank's General manager Francis Adell said the Wajir County Referral Hospital is among those that will receive the equipment to boost the fight against coronavirus. He said the PPEs were locally manufactured in line with President Uhuru Kenyatta’s Big Four Agenda of building local manufacturing capacity.  “The PPEs we are handing over today have undergone rigorous quality testing and assessment and have met local manufacturing and international standards,” Adell said. He said the manufacturers were educated on how to meet national and international quality standards,. Adell commended the county’s health department for measures it has put in place to curb the spread of Covid-19. Wajir Health executive Ismail Sheikh thanked Equity Bank for their solid collaboration and continued support. He urged other well-wishers and donors to also chip in. County secretary Abdullahi Maalim who received the donations on behalf of Governor Mohamed Abdi said the county will strive to deepen its collaboration with Equity Bank so as to reach out to as many people in need of the banking services and other social support. Last week, Abdi appealed to Wajir residents to stop disregarding the Ministry of Health directives for the containment of the spread of coronavirus. With 24 cases already reported, the governor said there might be a surge in infections if residents continue to disobey the measures.  Edited by P.O
