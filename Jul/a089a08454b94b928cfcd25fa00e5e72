The county government of Vihiga has received medical equipment worth Sh36 million from Kenya Medical Supplies Authority. "The supplies will help our health team deliver services to our residents," Governor Wilber Ottichilo said. The county received the equipment after settling a Kemsa pending bill of Sh67 million. While flagging off the drugs to the subcounties, Ottichilo said Kemsa had been supportive of Vihiga. “We will make every effort to ensure we pay our bills on time for the drugs they supply to us once we get our funds from the national government,” Ottichilo said. "I also thank the Kemsa management for their patience with us especially when it comes to payment." He said the county relies on the national government to settle bills. "So, when the Treasury delays to release funds we have no choice but to bear with the situation," Ottichilo said. Through the Ministry of Health the county has managed to recruit 167 health workers under the UHC programme to boost services. Deputy Governor Patrick Saisi urged staff in charge of drug management to ensure proper usage. Edited by Henry Makori
