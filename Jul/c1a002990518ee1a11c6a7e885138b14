Former Tusker Project Fame winner and gospel artiste Ruth Matete is asking for help to pay her late husband’s medical bill, the funeral expenses and for her new life with her unborn child. Matete’s Nigerian husband Beloved John passed away in March after an explosion of a gas cylinder at their home in Athi River. She was at first suspected to have had a hand in his death before an autopsy report showed the husband had died from 60 per cent burns to his upper body. The body has been lying at the Kenyatta National Hospital following a request by the Nigerian High Commission to have it detained until the Nigerian government approves its release. Matete was permitted to bury her husband after investigations by DCI over the death of her husband. This was after her hubby’s Nigerian relatives demanded an investigation into Beloved John’s death. A poster, titled ‘In Loving Memory of Pastor Beloved John Apewajoye’, indicates payment methods for anyone who wishes to help Matete out. "This is to appeal for funds to help pastor Ruth Matete pay her late husband's medical bills, funeral expenses and for her new life with her unborn child," it reads. "Pay bill number is 891300, the Account number is 39659. To send the money via Mpesa use 0706206840."
