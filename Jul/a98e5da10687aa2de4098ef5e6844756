Impeached Kitui county assembly deputy speaker Emeritus Kasee Musya says he has left the office with his head high. The Kisasi MCA was Tuesday evening voted out after his colleagues overwhelmingly supported the motion for his removal. It was sponsored by Ngomeni MCA Eliud Nding’uri. Supporting Musya’s removal during a session presided over by speaker George Ndotto, Majority leader Peter Kilonzo lashed out at the ousted leader for going against the Wiper grain and being loyal to the Narc party and its leader, Governor Charity Ngilu. Kilonzo, whose sentiment was echoed by Majority whip Stephen Musili, said the Wiper brigade loved the honourable member abundantly but it was no longer tenable to treat him as one of their own. But speaking after the vote, Musya said although the process was illegal, he accepted the decision. He prided himself as an independent thinker who always speaks his mind but added that he felt betrayed by his Wiper party colleagues who were behind his removal. “I'm not a person who is given to following things dogmatically,” he said on the phone. “I'm now a very happy and proud man. I am relieved and I have been released to devote more time to serving my voters in Kisasi ward without interruption." Nding’uri had accused Musya of violating the Constitution with regard to the chapter on leadership and integrity. He said Musya used his office to bribe and lure MCAs to vote in a certain way when they were considering nominees to the Kitui County Public Service Board on May 13. Nding’uri further accused Musya of violating the County Assemblies’ Powers and Privileges Act by blocking MCAs from accessing the chambers during the debate on the Emergency Fund Bill. However, Musya dismissed the allegations as baseless and wishful thinking. “I'm not being investigated for any bribery. That is proof that the allegations are false. I'm okay with the MCAs' illegal decision as I leave with my head held high after efficiently serving as deputy speaker,” he said.
