Four people died on Friday evening when the saloon car they were travelling in collided with a truck at Mumberes along the Nakuru-Eldoret road. Mumberes Assistant Chief, Nicholas Rotich said the driver of the saloon car may have lost control of the vehicle and moved onto the wrong lane. "All the four occupants in the car died on the spot while the truck driver and his conductor escaped unharmed," he said. Rotich said the saloon car was moving from Nakuru to Eldoret as the truck moved to the opposite direction when the accident occurred at 6:30pm. He added that the smaller vechicle had a 'Learner' sign. He said heavy rain that was pounding the area could have contributed to the accident due to poor vision. Rotich said the bodies are still trapped in the wreckage. More to follow...
