A Daystar University lecturer will take over as the new vice chancellor of St Paul’s University. The current VC's term will end in October. University Council chairman Jackson ole Sapit said Prof James Kombo was selected in recruitment that ended on July 2. Kombo served as Daystar's acting VC in 2018 after Prof Timothy Wachira was sacked as vice chancellor. Sapit, who is also the archbishop of the Anglican Church of Kenya which is the institution's sponsor, said Kombo is a professor of systematic theology and has been teaching research and management. He said Joseph Galgallo has served as VC for 10 years. Sapit applauded Galgallo for steering the institution's growth, saying many courses are going on online as the country continues to battle coronavirus. St Paul’s University public relations and marketing officer Michael Mungai said the dates of the handover will be announced later. “Everything is set, we shall let you know the exact date. Let us all observe the Ministry of Health instructions to protect ourselves from contracting and spreading Covid-19. This is why we decided to start virtual leaning so our students are not left behind” he said. Edited by Josephine M. Mayuya
