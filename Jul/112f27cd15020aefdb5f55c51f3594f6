The widow of one of six bouncers from Ahero who were lynched during a burial in Busia was electrocuted in her house in Nyando, Kisumu county. Moleen Atieno, 26, reportedly died when she opened her refrigerator to pick fish to prepare for the market. Following the electric shock, she ran out of the house wailing in pain and collapsed. Neighbours rushed her to Boya medical clinic where she died a few minutes after arrival. Atieno was a known fishmonger in Ahero market. She  was famously known as 'Sisqo’, married to  William ‘Sisqo’ Omondi, one of the bouncers hired to guard the body of slain businessman Johannes Okoth during burial in Bumala, Busia county. ‘Sisqo’ was brutally murdered on November  15 last year together with Elvis Odoyo, David Okeyo, Philip Kwach, Evans Onyango and Richard Odero. Nyando subcounty police boss Leonard Matete confirmed the incident, terming it unusual. He added that the incident was reported to Ahero police station by her father-in–law John Obonyo. "The woman was opening a fridge to pick fish when she was electrocuted and died upon arriving at hospital," Matete said. Matete wondered how a fridge could cause death through electrocution. "This is the first time I have heard someone dying following shock from a refrigerator. We have called technicians from Kenya Power to ascertain whether there was an electric fault or whatever happened," Matete added. Her body was taken to Ahero Subcounty Hospital mortuary awaiting postmortem. Matete said that police had launched investigations into the matter. A relative, Brian Ochieng, alleged foul play, saying the family had a longstanding domestic feud touching on a parcel of land left by their grandfather.
