On Monday, more than 500 locals of Mlango Kubwa and part of Mathare were the beneficiaries of weekly food donations by Hare Krishna Food for Life and area MCA Mutheu Musyimi. Sarah Muthoni a local fruit vendor said, "I'm so glad that today I can sleep peacefully knowing that a good number of families and street children have taken something." Adding, "Most breadwinners are jobless as a result of the coronavirus and most families are starving. I would admire if the distribution was to be daily to ease the struggles."
