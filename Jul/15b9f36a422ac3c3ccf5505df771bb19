A man charged with assault caused excitement in Kibra court on Thursday after he beat up his wife after he found her with another man in his house. "I found my wife with another man in my house. When the man saw me, he ran away," the man said. The suspect further said his wife bite him on the knees and he had no option but to beat her. Some minor offenders opted to plead not guilty after one man landed a five-years jail term after pleading guilty. Normally in the Kibera court, minor offenders plead guilty but this week, things were tough forcing most of them to plead not guilty for bond terms. The magistrate’s tough handling of the matters before must have made them to change their minds and plead innocent to avoid going to prison. A man charged with stealing from tenants was shocked after he was convicted to four years in jail. He shouted, “You have killed me!” This was ironical because the Star mole had learnt that the suspect had armed himself with some thousands of shillings, optimistic that he would pay a fine. The man was convicted after he failed to properly mitigate and decided to behave as if he had some speech disorders. This points to why many suspects end up in jail, even over petty offences, thus congesting Kenya’s prisons.
