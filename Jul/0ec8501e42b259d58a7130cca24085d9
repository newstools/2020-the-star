Interior CS Fred Matiang’i and Inspector General of Police Hillary Mutyambai visited the family of the constable officer who lost his life in the recent foiled militia attacks in Garissa. John Njenga lost his life on July 22 when al Shabab militia attacked Garissa border police unit which left three officers with injuries. Matiang’i said Njenga died in the battle that saved the lives of his colleagues, and displayed true service to the country. “For his selfless dedication to the country, and for the sacrifice he made to save the lives of his colleagues,” Matiang’i said. He added that the government will support his his widow and two sons. IG Mutyambai also hailed Njenga for his role of defending the nation against al Shabab. Njenga succumbed to the injuries at Hagadera IRC Hospital where he and his colleagues were being treated. While confirming the incident, Police spokesperson Charles Owino said the militants threw grenades and improvised explosive devises, injuring one officer on the right leg and left hand, another on the right hand and the third on the left thigh. “They were a large number…I’ll be able to confirm how many have been killed later but so far we have five bodies. There was a lot of blood,” Owino said. The militants were repulsed after 30-minute gunfire, according to police sources.
