" I hereby tender my resignation as the chairman and a member of the senate Ad hoc committee on Covid-19," Sakaja said in a letter to Senate Speaker Ken Lusaka. In a letter seen by the Star on Tuesday, Sakaja said his resignation is effective July 20. The senator said he had decided to step down from his position in the committee in order to set an example and take responsibility for his actions. The lawmaker said he will abide by the law and had already paid his cash bail for his actions.
