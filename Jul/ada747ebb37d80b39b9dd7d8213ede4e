Borabu MP Ben Momanyi has drummed up support for Interior CS Fred Matiang'i, saying he can make a good president. He said the Kisii community's future is bright with Matiang’i as its leader. “As the Gusii community, we believe we can make a very good president and I'm very sure with CS Matiang’i we can lead the country,” Momanyi said. "We are praying that when the right time comes we will make a great decision to bring on board a leader we can all support as a community." The lawmaker said changes to the Constitution are long overdue and spoke out against the winner-take-all system. “We need to have an all-inclusive government where the president's powers are only on some functions but not as overall as it is," Momanyi said. "This will mean that the leadership of the country will be revolving in all the communities not as it is now that only a section of communities are benefiting from the presidency.” A number of leaders from the two Gusii counties (Kisii and Nyamira) support Matiang'i, citing his performance record. “We have no doubt that if we arise as a community and support our own for the top seat, we will definitely make it as a community. It is high time we come out and give support to our own son,” said youth leader Brian Mamboleo. Edited by Josephine M. Mayuya
