ODM leader Raila Odinga is in Watamu, Kilifi county after his doctors advised him to move to the warm coastal town, sources say. Raila was flown into Watamu on Wednesday and is expected to stay there for weeks until the chilly conditions in Nairobi are over. His right-hand man and Minority leader in the National Assembly John Mbadi confirmed that President Uhuru Kenyatta’s handshake partner is away in Coast. But the Suba North MP said Raila will stay in Watamu for only four days. “We were with him on Friday and he told me he would go to Coast for four days. You see he is supposed to take his rest. He is ok, he is just recovering,” Mbadi said. The former prime minister flew out of the country on June 24 to Dubai where he underwent surgery to treat a nerve disorder that had affected one of his legs. On July 13, he made a quiet return ostensibly to not alert supporters who would have flocked to the airport hence breaking the Covid-19 protocols. On July 1, the ODM party leader expressed gratitude to Kenyans for standing with him as he received treatment in the United Arab Emirates. In a one-minute video shared by his daughter Winnie Odinga, Raila, clad in a mustard polo T-shirt and blue shorts, said the messages of goodwill from Kenyans made him recover quickly. “I want to thank all my friends, supporters and all our youth who have sent me so many messages of goodwill. It has just been amazing and wonderful. It makes me recover so fast,” Raila said. It appears that Kenyans will have to wait longer to get to know what is contained in the final report of the Building Bridges Initiative as Raila takes his rest. Early this month, the BBI task force chaired by Garissa Senator Yusuf Haji said it had completed writing the final report and was awaiting availability of the President to present it.
