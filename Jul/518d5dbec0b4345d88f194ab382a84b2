Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu has promised to pay medical expenses for a Tanzanian national woman to have her malignant growth removed. Through a Twitter post on Thursday evening, Ngilu revealed that she met the 20-year old Pendo Masonga in Nairobi. Upon realising the malignant growth, the lawmaker interacted with the lady who revealed that she has been living with the condition for a long time. Masonga, who has an infant, allegedly moved to Kenya with hope of meeting well-wishers to help her undergo a maxillofacial operation to correct the growth. "I have offered to pay for her expenses to undergo the operation which will be done in Kitui after other four successful similar surgeries at the Kitui Referral Hospital. The patient has been picked, and is now in an ambulance on her way to Kitui Referral hospital," Ngilu said. In 2018, Ngilu opened a new state-of-the-art amenity ward at the County Referral Hospital in a bid to accelerate access to quality healthcare. The facility has since made it easier for residents to access services from  paediatricians, general surgeons, orthopaedic surgeon, physicians, gynaecologist, endocrinologist, maxillofacial surgeon, pathologist, family doctors and a neurosurgeon. In the same year, a Cuban Maxillofacial surgeon, Arelis Rabelo Castillo, conducted the first specialised operation in Kitui
