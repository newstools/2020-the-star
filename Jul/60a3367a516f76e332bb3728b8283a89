Jeff Koinange has urged Kenyans to Covid-19 seriously but not assume it is a death sentence. Speaking during Jeff Koinage Live, the father of one said what is causing fear among Kenyans is that we are focusing more on deaths than recoveries. "Most people are afraid of putting their corona status out in the public because people will assume they are dying. Which is not the case. Ninety per cent of the people will come out of it," he said. "Covid-19 is real, do not be in denial if you feel any signs. Get checked and protect those close to you." Jeff announced he had tested positive for corona on Monday. "I’m doing Good. No symptoms and my family is fine. All my close contacts have been informed. Right now I’m in self isolation," he posted.
