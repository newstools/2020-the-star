The government has imposed a 6pm to 6am curfew in Mikululo on the Makueni-Kajiado border to quell violence between two communities in the area. Four people have been killed and several injured in resurging clashes over pasture between the Kamba and Maasai communities. The attacks occurred last Friday and Sunday after young men allegedly from the Maasai community attacked homesteads belonging to the Kambas along the border. The injured were taken to Makindu Subcounty Hospital and the Makueni County Referral Hospital. Two have been discharged, while two others are still receiving treatment. The government has also sent officers from the General Service Unit (GSU) and the Rapid Response Unit (RDU) to ensure that normalcy returns to the area. The resolutions were announced on Monday by Makueni county commissioner Maalim Mohammed during a crisis meeting attended by local leaders and residents. Also in attendance was Kajiado county commissioner Joshua Nkanatha. â€œFrom 6pm today [Monday] I expect all of you to be in your houses. Police will carry out an operation in the area and if you violate the curfew, you will be taken in as a suspect," Mohammed warned. He also said a 20-member peace committee that was formed last year following similar attacks in the area would be revived. Mohammed warned government officers against being biased in their execution of duties. Nkanatha said a buffer zone should be created between the two communities to end the violence. In July last year, two people were killed due to a land dispute and several houses were torched during the incident. Edited by A.N
