Kenya has partnered with Facebook to market the country's tourism sector as the local and international travel resumes. The Tourism and Wildlife Ministry in partnership with Facebook have  launched 'Boost with Facebook for the Ministry of Tourism and Wildlife' - a digital marketing programme for Kenyan SMB’s in the tourism and hospitality sector affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. “Through the Boost with Facebook programme, I urge all tourism stakeholders and SMBs to equip themselves with the necessary digital marketing skills to help them quickly recover from losses incurred due to the pandemic,”Tourism CS Najib Balala said. With the tourism and hospitality sector in Kenya being hit hard due to the pandemic, the programme is designed to help thousands of tourism stakeholders using the Facebook family of apps to boost their businesses’ marketing efforts during these uncertain times. The Facebook family of apps include Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. The programme will feature webinar sessions led by Facebook’s implementing partner Wylde International in association with the Public Relations Society of Kenya (PRSK) and the Media Council of Kenya (MCK). Boost with Facebook will enable its participants identify business constraints caused by Covid-19, learn how to manage stranded assets and develop new strategies and business initiatives to survive the pandemic. The programme will also equip SMB’s with skills on building an online presence with Facebook, storytelling on Instagram, connecting with audiences through Facebook groups, growing business through WhatsApp and implementing advertising strategies on Facebook’s family of apps. “ At Facebook we know that small and medium businesses in Kenya may be experiencing unexpected challenges during the outbreak of Covid-19 and we’re committed to providing as much support as possible,” Facebook head of public policy Mercy Ndegwa said.
