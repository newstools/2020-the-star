Some 817 IDs are lying uncollected at the Registrar of Person’s offices in Moyale subcounty, Marsabit county. Subcounty Registrar of Persons Andrew Kimitei said on Tuesday 471 cards are replacements, while 346 were new applicants. The official appealed to owners to collect the IDs at the subcounty registration office in Moyale during normal working hours. “We were using chiefs and their assistants to trace people who had applied for the documents – both new applicants and replacements – but after the IDs were brought from Nairobi, the applicants have been reluctant to collect them,” Kimitei said in his office in Moyale. He stressed the importance of the document, saying it opens avenues for other transactions that include government services, travel and financial matters. Kimitei said the law makes says anyone of 18 years should acquire an identity card, failing which one will be guilty of committing a criminal offence under the Registration of Persons Act. He further said it only takes a few days for one to secure an ID, adding that the vetting process had to be stopped following the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. “We are waiting to be given the go-ahead from the headquarters so that we can resume vetting and processing of the documents but whoever has undergone the process can keep on checking if the document has been finalised,” the registrar said.
