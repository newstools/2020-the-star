The Directorate of Criminal investigations will release two of former Sports Cabinet Secretary Rashid Echesa's vehicles today. Senior principal magistrate Stella Atambo had ordered DCI boss George Kinoti to appear before her in person to explain why he had not complied with the court directive to release the vehicles. DCI legal and crime affairs director Amos Omuga said they had no intention of further holding the vehicles since investigations had been completed. “In respect of motor vehicle KCL 350J, a Mercedes Benz, and KBY 750U,  a Toyota Lexus, the investigations were complete and the police have no reason to continue holding them,” Omuga said on behalf of Kinoti. He said Ford Ranger KBP 725B is not in the DCI custody as it had been seized by the Kenya Revenue Authority. “I personally will ensure that the procedure in handing over any material held as exhibit by the DCI shall be released to the applicant (Echesa). The applicant shall too acknowledge an inventory of the same,” the lawyer said. Atambo considered the DCI representation on compliance of court orders in place but expected the status report on the Ford Ranger held by KRA. The investigation officer should come with the status report on the release of the vehicles during the mention of the matter on July 14. Echesa had mid June sought court orders to have the cars released to him, citing the challenges he faced using public transport amid the coronavirus pandemic. The vehicles were seized on March 2 after a complaint was made to the DCI by a Kisumu resident that the cars were acquired fraudulently. The three vehicles were not included in search warrants issued by the court.  - mwaniki fm
