 Laikipia leaders want the National Treasury to release 30 per cent of the Sh316.5 billion allocated to county governments before the Senate reaches a consensus on the revenue allocation formula. Governor Ndiritu Muriithi said the paralysis in the Senate over the third generation formula has derailed the devolved units' efforts  to fight Covid-19. He spoke on Thursday while assenting to the county's Sh7.9 billion Budget Appropriations Bill 2020/2021. The Senate is embroiled in a tussle over the formula of sharing  the money allocated to the 47 counties. Muriithi said Laikipia had pending bills totalling Sh718 million in the 2019-2020 financial year due to failure by the Treasury to remit funds to counties by last month. "We are urging the National Treasury to proceed with July and August disbursement to counties on the basis of vote on account. Services, particularly in the health sector, should not be constrained because of the debate that is going on in the Senate," he said. Deputy Governor John Mwaniki said the coronavirus had adversely affected the health sector. He said efforts to combat its spread would be punctured if resources are not made available on time. "We are in an era whereby Covid-19 is demanding a lot in terms of service delivery. When counties lack funds, this poses a great danger to the lives of our people. Treasury CS Ukur Yatani should speed up the process of allocating funds to counties as directed by the President," Mwaniki said. Speaker Patrick Waigwa said the Senate should agree on the revenue sharing formula as counties are suffering. “We need the essential services to continue running smoothly. Covid-19 issues need a lot of facilitation,” Waigwa said.  - mwaniki fm
