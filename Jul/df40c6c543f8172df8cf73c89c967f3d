Kenya Power lost Sh9.5 billion in revenue in the first four months of the Covid-19 pandemic. Appearing before the Senate Energy committee, Energy CS Charles Keter linked the decline in revenue to the sharp interruption of commercial and industrial operations and the government directives that no Kenyan should be cut off during the pandemic, resulting into several cases of customer defaults. Keter said closure of small and medium enterprises had huge impacts on the electricity consumption in the country. “Between March and June, electricity consumption declined by about 14.8 per cent corresponding to a decrease in energy consumption by about 341 GWh. Consequently, electricity sales revenue reduced by about Sh5.6 billion,” Keter said. “Increased customer defaults of monthly electricity bills estimated at 8.7 per cent, resulting in a further reduction in revenue by Sh3.9 billion.” During the same period, the CS noted that the state cooperation incurred Sh1.2 billion in increased operations to maintain power supply across the country. “As an essential services provider, staff are required to play great role in maintaining uninterrupted electricity services in this period hence increased operational costs.” The CS was appearing virtually before the committee chaired by Nyeri Senator Ephraim Maina. He was to - among others - give an account of the impact of Covid-19 on the operations of the power company. He was also put to task to explain why Kenyans continue to pay high cost of electricity despite the significant drop in the cost of fuel and improved rainfall pattern across the country. “In 2019-20, the overall tariff reduced from 20.50 Sh/kWh in August 2019 to a low of 18.84 Sh/kWh in May 2020,” the CS responded. “The significant decrease was due to reduction in Fuel Energy Cost (FEC) which reduced from 3.39 Sh/kWh in July 2019 to 2.40 Sh/kWh in May and June 2020 hence, the overall average tariff for the financial year 2019/20 was 19.56 Sh/kWh.” Edited by R.Wamochie
