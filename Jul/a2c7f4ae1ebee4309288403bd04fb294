Gospel singer Emmy Kosgei turned 40 years yesterday. To celebrate, she shared her photo on social media, thanking God for taking care of her. She captioned it, "Hello, 40! Happy birthday to me. What shall I render to Jehovah?" Her Nigerian husband Apostle Anselm Madubuko also celebrated her, saying, "Happy birthday my Nubian Queen! I love u plenty! Keep increasing on all sides of Jesus love." Emmy got married to the General Overseer of Revival Assembly Church six years ago, and they are celebrating their anniversary this year. Emmy says her husband loves her genuinely and that gives her more reasons to stay in love with him. Apostle Madubuko is turning 62 years old this month.
