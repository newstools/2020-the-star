Dr Ashoke Singh Matharu, a director of the hospital, operations manager Muffadal Ammar HassamJee and laboratory technicians Herbert Cheruiyot Charles and Beatrice Awino denied committing the offences on Wednesday at the Lang'ata Road-located hospital. The particulars of the cases were that they were found jointly stocking expired medical laboratory reagents Bilirubin (T), Combi 35, Ast Got, Actone, Area Bun/UV, Magnesium, Trigs, Excel, Labsystems, Bsa Accurate against the Medical Laboratory Technicians and Technologists Act. The second count was that they used un-validated labaratory reagents contrary to regulations required by the law. Their lawyer, Mark Omuga, told Milimani senior resident magistrate Tobiko Sinkiyian that Ashoke is a medical doctor with 30 years experience. Omuga said the practising certificates of Cheruiyot and Awino had been confiscated by the police and requested the court to order the return of the documents. “Your honour my clients need to have the practising certificates since many people depend on them and their service and the prosecution has not given any reason why they want to hold them,” he said. Ashoke and Ammar were released on Sh100,000 bail each and Cheruiyot and Awino on Sh50,000 bail each. The court also ordered the release of the technicians' practising certificates within seven days if there are no reasons to keep holding the documents.
