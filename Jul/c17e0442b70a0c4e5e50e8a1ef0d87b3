Two Baringo legislators have clashed over who between Senator Gideon Moi and Deputy President William Ruto should vie for the presidency in 2022. Tiaty MP William Kamket of Kanu said Gideon should go for the top seat, while his Baringo North counterpart William Cheptumo said Ruto fits the bill. “If Gideon becomes the next President instead of Ruto, then there is no problem as we will have lost nothing as Kalenjins because both come from our community,” Kamket said. He said Baringo residents should support Gideon since he is Tugen. But Cheptumo maintained that DP Ruto is cut for the job. They spoke during the funeral of Isaac Cherogony, the husband of Baringo Woman Representative Gladwel Cheruiyot, in Kapkiamo, Baringo North subcounty, on Friday. The burial was attended by hundreds of mourners. Leaders present included Murang’a Woman Rep Sabina Chege, nominated Senator Abshiro Halake and Baringo Deputy Governor Jacob Chepkwony. Kamket said Baringo residents have no reason to say President Uhuru Kenyatta has been discriminating against Kalenjins, yet he has appointed several professionals from the area to key positions in the government. "If Murkomen is replaced by Samuel Poghisio as Senate Majority leader, then what is the difference? If Cheptumo is removed from assembly chair of Justice and Legal Affairs and I’m put there, what is the problem? We are all Kalenjins?” Kamket said. But Cheptumo responded to Kamket, saying following his removal from the position of Justice and Legal Affairs Committee chair, he has noted that the ongoing changes in the Jubilee party are driven by hate, not merit. “The changes are good if the exercise is motivated by professionalism and goodwill rather than the perceived political inclination,” he said.
