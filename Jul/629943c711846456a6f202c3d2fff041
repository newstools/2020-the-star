Majid Al Futtaim has completed the second phase of its charity initiative to support underprivileged families across Nairobi affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The initiative has helped to generate donations of more than 65 tones of staple food items, worth over Sh5 million, since its launch in May 2020. “We appreciate the support from partners and well-wishers such as Carrefour to help vulnerable families with food rations during this pandemic,” Secretary general Kenya Red Cross, Asha Mohammed said. Carrefour which is operated by Majid Al Futtaim in Kenya joined forces with the Kenya Red Cross to deliver donations providing over 10,000 food hampers to families in need. These hampers comprised of essential items such as maize meal, rice, ndengu, and baking flour. As a catalyst for change in the community, Carrefour encouraged its customers to also support vulnerable families affected by the coronavirus by donating food hampers when shopping at any of its stores with the brand supplementing the contributions donated by customers. “We are grateful for the generosity of our customers. At the start of this campaign, we aimed to support up to 5,000 at-risk Kenyan families. As we near the conclusion of this campaign, we can proudly say that we have gone above and beyond our target.” Country manager of Carrefour Kenya, Franck Moreau said. He also added that the firm is determined to offer ongoing support to families in need and demonstrate their commitment to the people of Kenya. The initiative was further supported by the Kenya COVID-19 Emergency Response Fund, which took the lead on distributing the donated food packages to families. The charity campaign also saw families from Githembe in Nairobi receive over 33 tonnes of staple food, worth over Sh2.5 million, in the first phase of the campaign.
