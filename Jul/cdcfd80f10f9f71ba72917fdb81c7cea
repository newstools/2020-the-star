The Kenya Covid-19 Fund Board and Equity Group Foundation last week embarked on the distribution of locally manufactured PPEs to public hospitals for use by healthcare workers dealing with Covid-19 patients. Tigoni Level 4 Hospital in Kiambu County, which is among identified 68 public hospitals, received disposable gowns, surgical masks, N95 respirator masks, nitrile gloves, head/hair covers, shoe covers and gumboots. Speaking during the event, Covid-19 Fund Board Health Committee chair James Mwangi said, "Various medical professional associations have teamed up to facilitate psychosocial and case management training for over 50,000 health care workers dealing with Covid-19."
