The Senate on Tuesday shot down the disputed revenue sharing formula proposed by Irungu Kang'ata (Murang'a). Kangata, also the Majority Chief whip, had sought to amend the report by the Finance and Budget Committee to push forward the commencement date of the formula. The committee has proposed the new formula takes effect in 2021-22, but Kangata wanted it to commence in 2022-23. This was seen as strategy to entice those opposing the formula to endorse it. Earlier, Finance and Budget Committee chairman Charles Kibiru (Kirinyaga) made a case for the disputed formula. While moving the motion , Kibiru urged his colleagues to approve the panel's recommendation, arguing that it was arrived at after thorough consultation with several stakeholders. "We need to shift our gear from saying who gets what. This county is ours. We should ourselves, as a Senate, tonight question if we want this county to move forward. We have had over 20 simulations in the Committee," he said . He said the Senate should approve the formula and push for more allocations to the counties to ensure no county is left behind "From where we sit, the minimum that should be taken to counties should not be less than sh350 million,'" he said.
