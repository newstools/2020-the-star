MyMoviesAfrica™ is producing 10 titles selected from the African Women in the Time of Covid-19 Short Film Competition. The films will be available for free for three months. The short film competition invited African women to share their stories about the personal, economic, and social impact of Covid-19 in Africa. Speaking on behalf of the service, co-founder and content director Trushna Buddhdev-Patel said, “Normally a rental is Sh100-Sh200 per 48 hours, but these films shall be available for free on MyMoviesAfrica™ for a limited time, across the world. "And we are delighted that 40 per cent of the selected films are from Kenyan producers.” The short films from Hellen Samina Ochieng, Neha Manoj Shah, Skinnor Davillah Agello and Wambui Gathee highlight the challenges women in Kenya have endured during the pandemic. About 200 women from 18 African countries shared their moving and honest stories on diverse topics. The dominant themes were domestic violence, altered access to opportunities and increased burden of care. There were also stories of resilience and hope. The 10 films premiered on the Ladima Foundation Facebook page on Friday.
