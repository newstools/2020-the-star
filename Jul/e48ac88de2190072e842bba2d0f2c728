Menengai Oilers are keen to sign playmaker Geoffrey Ominde on a permanent deal. The diminutive half-back joined the Nakuru-based outfit during the December/January transfer window on loan from rivals Nakuru and Oilers coach Gibson Weru said they are committed to sign him permanently. “He brings a lot of experience to our young side and is a match winner on any given day. For the club to attain it’s goals for next season and the years ahead, he will play a critical role,” added Weru. The former Kenya Sevens’ international said once the transfer window opens, they will finalise Ominde’s deal. “We still don’t know when the transfer window will open due the uncertainty of the Covid 19 pandemic and suspension of the league but it will be the first order of business we will do,” noted Weru. He said they will strengthen the forwards with two or three signings. “We are a bit thin on forwards and it’s an area we must bolster if we are to maintain our playoff position come next season.” Ominde joined the team alongside back rower Dalmas Chituyi and former Impala utility player Mark Kwemoi. The trio meshed up with the youthful outfit to finish sixth on the log and qualified for the playoffs for the first time, where they were due to play Homeboyz before the season was suspended due to the Covid-19. Weru said the players are training individually from home and are being monitored by the strength and conditioning coaches.
