The recruitment of KPA’s managing director will now proceed as scheduled after the court lifted the temporary restrictions it had placed against the process. The Employment and Labour court Judge James Rika threw out a petition that sought to stop the recruitment of the new MD. Judge Rika said the petition by the Commission for Human Rights and Justice lacked merit and its prayers could thus not be granted. The Mombasa-based  judge said the petitioner failed to produce any evidence to prove the board of directors defied the Constitution in the recruitment by conducting interviews without public participation. Rika noted that the public participation had been considered as the Dock Workers Union representing KPA’s workers had been involved and had approved the process. “The board has proven it has put in place plans to ensure the process meets the transparency and accountability required, “he said The board had received at least 150 applications for the seat, which fell vacant after the resignation of Daniel Manduku. Before his resignation, Manduku had been linked with several corruption scandals and was under investigations. According to the petition filed on May 7, the civil society group sued KPA board of directors, Transport Cabinet Secretary and the Attorney General. The petitioner termed the scheduled recruitment process as unconstitutional, arguing for its suspension until all the constitutional requirements were met. But the respondents opposed the petition and termed the application as preemptive, speculative and one that sought to waste judicial resources. Edited by EKibii
