Milimani law courts have been closed for 14 days with effect from July 30, Chief Justice David Maraga has said. This comes after an officer tested positive for coronavirus on Monday. In a statement released on Wednesday, Maraga said that during this period,Â  urgent matters shall be dealt with on the online platforms. "Respective Heads of Divisions and Courts will issue directions on the handling of matters that will be affected by the closure," Maraga said. During the last week, several members of staff have experienced symptoms similar to those of Covid-19. "The Leadership of the Judiciary has, in consultation with the leadership of Milimani Law Courts and well as the Ministry of Health, taken the necessary steps to suspend physical court operations," CJ said. He added that this will enable all the members of staff at Milimani Law Courts to self-quarantine and thereafter get tested before resumption of physical operations. A source who did not want to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter on Tuesday informed the Star that after the staffer at Milimani's family division court tested positive, judges called an urgent meeting. The judges then resolved to conduct mass testing and the courts to be closed for two weeks.
