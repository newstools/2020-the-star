The government through the Ministry of Interior is set to roll out Phase Two of the National Hygiene Programme, known as Kazi Mtaani which targets the youth. The second phase of the programme will be launched on Monday next week. During the Budget estimates on June 11, Treasury CS Ukur Yatani allocated Sh10 billion to the programme. The programme will run for six months in all the 47 counties. More than 278,000 youths are set to benefit from the social protection programme. The programme was launched by the President on April 25, targeting youths in slums from eight counties. The programme was first rolled out in 28 slums in Kiambu, Nairobi, Mombasa, Kwale, Nakuru, Mandera, Kilifi and Kisumu. Kazi Mtaani has been hired jobless young people to make the environment safer during the Covid-19 pandemic and the government will now expand the programme to about 300,000 youths. ICT and Innovation PS Jerome Ochieng said on Monday that  the programme had cushioned residents from the economic effects of Covid-19 and ensured improved hygiene and sanitation. Speaking in the Obunga slums in Kisumu county, one area where the programme is being implemented, he said the government would recruit 10 times more young people in the second phase. He was joined by Kisumu Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o and county commissioner Susan Waweru.
