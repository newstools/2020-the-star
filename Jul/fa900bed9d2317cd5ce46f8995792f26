The County Assemblies Forum has criticised the CoG for seeking to stop MCAs from impeaching governors. Ward representatives on Wednesday said that the oversight role of county assemblies will not be stopped in the name of the coronavirus pandemic. Through a statement released on  Wednesday, CAF said that the issues being witnessed between County Assemblies and governors is instigated by the latter's 'condescending' approach to issues, and their desire to avoid oversight by the county assemblies. “County Assemblies will continue to effectively exercise their oversight role to ensure that public resources are utilised prudently. This will be heightened especially on expenditure during this Covid-19 pandemic,” part of the statement reads. The forum has also expressed its displeasure over the harassment of MCAs by their governors, pointing a finger at Kirinyaga, Bungoma and West Pokot counties. They have asked Parliament and the Commission on Revenue Allocation to end the stalemate on the division of revenue. According to CAF, Parliament and the Commission on Revenue Allocation should ensure that they expeditiously come up with a formula that is equitable and serves the best interests of Kenyans. The forum said that it has commissioned a Technical Advisory Project that is aimed at providing MCAs with information and advisories regarding the status of Covid-19 in the country, a programme that was supported by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). The project will help assemblies to undertake their legislative role in facilitating the Executive and their communities as per their mandates. CAF in conjunction with the United Nations launched the UN Health Expert volunteers in Kajiado county, where a total of 50 volunteers were distributed among the 14 counties. The Sh53.5 million aid from the UN will run for two years with the possibility of extension dependent on the availability of funds and the success of the program.
