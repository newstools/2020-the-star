The family of the late Kibra MP Ken Okoth has organised a memorial service to mark one year since his death. According to ODM, the remembrance service will be held on Friday evening at the Guadalupe Catholic Church, which is in Adams, Nairobi. Ken died on July 26 last year at the Nairobi Hospital where he was receiving treatment. He died at the age of 41 after a long battle with colorectal cancer. Okoth was in his second term as Kibra legislator and had been hailed for his distinguished development track record and brilliance as a MP. With Kenya's largest slum sitting right at the centre of his constituency, Okoth was dedicated to ensuring that this was no longer the image of his constituency. He was the second high-ranking leader to die of cancer in a span of one month after former Safaricom chief executive officer Bob Collymore succumbed to the scourge on July 7 last year. His body was cremated in a private ceremony in Nairobi after a tussle over his final resting place. Kenâ€™s brother Bernard Otieno Okoth (Imra) was sworn in as Kibra MP in a heated by-election.
