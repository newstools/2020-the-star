Kenya has reported 7,577 Covid-19 cases after 389 people tested positive in the last 24 hours. This is from a sample of 4,829 people who were tested in the same period. A statement to newsrooms indicated the country’s accumulative tests stand at 185,035 samples. All the 389 cases are Kenyan except three. According to the statement, 266 are males and 123 females with the youngest being a one year old and the oldest 93 years. Some 88 other patients have been discharged from various hospitals bring the total number of recoveries to 2,236. Unfortunately five more patients have succumbed bringing the total of fatalities to 159. This comes after the Kenya Medical Research Institute estimate  that about 550,000 people in Nairobi and roughly 100,000 in Mombasa, have already contracted and recovered from Covid-19, probably gaining some immunity. Scientists suggest that about 2.6 million Kenyans already have the coronavirus,  after they tested donated blood for antibodies. According to the report, some could have been infected as early as March because the antibodies can linger in the blood for several months. The prevalence of antibodies to the virus ranged from 1.1 per cent in blood donated in Uasin Gishu county to 12.4 per cent in Nairobi. At least 6,000 people should also have died from the disease countrywide, based on the current crude death rate. More to follow....
