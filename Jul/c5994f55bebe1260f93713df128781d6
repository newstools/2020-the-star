Kenyan artists have arranged an exhibition this weekend to raise money for hungry families during the Covid lockdown. The proceeds from the sale of around 50 pictures will go to four local charities for feeding programmes to support deprived children and households in informal settlements. The four charities are the Kobo Trust; ITH Ministries Treasure Homes; Kuwinda School Nursery Freeding Programme; and Mukoma-Hardy Coronavirus Support. Among the artists represented are Peterson Kimathi, Patrick Kinuthia, Mary Collis, Fitsum Berhe, Eltayeb Dawelbait, Michael Soi, Nigel Pavitt, David Marrian, Peter Elungat, Geraldine Robarts, and the exhibition organiser Sophie Walbeoffe. The diverse and colourful exhibition shows mostly paintings that have been produced over the Covid period in Kenya. The exhibition is on show at the Matbronze gallery in Kifaru Lane in Karen over from July 31 to August 2. There is also an online catalogue.
