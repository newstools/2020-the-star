The Vihiga County Council of Elders has split into two camp, each supporting different groupings to speak for and lead the Luhya community in 2022. One camp is behind ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi and his counterpart Moses Wetang’ula of Ford Kenya. It says the other camp is trying to divide and scatter Mudavadi's presidential votes. The other camp is behind Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya and Devolution Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa, both pro-Jubilee and promising development. The ANC-Ford Kenya camp was badly hit by their opponents after inaugurating Mudavadi and Wetang'ula for the Luhya leadership. It is led by chairman Gasca Ochiemo, treasurer Hezron Sieba and organising secretary Joseph Kiligolo who read a statement criticising the other camp. The camp backing Wamalwa and Oparanya is led by former Makadara lawmaker Fred Omido, Edward Oware and Jactone Omutsi. Kiligolo was addressing the press at a hotel in Sabatia subcounty where the council held an open meeting to deliberate on the county's way forward. “As elders, our mandate is to foster integration, cohesion, harmony in our community and not to engage in divisive politics," Kiligolo said. He said the so-called 'development team' under Oparanya and Eugene has a "personal interest in disorganising this region so we won't  have a strong base to support our own son here," he added. The camp behind Oparanya and Eugene has continuously praised Cotu boss Fancis Atwoli's leadership under BBI, saying they are trying to help the region economically. Omido and his team said the region will get more development under the pro-Jubilee leadership of Eugene and Oparanya. (Edited by V. Graham)
