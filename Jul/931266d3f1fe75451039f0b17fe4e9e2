Garissa Governor Ali Korane on Sunday lauded the massive private investments in the county because they bring jobs and improve residents standards of living. Korane said his administration had created policies and collaborations to woo investors to the county and boost commerce and light industries. The governor spoke when he opened the Express Mall, a private investment along Kismayo Road in Garissa town. The shopping mall has over 100 stalls and units which retail food and beverage, garment, health and beauty products and electronics. It also houses banking halls, offices and supermarkets. "Steady investment ventures by private sector players in Garissa will soon lead to major economic and social improvement. I laud the proprietor for investing in the town as this would go a long way in satisfying the urban needs of the town," he said. The governor added that the upgrade of Korahey market was almost complete and would offer improved business conditions to hundreds of small scale traders currently selling their wares from the roadside of Souk Mugdi. The governor also assured the traders operating in Souk Mugdi and its adjacent areas that the flooding would be contained. Floods have previously wreaked havoc on businesses when it rained but works on storm drainage to carry away runoff rainwater is ongoing. Korane also revealed that the long-awaited cancer centre would be opened soon. It is about 79 per cent complete. The governor called on residents to adhere to the laid down guidelines for social distancing, wearing a mask in public areas and frequent hand sanitisation. The governor was accompanied at the launch by county secretary Abdi Ali, several CECs, chief officers and senior government officials. He urged residents, especially the youth, to take Covid-19 seriously and protect themselves and their families. “There is a worrying scepticism on the part of our community about the existence of the contagion,” he said.
