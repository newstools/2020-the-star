In a social media post, the mother of one took a moment to celebrate the strides and efforts she has taken towards ensuring her daughter has a good life. Makena, who has never revealed her baby daddy, went ahead to state how worried women become thinking they can't raise kids without their fathers, only to realise they are capable. "I'm so proud of my years as a single parent than I have ever been in my life," she wrote. "I thought raising my child without the father will be disastrous, only to realise we just panic and think we can't do without a man's help. Yet we are capable and strong."
