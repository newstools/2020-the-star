The war against Covid-19 has reached a critical stage and politicians are expected to lead from the front. However, in Kakamega, Vihiga, Busia, Bungoma and Trans Nzoia counties politics has taken centre stage. Leaders converge not to strategise on how to tackle the fast-spreading virus but to discuss succession politics. Two distinct camps have emerged—the Wycliffe Oparanya-Eugene Wamalwa axis and the Musalia Mudavadi-Moses Wetang'ula camp. Both groups are wrong. The ban on political gatherings remains as part of the measures to contain the spread of Covid-19. Sadly, this is being selectively enforced. The Oparanya-Wamalwa team meets freely while the Mudavadi-Wetang'ula camp has to face teargas anytime they convene. This weekend, meetings convened by Oparanya and Wamalwa in Kakamega and another held by Kakamega Senator Cleophas Malala and ODM secretary general Edwin Sifuna in Bungoma went smoothly. However, in Hamisi leaders who had converged at the home of  MP Charles Gimose to condole him following the loss of his mother were forcefully dispersed. After the uprooting of Kanu in 2002, Kenyans expected a new dawn ending the use of state power for political oppression. Unfortunately, they were wrong, for the more things change, indeed, the more they remain the same.
