Comedian Terence Creative says he is proud of his body. The comedian has been body shamed online. “I’m a very proud fat guy. You see, we have a lot of unhealthy people but like who I am, I’m very healthy, and cute and all my organs are functioning,” he told Word Is. Terence spoke at the launch of new products by Gire Limited in Karen. He is one of the brand ambassadors signed up by the firm. Terence said he pities people who body shame others. "If you look at it, really, they are the ones with the problem," he said. "Not me. I’m good with who I am. I’m happy with my struggle, ninapambana na nyama zangu. I’m okay.” Terence cautioned his trollers that what goes around comes around. “I don’t want to say I’m used to that and I don’t have a problem with it. If you saw my photos from back then, I would prefer to be the way I am now. I’m satisfied with my structure. I am okay with my body," he said.
