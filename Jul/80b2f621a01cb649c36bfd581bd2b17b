Wajir Woman Representative Fatuma Gedi has joined human rights activists in condemning an assistant chief accused of defiling a minor. Speaking to the press in Wajir town on Saturday, Gedi said the county’s progress made in the past few years to enhance enforcement and implementation of sexual and gender-based violence laws is hitting a dead end. “My office has written to the Director of Public Prosecutions and county commissioner to act quickly and ensure that justice has been served,” Gedi said. Assistant chief Kalmoi Shale Ahmed was arraigned before a Garissa court on Friday. Ahmed, who is from Wajir’s Arbagaramso village, denied three counts among them intentionally and unlawfully defiling a minor in Wagberi. He denied intentionally touching the child, who was identified as KGH. The administrator further pleaded not guilty to the offence of wrongly distributing obscene images contrary to the Computer Misuse and Cybercrime Act. The assistant chief, who was unrepresented, asked for bond saying he is a public servant and cannot influence witnesses. He told the court that he has worked diligently and without favour for six years. “I was recruited in my current job when I was 23. For the last six years I have never had any problem with anybody, I have worked and serve the public attentively,” he told chief magistrate Cosmas Maundu. The court will rule on his bond application on July 8. Edited by R.Wamochie
