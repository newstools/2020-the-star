A Nairobi court has allowed the police to detain a Ugandan and his Kenyan accomplice who were arrested with assorted explosives and detonators. The two were arrested in Chepkatet village, Uasin Gishu county, and police sought to hold them for seven days as they complete investigations The 59-year-old Mohamed Ahmed Bisher and Ugandan Nasanga Ibrahim, aged 68, appeared before Milimani senior resident magistrate Caroline Muthoni. The magistrate allowed the Anti-Terror Unit Police to hold them for one week as they complete investigations. Police corporal Kennedy Karanja told the court the suspects were arrested on July 11 at Chepkatet village in Uasin Gishu county by a team of police officers drawn from Directorate of Criminal investigations, ATPU and SSU. They were arrested after detectives received intelligence reports of their possible involvement in terrorism, surveillance and intended terrorist attack within the country. According to a police affidavit, during the operation they recovered 2kg of TNT explosives, 44 pieces of Nobleâ€™s explosives, seven detonators and high explosives boosters among others. "The items recovered have been forwarded to the Commissioner of Mines and Geology and the Bomb Disposal Unit for forensic examination and the reports are yet to be obtained," PC Karanja said. The investigating officer said investigations were complex and required time and it involved a number of agencies. The suspects, however, opposed being detained, saying they were elderly and sickly. They argued that if detained they were vulnerable to being infected with Covid-19.
