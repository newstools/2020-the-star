Kenya’s capital market recorded a net foreign portfolio outflow of Sh10.3 billion in Q2, 2020 as compared to an inflow of Sh1.1 billion the corresponding quarter last year "This drastic change can be attributed to the panic trading brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic,’’ CMA report said. Even so, average foreign investors' participation in Q2 accounted for 64.6 per cent on the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) compared to 61.1 per cent recorded in Q1, indicating a 3.45 per cent  increase growth. The Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) posted mixed results in the quarter ended June, with the equity turn over dropping by 9. 5 per cent, confirming a decrease in trading activity at the bourse as investors took leave to absorb Covid-19 shocks. However, market capitalisation recorded a 4.38 per cent increase to Sh2.1 trillion compared to Sh2.01 trillion in the first quarter. Volumes traded also increased by 4.51 per cent to 1.42 billion compared to 1.36 billion in the previous quarter.
