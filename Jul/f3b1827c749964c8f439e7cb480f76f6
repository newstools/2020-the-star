@robertomollo3 Tarmacking of a 74km road connecting Homa Bay and Migori counties is starting in 21 days after the project was handed over to the contractor. National Assembly Minority leader John Mbadi handed over the Sh2.83 billion project to China Civil Engineers Construction Corporation. The tarmacking of Mbita-Sindo- Magunga -Sori road had stalled since 2011 after a contractor who won the tender experienced hitches. The hitches came when the company had constructed 7km between Mbita and Sindo towns. Mbadi said the handover had ended the impasse which marred construction of the road. Speaking during handing over at Kiyabuya market, Mbadi said works will take three years. He said the truce between President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga made it easy for them to push for the construction of the road. “The contractor will start the work in 21 days. We thank the government through the handshake which has enabled funding of this project,” Mbadi said. Construction will start at Ogolo Muok village which is the boundary between Homa Bay and Migori counties on the road. The construction will begin from Ogolo Muok towards Sori in Nyatike constituency in Migori. It will proceed towards Kiabuya, Magunga and Sindo trading centres in Suba South constituency, Homa Bay. Mbadi said the road is very important to fishermen and farmers operating around Lake Victoria “Its construction is expected to open the area for economic growth because this constituency has never had a tarmacked road since independence,” Mbadi said. Residents expressed their happiness with the project. Suba South is a chief producer of food crops such as maize, sorghum, and sunflower among others in Homa Bay. Farmer John Omondi said the road will greatly help them in transportation. “Lack of good roads has made us sell our farm produce at throw away prices over fear that they can go bad. Construction of this road will save us,” Omondi said. Edited by R.Wamochie
