The Covid-19 pandemic has affected farmer outreach programmes in Nyandarua, which may have an effect in future production. Nyandarua executive for Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries James Karitu said there was a problem as farmers were normally brought together in small groups for training but this has been slowed down by the pandemic. “We are not able to meet the farmers and therefore interaction in terms of capacity building has been slowed down,” he said. He said potato farmers are normally brought together in groups of between 25 to 30 people in a farmer field business school model, where they are trained on the best practices for maximum yield and soil preservation. The same is also done in the dairy sector to increase milk yields. There are also farmer field days occasionally conducted by the Department of Agriculture. Karitu said for now production has not been affected but it is likely to be affected in future if farmer training programmes do not resume soon. He said individual farmers were still going on with work, and given the rain that continues to be experienced in the region, there was no shortage of food. He said there was no major damage from swarms of locusts that invaded parts of the county earlier in the year, adding that the county was able to act on time and was well prepared should the swarms strike again. “We did aerial spray around Ndaragwa Forest where there were large swarms but they did not do any significant damage,” he said.
