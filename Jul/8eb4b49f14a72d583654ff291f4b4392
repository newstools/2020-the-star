South Eastern Kenya University has kicked off massive production of hand sanitiser for its over 10,000 population of students and staff and for the market. Vice chancellor Geoffrey Muluvi said on Wednesday the institution had invested up to Sh2 million to set up the sanitiser production plant to ensure the safety of the university community during the Covid-19 pandemic. The VC expressed the hope that the investment would  be recouped from the sale of the product not only within the university community but also externally. Muluvi said the textile department  was producing  face masks  that  will be sold to  students as subsidised prices to ward off coronavirus infection. Prof Muluvi spoke at the Seku main campus in Kwa Vonza in Kitui county during the official launch of the mass production of hand sanitiser. He said the university was doing everything possible to ensure it met all the Health ministry protocols to combat Covid-19 ahead of  the  proposed  reopening  of  universities and other tertiary  institutions. “We will have automatic sanitiser gadgets and hand washing machines in various points within the university. Social distancing will be observed not only in lecture halls but even in the hostels and offices,” the VC said. He said since the number of students attending lectures at any time will be drastically reduced due to social distancing, the majority of students will undertake virtual learning. Prof  Muluvi said the university was fully ready for digital learning. A lecturer in the department of physical sciences, Dr Stephen Musyoka, said the institution was producing one of the best sanitiser available following intense research. He said the plant was able to make 1,000 half-litre bottles of sanitiser a day when working at full capacity. Edited by Henry Makori
