Members of Parliament from the Coast Region have accused the Raila Odinga-led Orange Democratic Movement of betraying them over the revenue sharing formula. The 10 lawmakers drawn from Coastal counties named the four Luo Nyanza senators terming them enemies of the Coastal region. Led by ODM’s Owen Baya (Kilifi North), the Coast MPs said by Senators James Orengo (Siaya), Fred Outa (Kisumu), Moses Kajwang’ (Homabay) and Ochillo Ayacko (Migori) voting to deny the region resources is the highest form of betrayal. “The debate and subsequent vote on the Majority Whip Irungu Kangata's amendments on the revenue sharing formula has exposed who our true friends are," Baya said. The lawmaker said the vote exposed the ideological hypocrisy of their so called 'political bedfellows'. “ODM senators from Luo Nyanza threw the Coast under the bus left us on the horns of despair," Baya said. "We wish to tell them that their selfish votes may be celebrated at home because they were to attempt to save BBI and a few million shillings as benefits of handshake. ” The lawmakers noted that the action of the ODM senators will have political ramifications in 2022 adding that the region is considering courting new friends going forward. “Their actions and their votes consequentially mean a divorce to the fraternity at the Coast.” The lawmakers included; Mohammed Ali (Nyali), Michael Kingi (Magarini), Aisha Jumwa (Malindi), Sharif Ali (Lamu East), Andrew Mwadime (Mwatate), Khatib Mwashetani (Lunga Lunga), Jones Mlolwa (Voi) Paul Kahindi (Kaloleni) and Benjamin Taya (Kinango)
