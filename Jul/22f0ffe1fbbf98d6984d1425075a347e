Uganda has withdrawn their hosting bid for the 2020 Fiba Africa Zone Five women’s Club Championships slated for October. Zonal secretary, Vitalis Gode, said they have to go back to the drawing board following the move to pick a new host once things settled. “The Ugandans cited the current coronavirus crisis, saying they can’t guarantee the required financial resources among other things,” Gode said. He said given the uncertainties caused by the coronavirus pandemic, they will continue waiting for the opening up of sports in the region before opening another bid. Kenya were to be represented in the tournament by two giants thus reigning national women champions Equity Bank Hawks and Kenya Ports Authority. The dock women were placed second after they lost to JKL Dolphins during last year’s finals in Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania while the bankers were third. The top two teams from this championship will represent the zone in the Fiba women’s Africa Club Championships to be held next year. This is the first time the women’s show has been detached from the men’s event, which has been swallowed by the inaugural Basketball Africa League. National league champions Ulinzi Warriors will represent the country in the BAL programme which currently hangs in balance.
