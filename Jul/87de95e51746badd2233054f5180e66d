Mau Complex in the Rift Valley is the largest indigenous mountain forest in East Africa. It borders Kericho county to the West, Narok to the South, Nakuru to the North and Bomet to the South West. The evictions of people who have settled on forest land are an effort to save the Mau ecosystem, which the authorities say is threatened by ongoing encroachment, heavy deforestation, and illegal settlements. The Mau issue should be resolved well and for good.Â  This forest should never be used by politicians for their own interests. Those people who bought or sold the land should be followed by the law. We have many poor families who have nowhere to go because of being duped to buy the land in the forest. I know those people are known, and we should not render innocent Kenyans homeless because someone sold the land and even produced valid documents. As we discuss the BBI, let us also remember the many homeless Kenyans whom someone lied to or took advantage of and sold these parcels to them. Respect their human rights and dignity must be protected. Kibet Bernard, Nairobi
