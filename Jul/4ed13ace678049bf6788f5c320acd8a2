Politicians and musicians are among individuals the National Cohesion and Integration Commission is investigating for incitement and hate messages across the country. Thirty-four hate speech cases are either in court or in various stages of investigation, NCIC chairman Samuel Kobia said in Narok. Kobia, who was addressing a media sensitisation workshop a few days ago, said several cases have been heard and determined. He defended the commission from attacks and accusations over perceived ineffectiveness, noting that the NCIC has made great strides in ensuring that those who incite the public are held accountable regardless of their status. The chairman said they have competent staff, some of them seconded from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations. “As a commission we have the ability to deal with warmongers in the country irrespective of the position one holds. We have the right to arrest and charge…it is only the President who is protected by the Constitution,” he said. However, not all statements uttered by politicians or any other personality amounts to incitement. "Our officers investigate the contents of what was uttered before taking any action,” he said. Kobia cautioned media houses and bloggers against conveying information likely to cause a breach of peace as they too will not be spared. The NCIC chairman, who was accompanied by the organisation's acting chief officer Millicent Oketch, Commissioner Philip Okundi, Victor Bwire and Olive Meet, said there were plans to decentralise for the ease of handling cases at county levels. He said it has not been easy for residents to report hate and incitement cases due to unavailability of offices at grassroots level. Offices will be put up in identified regions before the end of the year. One of NCIC mandated is to investigate on its own accord or on request from any institution, office, or person any issue affecting ethnic and racial relations.  - mwaniki fm
