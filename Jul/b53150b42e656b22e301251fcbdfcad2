Manchester City have successfully overturned their two-year ban from European club competitions. The Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) announced the club were cleared of "disguising equity funds" on Monday. Uefa's Club Financial Control Body (CFCB) issued the ban in February after ruling City had committed "serious breaches" of Financial Fair Play (FFP) regulations between 2012 and 2016.
