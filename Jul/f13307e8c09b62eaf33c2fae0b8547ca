Back in the day, there was respect among artistes, Tanzanian singer Lucas Bukeda, alias Mr Nice, says. Speaking to Maina Kageni on his breakfast show yesterday, he said nowadays artistes are 'finishing' each other. He said there are many ways of finishing you and if you don’t have a backup, you end up vanishing into the background, but still, your talent is there. Mr Nice said most artistes are silent because someone is blocking them. "Some were lucky to be helped by Tanzania's former President, the likes of Ray C. But where is she? She was helped and helped up to five or six times and she still failed," he said. "Lady Jay Dee is silent, but I tell you Maina, they are not silent for no reason. Something is happening behind the scenes, I’m telling you, you will find someone has blocked them somehow."
