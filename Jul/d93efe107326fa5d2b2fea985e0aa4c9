KPA acting MD Rashid Salim said the depot is doing well. “We will continue advertising it so that those who are willing to use the depot can seize the opportunity,” Salim said. The depot is meant to reduce congestion at Nairobi ICD and Mombasa port by reducing the number of trucks on the roads and facilitate seamless transshipment of goods to neighbouring countries. The facility with the capacity to hold two million tonnes of cargo annually was handed over to the government on May 7. The contractor - China Communications Construction Company Limited - handed over the project. The Sh6.9 billion facility is established on over 1,000 acres. The Chinese company will, however, remain liable for the project until May 6, 2021, under the defects notification period. On May 22, Transport CS James Macharia announced that all cargo destined for EAC member states of Uganda, Rwanda, northern Tanzania and South Sudan will be transported directly to the facility in record time from the Mombasa port. The move was however not received well by transporters. The Shippers Council of Eastern Africa challenged the government to address outstanding issues at the depot or risk losing trade to Tanzania. Council CEO Gilbert Langat told the Star on the phone that the implementation of a directive to move transit cargo through SGR must be well thought. “We need to develop the internal capacity first before pushing the whole issue to neighbouring countries that may get frustrated and go to Tanzania,” Langat said. The council is a business membership organization that represents the interests of importers and exporters in Kenya and the Eastern Africa region. It provides a platform to articulate their concerns and demands to service providers and government regulatory institutions.
