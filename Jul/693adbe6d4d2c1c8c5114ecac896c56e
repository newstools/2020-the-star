Three crew members narrowly survived after a Kenyan aircraft crashed on Tuesday in Somalia. The aircraft operated by Bluebird Aviation chartered to UN Humanitarian Air Services crashed at Beledweyne town airport before it burst into flames. “Kenyan DHC-8 Dash 8 on operations for UN crashed and burned landing at Beledweyne Airfield, Somalia. The aircraft was on a cargo flight,” a local radio station in Somalia reported. It was still not clear the cause of the accident however local authorities promised to initiate investigations. Officials also raised concern over increased cases involving Kenyan aircraft in Somalia, which are rarely reported. A couple of months ago Ethiopian forces shot down a Kenyan aircraft transporting humanitarian items moments before it tried to land. Six people who were on board died at the Bardale airport which is about 300km northwest of Somalia's capital Mogadishu.
