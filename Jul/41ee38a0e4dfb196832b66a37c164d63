The World Health Organisation has warned that the coronavirus is far from over and that the situation might instead worsen. As the world continues struggling to contain the virus, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has said strong institutions in the respective countries can reduce further effects of the pandemic. Tedros said that among the three points to curb the deadly virus is reducing mortality and suppressing transmission. “We need strong government leadership and coordination of comprehensive strategies that are communicated clearly and consistently,” Tedros said. In a virtual briefing from WHO headquarters in Geneva, Tedros said that the world was caught unprepared by the virus but that it’s not too late to come up with mechanisms to control the pandemic. “There will be no return to the “old normal” for the foreseeable future. But there is a road map to a situation where we can control Covid-19 and get on with our lives. No matter where a country is in its epidemic curve, it is never too late to take decisive action.” According to the figures from Johns Hopkins University, global infections since the coronavirus outbreak began have passed 13 million with 573,288 deaths. Africa has recorded 84,412 cases with 3, 048, Kenya recording 10,971 with 202 `deaths as by July 14, 2020.
