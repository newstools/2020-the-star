Safaricom Home Fibre customers will now be able to stream all their TV channels and internet entertainment on any television. This can be done through an Android TV box for internet streaming. The Android TV box is immediately available at Safaricom Shops and on Masoko at a Sh6,999 offer with no monthly costs. The box is “plug and play” meaning that customers can easily connect it to their TVs and Home WiFi network without need of a technician. It can support up to 4K HD resolution providing viewers with super-clear video clarity. Customers can use their voice to perform different functions on the TV box such as searching for shows, movies or apps. In addition, it can be configured to connect to a Home Fibre WiFi network. It further supports playing back of recorded movies, TV shows and photos through USB flash disks and MicroSD Memory Cards. The Telco said the box is part of a strategy to bring its Home Fibre service to more homes. The TV Box equips any TV with the capability to stream content from YouTube, Netflix, ShowMax, Hulu, Sling and other Android TV Applications. It also enables customers to wirelessly project their smartphone and laptop screens to the TV through screen casting. “The lack of a feature to directly stream content from the internet has previously been a challenge for potential Safaricom Home Fibre customers," CEO Peter Ndegwa said. "The Android TV Box now empowers customers to connect any TV to the internet opening up a world of endless entertainment options for the family." The introduction of the Android TV Box will ease the transition of homes to online entertainment, helping them keep up with their favourite TV channels online. The Home Fibre service remains available to more on *400# with three distinct packages dubbed Bronze, Silver and Diamond tailored to support light, medium and heavy usage respectively.
