Coast-based singer Nyota Ndogo says she is looking for a witchdoctor after a thief stole some valuables from her business premises. Nyota reported to her workplace only to find her small business had been robbed. “Today we arrived at my hotel in the morning and we found the seats out. The thieves stole bananas, five chapatis, cooking gas, two kilos of beans and cooking oil. They tried to carry the freezer but were unable to move it,” she wrote. The singer had just done her shopping for the hotel the day before. “Is Babu Loliondo still there so we catch these thieves at their doorsteps very early in the morning? God is watching. I am going to return my freezer home,” she said. In a previous interview, Nyota said she plans to build rental houses. She is also the proud owner of several tuk-tuks used as PSVs in Voi.
