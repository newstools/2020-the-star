Police in Garissa on Monday stopped a group of activists from protesting against the county government, citing threats to the war on Covid-19. Garissa Community Development Watchdog Group had notified the police on June 26 of a planned demonstration that was scheduled for Monday, June 6, against what they described as wanton corruption allegedly perpetrated by county officials. The activists, led by their chairman Hassan Aden Gumo, said the protest was to push the investigative agencies to probe how devolved funds had been used. However, in a letter to the group on Monday, the police cited the likelihood of getting overwhelmed by the immense number of unemployed youths, a situation they said would hinder efforts against Covid-19 such as social distancing and maintenance of hygiene. In the letter — which was copied to Northeastern regional coordinator Nicodemus Ndalana and other senior security officials — OCS Akare Gababa said they could not rule out the possibility of hooligans taking advantage of the event to influence vulnerable youths. “Kindly seek other avenues to ventilate your raised issues for the sake of Garissa residents who are faced by the Covid-19 pandemic and myriad of other challenges,” the letter reads. "Much as the Constitution guarantees picketing, let it be borne in our minds that coronavirus shall not spare our people, it's upon this premise that I wish to inform you that your request stands denied." But Gumo said the county officials might have had a hand in the cancellation. Undeterred, he said they would go ahead and stop "daylight robbery" by county officials. Gumo said they will seek private prosecution of Governor Ali Korane alleging that he has presided over misappropriation of public funds. "We wanted to protest against corruption, as well as nepotism and lack of transparency in all government operations; even if the protest is cancelled, we will pursue private prosecution,” he said.
