Kenya has recorded 183 new Covid-19 cases, raising the total number to 8,250. This is out of 2,061 samples, Health CS Mutahi Kagwe said on Tuesday. From the cases, 177 are Kenyans while six are foreigners. A total of 119 are males while 64 are females. Kagwe said the youngest is four years and oldest 79. Nairobi leads with 100 cases. He noted that 90 patients have been discharged. However, three deaths have been recorded during the same period. Kagwe warned Kenyans against being irresponsible, adding that the choice is in our hands to do the right thing. This is a new phase altogether. Ask yourself, do I have to enter a crowded place if I can get Covid-19?" he posed. "If you know that in a market place, the person selling you commodities does not care about Coronavirus. Why buy there? Why buy cabbages from a person who is not wearing masks?" Kagwe said Kenyans have a choice, adding that when Kenyans travel upcountry, they take shopping to their relatives but noted that masks and sanitizers should now be included. "Carry masks and take it to them. Among the things you will take to them is a mask and a sanitizer and keep your distance," he said. On Monday, President Uhuru Kenyatta lifted the cessation of movement in Nairobi Metropolitan Area, Mombasa and Mandera counties from Tuesday, June 7, 2020. However, the President extended the nationwide curfew currently in place between 9 pm and 4 am by another 30 days. "By re-opening Nairobi, Mombasa and Mandera, we are more at risk than we were when the restrictions were in place," he said during an address on Monday.
