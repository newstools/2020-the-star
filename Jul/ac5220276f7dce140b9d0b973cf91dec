Nandi Governor Nandi Stephen Sang has warned that Covid-19 is spreading within the community and everyone must play their part to stop it. He emphasised on Tuesday that gatherings would not be allowed and said residents must wear face masks, wash their hands frequently and observe social distancing. Sang was inspecting ICU facilities at the Kapsabet Referral Hospital. “It is now time to tighten our belts and not relax. Covid-19 is here with us spreading within the community. We each have a role to help flatten the curve if we abide by control measures,” he said. The county has recorded seven confirmed cases and Sang said the county would tighten and fully enforce controls. He said the county had complied with the requirement to establish more than 300 beds for handling Covid-19 patients in case of an upsurge in infection. “I am calling on Nandi residents to rise to this challenge to reduce the spread of this virus at this critical time,” the governor said. The county has completed ICU facilities. Seven beds are at Kapsabet County Referral Hospital and three ICU beds are at Nandi Hills County Hospital. “These 10 ICU beds are ready for use. An additional five ICU beds will be available in a month,” Sang said. He said the county has set up 312 isolation beds in health facilities across the subcounties. “All these will enabled the county to meet the directive by President Uhuru Kenyatta that every county set up at least 300 isolation beds,” Sang said. He was joined by county Health executive Ruth Koech and Kapsabet MCA Fred Kipkemboi. Sang said the county was working closely with the national government and neighbouring counties. The county has deployed 12 new ambulances. It has invested more than Sh2 billion to expand health facilities in the last two years. (Edited by V. Graham)
