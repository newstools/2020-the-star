Three former managers of Blue Shield Insurance were on Tuesday charged before a Nairobi court with misappropriation of over Sh10.2 million and attempted disposal of assets. Sammy Mutua, a commissioner of the Issuance Regulatory Authority, John Sifa a statutory manager (Policyholders Compensation Fund) and Eliud Muchoki, also aÂ  manager, denied two counts of attempted fraudulent disposal of the insurance company assets and stealing. The insurance firm has been under statutory management since 2011. The prosecution claims that between July 5, 2015 and July 2016 at Blue Shield Towers in Nairobi, Mutua and Sifa attempted to dispose of the property without approval of the statutory management board. The property was also under moratorium. Sifa and Muchoki were separately accused of stealing Sh10,295,428 from Blue Shield Insurance between September 16, 2011 and July 6, 2014. They came into possession of the cash because of their jobs. The three appeared before Milimani senior principal magistrate Kennedy Cheruiyot. They sought lenient bond terms, saying that they will abide by all conditions set by the court. They said that they are not a flight risk since they have cooperated with investigations into the matter since 2015. The magistrate released them on a cash bail of Sh100,000 each. The case will be mentioned on August 4 for pretrial.
