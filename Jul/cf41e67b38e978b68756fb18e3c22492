Was the hand of a key political figure behind the push to punish a vocal lawmaker from Western region? Details have emerged about how the figure arm-twisted a party leader to hurriedly convene a top party meeting to ratify the decision to punish the fiery legislator. It is reported that the lawmaker became a target of the politician after he was handed a key role that would determine the fate of another influential politico from a politically charged region. The targeted lawmaker has become a key supporter of the Building Bridges Initiative spearhead by President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga making him an enemy of the opposing camp. ** A party leader who has publicly dismissed alleged links with a top political player in the country was recently exposed when a car hire company linked to the man he has disowned gave him a fleet of top-of-the range cars for his homecoming. The man had a motorcade of more than 10 fuel-guzzlers. A search of the registration of the vehicles indicated that they belonged to the company associated with an aide to the top politician. The development has stirred speculation in the party leader's home turf that he is being funded by the politico who is touted as a front-runner in President Uhuru Kenyatta’s succession. It is true that in politics, there are only permanent interests. ** A lawmaker from Nyanza has literally gone into hiding since the outbreak of coronavirus in the country. The lawmaker has only been spotted in his constituency once since the pandemic started. His constituents have been wondering about the whereabouts of their representatives since he also rarely catches the eye of the speaker during National Assembly’s proceedings. The impatient constituents have now resorted to expressing their frustrations on the local vernacular radio stations to smoke the MP out.
