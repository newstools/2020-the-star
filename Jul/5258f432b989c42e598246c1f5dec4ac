 ANC has warned its MPs against associating with Deputy President William Ruto and instead asked the lawmakers to support President Uhuru Kenyatta's agenda both in and outside Parliament. The resolution was reached at a party parliamentary group meeting on Wednesday. "We resolved that our focus will be to strengthen Musalia Mudavadi as the strongest presidential candidate in Western to go out and form coalitions with other communities so he can ascend to power," deputy party leader Ayub Savula said. Both Uhuru loyalists and Ruto's allies have been courting Mudavadi. On Saturday, Mudavadi said he was open to working with everybody including the DP as long as he supports his presidential bid. Mudavadi has been meeting elected leaders and business people at his Musalia Mudavadi Communication Center in Nairobi for the last two months. He and his Ford Kenya counterpart Moses Wetang'ula on one hand and Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya and Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa on the other have been holding parallel meetings in Western in recent weeks as they campaign for the elusive Luhya unity. While Oparanya and Eugene have said they are lobbying for development to the region, Mudavadi's camp is consolidating support for his 2022 bid. Savula, who is the chairman of the ANC parliamentary group, said lawmakers also mandated Mudavadi to seek audience with Uhuru to solicit his support given he is the de facto leader of the Mt Kenya region. Savula said MPs and MCAs who were elected on ANC and Ford Kenya tickets will form a working alliance to consolidate Mudavadi's support base in Western. The PG also resolved not to attack Oparanya, Eugene and Cotu boss Francis Atwoli going forward.Â  "We instead will continuously urge them to join the Musalia bandwagon," Savula said.  Edited by P.O
