There should be no hurry to physically go to church, Health CS Mutahi Kagwe has said. Speaking during a press briefing in Kilifi on Friday, Kagwe urged Kenyans not to rush to go back to church because chances of contracting the virus may increase. “There is no hurry to go back to church, there is no hurry to get to heaven. You can worship at home and your prayers will still be heard, so we should not want to rush to get back to our places of worship,” he said. He added that elderly people with underlying conditions are more likely to get infected. “Someone who is 65 or 62 like me and they have underlying conditions should be careful and should opt to stay at home because you’ll go to church, get into contact with someone with the virus and end up in hospital. The church is not going anywhere," the CS said. Kenya on Friday recorded the highest number of cases with 473 people having tested positive for Covid-19 in the last 24 hours, bringing the total number of positive cases to 9,473 . Of the cases, 324 are male while 149 are female with the youngest being a one-year-old while the oldest is 90 years old. In the case of recoveries, the country has witnessed 76 recoveries. Sadly, the country has lost eight more people, bringing the total number of fatalities to 181.
