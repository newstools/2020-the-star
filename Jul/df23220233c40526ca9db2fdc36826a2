Yesterday, radio personality Felix Odiwuor, alias Jalang'o, joined Kamene Goro on Kiss FM, where they will be hosting 'The Morning Kiss' and were trending at number one. Back in the day, Jalang'o debuted his radio career on Kiss FM, hosting a show with the legendary Caroline Mutoko. "I am ready to work. I want to thank God for this amazing opportunity and start this journey with Him. People are being sacked left, right and centre and I am being employed. If it is not God, then who can it be? I hope we make history," he said. "Let's make radio great again," Kamene added. Jalang'o went on to tease Kamene. "It looks really nice. I will be waking up and you are the person I'll be seeing everyday, hotness reloaded." While at it, the two spoke about relationships after Will Smith's wife Jada Pinkett Smith recently confirmed she was in an 'entanglement' with rapper August Alsina. Jalang'o said, "They were tired of each other from the word go, but she (Jada) chose to stay for other reasons. How can you say you want to find your happiness after 25 years? Why did it take you so long to realise you were unhappy? "Such things can only happen in America and not in Africa. The thing you should be looking for is why Will Smithâ€™s wife decided to stray after 25 years. If you are unhappy tell me in the first or second month, or leave. "The root cause of all evil is money. If a man takes a woman away, I can't do anything but look for money. "But money wasn't a problem. If a broke man takes your girlfriend and you have money, it is worse. Women want time, want to be appreciated, but when you are hustling, you don't have time for your girlfriend." Jalang'o and Kamene are set to take the radio industry by storm.
