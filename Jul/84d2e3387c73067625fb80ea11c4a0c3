Kiss FM co-host Jalang’o has offered to pay first-year school fees for ex-Churchill Show comedian Paul Wakimani Ogutu. This was during a live interview on Jalang'o TV, where Wakimani said the only help he needed was to go back to school and study journalism. Wakimani shared his story of getting into depression after being sued over the death of fellow comedian Ayeiya, who died in an accident from a car he was driving. "Right now I would really like to go back to school, ndio tumecheka about it but venye nimeamua nataka kurudi chuo nikisharudi poa. Cha ukweli, sina fee, yenye sahizi kama kunaeza kuwa na msee anataka kunipeleka chuo niende tu nisome, hata kama ni loan ntarudisha,” he said. Jalang’o said he is going to pay school fees for his first year of study, and Wakimani Ogutu can continue paying his own fees from the second year. He added he will speak to the Dean at Daystar University and have him registered for his course of choice, where he will attend classes in the evening and work during the day. “Si story na loan, saa hizi mtihani imeanza Daystar tunafanya online, so what I want to promise you ni, in the next intake, I’ll pay for your first year," he said. "I’ll register you and pay for your first year. Once I’ve paid for your first year, hii ingine utakuwa ukihustle ukijilipia. So you hustle during the day, jioni unaenda class."
