Shipping and Maritime Affairs PS Nancy Karigithu has expressed disappointment that many young women are losing jobs owing to unplanned pregnancies. She said many of them are unable to take up jobs immediately after graduating from colleges and universities due to pregnancy. “I urge girls and young women to be very cautious and avoid reckless sex which might lead to accidental pregnancies,” Karigithu said. The PS was speaking while launching the Kazi Mtaani programme at the Embu stadium. The project will benefit 2,890 youths from informal settlements in the county. The youths who are drawn from selected 18 informal settlements across the county will be working for 11 days every month. Karigithu called upon the youth to dedicate themselves to the programme for their own benefit and avoid being too choosy as white colour jobs are dwindling. She said those who qualify should consult with their leaders for them to be considered in the Blue Economy youth programme. The government is prioritising the Blue Economy project which has not been fully utilised, Karigithu said, adding that there is an opportunity for those who have qualified in artisan courses. County commissioner Abdullahi Galgalo and county secretary Jason Nyaga promised to give the youth all the necessary assistance to render the services but asked them to be committed and disciplined. Galgalo urged them to use the money from the programme prudently, advising against illegal activities. Edited by R.Wamochie
