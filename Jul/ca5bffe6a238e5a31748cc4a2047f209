Pastor Robert Burale has been discharged from hospital after he tested positive of the coronavirus. One of his friends, identified as Nina Njoroge, announced his release on social media. “Robert Burale is in his house. Covid is real. I’m grateful to everyone who prayed with me. Blessings,” she said. She was backed up by Karol Tunduli, an ally of the pastor, who posted a photo with him and captioned, "Now we can talk and laugh at your new name when CS Kagwe called you Robert Murathe!" Burale announced to his fans through his social media platforms last week that he was admitted at Nairobi Hospital after he tested positive of the virus. He urged Kenyans to be vigilant and observe the guidelines given by the government to prevent them from contacting the disease.
