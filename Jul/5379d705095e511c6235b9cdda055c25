Butali Warriors' forward Frank Wanangwe has revealed he misses the Kenya Hockey Union Premier League. The pacey striker relocated to the United States earlier this year  after landing a job. Wanangwe missed the second leg last season through nagging knee injury that has kept him out since September. He, however, remains defending champions Butali player. Wanangwe was the unsung hero when his brace helped the sugar millers beat rivals Kenya Police to win the 2018 title on the final day. The double powered the then Denis Owoka-tutored side to their third league title. The former Strathmore Gladiators lynchpin who is not in a hurry to return to action, said he can only do so after he fully recovers. "Honestly, I miss the KHU league but you know I have an injury which I am managing. I don't think I will play competitively till I feel better. It is hard to prevent an injury but I hope my legs would still support me. The wonderful moments on the field always jogs my memory," he noted. Wanangwe is a brother to the prolific Sikh Union striker Davis Wanangwe who has also had an injury-laden career.  Davis is a former Kenya International  who retired in 2014 after incurring a  knee injury. Davis was forced to take a six-months break in 2018, owing to the same problem. The 29-year-old was again unavailable from October last year and his absence dealt the historic club a piston-thrust blow as the team was relegated to the second tier.  Davis, who is the captain however, expects the team to bounce back and take their place in the top tier.
