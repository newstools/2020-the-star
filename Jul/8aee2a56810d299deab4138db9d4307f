Nairobi Metropolitan Service Director General Mohammed Badi has warned Governor Mike Sonko against occupying the former mayor’s residence in Lavington. Badi on Tuesday accused Sonko of politicizing the matter after NMs announced it will be renovating the residence and all county houses. The DG noted that the house had been vacant for almost two years and has not been repossessed prior to NMS announcement. Badi accused Sonko of politicising the matter, saying that prior to NMS’ repossession of the property, it had been vacant for over two years. “The Lavington residence is not the only house we are repairing. There are several others. Why Sonko decided to feud over that one I do not know. I cannot answer on his behalf,” Badi stated. The NMS Boss further said that the property was now under tight security and warned the governor against accessing it. However, he revealed that once the renovations are complete, the governor can move into the residence. “We are taking up all county houses that are dilapidated. We want to build them so that more staff will have more housing. If he (Sonko) wants to enter it, he should wait for us to rebuild it. After all, it belongs to the county," Badi said. Last week, Sonko announced he would convert the Lavington residence into the official governor’s residence.
