Tigania East MP Gichunge Kabeabea has scoffed at clerics who claimed the power to heal other diseases but cannot cure Covid-19 patients. Kabeabea said the false preachers had deceived many to flock to their congregations but the virus has now locked them in their houses, jut like the faithful. However, bishops and other Tigania East clerics said the power to heal only comes from God. They spoke at EAPC Mikinduri Church and St Angelas Girls Secondary School where the MP donated 700 thermo-guns worth Sh4 million to churches and mosques. The MP urged pastors, bishops and clergy to pray but also sensitise residents to adhere to Health ministry protocols to contain the virus. Karanja Njoa thanked the MP for donating the gadgets. He said many churches had been hard hit by the disease. The lawmaker pleaded with President Uhuru Kenyatta to lock down counties reporting high cases of Covid-19 to avoid overstretching the hospitals further. Kabeabea said a friend who had wanted to sell him land died in three days of contracting the virus. “We are headed in the wrong direction. The numbers are skyrocketing... Many have stopped projects that allow people to get money. Construction sites no longer give jobs to our youths due to uncertainty,” Kabeabea said.
