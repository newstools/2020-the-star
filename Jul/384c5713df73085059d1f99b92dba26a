Chiefs, village elders and members of Nyumba Kumi community policing initiative in Kisii county will pursue men who impregnate schoolgirls to face the law. Under a multi-agency programme launched by Kisii County Education Board, girls who have become pregnant during the prolonged school closure due to coronavirus will be identified. Board chairman Henry Onderi said the teams will identify the men responsible for teenage pregnancies so that they can be arrested and prosecuted. “The multi-agency child protection model will profile the number of schoolgirls who have been impregnated in the entire county during this period of prolonged school closure,” Onderi told the Star on phone. The director of Jaramogi Oginga Odinga University Kisii campus said the county would not allow individuals to ruin the future of girls. “Lives of the girls are under threat. That is why we are going to work tirelessly to protect them from the perpetrators,” he said. Onderi blamed parents for nor properly guiding the girls while at home. He noted with concern that parents leave their phones with girls which they use to watch pornographic sites. “I am urging our parents to monitor closely what the girls do with their phones. They should realise that the children use the phones to watch funny things in the pretext they are revising,” he said. Kisii is among the counties with high numbers of teenage pregnancies, according to statistics released by the Ministry of Education in March this year. The statistics showed that out of the 11,950 girls who fell pregnant, 2,885 of them were in primary school while 9,065 were in secondary. Bungoma topped the list of the counties with the highest teenage pregnancies with 1,080, trailed by Kakamega with 1,018 and Kisii with 1,015. Other devolved units with high cases include Kisumu (641), Elgeyo Marakwet (509) and Trans Nzioa (508).  Edited by Henry Makori
