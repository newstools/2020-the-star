A 15-year-old boy accused of killing a girl in Rachuonyo South was on Monday given a Sh200,000 bond by the High Court in Homa Bay. The Form 1 student at a local secondary school is accused of murdering an 11-year-old girl on June 19. The boy denied the charges before Justice Joseph Karanjah. The pathologists who conducted the postmortem at Rachuonyo Level 4 Hospital in Oyugis town said the girl died of profuse bleeding, which caused her heart to collapse. The report also indicated that the girl was hit with a blunt object on her right ribs, fracturing three. The blood on the right side of the chest affected crucial internal organs such as the heart, causing instant death. The case will be heard on October 13 and the boy will be remanded at Manga Juvenile Children’s home in Kisii until the bond is raised. The boy is reported to have killed the girl after an altercation in a cattle grazing field. The girl's mother accused the suspect and his younger brother of teasing her daughter as they were grazing. She claimed the boys attacked the girl and her sister with stones and a wooden rod before the latter ran away. The girl's body body was found in a maize plantation in the village three days later. “The assailants disappeared after killing and dragging my daughter into the maize farm,” the mother said. Last week, area police commander Esau Ochorokodi said they arrested the boy after evidence linked him to the death. “We’ve been conducting our investigations which revealed the boy is a key suspect in the murder,” Ochorokodi said.
