Parents are to blame for the increased cases of teenage pregnancies and early marriages during the Covid-19 pandemic, nominated MP Dennitah Ghati said on Friday. She said police and chiefs are not to blame because parents have neglected their responsibility of guiding their children. "What police and chiefs should do is to compliment their [parents] job,” she said. Ghati said the current economic meltdown should not be an excuse for parents to stop caring for their children. The legislator said the fact that children will stay home longer before schools reopen in January is a cause for worry. “We have a fresh six months before schools reopen and all stakeholder must come together,” Ghati said. “Parents should be keen in finding out where there children are. The government may offer a shoulder through laws, but won't do parenting.” Ghati told the Star on the phone that parents are the first line of defence in the war on teenage pregnancy and sexual abuse. She urged police and chiefs to help in reported cases and apprehend parents who seek to settle cases of teen pregnancy, marriage and sexual crimes outside the court.
