We are heading towards a referendum and Kenyans should prepare for it despite Covid-19, Western professionals led by Governor Wilber Ottichilo's former chief campaigner Joseph Simekha said Simekha said Kenyans must adopt the situation at hand and go on with life adding that Covid-19 is no joke, thus the requirement of high standards of discipline  during the referendum. The professionals were speaking at Ebunangwe Resort in Emuhaya subcounty on Friday. "Other nations have conducted their elections in a proper way with high standards of discipline. France and Malawi have done so nicely and Tanzania is heading there as well," Simekha said. “If Kenyans are given an opportunity to vote, don’t ignore the state orders on coronavirus, we have seen the damage the virus has done globally,” he said. On the Building Bridges Initiative, Simekha said it is not just about leadership but also improving the economy. The professionals said there is a need for them to take part in the report to ensure Kenyans are not misled by politicians. They said BBI also aims at strengthening devolution that has faced challenges since its inception. Simekha said the report should be provided to Kenyans to read and make decisions without any influence from the political class. “We want to rectify our mistakes to ensure we are part of the government come 2022, political leadership has been on the opposition for long and it’s time for to part of the incoming government."
