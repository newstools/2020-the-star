A civil society wants the Coast Water Works chair and a board member restrained from discharging their duties. The Commission for Human Rights and Justice claims that Former Kilifi South Mustafa Idd sits on the board with his wife Amina Mnyazi. The group said the two have turned the agency into a ‘family utility’ thus causing conflict of interest. They want the Employment and Labour Court to bar the couple from conducting any board meetings or implementing any board decision. The lobby wants conservatory orders issued against authorising payment for all mileage claims made by the duo. It wants the court to order for investigations into the mileage claims. According to affidavits filed by the group on June 30, Idd and Mnyazi were appointed last year February by the Water CS to serve for three years. The group said after their appointment, the duo got married and are currently living as husband and wife. Through director Julius Ogogoh, the lobby said Idd has been claiming mileage using a vehicle used by Mnyazi yet he has an official vehicle provided by the agency. The group further said Idd cannot be trusted to preside over board meetings and make any impartial decision as it will present conflict of interest between his family and the public. “It is on record that a man and his wife cannot preside over the same public agency without causing conflict of interest. The duo failed to disclose the existence of their marriage.” The duo has been sued alongside the firm's CEO, State Corporate Advisory Committee, EACC and the Attorney General. The petitioners further want the CEO to be investigated for approving the mileage claims by both Idd and his wife. Edited by R.Wamochie
