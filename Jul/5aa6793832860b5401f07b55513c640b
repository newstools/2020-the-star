A Nandi hospital and a police station have been closed after a nurse and two police officers tested positive for Covid-19. The Meteitei sub-county hospital nurse arrived at the facility displaying signs of  Covid-19 and after being tested was found to be positive. She was taken to an isolation centre. The police officers based at Kabiyet were found to be positive of the disease during routine tests by the Nandi county health department. The station was shut and the officers moved to a private isolation facility and the search for their contacts started. Some of the crime suspects were transferred to other police cells and others bonded. Nandi Health CEC Ruth Koech said the nurse had just arrived from her rural home in Busia and complained of being unwell. She was tested and found to have Covid-19. “She’s in stable condition in isolation. As a department we will ensure she receives the necessary support to overcome the challenge,” Koech said, adding that the medic had minimal contact with her colleagues. The hospital was closed as a precautionary measure to allow fumigation and tracing of contacts. “The facility has been fumigated as at now and services will resume as soon as possible once the health workers have been handed a clean bill of health,” Koech said. She said there should be no cause to panic. "Our patients are safe,” she added. In June, Songhor police station was closed for two weeks after a capital offence remandee and nine suspects tested positive. The remandee later escaped while at Nandi Hills Subcounty Hospital isolation ward. He is yet to be re-arrested.   - mwaniki fm
