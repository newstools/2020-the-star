Good morning Felly, I hope you are well. I enjoyed your article on the Star today especially because I am a 24-year-old lady who craved growing up in order to enjoy adult responsibilities like marriage and having babies. I turned 24 on 3rd January and a veil was lifted off my face. I realised that I needed to love the young girl in me who did not feel loved. Bringing that hurt little girl to marriage would have been terrible. I got myself a vision board and enrolled in classes to deal with that little girl. I am enjoying my work, learning to breathe in and enjoy my youth. So thank you for reminding me that I am on the right path. Have a great day ahead. Warm Regards, Wanjiru Dear Wanjiru, First of all, can I send you tight virtual hugs? Listen, there is no hurry. Like I always say, learn from the older ones life is too short to make your own mistakes. Learn from other people’s mistakes. I recently found a picture of myself as a little girl. I must have been five or six. I am seated on a chair and looking at the camera. I have big eyes so I can almost see into my soul. Ever since I found that picture, I am making different choices for myself. I invite you Wanjiru to get a picture of yourself as a little girl, under ten. Please really look at that picture. You are someone’s child, someone’s little girl. Someone thinks you are precious. Before you commit to anything, look at that picture. The decision you are making in whatever circumstance, go back to that picture of you as a little girl. Is it what you want for that girl? Because you are that girl. All the best in your journey. Love, light and joy.
