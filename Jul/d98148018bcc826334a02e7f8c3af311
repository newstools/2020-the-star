The government has started a sensitisation programme for parents and schoolchildren in Lari constituency in the war on teenage pregnancies. Lari Scheme chief George Kahonoki said this follows a report a high number of girls who have become pregnant after schools were closed to control the spread of the coronavirus. “We aim at reaching parents and schoolchildren to enlighten them on the dangers of engaging in early sex,” Kahonoki said. Nyumba Kumi official Lucia Njoka advised girls not to wear very tight clothes, saying this is what attracts boys and men to them. She spoke at Gospel Family church on Saturday where Kahonoki had invited 20 secondary schoolgirls and their mothers for a seminar. He was accompanied by assistant chiefs Alice Ngugi (Ruiru) and Gerald Thuku (Uplands). Kahonoki said they had placed washing points and had arranged the seats two metres apart to observe social distancing during the seminar. The chief said they will soon invite boys and their fathers for a similar talk. Lari deputy county commissioner Aaron Koros said they had empowered Nyumba Kumi officials to assist chiefs and their assistants in reaching out to schoolgirls and their parents. Recently, the Kenya Health Information survey indicated that a total of 3,964 girls of 19 years and below had gotten pregnant between the months of March and June. Last week, President Uhuru Kenyatta warned that once a DNA is conducted, the man involved will face full wrath of the law. Edited by A.N
