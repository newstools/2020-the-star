Kisumu Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o has expressed concerns that most residents are disobeying the Covid-19 measures put in place by the government. He said residents are gradually resuming their normal lives despite the rising cases in the country. Nyong’o said Kisumu is at risk of recording more infections because many people are now moving to various destinations following the reopening of hotspot counties. “The virus is real. We are appealing to our people to take responsibility to contain the spread,” he said. He said the rising number of cases could soon overwhelm isolation centres in the devolved unit. The governor spoke during the launch of a joint Covid-19 mitigation drive spearheaded by the UN-Habitat and the Kisumu government to benefit thousands of residents living in informal settlements in Kisumu town. They will receive 15 handwashing stations, sanitiser and masks. The programme, also supported by the Civil Society Urban Development Platform, will educate people on the importance of protecting themselves. “I wish to thank the UN-Habitat for this programme, which aims to escalate awareness in Covid-19 safety guidelines in areas such as Nyalenda A and B, Manyatta A and B, Obunga, Nyamasaria and Kondele,” Nyong’o said. Deputy Governor Mathews Owili urged residents to change their attitude and follow the rules. “There is no way we can win this battle if we don’t strictly abide by the rules,” he said. Edited by A.N
