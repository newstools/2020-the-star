The government has started transferring police officers from Rioma police station in Marani subcounty, Kisii, after a cop allegedly shot dead a trader in a holding cell on Sunday. County commissioner Stephen Kihara said on Thursday that the transfer drive will end by Monday. The trader, who sells sanitiser at Rioma market, had been arrested for not wearing a mask and taken to the holding cell, where he was shot in the head. He succumbed to the injuries while still in the holding cell. The cell is manned by county government officers. The shooting sparked a two-day protest - Sunday and Monday. Angry protesters torched part of Rioma police station on Sunday. Kihara said the officer who shot the trader has been arrested. "The probe into the incident is going on but the officer who shot the trader has been arrested," he told the Star. The administrator said even after the arrest of the officer, the planned overhaul of security officers will continue. It is not clear how many police officers will transferred. "The overhaul has started and we will not stop until all rogue officers are identified and isolated," Kihara said. All rogue officers who misuse firearms will be acted on, he added. Kihara said the government is doing everything possible to ensure the family of the victim gets justice. The government has since engaged elders, youth and traders from the area with the aim of restoring calm. Kihara spoke at Nyanchwa in Kisii during the recruitment drive of the youth for the Kazi Mtaani initiative. At least 3,009 youth from across the four informal settlements in Kisii town will be recruited, Kihara said.
