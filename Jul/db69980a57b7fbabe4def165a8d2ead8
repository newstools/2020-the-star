The Kwale health department is planning to launch a mobile clinic exercise to serve remote villages that have difficulty accessing health services. This comes after Kaza Moyo residents in Kinango subcounty complained about missing out on crucial health services due to the location of the village. Health executive Francis Gwama said the county will deploy mobile clinics in the targeted areas to cushion residents who have to cover long distances to seek treatment. “Starting with Kaza Moyo, we are going to move in very quickly so that they can get relief and at least get some of the important medical amenities,” he told the Star on the phone. The mobile clinic is expected to provide immunisation jabs, maternal services and treatment of common diseases like malaria and flu among others. Gwama said patients who require advanced treatment will be referred to subcounty hospitals with the aid of the department. The clinics will be conducted at least three times a week in a rotational mode. Gwama, however, said the mobile clinic was already an ongoing programme but they will identify areas whose services are crippled. “We normally have the outreaches where the treatment services are offered on a monthly basis and if they have stopped in some areas, I am going to find out why and intervene." He also advised residents to attend public participation forums to propose crucial projects. Gwama said citizens have the power to convince the government to construct health facilities where they want them.  Edited by R.Wamochie
