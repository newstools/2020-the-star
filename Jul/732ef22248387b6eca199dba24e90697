Gospel singer Betty Bayo once bleached herself to please a man she loved. Posting on Facebook, she said the man wanted a light skin and so the only option she had was to buy products that would lighten her skin. However, the man did not marry her. "I once fell in love with a young man I was sure he will marry me," she wrote. "I loved and adored him, he claimed he loved me too and he would marry me if only I was light-skinned (rangi ya thau) I decided to remove my legs from the sack, Mimi huyoo River Road. "I bleached my skin to make him happy. The next thing he told me he will marry me if only I was a bit taller. Weee my friend nlikua natembea na high heels throughout karibu niende nazo kwa choo tu." Along the way the man dumped her, leaving her confused. "Yellow face, black legs, blue hands, had no choice than to go back to factory setting," she said. She encouraged women to trust in God for a life partner. "Any person who compares you with other people and forces you to be who you are not, who always lowers your self-esteem and still claims he or she loves you, is a scam," she said.
