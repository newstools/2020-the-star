Three Mara Serena Hotel staffers have tested positive for the coronavirus in Kisii county. The hotel is in Transmara West in Narok county but the three had sought testing at the Lancet Medical Laboratories in Kisii before resuming work. Kisii county public health boss Richard Onkware said the trio's samples were taken on July 11. Governor James Ongwae said his administration was alert to possible surge in infections following the easing of restrictions on movement. “We are already cooperating with the national government, besides partnering with stakeholders to ensure that all the measures given by the Ministry of Health are adhered to," he said in a statement to newsrooms. Ongwae, however, took issue with the Wednesday ministry briefings which placed the three hoteliers in Kisii instead of Narok where they are based. “I wish to clarify that the said Covid-19 positive cases involve three hoteliers who are non-Kisiis aged 27, 28 and 38 working at Mara Serena Hotel in Narok county where they reside,” he said. Kisii has registered only six cases, five of whom have since been treated and discharged. “I wish to report that as a county we are well prepared to face an outbreak which we, however, wish doesn’t happen," he said. The county has prepared a 310-bed isolation centre at the Kisii Teaching and Referral Hospital and 20 ventilators fitted. More medical facilities have also been upgraded and equipped in readiness for a possible rise in infection. Ongwae said the county was supplying over 1 million free face masks and other essentials like sanitiser and detergents. The health staff also have enough PPE, including surgical N-95 masks. The county has also erected water tanks along the streets of Kisii town to facilitate handwashing for members of the public. (edited by o. owino)
