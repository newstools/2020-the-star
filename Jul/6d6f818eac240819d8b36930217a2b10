The Ministry of Health has said a surge in coronavirus cases will not overwhelm  facilities. Health CAS Mercy Mwangangi on Thursday said the government has put in place enough mechanisms to handle the situation. “It takes a lot to be able to say we’ve reached the point of being overwhelmed and I do not envision a point at which we would ever be overwhelmed,” Mwangangi said. This comes as the country confirmed another 796 cases in the last 24 hours, taking the total number of cases to 15,601 out of 261,027 samples that have been tested since March 13. This is the highest number of cases recorded on a single day. The government started implementing home-based care for Covid-19 patients in June to reduce the number of people in health facilities. Home-based care was prompted by the fact that the majority of cases are either asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic. County governments have also been asked by the government to improve health facilities at the grassroots level. The government had cautioned health facilities against turning away patients due to lack of beds. The government said such a move would be putting patients at more risk amid rising cases of the coronavirus.
