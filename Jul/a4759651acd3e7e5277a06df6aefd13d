Religious leaders from Narok county have urged the government to loosen the rules on church services because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Clerics under the Narok Pastors Fellowship said the regulations put up by the state were too tight and almost impossible to apply. “The rule on only 100 persons attending a church service at a go is not applicable because some churches have as many as 5,000 members. Now who will attend and who should be left behind,” said Fellowship’s Secretary Bishop Peter Nakola. Speaking during a church service at Ololulunga Full Gospel church on Sunday, Nakola said most of the church elders and leaders were above 60 years and are the ones at the frontline in leading the service. “We want the service to take longer than only one hour so that we can have a proper worship session. However, we are grateful to the government for re-opening the churches,” he said. Most of the churches services resumed yesterday after the government stopped them following outbreak of Covid-19 in March. Meanwhile, the clerics have opposed the proposed Reproductive Health Bill saying it will normalise sex among teenagers. Nakola said they will not support the bill, which is being sponsored by Nakuru Senator Susan Kihika, noting it will encourage immorality among teenagers and could impact negatively on the society. He called for a consultative forum on the proposed law especially in the grassroots as it was against cultural and religious believes. “The Bill in its current form seems to encourage teen sex by using contraceptives, which will lead to premature sex. We need to be very careful so that we may not seem to be permitting teenagers to engage in sex,” Nakola said.
