He graduated from Columbia with a Master of Arts in Business and Economics Journalism on May 20. He announced on his social media accounts his first story is about the inner workings of a Covid-19 intensive care unit. He wrote, “ Some personal news. A year after I took a career break, I’m back to reporting. I’m doing a new thing as a US correspondent, covering this pivotal moment in America for the BBC News and BBC World Service. My first story, from inside a Covid-19 ICU, airs today across the BBC.”
