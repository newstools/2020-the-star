A city lawyer has urged the Law Society of Kenya to give activist Okiya Omtatah honorary membership due to his many achievements in public interest litigation for over 10 years. In his notice of motion to the LSK, Ochiel Dudley says he will move a motion at the AGM on July 23 for a special resolution to grant Omtatah honorary membership. Omtatah is not a lawyer, though he is involved in litigation, which takes up much of his time. He is also a playwright and an author, which pays the rent. Honorary member is a ceremonial title conferring no right to practice, vote or hold office within the LSK. Dudley said under the LSK Act, the society's council may elect to honour a deserving person as an honorary member of the Society either for life or not He argues that Section 4 of the Act obliges the society to safeguard the public in legal matters. Dudley asked why the activist, who has litigated so many matters helpful to society, has never been given honorary membership. In July 2018, the Law Society of Kenya complained that Omtatah was taking lawyers’ jobs through his many filings of public interest litigation. “Rightly or wrongly, Okiya Omtatah has since 2010 chased constitutionalism, the rule of law and administration of justice through public interest litigation,” Dudley said. He said Omtatah’s litigation has shaped the law in all areas and touched many Kenyans’ lives. His work has included judicial independence, public appointments and procurement, land issues, the rights to health, a clean and healthy environment and free and fair elections, among other issues. “So it is fair that the Society considers recognising and honouring Omtatah for his assistance to the public, which is consistent with the LSK’s goal under Section 4,” the notice of motion reads.
