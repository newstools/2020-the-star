Different people have continued to condole with the family of Lari sub county chairman for community policing Peter Kiugu, who passed away following a fatal road accident at Mathore area on the Nairobi Nakuru highway. Area deputy sub county police commander Charles Opondo said Kiugu was driving home on Friday night, when he rammed on a stationary lorry near Exxen petrol station. Opondo said the lorry had hit a pickup and landed in a ditch. “It was at time when our chairman arrived at the scene but his efforts to slow down were futile as his car skid and rammed on the lorry from the back since it was drizzling and it was also foggy,” he explained. The police boss said Kiugu was removed and together with the lorry loader, were rushed to AIC Kijabe Mission Hospital, but the chairman was pronounced dead on arrival. The loader sustained serious legs injuries and was admitted. The lorry driver and the pickup driver that had landed in a ditch also survived unhurt. Kiugu, who was also the vice chairman of Limuru Court Users Committee, was described as a brave, enlightened man who spoke his heart without fear.
