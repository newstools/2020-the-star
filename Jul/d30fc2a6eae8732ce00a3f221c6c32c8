City dwellers will soon be able to enjoy recreational facilities at the Michuki Memorial Park, with restoration and rehabilitation works almost complete. The 26-acre park was handed to Kenya Forest Service in April, as one of the several green spaces in Nairobi that will now be under the central government. The journey to change the park began when President Uhuru Kenyatta caught sight of the park from the K24 studios during an interview. The Environment ministry has been undertaking the rehabilitation works at the park in conjunction with various partners.
