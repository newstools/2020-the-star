Several families in Nyamira are now going without food after the breadwinners were sentenced to mandatory quarantine. The Star visited two families where the parents were thrown into quarantine after they were arrested while returning home past curfew time or without a face-mask. Nancy (not her real name), a mother of four, is serving quarantine at Sironga Girls High School in Nyamira South after she was found along a road without a face mask a week ago. Her mother-in-law, who is now taking care of her four children, says Nancy was the breadwinner since her (Nancy's) husband died two years ago. “I have really struggled a lot to provide for these children having in mind that the economic crisis has hit our country and almost everyone is suffering,” she said. In another incident, Faith (not her real name) was quarantined a week ago after she was found without a face mask while in Nyamira Town. According to her mother, Fridah Bosibori, Faith is the source of income for her two old parents. Bosibori said since their daughter went to quarantine, they are facing problems. “My daughter works in an hotel in Nyamira Town and I do remember last week after she called me and informed me that she had been quarantined after she was found without a face mask. At our age we cannot get out and look for food to eat since we are too old without strength to work even on our farm,” said his father. The Star established that in Nyamira County, more families are suffering after the bread winners were quarantined for the 14 days .
