Three elderly people have been killed with pangas in three weeks in Kwale county and police fear the trend is increasing as people want their property. County police commander Joseph Nthenge said the three have been killed in Matunga, Lunga Lunga and Kinango constituencies. “For the last 21 days we have had cases of grey-haired people being killed,” he said. The victims were between the ages of 60 and 80. Calling the situation alarming, he said a certain gang attacks elderly people during the night and slashes them to death with pangas. The motive is not known and investigations are underway. It has been about six months since the last killing of an elderly person in Kwale; a number of killings took place. Police boss Nthenge said investigations into the previous killings revealed most were prompted by land inheritance issues and suspicion of witchcraft. He advised youth to engage in honest business and not to target elderly people for early property inheritance. Covid-19 has worsened the economy and people may be driven to get property and money dishonestly. The police boss warned residents to solve their differences through peaceful dialogue and avoid bloodshed. “Taking someone’s life won’t help you with anything. If it’s about land, why don’t you try address the problem amicably using the right channels?” he asked. Nthenge said police won’t tolerate bloodshed and perpetrators will be pursued at any cost and charged in court. He urged residents to furnish information leading to the arrest of any culprits linked to the murders, whether the killers themselves or possibly people hiring them. (Edited by V. Graham)
