The construction of a 20, 000 capacity Siaya Stadium is nearing completion. The works being done by Chinese firm Jiangsu Provincial Construction Company Limited started in 2018 and will cost Sh390 million. According to Governor Cornel Rasanga, the construction is at 90 per cent complete. The remaining works include planting of grass and installation of seats with the process having being slowed by the advent of the coronavirus pandemic, he noted. “Construction works are ongoing though with a few workers due to government guidelines on social distancing. Importation of some materials from China has also been delayed by the coronavirus pandemic,” he said in a statement. “The construction will seek to increase access for all Siaya residents to modern sporting facilities required for quality sports talent development and exposure." "The stadium will also provide international sports arena for major national and international events which will attract revenue and create direct and indirect employment opportunities for Siaya County residents,” added Rasanga. The facility will also host socio-cultural events, gatherings and conferences. The stadium will also have offices, amphitheater, changing rooms and indoor training facilities. The county will also lay a tartan track and floodlights to facilitate evening events. Rasanga said they are also in the process of improving various sports grounds across the county including Musembe in North Gem, Akala in Wagai, Miguena and Nyilima. The devolved unit will support Football Kenya Federation Division Two side Bondo United.
