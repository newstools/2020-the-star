The rising cases come as an experimental vaccine for Covid-19 by US pharmaceutical firm Moderna Inc showed it was safe and provoked an immune responses in all 45 healthy volunteers in an ongoing early-stage study, US researchers reported. Volunteers who got two doses of the vaccine had high levels of virus-killing antibodies that exceeded the average levels seen in people who had recovered from Covid-19, the team reported in the New England Journal of Medicine. No study volunteers experienced a serious side effect, but more than half reported mild or moderate reactions such as fatigue, headache, chills, muscle aches or pain at the injection site. These were more likely to occur after the second dose and in people who got the highest dose. During Kenya's daily Covid-19 briefing, Health acting director general Dr Patrick Amoth said, "Something exciting is coming from America, all the 45 people given the vaccine developed an immune reaction." Experts say a vaccine is needed to put an end to the coronavirus pandemic that has sickened millions and caused nearly 575,000 deaths worldwide.
