The Health Ministry on Thursday dismissed claims that health workers who have been infected with Covid-19 contracted the disease from patients. Director Public Health Dr Francis Kuria said while the claims of them contracting the disease while handling victims might be true, the fact that they live among the society where they could contract is also a reality. He said with in regard it would be unfair to conclude that they had contracted the disease while on the line of duty. "As numbers continue to rise, they include health workers which is a clear indication that they have not been spared," Kiuria said. He added, "They all live with us, and there the possibility of them contracting it from us is also alive". Kuria said over 500 health workers have contracted the disease since the first case was reported in March. He said some of the challenges the front-liners face is an inadequate supply of PPEs but the ministry is doing all it can to ensure the facilities are fully equipped. Kuria said so far 70 per cent of health facilities across the country have reported one or two cases of the disease. Kenya has so far reported 15, 601 positive cases of the disease after 796 people tested positive in the last 24 hrs. Health CAS Dr. Mercy Mwangangi said the cumulative samples tested so far stands at 261, 027. She said while 7,135 patients have been discharged after recovery, 263 have succumbed to the disease. "It is from here we appeal to all our people to ensure they visit health facilities immediately they feel unwell," she said. Mwangangi said the Ministry has noted with concern in the past few days where people are rushed to the hospital at the last minute when their condition has worsened only for them to succumb. "This is not good. It is only prudent for one to seek medical attention at the earliest opportunity instead of waiting too long. That is detrimental as we have observed of late," she said.
