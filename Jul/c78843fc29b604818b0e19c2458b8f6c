A city lawyer has asked the Law Society of Kenya to give activist OKiya Omtatah honorary membership due to his achievements in public litigation for over 10 years. In his notice of motion to LSK, Ochiel Dudley says he will move a motion at their upcoming AGM on July 23 for a special resolution to grant Omtatah honorary membership. “At the meeting of the society on Thursday, July 23 he will move a motion for a special resolution to be passed recognising Okiya Omtatah as an honorary life member of the Law Society of Kenya under Section 9 with no right to practice as advocate or vote or vie in any LSK election,” Ochiel said. However, honorary membership is only a ceremonial title conferring no right to practice, vote or hold office within LSK. The advocate further states that under the LSK Act, the Council may elect to honour a deserving person as an honorary member of the society either for life or not. He argues that Section 4 obliges the society to safeguard the public interest including by protecting and assisting members of the public in Kenya on the law. Ochiel also wondered why the activist who has litigated so many matters has never been given honorary membership.“Rightly or wrongly Okiya Omtatah has since 2010 chased constitutionalism, the rule of law and administration of justice through public interest litigation,” he said. It is his argument that Omtatah’s litigation has shaped the law in all areas and touched many Kenyans lives including on judicial independence, public appointments and procurement, land, right to health, right to clean and healthy environment and free and fair elections.“So it is fair that the society considers recognising and honouring Omtatah for his assistance to the public which is consistent with the LSK’s goal under Section 4,” the notice of motion reads,
