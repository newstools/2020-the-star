Bungoma Governor Wycliffe Wangamati will reshuffle his cabinet in what close  sources say is a bid to boost efficiency. A source who sought anonymity told the Star that the governor has already made up his mind about the reshuffle following a public outcry. “It is not whether or not he will carry out the changes but the only question now is when,”the source said . The governor is likely to make the changes once he arrives from Nairobi where is on official duties. “After three years of service, the governor now knows everyone's strength and would like to place people in departments in which they can perform well. Unfortunately one or two CECs could be axed,” the source said. Contractors have in the recent past been up in arms over some departments, saying they were asked for bribes. Reached for a comment, the governor's communication director Tim Machi said he was not aware of the changes but described any reshuffle as within the mandate of the governor. “I don’t want to deny or agree about any impeding changes but what I can say is it is within his prerogative to make any changes for efficiency of his government, ” Machi said.
