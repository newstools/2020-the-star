President Uhuru Kenyatta has cautioned Kenyans against adopting a careless attitude amid efforts to contain the coronavirus. Uhuru, during his national address on the pandemic on Monday, said such an attitude will cost Kenya. "It is evident that those who have displayed such a careless attitude have suffered greatly and in this case, we are not special. Let us not follow those examples that will hurt us in the end," Uhuru said. Uhuru said socialising and drinking alcohol remains the greatest risk to the spread of the disease. He said Kenya is fortunate that the fatality rate is at 1.6 per cent which is lower than the average rate. "This low rate has however given Kenyans a false comfort and they are not taking the disease as a serious matter posing a health risk," he said. "Let it be known that locking down the country is not a solution. But we cannot have a policeman in every home, village and street to enforce the protocols put in place." The head of state said the time has come for each citizen to take responsibility and speak and report those who refuse to adhere to laid down procedures. "Do your part as a citizen, these are not normal times, we are globally in abnormal times where many people in tens of thousands have had to endure the pain of isolation," Uhuru said. "Many countries are facing a crisis due to lack of sufficient space to hold bodies that are left lying across the streets, not to mention the mass graves and burials. We cannot therefore as a country allow this to be our fate." So far the disease has left 17,975 people infected across the country with 7,833 having been discharged. Sadly, another five patients have succumbed to the disease, raising the total to 285. Uhuru said Kenyans should give self-isolation priority if the pandemic is to be fought and defeated.
