 The ODM party will not incorporate in House committees MPs who will jeopardise the implementation of the BBI agenda, chairman John Mbadi has said. MPs are expected to discuss the BBI report in the National Assembly once its implementation starts. Mbadi on Friday said the committee of Justice and Legal Affairs and the committee on Delegated Legislation are crucial in the implementation of the BBI report and should consist of MPs loyal to the handshake between President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga. The BBI was birthed by the handshake. Mbadi who is the National Assembly's Minority leader said he disagreed with his Majority counterpart Amos Kimunya over the list of MPs who should be seconded to the two committees. Speaking at Kiyabuya trading center in his Suba South constituency during a tour of road construction projects, Mbadi said ODM does not want the committees to consist of MPs opposed to BBI. “The membership of the committees shouldn’t be MPs who have ever since opposed to the handshake. They are likely to disrupt and derail the implementation process of BBI,” Mbadi said. ODM wants Jubilee to replace Uasin Gishu Woman Representative Gladys Shollei, Baringo North MP William Cheptumo and others with loyal members. Mbadi said the MPs are allied to Deputy President William Ruto who has openly opposed the BBI agenda. “I agreed with Kimunya to make changes in the Jubilee list of membership.  We hope next week we’ll have a new membership list to ensure we implement what many Kenyans support,” Mbadi said. Mbadi was with MCAs Evans Marieba (Gwassi North), Nicholas Ayieta (Gwassi South) and former MCA Jared Kajomo. He dismissed claims that ODM and Jubilee are wrangling over parliamentary committee positions. “It is not factual to report that there is a disagreement between Raila’s and Uhuru’s MPs over slots in committees,” he said.
