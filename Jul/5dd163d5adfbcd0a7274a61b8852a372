"Lately, we have been writing a lot of new music. And, by a lot, we mean like very many new songs," they wrote. "Also, El Shaddai really did it big for us and we would like to keep the same energy. Being in a group of three artistes who are perfectionists can sometimes get crazy. Anyways, watch this space #newmusicloading." El Shaddai was meant to create awareness on mental health and the importance of saying what you feel as opposed to bottling it. The song marked the start of a campaign called ' #ItakuwaFine', which means, 'All will be well'.
