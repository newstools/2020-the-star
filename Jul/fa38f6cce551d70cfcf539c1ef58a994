Police have completed their investigations into the bizarre killing of four children in Naivasha a week ago and are ready to charge their mother with murder. But Beatrice Mwende was mentally unstable when she committed the acts. According to a report by a psychiatrist in Gilgil where the suspect was taken for mental assessment, she had underlying issues. Documents presented in court indicate the four children were strangled to death. Prosecution counsel Alex Ndiema told Naivasha senior resident magistrate Lyna Sarapai that they were ready to charge the accused with four counts of murder. Ndiema sought orders from the court to hold the accused for two extra days as the High Court in Naivasha would be seating on Thursday. “Due to the prevailing Covid-19 conditions, the High Court will not be sitting for the next two days and we want to hold her until then before charging her with four counts of murder,” he said. The magistrate directed that the accused be remanded at the Naivasha annex prison until Thursday when she will be charged with murder. The murdered minors were Melody Warigia (eight years), Willy Macharia (six), Samantha Njeri (four) and Whitney Nyambura (two). During an emotional burial ceremony on Thursday last week, the family denied the suspect was depressed or had any financial constraints. Meanwhile, 11 members of the ‘Confirm Group’ in Nakuru were charged in the same court with arson, planning to commit a felony and possession of bhang. The youths were arrested by police in Nakuru following bloody clashes in Flamingo and Kivumbini three weeks ago in which one man was killed and several houses torched. According to the charge sheet, the eleven who were not represented burnt two houses in the two estates on June 20 and were planning to commit more attacks. The prosecution objected to their release on bond noting that investigations were still going on and more suspects were expected to be arrested.  Edited by Henry Makori
