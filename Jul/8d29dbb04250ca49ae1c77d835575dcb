Edermann Property has withdrawn a Sh26 billion suit against the Kenya Railways Corporation and Kenya Railways Staff Retirement Benefit Scheme over disputed land. The real estate firm had last month promised to settle the dispute through arbitration, to the delight of KRC pensioners. The firm entered into an agreement with KRSCBS and KRC on July 6 ending a row that lasted over a decade. “The plaintiff hereby withdraws its suit unconditionally,” the consent document reads. The consent was recorded at Commercial and Admiralty Division of Milimani law courts. The dispute arose after KRC and KRSRBS started selling land that Edermann held it had acquired through a tender. The company maintained it had tendered and acquired the land and was ready to put in an investment together with its partners. The court battle has existed since 2009 when KRC and KRSRBS each claimed ownership of the parcels in Makongeni Estate, Nairobi Railways Club, Kindaruma Road and Kenya Railways Golf Club. In May, KRC retirees urged the government to intervene and ensure their monthly pension is paid. Retirees lamented their difficulties when the government stopped paying their pensions. Edermann said it had extended an olive branch to KRC and KRSRBS to "stop the suffering of the pensioners”. The plight of the pensioners, who decried not receiving pensions for up to 11 months, was highlighted in the media in May. "We are very happy and we feel relieved after a protracted court battle. We are looking forward to more fruitful deliberations,” pensioner John Ndege said. Another, John Mwangi, had explained that when the government could not continue paying them, it transferred some of the properties owned by KRC to the scheme. But the scheme was only able to make Sh24 million monthly against pensions amounting to Sh73 million for 10,000 members. Edited by R.Wamochie
