Bungoma politician Edward Nabangi has died. The 2017 Kabuchai MP contestant died from Covid-19 complications, according to Bungoma Health CEC Dr Antony Walela. Nabangi died at 4.30 am on Wednesday at Lifecare Hospital where he had been in the ICU for almost a week. He was admitted on Tuesday, July 21. According to a family member who requested not to be named because he was not authorised to speak to the media, the politician was put on medication at the facility, formerly known as Lumboka Hospital. “Yes, we have lost him, he succumbed this morning. It is very painful for the family and Kabuchai constituency members. We have lost a treasure that was a family pillar,” he said. Nabangi, an accountant, is reported to have travelled from Nairobi last week and had been distributing face masks and sanitiser to Kabuchai constituents. He was later hospitalised at Khamulati dispensary in Kimilili after falling sick, then referred to Lifecare Hospital in Bungoma town. Nabangi has been instrumental in helping vulnerable members of society. He has built houses for many constituents. His efforts in the war on the coronavirus crisis were also being felt as he distributed iron sheets, food and sanitary items. In 2017, he ran for the Kabuchai parliamentary seat as an independent but was defeated by Ford Kenya's James Lusweti — the incumbent. Bungoma county has so far reported 25 Covid-19 positive cases, according to Dr Walela. He said 13 people have been discharged from the Webuye isolation centre after recovering.
