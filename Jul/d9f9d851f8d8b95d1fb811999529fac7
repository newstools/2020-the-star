Members of the Music Copyright Society of Kenya in Western have asked their chair Silvanus Opaka to explain how he spent money collected for the funeral of veteran musician John Nzenze. Already Nzenze's family has said it was never given any cash from the MCSK. “The MCSK representatives told us they would be in charge of the hearse and coffin but no single cent was given to us, nor the breakdown of what was contributed and what was spent. No one has informed us,” Nzenze's sister Mary Mwoyo said. Emanuel Musindi from Kakamega told the Star that since Nzenze was laid to rest, Opaka has not convened a meeting to give a breakdown of how the money contributed by members was spent. “We are in total darkness. We don’t know how much was contributed, how much was spent and what was handed to the family. It remains a big question that we need the chairman to respond to,” Musindi said. He said efforts to reach the chair for clarification had failed as he kept taking them in circles. "We, as the members, are appealing to the entire office to step aside to pave way for investigation into these allegations," he said. "We won’t bear a bad name in the music industry because of a few individuals with personal interests that will ruin our reputation in the society." However, Opaka dismissed the claims, saying Musindi was not a spokesperson of the family of the late Nzenze. He further said members of the MCSK were well-informed and all the reports were tabled during the annual general meeting. “Nobody from Nzenze’s family requested us to do so. It was the respect we had for the Twist legend," he said. "If there is anything they want from Nzenze’s family they are free to go there; I won’t block them, nor should they use me as their ladder to that family,” Opaka said. Edited  by Henry Makori
