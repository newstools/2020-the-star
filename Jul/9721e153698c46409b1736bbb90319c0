A businesswoman who was charged at a Nairobi court with obtaining Sh3.4million from her neighbour will remain in custody until Monday when court will rule on her cancellation of bail. Serah Nyokabi was charged in May but absconded court. She is accused of fraudulently obtaining Sh3.4 million from Josey Njoki by pretending that she would partner with her to finance a tender to supply tablets to the Communication Authority of Kenya. She allegedly committed the offence on dates between July 19 and October 31, 2019 in Nairobi County. Nyokabi denied the charges and was released on a cash bail of Sh100,000. She however jumped bail on two mentions since taking plea in May. The accused was rearrested on Thursday after being tracked in Nanyuki and arraigned on Friday. The prosecution asked the court to be allowed to amend the charge sheet and have Nyokabi plead afresh. Investigating officer Jane Njue also made an application to cancel her bond saying the accused failed to appear in court and skipped two mentions before she traced and arrested. The court heard Nyokabi is a neighbour to the complainant and has been intimidating her through other neighbours and the matter was reported at Embakasi Police Station. “I have received information that Nyokabi told the complainant to ask the court for the money she allegedly obtained from her and she has been posting photos while on vacation enjoying the money,” Njue said. Nyokabi however dismissed the claims by the investigating officer saying that she did not skip court intentionally. Nyokabi said she had tried to reach to the court through her lawyer but no clear information was availed. Magistrate Esther Kimilu remanded the accused until Monday when she will rule on the application and Nyokabi’s plea taking on the amended charge sheet.
