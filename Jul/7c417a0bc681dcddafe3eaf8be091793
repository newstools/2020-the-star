Embu MCAs have asked Governor Martin Wambora to let them manage Sh400 million ward equalisation fund that is meant for projects. The Sh400 million was appropriated in the budget for projects selected for urgent action by the residents. The MCAs have promised to set aside sufficient cash for Wambora’s flagship projects. In return, they say, he should refrain from touching the Sh400 million. Deputy speaker Steve Munene said Wambora will have more than Sh1.5 billion to fund his flagship projects out of Sh1.95 billion allocated for development projects in 2020-2021. The MCAs said that they had resolved to finance Wambora's legacy projects. Mavuria MCA Ngari Mbaka called for inclusion of Mbeere subcounties in Wambora’s flagship projects. Mbaka said the subcounties in Mbeere had been left out of the list of projects. He said it was unfortunate that some wards had been side-lined in the allocation of development projects while others prospered. Mbaka said Mbeere South subcounty alone generated over Sh300,000 in revenue and deserved a considerable chunk of county funds for development. He said the governor works for every citizen in Embu and all deserved to benefit. Deputy Minority leader Newton Kariuki said Mbeere people faced acute shortage of water, good roads, hospitals and other amenities. The Muminji MCA said for Wambora to leave a proper legacy, he must be seen to be working even for the people of Mbeere. The leaders spoke at the county assembly chambers while endorsing the proposed allocations contained in the County Fiscal Strategy Paper. The strategy paper will inform the county budget for the 2020-2021 financial year. (edited by o. owino)
