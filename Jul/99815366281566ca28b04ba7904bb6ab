The court on Tuesday will visit tycoon Humphrey Kariuki’s Africa Spirits Limited factory in Thika in connection with his Sh41 billion tax evasion case. Nairobi chief magistrate Francis Andayi on Friday directed the visit to take place on July 21, with all Covid-19 containment measures observed. Kariuki is also facing charges of forgery and money laundering. He has pleaded not guilty to all counts. It is alleged that incriminating evidence in the tax evasion case – liquor and excise stamps – were stolen while it was under police guard. An AP guard died there. Audio and video recordings of the site visit will be taken by both the prosecution and defence. Kariuki was charged in August last year and he has been barred from the closed factory. The court rejected a request by the prosecution for seven more days before visiting the crime scene. Police had said they needed more time to comply with Covid-19 directives on sanitation and social distancing. The prosecution also argued the factory in Thika involves other cases before the Thika law courts. The defence protested the proposed delay, saying police had sufficient advance time to determine how it would comply with directives. The order for the site visit was issued on July 10. The other cases do not have orders for site visits and a visit by the court in Nairobi would not tamper with evidence, the defence said. The visit will be restricted to two hours unless there are compelling reasons for extension. Andayi directed all parties to observe Health ministry Covid-19 containment measures. The Inspector General of Police will be required to provide washing points, sanitiser and face masks. Kariuki was charged alongside Peter Njenga, Robert Mureithi, Kepha Githu and others. They denied all the charges and were released on Sh20 million bond each. (Edited by V. Graham)
