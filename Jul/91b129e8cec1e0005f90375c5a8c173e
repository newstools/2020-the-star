Some 400 Mandera residents have sought court orders to scrap Kutulo subcounty on claims it was illegally created and gazetted. In their petition filed on Friday at the High Court, the residents led by Yussuf Surrow said Interior CS Fred Matiang'i and Attorney General Kihara Kariuki broke the law in creating the sub-region. The administrative unit was created through a special gazette notice on June 21, 2017 from Mandera Central subcounty. But the residents say the population of Kutulo is sparse and some units do not have persons living in them. “The creation of these administrative units was done in violation of the law and without public participation,” they say in the suit papers through lawyer Gordon Ogola. The residents claim the state acted outside the confines of the law while creating the administrative units. They argue the public was not consulted on the issue, neither did they give their contribution. The residents added that they do not agree with the creation of Kutulo subcounty and its divisions, locations and sub-locations. “The whole process demonstrates an absence of adherence to and disobedience of the law,” they say in the petition. The government, in creating Kutulo, did not consider the population of the subcounty, the size of the area and the community interests, the petitioners say. The residents want the Kutulo subcounty declared nonexistent and the court to revoke the appointment of Mandera deputy county commissioner. The Mandera county government, county commissioner, and the deputy county commissioner Kutulo subcounty have been included as interested parties.  (edited by o. owino)
