Western branch Handball Federation secretary general Akaka Shisoka has called on sportsmen and women to embrace education and professionalism as a fallback plan upon retirement from sports. Speaking to the Star Sports on phone, Shisoka, who has also handled the national women's handball team sympathised with the sorry state most players have found themselves in after retiring. Shisoka said coaches have a major role to play in building the future of their players, saying they should not only concentrate on winning games and titles only but to also provide mentorship. “It's upsetting to see most players in the country ending up in miserable situations after retiring. This gives the sporting industry a bad picture and demoralises the upcoming sportsmen and women,” said Shisoka. He lauded rugby fraternity where most of the players have embraced education and thus are professionals in different fields, something which gives them confidence that life upon retirement is secure. “The rapid growth of rugby in the country is a challenge to other sporting disciplines that needs to be emulated," said Shisoka. He called on fellow coaches to encourage their players to work hard in school. “Out of this education, they can rise to key and strategic positions in various organisations and also in government and can better be placed to lobby for good policies and goodies for our struggling sports fraternity,” he added. Shisoka appealed to the county and national governments to come up with good programs that will recognise and help sportsmen and women who have remained great ambassadors of the country find a soft landing. “It saddens to see players struggling in settling medical bills and failing to meet other family obligations, which has seen many slip into depression and untimely deaths,” he stated. In addition, he urged players to invest and plan for a future after sports.
