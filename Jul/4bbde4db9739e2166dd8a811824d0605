Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi never uttered a word in the National Assembly in 2019, a this is according to a report by Mzalendo. According to the report, past reviews shows he has maintained the performance since 2017.

The report also reveals Busia Senator Amos Wako also never uttered a word in the Senate last year, alongside five others including nominated members. They are among 25 legislators – both from the Senate and National Assembly who have been rated for their poor performance in the said period. Kajiado Senator Philip Mpaayei, nominated counterparts Christine Zawadi and Mercy Chebeni were also rated as most inactive. Senator Ledama Ole Kina (Narok) was ranked the top performing senator. He was followed by Moses Wetangula (Bungoma), Aaron Cheruiyot (Kericho), Ochilo Ayako (Migori) and Getrude Musuruve (nominated). In the National Assembly, Mumias West MP John Naicca; Samuel Arama (Nakuru West); James Gakuya (Embakasi North); George Aladwa (Makadara); Abdi Shurie (Balambala) are among those singled out for 'poor performance' in plenary business. “The average performance of male MNAs is 21 speech counts. At least 69 per cent of all male MNAs are below this average,” the report by Mzalendo reads. Among the top performers in the National Assembly were MPs Millie Odhiambo (Suba North), David Ole Sankok (Nominated), Wilberforce Oundo (Funyula) and Robert Pukose (Endebess).
