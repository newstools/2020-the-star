Locals from Kisumu County on Tuesday staged demonstrations along the Kondele- Kibos Road and Kibos Sugar Factory over the killing of three people allegedly by the company's car. The locals demanded for justice for the bereaved families saying nobody was above the law. They claimed that there is a deliberate scheme to cover up the real perpetrators of the accident by airlifting them abroad. The three Meshak Ouma (37), George Oudi (28) and Martin Bonyo (25) succumbed following an accident along the Kondele-Kibos road on Saturday during curfew hours around 9.45 pm. The three who were on boda boda were knocked down and died on the spot by the vehicle alleged to have been heading towards one of the sugar factories within the area. According to witnesses, the driver of the vehicle attempted to overtake a vehicle when it knocked down the three. One of the relatives to the deceased Jack Ochieng alleged that the vehicle later sped off to Kibos Sugar Factory where they allegedly abandoned the vehicle and disappeared. “Why are the authorities trying to hide the real culprit behind the incident. We were forced as locals to go to the company and remove the vehicle at the company's yard,” he said. “We want justice for the family, the orphaned children and widows,”said Boniface Akach a human rights activist. He noted that the person who knocked down the three is well known to the members of the public and should be brought to book. “The person who was presented to the police is totally different from the one who caused the accident," Akach said as they called on the DCI to take over the matter. However when contacted, the county commander Ranson Lolmodoni told the Star that the person who caused the accident was arrested and had already been charged in court.
