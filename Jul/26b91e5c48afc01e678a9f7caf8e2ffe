Embu is experiencing challenges in the Covid-19 fight due to non-remittance of Sh5 billion pledged by the national government, Governor Martin Wambora has said. Wambora said the county is struggling to set up the required 300-bed isolation space in preparation for any eventuality after President Uhuru Kenyatta reduced the Covid-19 restrictions, but that it’s succeeding with the help of good Samaritans. He revealed that by now, the county has 14 ICU beds and four Special Care beds worth Sh3, 466,080. The beds were contributed by Family Bank in conjunction with Megascope Healthcare Limited. Addressing the people on Friday while receiving the medical equipment at Embu Level 5 Hospital, Wambora said the facility already has 208 isolation beds, with another 196 set to be delivered next week to total 404 beds. Wambora hailed Family Bank and Megascope for their donations promising to work with them to help  residents fight the pandemic and also do business in the county. Family Bank CEO Rebecca Mbithi said the bank was cognisant of the health requirements of counties as directed by the national government, hence the need to work with them. Mbithi said the bank has set aside Sh14 billion to cushion Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) against the Covid-19 aftermath. On opening up of the economy, Governor Wambora said businesses were resuming operations. However, he called on residents to adhere to the government directives to combat infections. "Avoid crowds and public gatherings, to wear masks and wash their hands with soap and running water." Edited by R.Wamochie
