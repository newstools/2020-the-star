The inauguration of ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi and Ford Kenya's Moses Wetang’ula as Luhya leaders was illegal, council of elders' chair Edward Oware has said. The inauguration took place at Emuhaya MP Omboko Milemba’s home but the elders say it is against customs to anoint two people for the same position. They said the two leaders must first merge their parties and give them one candidate to bless. Oware said Arthur Imbira, a church pastor, had no business doing the work of elders. “As a council we can't say Imbira was acting on our behalf. We have Fred Omido who is our council chair in the county so were the two inaugurated at the county level or subcounty level?” Oware asked. Oware said such functions are not conducted in the homes of individuals but on public grounds where all people participate. He said the leaders needed to wait till the Covid-19 pandemic is contained before holding the event. The elders said once Mudavadi and Wetang'ula have merged parties, they will lobby other western leaders from Wiper, ODM, Jubilee for their win.
