Milimani senior principal magistrate Kenneth Cheruiyot has issued a warrant of arrest against the Investigating Officer (IO) in former Sports CS Rashid Echesa's criminal case. This is after Echesa's lawyer informed the court that he is yet to receive his Range River and two firearms. The court had ordered the DCI to return the car and guns to Echesa. Cheruiyot on Monday ordered the county police commander to effect the court order against IO John Munjama and give Echesa his vehicle back as had been ordered by court. The DPP had moved to the High Court in a bid to overturn Cheruiyot's ruling, but the judge dismissed the appeal and directed them to comply with the court orders. Echesa was charged in connection with a Sh39 billion fake arms scandal. The DPP had said the firearms and vehicle were recovered as a result of a search conducted on Echesaâ€™s premises and are directly connected to the offences he has been charged with over the fake arms deal. Echesa was arrested on February 13 and subsequently charged on February 18 with conspiracy to defraud changes among other offences. At the time of his arrest, Echesa had in his possession the Range Rover.
