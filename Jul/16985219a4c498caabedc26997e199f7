Some governors are considering contesting for the MP seats in their respective constituencies in the coming 2022 polls, to make it easier for them to lobby for Cabinet Secretary positions. The lot is positioning to reap from the BBI proposal that CSs to be appointed from Parliament. One of them is a second term governor while the other is a governor who has found the going getting tough. Sources close to a county chief riding on the BBI wave told Corridors that the man is working hard to undo the damage in his backyard where supporters have vowed to punish him should he vie for MP. The governor wants continued political power to give him “immunity” from past deeds.  Just why has a speaker and a group of MCAs turned a county assembly premises into their bed room? The assembly boss and the ward reps have for the past two weeks been spending the nights in the county offices. Those in the know said the speaker fears being toppled by rebel MCAs who the person has not been seeing eye-to-eye with. Last Tuesday, one of the MCAs who spent the night at the assembly premises was heard telling his colleagues that he rushing home to collect clothes that he would use the following day.  The whereabouts of a once-powerful House leader in the Senate is becoming a worry for his colleagues. Well, the gentleman has not been seen within the precincts of the August House since his ouster from the seat in the recent upheavals instigated by the leadership of the Jubilee party. His colleagues were overheard pitying with the man with some suggesting that the fellow could have taken his ouster way too personally. They are waiting to see how the man would deal with the requirement against skipping eight consecutive sittings as the man could be on his fifth or something close.
