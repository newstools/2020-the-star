President Uhuru Kenyatta, last week, made a very sensible decision of lifting travel restrictions. He was, no doubt, torn between saving lives and averting an economic catastrophe. But for the economy to benefit from the free movement of passengers in and out of Nairobi and Mombasa, key cities, we must have a major shift of mindset. The economy will not recover if strident scaremongers, on social media, drain the nation of the confidence it needs to get people spending again. If the lucky among us, who still have jobs, cannot fuel their cars and drive to work, eat out in restaurants, the economy will die a slow and painful death. The public should behave with caution – wear a mask, sanitise and keep physical distance – but not listen to the prophets of doom already predicting we prepare for another lockdown because numbers are rising. That is to invite a state of paralysis that neither deals with Covid-19 nor gets the economy back to life. We must take responsibility as well informed citizens aware of the simple but effective protocols of staying safe without letting fear or the pig-headedness of conspiracy theorist who think Covid-19 is a lie distract our focus. The responsibility is now ours to take the cue from Kenyatta’s decision and behave responsibly.
