Early Childhood Development Education teachers that had been laid off by the Taita Taveta government have got reprieve after the County Public Service Board agreed to consider then in the upcoming recruitment. Chairman Alfred Mlolwa said most of the tutors shall be hired back. Mlolwa told the county assembly that the board and department of Education and Libraries were working on a framework to contract back the over 200 teachers. The teachers' contracts were terminated two years ago after serving for close to five years. “The board is taking seriously the resolutions of the committee on education in regard to the dismissed teachers. We are targeting to hire them back,” Mlolwa said. Marungu MCA Paul Waweru asked the board to waive payment of the needed Chapter Six certificates during this pandemic until a time when applicants are able to afford payment. "They have become so expensive to get, at least during this pandemic, until such a time when we can go back to normalcy. Some of the offices are also closed,” Waweru noted. Acting Education Committee chairman Norbert Chanzu directed the departments of education and finance to agree on making the County Education Board independent to allow timely release of funds. He said delayed issuance of bursaries and education loans had been caused by lack of an independent decision at the board. “Education is key to our society and should be treated so. The board has continuously delayed to release funds to beneficiaries,” he said. Chanzu said the education department was working on making sure that all ECDE centres meet set regulations by the state in preparation for reopening.  Edited by R. Wamochie
