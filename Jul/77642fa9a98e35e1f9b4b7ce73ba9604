Media personality Anita Nderu caused a stir on social media on Thursday after she released a snippet of an episode of her cooking show which has since gone viral. The former Capital FM presenter featured two members of the LGBTQ community and the trio engaged in smutty talk as they cooked. Many seemed to be irritated by Nderu's video as some took to Twitter to express their fury. Some Kenyans on Twitter had thought Nderu had been contracted by Fresh Fri manufacturer Pwani Oil to maket the product as it is placed conspicuously during the cooking episodes. However, the cooking oil company disassociated itself from the video saying Nderu was not asked to advertise its product. The company, however, went ahead to thank her for being a customer. "Fresh Fri would like to state that we have not engaged Anita Nderu for product placement or any other advertising of any kind. However, we would like to thank her for being a Fresh Fri consumer," the brand said. Nderu had noted that the video was in support of Pride Month which is dedicated to create awareness about the LBTQi community. In the episode, Nderu and her two guests dressed skimpily and talked about sex and pornography. Kenyans on Twitter did not take it well. Here are some comments; drey@Dreymwangi said, "Anyway no one can convince me Anita Nderu isn't working with Fresh fri... That was a marketing strategy". @OnyangoCarlosÂ· said , " Is the show really about cooking or promoting their sexual orientation...then they go ahead and put innocent Fresh Fri in it...Anita Nderu should stop confusing us".
