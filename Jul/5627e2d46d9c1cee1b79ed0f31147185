Anti-riot police on Friday night dispersed boda boda operators in Eldoret who were protesting the murder of their chairman in the town. The body of Ibrahim Murgor was found in a maize farm near Illula Primary School, a few yards from his home. Murgor is the son of former presidential escort Charles Kimurgor who served during late President Daniel Moi's regime. He was a well-known rights crusader in the town. The body was found with deep cuts all over with the eyes gouged out. His motorcycle was found near the body and nothing was stolen from him. The boda boda operators took the body and refused to allow police to take it to the morgue. But anti-riot police fired in the air and used tear gas to disperse the hundreds of riders. All businesses were shut down during the scuffle. The riders were forced to flee, leaving the body to be taken to the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital. "We want to know who killed our leader and why. They have killed him brutally and we now fear for our lives," the riders' spokesman Paul Korir said. Korir said it seems the killers just wanted to kill their leader because nothing was stolen from him Uasin Gishu county commander Abdirizack Jaldesa said they are investigating the incident. "We, however, ask the operators to remain calm and avoid incidents of lawlessness as we investigate the incident," Jaldesa said. Edited by R.Wamochie
