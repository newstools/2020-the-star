The government has reduced the duty on raw materials for making baby diapers and puller pads. Industrialisation CS Betty Maina on Friday said the duty reduction on manufacturing of the commodities was one step to make industrialisation sector more competitive. Maina said the move will make it more competitive and we will continue to support local products by addressing business environment, issues of labour and  electricity among others. Maina was speaking to the press  after touring Sunda Kenya Company in Athi River, Machakos County. “We support the industry in regard to unfair competition from imported products that may be causing a lot of injuries, and the Kenya Trade Remedy Agency that was launched this week has the responsibility of investigating any complaints against unfair trade practices,” Maina said. She said the Agency is charged with making recommendations on measures that can be applied such as countervailing duty and surcharges. The CS lauded the factory for its contribution to the country’s economy through local manufacturing. “We are excited about this investment in Kenya. Making baby diapers, wet wipes, pull-up pads and detergents. This is an exciting new investment that  came in the last year,” She said. Maina said they look forward to using all instruments available to them to  supporting the industry. On the manufacture of PPEs, the CS said they were excited by the industries’ responses to the government’s call to locally produce them. The company’s PR manager Stan Tan said they had hired over 300 employees from May to-date. “We believe the government will support us. We are trying to support our society and the local community,” Tan said.
