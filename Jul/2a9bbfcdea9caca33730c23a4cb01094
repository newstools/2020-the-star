@eosere Busia county will expand its capacity to care for Covid-19 patients by adding 124 beds in five health facilities. Kocholiya Level Four, Nambale Subcounty, Sio-Port and Khunyangu hospitals will each get 30 new beds. Port Victoria Hospital will be fitted with 24 new beds. The county currently has two coronavirus isolation and treatment centres at the Alupe Subcounty Hospital and Busia Agricultural Training Centre. Health chief officer Dr Isaac Omeri said Thursday that the additional beds will accommodate more patients as community mass testing begins. “Currently we are focusing mostly on Alupe and Agricultural Training Centre. We have discussed possibilities of expanding our bed capacity to 402,” Omeri told an FM station in Busia town. He said truck drivers were to blame for the rising number of the coronavirus infections in the county. Busia had recorded 811 positive cases by Thursday. “Most of the residents confirmed positive of the coronavirus are those who have mingled with the long-distance truck drivers especially in Busia and Malaba towns,” he said. He asked residents to wear face masks as directed by the Ministry of Health to help curb the spread of the disease. Omeri also urged barbers and hairdressers to observe high standards of hygiene for the benefit of their clients. “Coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets and hence the need to adhere to the Covid-19 regulations,” he said. Healthcare workers are doing their best to save lives despite Busia being among the counties with the highest Covid-19 burden, he said. (edited by o. owino)
