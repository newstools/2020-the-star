Mövenpick Hotel and Residences Nairobi resumed its operations on Wednesday, after it was closed in March due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The hotel has ensured all government safety measures to slow the spread of coronavirus have been observed. It has done so by ensuring the seating distance between two people is 1m apart, and before entering the hotel, one has to sanitise their hands and get their temperature checked by well-trained hotel’s safety ambassadors.
