Scores of people were injured on Tuesday after a stampede occurred at the Likoni Crossing Channel. This is after one of the ferries, MV Safari, the newest, stalled. MV Safari arrived at the Port of Mombasa on April 25. Kenya Ferry Services managing director Bakari Goa said the problem started at around 3.30pm when MV Kwale, while at the mainland ramp, hit MV Safari. The impact left a hole on the side of the MV Safari. This caused water to flood into the engine room. MV Safari had to be tagged to safety by one of the KPA tug boats. KFS said it will issue a comprehensive statement later. There was congestion at the waiting bay, which was already full. Commuters ran out of patience and pushing and shoving started, oblivious to social distancing directives to curb the spread of the coronavirus. They overwhelmed the sentries manning the gates at the waiting bay after MV Jambo arrived to ease the congestion. Some were rushed to various hospitals as Red Cross officials arrived to help the injured. In October last year, a ferry stalled midstream with passengers and vehicles. MV Likoni developed mechanical problems and started drifting under heavy ocean currents. MV Jambo was forced to push the stalled ferry to the shore and vehicles were forced to exit in reverse while passengers stampeded out of the ferry. More to follow...
