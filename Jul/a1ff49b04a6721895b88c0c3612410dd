The Kenya Association of Manufacturers has appointed Mucai Kunyiha as the new national chairman. He will lead the organisation for a two-year term. Kunyiha, who has been the vice chairperson from July 2018, takes over from Sachen Gudka whose term has come to an end. Kunyiha has championed the association’s sustainability agenda and circular economy through his role as the PET sub-sector chairman. He played a key role in the development of the Kenya Plastic Action Plan, a private sector-led policy and action plan aimed at enabling a circular economy for environmentally sustainable use and recycling of plastic. It was launched late last year. “The road ahead for manufacturing and the economy will not be easy as the impact of Covid-19 pandemic is yet to be determined as it continues to unleash damage locally and globally,” Kunyiha said. He added that the sector demands big changes, including the development of rebound strategies and policies. The new chairman will focus on advocating the development of policies that support industrial growth, pushing for predictability in fiscal and legislative regulations and support for SMEs through policy advocacy. He will also champion Kenya’s circular economy through enhanced partnerships and drive the waste management agenda through the Kenya Plastic Action Plan. Rajan Shah, the CEO of Capwell Group of Companies, has been appointed the new vice chairperson. He has also served on the KAM board in various capacities and as the regional chairman of KAM Central. Kunyiha is a lawyer and the group MD of Kzanaka Ltd, which includes Cooper K-Brands Ltd, Analabs Ltd, Mashiara Park and Qaribu Inn. Gudka will remain an ex-officio member of the board, playing an advisory role in directing the growth of the association.
