The Covid-19 pandemic may worsen the existing inequalities that affect older persons in society, the UN says. In a brief on the impact of Covid-19 on older persons, the UN says the concentration of health resources on Covid-19 may marginalise older persons further. “It creates barriers to the elderly obtaining health services for their underlying conditions, some of which may increase their vulnerability to Covid-19,” the brief says. Even before the Covid-19, older people faced significant barriers while accessing health services and support. “At this time, health services unrelated to Covid-19 may be scaled back, but the right to health requires that older persons continue to receive integrated health and social care, including palliative care, rehabilitation and other types of care,” the UN says. Researchers say social distancing policies must also consider the already precarious existence of many older people, particularly those living alone or dependent on others for care and support. UN says that Covid-19 recovery is an opportunity to set the stage for a more inclusive, equitable and age-friendly society. This is in a bid to attain the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development to leave no one behind. Edited by A.N
