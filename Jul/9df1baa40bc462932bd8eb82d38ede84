Diamond Platnumz, Ali Kiba and Harmonize were brought together by Tanzanian President John Pombe Magufuli over the weekend. While addressing citizens, Magufuli asked the three to stand up and asked them to unite as it the best thing to do. He said, "I feel good when I see Ali Kiba seated next to Diamond. When you see Harmonize who left Diamond praising him in public, that's the unity I want. I thank you so much and thank you for supporting CCM (Chama Cha Mapinduzi)," he said. Ali Kiba and Diamond Platnumz have been rivals for years and have never seen eye to eye. The two have been said to divide Bongo Flava fans into two teams. Harmonize on the other hand got into Diamond's bad books when he left his record label WCB to start his own, Konde Gang.
