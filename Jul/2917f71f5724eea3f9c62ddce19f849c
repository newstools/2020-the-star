Vihiga county has set aside Sh30 million for Kazi Mtaani in the 2020-2021 budget. The Vihiga Appropriations Bill, 2020 assented by Governor Wilber Ottichilo at the county headquarters on Friday targets to benefit youths, women and persons with disability. The money will be used to create casual jobs in waste management within the county. While assenting the bill Ottichilo stated that the county executive would now have authority to spend and implement the budgeted projects. “Without this bill, the county cannot access financial resources from the national government,” Ottichillo said. However, Ottichillo gave room for the executive to revisit the budget and make amendments in case of uncertainties that may result from the coronavirus disease. The Sh5.4 billion budget will prioritise agribusiness, completion of the hospital plaza, completion of a blood transfusion unit and construction of talent centres, said the chief officer for Finance Livingstone Imbayi. “Improving sporting activities within the county, recruitment of ECDE teachers, revamping of infrastructure in TVETs and ECDEs, improvement of  our market facilities, provision of clean water to residents, rehabilitation of forests, roads maintenance, completion of the governor's and deputy governor's residences among other key projects must be finished in this financial year,” Imbayi said. Already the doctors’s plaza has been allocated Sh100million. Budget committee chairman Patrick Akhwale urged the Finance department to ensure that the budget was uploaded promptly for effective and efficient implementation for the county's development agenda Deputy governor Patrick Saisi thanked the county assembly for approving the budget without squabbles, noting that this will enable the executive to roll out projects in line with the governor's manifesto.
