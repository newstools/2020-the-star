A 25-year old man is recuperating at Kenyatta National Hospital after his hands were severed by his brother-in-law over land dispute. Ernest Kobia alias Ndimu Karaithe had both hands chopped off by an in-law at Tiira market, Nduguto location, Meru County. He was taken to Meru Level Five Hospital and later transferred to KNH where he has been admitted since Wednesday. The assailant, Jotham Mwenda, is said to have used a panga to cut both arms of the victim then fled. According to the victim's father Charles Kiraithe, Mwenda attacked Kobia for opposing Mwenda's marriage to his sister. Mwenda was entitled to a piece of land due to their union but Kobia was opposed to such inheritance. Kiraithe said his son and his son-in-law had irreconcilable differences over the marriage of her daughter, with Kobia claiming Mwenda was not good enough to marry his sister. "They have had quarrels for a long time, threatening each other after my young boy expressed the discontent of  Jotham Mwenda to marry his sister and inheriting the piece of land I gave them," Kiraithe said. A cousin who did not want to be named said: “Their issues started two weeks ago after Kobia destroyed the bridge before assaulting Mwenda. If the suspect is Mwenda, he was on a revenge mission because he has also been nursing an injury inflicted by Kobia," he said. He said Kobia was found unconscious after the incident. The kin called on the authorities to trace the assailant, who went into hiding soon after committing the crime. Igembe South police boss Henry Onyango said they are searching for Mwenda, as they wait for Kobia to get out of the hospital and record a statement. “Members of the public should learn to solve domestic issues amicably instead of taking law into their hands. Igembe People kill one another every now and then over land-related issues. Let people involve area elders," he said.
