Former Churchill Show comedian Paul Wakimani Ogutu has for the first time confirmed rumours he has been battling depression. Speaking in an interview with theoriginalpadre254, the comedian said he is depressed. Wakimani, who was driving the car involved in an accident that killed fellow comedian Ayeiya (Emmanuel Makori), says he has also been sued by the comedian’s family. The family wants him to pay them Sh21 million. "After the accident, I got depressed and used to drink a lot and I was drowning every day to the level no one could understand me," he said. "I was trying to pick myself up and move on, but those guys at Churchill Show were not understanding what I was doing with my life." He said he had no one to depend on at the time and became violent. His girlfriend whom he had dated for almost five years left him. "It really hurt me. I remember there were days I’d wake up na naangilia naona tyres za gari, kumbe niko kando ya barabara. Naangalia hivi naona hii ni jam, watu wanaenda job. Nakumbuka nilibleki the previous night after drinking," he said. He added that there were days he used to wake up being slapped by police officers while passers-by stared. "There’s one day niliamshwa na makofi. Kuangalia ni polisi coz I had fought people where I was drinking the previous night and was told I had five cases of assault," he said. He said there was no one to help him, not even his colleagues, and that’s why at some point he stopped posting on his social media platforms. "I’m at a point I’m trying to pick myself up. I’m not the kind of person who gives up easily," he said. "My hands were burnt and I could have died but God has been there for me." He asked his fans to support him spiritually as he is still on his way to recovery. Edited by T Jalio
