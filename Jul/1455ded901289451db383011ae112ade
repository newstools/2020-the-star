Tusker's first choice goalkeeper Emery Mvuyekure says he is not keen to leave the club in the forthcoming transfer window. The Rwandese custodian has been heavily linked with a move to South African giants Orlando Pirates but he says he has no intentions to ditch the Ruaraka based club. He, however, acknowledged that his agent had been approached by a host of clubs who are interested in his services. Mvuyrekure joined Tusker in 2018 from AS Kigali as the club sought to replace Kenyan international Duncan Ochieng who has since hanged his gloves. "There have been rumors that I will be leaving Tusker when the window opens but as far as I am concerned, I remain a brewer. My contract expires next year and I have a duty to honour the terms in my contract and serve the club to the best of my capability," he said. "My agent told me there were offers but I am yet to agree on anything. I am focused on honouring my contract with Tusker and even win titles." Tusker have been reported to be eyeing former Wazito goalkeeper Kevin Omondi who was among the 12 players axed a week ago.
