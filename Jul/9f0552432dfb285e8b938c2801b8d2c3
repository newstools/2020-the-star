Three people died on the spot in an accident involving two trucks and a Probox at Maanzoni on Mombasa Road near Athi River on Monday midnight. Two others were seriously injured. The three died a few hours before the removal of a roadblock at Small World Resort Club, following President Uhuru Kenyatta’s reopening of the economy. The roadblock had been erected two kilometres from the scene of the accident to stop travellers entering or leaving the Nairobi Metropolitan Area. The dead were the drivers of the two trucks and a turnboy, according to Athi River subcounty police commander Catherine Ringera. Daystar assistant county commissioner George Orina said a Nairobi-bound truck veered off the road and collided head-on with an oncoming truck and hitting the Probox. “One person was rescued while three died on the spot. They were trapped in the wreckage,” Orina told the Star on Tuesday. Ringera said the Mavoko fire brigade and police cleared the wreckage at dawn. She said the injured, including the Probox’s driver, were treated at Machakos Level 5 Hospital. Athi River deputy county commissioner David Juma cautioned motorists against flouting traffic rules. He said motorists and the public should always exercise self- discipline. “It is unfortunate that the accident occurred just a few hours before the cessation roadblock in Athi River was removed. Let’s all exercise caution on the highway,” Juma said. On Covid-19, he echoed President Kenyatta's counsel that “people should put on face masks all the time as the disease has spread across the country. Avoid public gatherings and rush to hospital in case you experience Covid-19 symptoms.” The administrator advised against unnecessary journeys to rural homes until the Covid-19 curve flattens. He said there had been minimal accidents along the Nairobi-Mombasa highway during the cessation of movement to and from Nairobi.  - mwaniki fm
