Fast-rising singer Adasa has released 'Mahaba Niue', a love ballad meant to be a dedication to those in love. She said in a statement, "I recorded it at Dallaz Studios, where I am signed and I hope it spreads love." Her other songs include 'Nipekeche', 'Tunaendana', 'Noma' and 'Niloweshe'. "I started singing in high school and then at church and other public events. My parents fully supported me though they insisted that I would put much concentration in my education too." She believes art helps solve unemployment, having been hired as a singer at one of the five-star hotels in town. "I've gone from audition to audition, but I was approached by the technical manager for Pride Inn Hotel and he asked me to report at the hotelâ€™s premises the next day," she said.
