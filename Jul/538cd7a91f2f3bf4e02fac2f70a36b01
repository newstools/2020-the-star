Car dealers have started diversifying services to cope with the tough times brought by the Covid-19 pandemic. DT Dobie for instance has started offering mechanical inspections for preowners, owners, buyers and sellers of used Mercedes and Volkswagen cars covering those bought locally, or imported from other countries. “For a fixed cost of  Sh3000 shillings plus VAT, we carry out what we call a ‘health check’ . This is thorough mechanical inspection of the vehicle and we advise customers about defects that need repairs, or replacement parts,” said Andrew Munyua, the DT Dobie Deputy Service Manager Nairobi. “If a customer has repairs carried out in our workshop, or parts bought from DT Dobie, the 3,000 shillings is refunded, or credited to the bill.” He added pre owned buyers of used Mercedes and Volkswagen cars are advised to have a thorough mechanical check-up by DT Dobie before concluding a purchase. This will save expenses resulting from unexpected repairs, or and parts required for the work. DT Dobie has put in place measures to ensure compliance with the rules which the Government has introduced to limit the spread of the coronavirus.
