The Kenya Women Parliamentary Association (Kewopa) members on Tuesday voted by acclamation to remove Purity Ngirici as chairperson. The Kirinyaga woman representative was replaced by her Kiambu counterpart Gathoni Wamuchomba. She however dismissed the purported changes saying the association's constitution was not followed. Members proposed Kiambu Woman MP Gathoni Wamuchomba to replace her. “They can remove me when they want to. They need to call a meeting. There must be a meeting of seven days. They must invite every member. There should be two-thirds, not signatures.” “They cannot event take powers of the secretariat. This is just a story. Let us follow the procedure. ” The MPs accused her of poor leadership at the association and failure to protect interests of women in leadership. Kewopa is a membership association of all women parliamentarians drawn from across all political parties both elected and nominated in the Senate and National Assembly. Ngirici's woes are linked to the failed attempt to impeach Kirinyaga governor Anne Waiguru in which she sided with MCAs behind the motion.
