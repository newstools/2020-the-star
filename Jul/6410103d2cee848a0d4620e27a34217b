Police in Makueni are holding a 32-year-old woman after a man died in her house at Shimo estate in Wote town. The body of Stephen Soo, the suspect's age mate, was found dangling from the roof of her single room on Monday morning after she reported to Makueni police station. According to the report, the suspect claimed the deceased, a boda boda rider within Wote town, went to visit her on Sunday night but she retired to bed, leaving him to watch a football match between Chelsea and Manchester United. She woke up in the morning to find he had hanged himself using his jacket. "Since she was very tired, she retired to bed leaving Stephen relaxing on the sofa set. She woke up at 4:25am and found that he had hanged himself on the roof of her house using his jacket," reads part of the police report seen by the Star Makueni county police commander Timothy Maina, who confirmed the incident, said the matter was being handled by the Directorate of Criminal Investigations as the death was suspicious. "Other than what the woman reported to us, the death appears suspicious, but a postmortem will be done to determine what caused the death," Maina told the Star in his office. "It is not possible for someone to hang in a room where another one is sleeping and is not noticed. Again the distance between the floor and the roof of the room cannot facilitate commission of the same," Maina said. Family members of the deceased and boda boda riders who went to see the body in Makueni County Referral Hospital mortuary said it had blood in the mouth, nose and ears. Edited by Henry Makori
