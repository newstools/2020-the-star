Everton have shown promise under manager Carlo Ancelotti but the challenge for the team will be to become consistent and push for European qualification, skipper Seamus Coleman has said. Coleman said the Merseyside club must ensure the momentum does not fizzle out, having experienced false dawns under former managers Silva, Ronald Koeman and Roberto Martinez. Coleman said the Merseyside club must ensure the momentum does not fizzle out, having experienced false dawns under former managers Silva, Ronald Koeman and Roberto Martinez. “I don’t want to be having these conversations year after year when you have a decent run of form,” said defender Coleman. “You don’t want to be just speaking after a good few games saying, ‘we are doing well.’ I want us to be consistent. I want the club to be back challenging for Champions League places. “Carlo Ancelotti has not put pen to paper on a contract to be with a mid-table team. He wants to be successful. It’s up to the players to keep driving it on. If we’re not good enough I’m sure this manager will see it and bring his own players in.”
