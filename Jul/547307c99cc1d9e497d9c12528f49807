President Uhuru Kenyatta has scheduled an extraordinary session of the National County Government Coordination Summit on Friday, following a surge in coronavirus cases. In a statement on Monday, Uhuru said the session will entail checking the counties' state of preparedness. "The Session has been convened following a surge of Covid-19 infections across our Nation; with the disease having now manifested in 44 of our 47 counties," the statement signed by State House spokesperson Kanze Dena-Mararo said. There will be a review of the efficacy of the containment measures in place and review the impact of the phased easing of restrictions that were in place. "The session will consider the evolution of the disease and the medical models on how Covid-19 may propagate within our country over the months of August and September," the statement read. Uhuru further urged Kenyans to adhere to the rules and regulations to reduce spread of the virus. Tana River became the latest county to record a Covid-19 case on Saturday, raising the number of counties with the virus to 44. Health CS Mutahi Kagwe said the rising trend is worrying and urged Kenyans to save each other from this virus as the numbers of positive cases go up by the day. The CS was visiting Embu to asses the county’s preparedness to handle Covid-19. Kagwe said personal responsibility means saving yourself and saving another person. "You save me, I save you. That is what is called personal responsibility. If we agree, we are going to save each other. Take the responsibility of saving your family, friends and the public in general. And by observing the containment measures we can do that," Kagwe said. He asked people to assume that the person beside them is positive and if they approach them they might get the virus.
