If thievery in Kenya was only about biscuits, US ambassador to Kenya Kyle McCarter has said. This was after a monkey 'stole' McCarter 's biscuits at a Naivasha park on Saturday. "Mgondi stole my biscuits! #Stopthesethieves. If thievery in Kenya was only about biscuits...things would be just fine," he tweeted. But the replies on his account left much to be desired. @TimothyGuard22 asked McCarter "As a super power country's ambassador to our corrupt nation how are you planning to help us poor Kenyans from the shackles of corrupt dynasties." But McCarter hit back at him saying he does not choose Kenyan leaders. "I can’t choose your leadership. It is not my job. You must choose," he said. He went ahead to say that Kenya deserves self-reliance after he was asked to stop the US from interfering with Kenyan elections. "Don’t blame me. I would have made this the goal decades ago if I was in charge. I have done such in my own work," McCarter said. President Uhuru Kenyatta is tightening the anti-corruption laws in radical changes that would make it mandatory for all state officers, including the Deputy President, to step aside if charged. The President is also piling pressure on the Judiciary with a proposed requirement that all graft cases are concluded within two years. In a Bill tabled in the National Assembly, appointed state officers who are under graft investigations could be forced to step aside for 90 days even before they are charged. Uhuru has often stated that winning the war against corruption and uniting the country are among the major issues he wants as his legacy. “It is my hope that I will leave a united and cohesive society, and that we shall have won the war on corruption,” he said early this year.
