Some Mombasa folk turned violent and beat up a policeman after he told them to wear their mask in compliance with Covid-19 rules. The group from Kibokoni, however, said the officer was harassing them. The officer escaped narrowly after his screams attracted the attention of his colleagues from Central police station, who rushed to his rescue. The police constable is a Critical Infrastructure Protection Unit officer based in Tononoka. He is attached to Coast General Provincial Hospital. A police report filed at Central police station, the officer sustained head and body injuries. "The victim was rushed to Coast General Hospital and is in a stable condition. Progress report to follow," the report said. A nurse at the hospital said the officer suffered mild head injuries and a fracture. This is the latest incident of officers clashing with members of public over coronavirus directives enforcement. On July 6, residents protesting the killing of man selling masks and sanitiser in Kisii burned down Rioma police station. Edited by EKibii
