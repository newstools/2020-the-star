Kisumu county Industrialisation CEC Nerry Achar has stepped aside from his position. In a statement on Monday evening, Govenor Anayng Nyong'o noted that he had received the letter from Achar. “This is in to allow for the conclusion of a judicious matter that the said minister is engaged in,” he said. The governor who did not disclose, which case Achar was handling further stated that he had duly notified the county assembly speaker Elisha Oraro of his consent to the CEC's request. Achar before being moved to the industrialisation docket was the former CEC for Finance. However while serving as the Finance boss, he had a shaky term with MCAs  impeaching him in August last year. While impeaching him, 37 MCAs voted for his removal while three voted against his censure. The ward reps accused Achar of incompetence and gross violation of the Constitution. Kolwa East MCA Steve Owiti tabled the impeachment motion against Achar on July 30 last year and a select committee of 16 members was formed to investigate the allegations against him. The MCAs found that Achar was culpable in the motion's allegations hence unfit to hold any public office within the county. The committee recommended that the governor dismiss Achar with immediate effect. They also recommended that the Directorate of Criminal Investigations and the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission take up the matter. Achar  challenged his impeachment in court, but the case was dismissed in March this year. The minister however found his way back to the Cabinet after Nyong’o appointed him to the Energy and Industrialisation department. The assembly was to determine whether he lodged an appeal again in court or not by Tuesday.
