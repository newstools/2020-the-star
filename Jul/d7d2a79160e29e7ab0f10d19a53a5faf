The wait for a formula to determine how the 47 counties share the national cake continued on Tuesday. This is after Senate Deputy Speaker Margaret Kamar adjourned the stormy sitting at 9.05pm before members could take a vote on a formula. Amid shouts from the charged members, Kamar cited the curfew orders imposed by the President as well the many point of orders and at least 12 members who had requested to contribute. Nairobi Senator Johnson Sakaja had just moved a motion on a formula he proposed to counter the disputed one fronted by the House Finance and Budget Committee. While moving the motion, soon after the senators rejected amendments introduced by Murang'a Senator Irungu Kangata to the formula proposed by the Committee, Sakaja said the his method would ensure no county loses revenue. "The day I will see Nairobi get Sh30 billion is the day I say that this principal of one man one shilling applies," he said. As nominated Senator Isaac Mwaura was contributing to Sakaja's motion, Nandi senator Samson Cherargei stood on a point of order and urged the speaker to adjourn the sitting. Cherargei said it was past the curfew time imposed by the President. He was supported by Nakuru's Susan Kihika. However, senators Kipchumba Murkomen, Abshiro Halake and Stewart Madzayo rejected the adjournment, saying that a motion had earlier been approved to allow the lawmaker clear the business before them. Speaker Kenneth Lusaka will now have to gazette a special sitting for the members to conclude the debate and vote. Should he fail to gazette a sitting then the debate will resume next Tuesday.
