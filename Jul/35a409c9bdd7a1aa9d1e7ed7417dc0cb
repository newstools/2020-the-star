The Interior has dismissed reports on blogs alleging CS Fred Matiang’i has been admitted at the Aga Khan University Hospital as 'completely untrue'. In a tweet on Friday, the ministry said, On Wednesday, Health CAS Rashid Aman dismissed reports that the government has barred all the Cabinet Secretaries from traversing the country amid a surge in coronavirus cases. The CAS said the purpose of the circular from the office of the Head of Public Service - which prompted the reports - was to reinforce the containment measures. “The purpose of the circular was simply to reinforce the measures that the government had put in place for civil servants and public servants to observe,” Aman said. The clarification followed reports that President Uhuru  Kenyatta had barred Cabinet secretaries from touring the country as part of efforts to curb spread of Covid-19. However, Aman warned CSs against nonessential tours. Meanwhile, Government Spokesperson Cyrus Oguna on Friday confirmed he has tested positive for Covid-19. In a statement on Friday he said, "Recently having come from an assignment out of town , I developed mild coronavirus symptoms and got tested." "The results came back positive for coronavirus and I am now receiving medical care and responding well to treatment at an isolation and treatment facility." Oguna said contact tracing is ongoing, adding that his family is fine. Early this week, Oguna had dismissed reports he had been admitted. He took to Twitter to say, "We have noted reports on social media purporting that I have been admitted in hospital. I wish to clarify that I am well and just got back from an assignment out of town.” Oguna has been a regular fixture during coronavirus briefings conducted by the Health ministry daily.
