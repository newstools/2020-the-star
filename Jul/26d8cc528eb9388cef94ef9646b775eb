IsÂ selling the union between President Uhuru Kenyatta (pictured) and ODM leader Raila Odinga in some parts of Central Kenya so difficult that one has to engage in theatrics to convince locals to support the idea? Well, a woman rep from the region appeared to imply that asking locals to support the union could be as difficult as selling ice to Eskimos. While addressing locals during a public function, the legislator fell to her knees to convince her constituents to support the Uhuru-Raila union. She even warned locals that failure to support the two could lead them to the opposition. She appealed to residents to warmly welcome the duo whenever they visit the area. Chief officers in a county in Western are in a panic after the Public Procurement Regulatory Agency said it is investigating how their procurement processes are conducted. A little bird whispers to Corridors that chief officers in the county have been empowered by the governor to undermine the authority of their respective CECs, and are messing everything up big time. They are said to see to it that tenders worth over Sh6 million are divided into two or three so that they are not advertised, but end up being awarded to a single person. This is against the public procurement rules. But the chief officers have blinded the governor, deceiving him to believe that what they are doing is okay. Perhaps one ward representative in Nairobi just wanted to make headlines. The MCA threatened to resign to protest the grabbing of a parcel of land in Parklands area. It would certainly be the first in a country where leaders vow to die rather than resign when they are implicated in scandals. The ward leader posted on social media that he has tried in vain to stop land grabbers from putting up a building at the land and is, therefore, contemplating resignation because he cannot live with the fact that he did not stop the illegal activity in his area. Only time will tell if the MCA will go ahead with his threat.
