Three suspects were on Sunday evening arrested while indulging in a fake fish supplements business in Nairobi's Roysambu area. The suspects; Isaac Njoroge, Dennis Mugambi Kamwara and Brenda Watetu Kamau make part of the criminal gang identifying with the names Ziporah Kariuki, Hamisi, Jonah and Stephen Maina. They were arrested by DCI detectives based in Lang'ata. "The trio-who are among a wider syndicate and whose operations are conducted under pseudo names using different phone numbers - shuts further connection after receiving money from their victims, leaving them stranded with no traceable physical address," DCI tweeted. The three are said to be luring unsuspecting victims into the venture. Via Twitter, the Directorate said they have received increased reports of such cases in the area. "More investigations ongoing and suspects to be charged with, among any other possible counts, Obtaining Money by False Pretences C/Sec 313 of the Penal Code," he said. The DCI cautioned members of the public to be careful whenever engaging in any online business transactions with individuals, agencies whose physical addresses and legality of operations they do not know. Fish oil dietary supplements offer a convenient way for consumers to receive the associated health benefits of eating fatty fish, without eating fish. But, some products on the market may not contain the beneficial, natural form of omega-3 fatty acids that the packaging of these products suggests.
