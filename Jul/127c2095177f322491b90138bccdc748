Several traders at Ringa market in Kabondo Kasipul constituency are marking the month-end in agony after their businesses went up in flames at 12.30am. On Friday morning, property worth more than Sh1 million in four outlets - three shops and a butchery - were razed by a fire. The affected traders, led by Kepha Otieno, appealed for financial support from government agencies and well-wishers so they can reestablish their businesses. “I have lost property worth Sh200,000 in this incident. My family and I depended on the business, hence we appeal for help from well-wishers because we face serious financial difficulties,” Otieno said. According to Kojwach chief Caroline Onyango, the fire started from a shop that deep-fries and sells chips. “The fire started from the shop where potato chips were being cooked earlier. Residents suspect that fire used for cooking the chips was not put out properly, leading to the incident,” she said. The administrator said they reported the matter to police for investigations. Residents urged the Homa Bay government to intensify its firefighting efforts to rescue property in case of such incidents.
