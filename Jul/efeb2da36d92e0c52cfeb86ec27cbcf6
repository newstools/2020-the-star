The government will expand the hospital bed capacity in Nairobi by another 1,000 beds in the next 30 days to cater for Covid-19 cases. The Health ministry predicts a surge in the number of Covid-19 positive cases after President Uhuru Kenyatta lifted some restrictions. The President lifted movement restrictions in Mombasa, Nairobi and Mandera Monday and reopened places of worship with strict guidelines. The Kenyatta University Teaching and Referral Hospital is one of the facilities expected to provide an additional 500 beds. It currently has 300. The Health CS Mutahi Kagwe on Wednesday said the 1,000 beds may not be sufficient based on the case projections. Kagwe said the ministry will work with counties to ensure they upscale preparedness to deal with the pandemic. On Tuesday, he said counties will not evacuate patients to Nairobi. Counties were directed by President Uhuru Kenyatta to set up a minimum of 300 beds each for isolation of Covid-19 cases. “There are some counties that are still struggling to get the level of 300-bed capacity minimum. The up scaling of this capacity has got other benefits as well,” Kagwe said. He, however, noted that in addition to physical infrastructure, counties should train medics and enforce containment guidelines. “County governments must be prepared. That is why we are training people at the county level so that there is capability within the county to take care of as many cases as we can get,” he said. As of Wednesday, 26 counties had met the requirement, according to the Council of Governors’ report. The report indicated that the counties have 6,898 isolation beds against the requirement of 30,500. “The fortunate bet is that most of the cases in our country are asymptomatic so they are not exactly sick. They are people who can move on with life but they can pass the virus. Therefore, there will be need to be isolated.” Some of the counties that attained the capacity include Mombasa with 432 beds, Machakos with 373, Kiambu (325), Uasin Gishu(324), Makueni (312), Murang’a (305), Vihiga and Homa Bay with (300 each), Nyeri (340), Kisii  (318) and Kilifi (308). CoG chairperson Wycliffe Oparanya on Wednesday said the remaining 21 counties will meet the capacity by July 22. The CS has challenged the counties to take advantage of existing institutions to set up the isolation centres. So far, 42 counties out of the 47 have recorded a case Data from Wednesday’s briefing show that the number of positive cases in the country is 8,528 after 278 more were confirmed in 24 hours.
