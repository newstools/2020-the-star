Police in Lugari on Wednesday intercepted over 600 litres of chang'aa in transit to Eldoret. The consignment was intercepted at a roadblock near Spring Park hotel on the Eldoret-Malaba highway. The driver of the car transporting the brew hit and damaged a police vehicle that was parked on the roadside at the roadblock as he attempted to escape. The driver and a passenger fled to a nearby maize farm. They left behind their mobile phones. Lugari subcounty police commander Patrick Maundu said the illicit brew, which was packed in 20-litre jerrycans, originated from Bungoma county. Maundu said the driver of the vehicle was flagged down by officers manning the roadblock but instead of stopping he tried to make a U-turn, thereby hitting the police vehicle. On inspecting the car the officers found 620 litres of chang’aa. “The vehicle was carrying 31 jerrycans each filled with illicit brew. The vehicle has been booked several times by traffic officers for violating traffic rules. Whenever it is flagged down, the driver usually speeds off,” Maundu said. The vehicle was towed to Turbo police station awaiting the arrest and arraignment of the driver. Maundu warned they will mount a crackdown on the highway to nab those engaging in the illegal business. "This period should be used by every Kenyan to address the Covid-19 issues and how to remain safe, not selling chang'aa. In fact drinking should not be going on now and that is why even bars are still closed," he said. Edited by A.N
