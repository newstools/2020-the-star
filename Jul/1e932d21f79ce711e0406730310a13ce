Kisumu Governor Anyang Nyong’o wants the construction of the Jomo Kenyatta International Stadium in Kisumu to start immediately. A team comprising architects, quantity surveyors, structural, mechanical and electrical engineers, led by Deputy Secretary in the county, Josephine Onunga, visited the site on Friday. Nyong’o and his Sports and Culture County Executive Committee member Achie Alai led the team to the site at Mamboleo Agricultural Society of Kenya grounds where he asked them to start the works. The facility was named Jomo Kenyatta International Stadium in honour of the country’s first president, the late Jomo Kenyatta. The ground breaking ceremony for the Sh350 million multipurpose facility was conducted by Cabinet Secretary, Amina Mohamed on June 24, 2020. The CS said President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga wanted the construction of the 20,000 capacity ultra-modern stadium to be completed in under one year. The Jomo Kenyatta Sports Ground in the Central Business District, which was renamed Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Sports Center as tribute to Kenya’s first Vice President, will be upgraded. "As we invest in programmes to encourage the youth to nurture their talents, we must put up commensurate investments in sporting infrastructure to tap such talents," said the CS during the launch. The developments are a partnership between the county and national government designed to improve sporting facilities within the county. The county is also seeking partnership to upgrade degraded Moi Stadium in Kisumu. Nyong’o has also pledged to upgrade Muhoroni Stadium. Kisumu is a hotbed of talent having teams featuring in top tier rugby, football, hockey, and basketball leagues.
