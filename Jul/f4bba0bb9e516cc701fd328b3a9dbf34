Health CS Mutahi Kagwe created a light moment during his Covid-19 briefing when he threatened to expose officials who are still in office despite hitting retirement age. "We don't want to humiliate anybody. when you have worked for the Ministry of Health, for as long as some people here have, our prayer is that when your years have come, please go home peacefully, nicely, let's shake hands. Go and say bye to your colleagues," he said. The CS went ahead to joke that he would be forced to call the culprits' grandchildren to come for them. This left people present, including fellow Ministry of Health officials and members of the press, cracking up. "I hear there are some people who are still around. One of these fine days I'm going to send a message to their grandchildren. #Kujachukua mama, #Kujachukua baba, #Chukua babu tafadhali," he said. This comes a month after a standoff at Afya House after four Ministry of Health officers refused to move after Kagwe transferred them. The senior officers from different departments had worked in the ministry for over a decade. The transfer was part of the CS clean up after billions of public funds were reported missing. There were expenditure concerns as to how the ministry was spending the coronavirus funds. Two weeks ago, the CS deployed two more officers over accusation of abuse of office. Meanwhile, Kagwe on Tuesday announced 183 new Covid-19 cases, raising the total number of infections to 8,250.
