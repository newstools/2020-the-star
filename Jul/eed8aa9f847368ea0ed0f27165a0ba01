Senate will meet this week to consider governors' request for virtual meetings. Senate Speaker Kenneth Lusaka on Sunday said Covid-19 is real but “there are crucial Senate meetings that need to be well thought out”. “By Wednesday, I will communicate to the Council of Governors what we will have agreed on," he said on the phone. "As you know, the County Public Accounts and Investment Committee is critical and its meetings involve going through documents and reports.” On Monday, Council of Governor chairman Wycliffe Oparanya wrote to Lusaka asking that the CPAIC, chaired by Nyamira Senator Sam Ongeri, hold virtual meetings when questioning county chiefs on audit reports. The committee is going through the Auditor General’s reports for 2015-16, 2016-17, 2017-18. “The ministry of Health has given measures, which include observation of social distance, to contain the spread of the virus. In line with that, the council has advised all its members to avoid any physical appearance given the escalating number of confirmed cases,” Oparanya said in the letter also copied to Health CS Mutahi Kagwe. “The council proposes that Senate make use of other alternative means to engage [us] such as through virtual meetings which have been adopted by other organs of government such as the Judiciary among others.” It is understood that the Senate is not likely to likely accede to the request as each senator will have to be provided with bulky documents making it cumbersome venture.
