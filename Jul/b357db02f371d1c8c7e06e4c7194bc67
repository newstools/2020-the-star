Grandpa Records CEO and founder Refigah has paid a moving tribute in loving memory of the late Kibra MP Ken Okoth, who died a year ago after a long battle with cancer. In his tribute, Refigah says the two met on social media and became friends thereafter. "We frequently interacted, and he became close to me like a brother," he told Word Is. "Each time I posted on social media about charity or any community programme, he always called and asked to join, and we managed to carry out several community activities together." Refigah said the late Ken was always a phone call away, even in the middle of the night. "Whenever there was a need, he made 'Uheshimiwa' so normal. Didnâ€™t use big cars, and at no time had he ever portrayed himself as more important than others," he said. "Whenever he met a talented artiste, he always directed them to Grandpa Records for assistance. "Kibra overall community affairs was something he never missed in any of his conversations." In 2018, when he travelled to France for treatment, Refigah says they were always in contact. "I lost my father-in-law at the time and he managed to send his brother, the current MP Imran Okoth, to represent him during the burial in Ngong," he said. He refers to Ken as a hero and a legend. Refigah is currently doing charity under #SimamaNaKibra to help the less fortunate by feeding them in Kibra.
