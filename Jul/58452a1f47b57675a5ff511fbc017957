Gospel singer Gloria Muliro says her new song 'Nakubaliana' is meant to encourage people. Speaking to Word Is, Gloria said people should stand with the word of God because it is forever established and doesn't change. "It is just a song that builds faith in people that no matter what they may be going through, they can hold on to the word and God will come through for them," she said. This is Muliro's first release since the corona pandemic hit Kenya, and it comes five months after she released 'Look to Jesus'. She says she was badly hit by the pandemic. "One of my nature of ministry involves meeting people and going out a lot but. Because of the social distancing thing, that has not been possible," she said. She has been using social media and other platforms to interact with and encourage people.
