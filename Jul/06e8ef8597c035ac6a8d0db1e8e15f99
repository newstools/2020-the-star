The High court has directed the Inspector General of Police to restore Kandara MP Alice Wahome's security detail without fail. Justice James Makau on Thursday said the action of the IG to withdraw Wahome's security was illegal. "Wahome being an MP since 2013 has a legitimate expectation to be given armed police officers as her security and not to be withdrawn without justification,"said the judge. The Judge observed that the security assigned to Wahome was not done in accordance with the law. Wahome filed the case in February this year claiming that the withdrawal of her security detail was part of a plot by the government to eliminate her. Through Lawyer Stephen Gitonga, the MP said she is unable to discharge her constituency duties effectively after her security detail was withdrawn. “The withdrawal of my security leaves me with one conclusion that my life is in danger and the state is organising to hurt, injure or eliminate me through security agencies or goons," the MP said. The Inspector General of Police Hillary Mutyambai had on January 20 indicated that VIPs involved in or suspected to be involved in crime will not be provided with security until they are cleared by the courts. The statement was made through the director of corporate communications for the National Police Service. Subsequently, Wahome's police bodyguards were recalled. But Wahome said she was never informed of the reasons for that. “In arriving at the decision, the IG totally disregarded the Constitution and laws in Kenya regarding the protection and security of members of Parliament. The decision was made without any force of law, was unreasonable, whimsical and ought to be quashed,” said the legislator.
