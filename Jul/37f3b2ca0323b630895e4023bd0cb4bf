Diamond Platnumz has gifted Zuchu, the new female signee of Wasafi, with a car as a present to welcome her to the celeb world. Zuchu is singer Khadija Kopa’s daughter. Previously, she said she used to board matatus while her songs were being played on radio. She now has a car that has a striking resemblance to the one Diamond gifted ex-girlfriend Tanasha Donna. The same type of car he also gifted his mother on her birthday last year. In his message, the ‘Jeje’ hitmaker asked Zuchu to be disciplined just like her mother. “In life everything is possible, but we need to beleive in our dreams and pray a lot. Be respectful and disciplined. I wish you all the best, Zuchu," he said. The car was brought to the stage where Zuchu was performing by Rayvanny, leaving her in tears while Diamond Platnumz embraced her. The event was attended by Tanzanian celebs, among them Lady Jay Dee, Mbosso, Juma Jux, Diamond’s manager Sallam, Esma, Sandra Kassim, Rayvanny Irene Uwoya, Jokate Mwegelo. Also present were the singer’s exes Wema Sepetu and Hamisa Mobetto. Diamond, who was dressed in a black suit with a touch of gold, revealed that he was dressed by his baby mama Hamisa Mobetto. Speaking to Tanzanian media, Diamond said, "Nashukuru Mobetto styles ndio wamenivalisha. Ni designer na mimi kama Mtanzania nina kila haki ya kusupport Watanzinia wenzangu." Zuchu recently released her EP, titled ‘I Am Zuchu’. Edited by T Jalio
