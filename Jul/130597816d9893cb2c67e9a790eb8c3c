The high poverty levels and hunger in some remote Lamu villages during coronavirus could send many into joining crime group including al Shabaab. Local administrators say the worst-hit areas are Bobo, Roka, Kibiboni, Kwasasi, Mkondoni, Bargoni and surrounding villages. Hundreds of casual labourers in hotels and restaurants lost their jobs after many of the joints closed down due to Covid-19. Speaking during their weekly advisory committee meeting in Lamu town on Sunday, chiefs, their assistants and Nyumba Kumi officials expressed worry that the lack of basic necessities could prompt many to join terror groups in pursuit of a better life. Hundreds of residents in these villages are facing starvation and are appealing for relief aid. Chief Ahmed Lausi of Hindi said the situation had led to an increase in loitering youths. He said such people can easily be targeted by terror groups as they are vulnerable. “The number of people walking around hopelessly and idle is alarming. People are hungry and we are just concerned that as administrators. Our biggest plea is for the government and well-wishers to help with relief food and aid,” Lausi said. He revealed that some parents, especially mothers, had gone to extreme cases of giving out their children for sexual favourds in exchange of food and financial aid. The situation has greatly contributed to the soaring cases of teen pregnancies in Lamu county. Lamu recorded its first two coronavirus cases last month. “The Covid-19 situation has caused untold suffering. We are worried that it could get worse," Nyumba Kumi official Peter Mwaura said. Affected residents have urged the government to stop over-focusing on victims of flooding when distributing relief aid as they are equally in need. Edited by R.Wamochie
