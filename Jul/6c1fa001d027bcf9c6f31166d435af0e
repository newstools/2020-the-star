A new acting director general has been appointed at the Kenya Maritime Authority. John Odira Oming’o replaces George Okong’o who resigned on July 8. KMA chairman Geoffrey Mwango said Oming’o will hold the fort until a substantive holder is recruited. Oming’o’s appointment took effect on July 15 and he formally took the reins from Okong’o in a brief ceremony at the KMA headquarters on Monday. Oming’o holds a Bachelor of Education (Science) degree from Kenyatta University, a Master of Science degree in Commercial Shipping Management from the World Maritime University, Sweden, and a post-graduate diploma in Ports, Shipping and Transport Management from International Maritime Transport Academy, Netherlands. He is an alumnus of the Strathmore Business School (Nairobi), Lagos Business School (Nigeria) and IESE Business School, Barcelona (Spain). “John Odira Oming’o has also attended several short-term courses in management and maritime transport industry and is a member of the Institute of Chartered Shipbrokers (UK),” Mwango said. He described Oming’o as an experienced man with 29 years of maritime service under his belt. He worked for 15 years as a commercial maritime officer at the Kenya Ports Authority and for 14 years as the head of commercial shipping at the KMA. Oming’o said he will steer the KMA ship to greater heights. “This is an honour which I will serve with all the dedication this post deserves,” he said. Edited by Henry Makori
