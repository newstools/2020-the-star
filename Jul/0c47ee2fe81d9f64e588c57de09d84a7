A court has dismissed a discrimination suit brought by a lawyer against her law firm partners. Justice Stephen Radido said the court had no jurisdiction to hear the case because Nzilani Mweu was a partner in Kiptiness and Odhiambo Associates, and not an employee. “All in all, the court is not satisfied that the petitioner was an employee of the respondent for purposes of Employment Act, 2007. As a partner, she was an employer,” the judge ruled. Radido further ruled he was not convinced that he had jurisdiction over a dispute on the distribution of partnership revenue or commissions as the statutory law currently stands. The judge said he could not determine whether Nzilani was discriminated against as a partner or that she is entitled to commissions or share of revenues. “Even if the court were to hold that the petitioner was an employee, it would not be possible to sever the actions for constitutional violations from the claims over partnership revenue distribution,” Radido said. He encouraged the parties to seek mediation. Nzilani had said that she was hired by the law firm in 2015 and two years later she was offered the position of fixed remuneration partner starting January 1, 2018. However she resigned in September of that year and gave the firm a six-month notice Nzilani said the notice was accepted and the firm waived three months. She argued that her rights were violated and there was a breach of contract. She asked the court to determine whether she was a partner and therefore entitled to profits of 7.5 as had been agreed. During the hearing, she said under the terms agreed by the parties she was entitled to a fixed remuneration as well as bonuses and participation in profits. She told the court that she was not involved in decision-making as this did not fall under her job description. The court also heard that she was not a party to the partnership deed between Crispine Odhiambo and Stephen Kiptiness. Edited by Josephine M. Mayuya
