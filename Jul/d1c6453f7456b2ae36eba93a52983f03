Two politicians have come to the defence of Nairobi Senator Johnson Sakaja after he resigned from a Senate committee for flouting Covid-19 regulations. Sakaja on Monday resigned as chairman of the Senate Adhoc Committee on Covid-19. Speaking outside the Kilimani Police Station after recording a statement, Sakaja apologised to Kenyans for flouting the government's curfew orders and announced he was stepping down from the committee. The senator said he had decided to step down from his position in the committee in order to set an example and take responsibilityÂ for his actions. "I take responsibility for having flouted the Covid-19 rules. I was outside my home past 9 pm. It is regrettable but all of us make mistakes," he said. But via Twitter on Monday, Kakamega Senator Cleophas Malala said they shall not accept Sakaja's resignation. "Being found in a bar past time is equivalent to forgetting to put on a mask while eating. I stand with my distinguished cousin," he said. But the senator moments after deleted the tweet. The Director of Political Affairs at State House Machel Waikenda also came to Sakaja's defence. "I stand with my brother Sakaja and the senate should not accept his resignation," he said. However, minutes later, Waikenda too deleted his tweet. Sakaja was arrested alongside three others after they were found drinking outside the a city pub at around 1 am on Saturday. While in custody, the senator was asked to be given a free bond but he refused to leave the cell. The police later said Sakaja threatened to transfer all the officers involved in his arrest within 24 hours.
