Governor Wilber Ottichilo owes Vihiga taxpayers a clean payroll before his first term in office expires, the county Public Service executive has said. “If we manage to clean the payroll we are going to have enough funds for development in this county. Cleaning that payroll  is non-negotiable until is fully done," Pamela Kimwele said. She spoke to the Star on Tuesday at the county headquarters. There have been allegations that county payroll has been infiltrated by cartels in the recent past, with the county losing millions of shillings every financial year. Kimwele assumed office late January when Governor Ottichilo shuffled his cabinet, replacing Paul Mbuni. Mbuni was replaced amid claims of irregular employment of health workers and that there were ghost workers on the county payroll. "If the county fails to clean the payroll, Governor Ottichilo will have no choice but to engage the EACC and DCI to step in to root out those cartels who have manned the county payroll since the inception of devolution," Kimwele said. "We are already done with the head count and we are now in the verification process." She said verification will include the directors in relevant departments where each staff will be linked to her or his file. Within the file they will be checking when the staff was hired, leave procedures and other key information attached on the individual, Kimwele said. "We are doing verification because during head count even ghost workers will present themselves for the same." Those who will be found with contradictory information will face jail terms and fines for siphoning county resources. "Supervisors must give us the right information, so for those who might have gone astray while providing the information they will bear the consequences for not doing what is needed."
