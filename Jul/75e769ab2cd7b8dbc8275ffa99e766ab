Elephantiasis which is scientifically referred to as Lymphatic filariasis is a neglected tropical disease with a high prevalence in the Coastal region. Infection occurs when filarial parasites are transmitted to humans through mosquitoes. Infection is usually acquired in childhood, causing hidden damage to the lymphatic system. The adult worms only live in the human lymph system, which maintains the bodyâ€™s fluid balance and fights infections. The worm causes blockage of lymphatic channels, causing the lymph to accumulate and cause swelling of the body parts below the blockage. The swelling affects mostly the legs and the scrotum in men. However, in less common cases, it affects the arms and the breasts in women. According to the World Health Organization, the painful and profoundly disfiguring visible manifestations of the disease occur later in life and can lead to permanent disability. Such body deformities often lead to social stigma and sub-optimal mental health, loss of income-earning opportunities and increased medical expenses for patients and their caretakers. The asymptomatic infections still cause damage to the lymphatic system and the kidneys and alter the body's immune system. Even though the eradication is possible by the implementation of the WHO preventive treatment protocols, once the worm has established itself in the body, there is no drug that can destroy it and it must live out its lifespan. The global baseline estimate of people affected by lymphatic filariasis was 25 million men with hydrocele and over 15 million people with lymphedema in 2018.
