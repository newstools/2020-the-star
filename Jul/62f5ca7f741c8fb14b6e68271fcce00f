AFC Leopards have tabled  bid to sign Kariobangi Sharks speedster Harrison Mwendwa as they seek to strengthen their squad for the new season. The winger has for long been linked with a possible move to record Tanzanian champions Yanga but according to a senior Sharks official who sought anonymity, Leopards are likely to acquiring his services ahead of the chasing pack. The former Mathare United had attracted the eyes of Yanga scouts during the SportPesa Cup held in Dar-es-salaam last year in January following his outstanding performance, which saw him named Man of the Match in the final. However, Sharks have maintained that the Jangwani Boys have never made a formal inquiry of Mwendwa’s  signature alongside that of national U-23 midfielder Sven Yidah, who is also on their radar. The official says that negotiations between them and Leopards are at an advanced stage and should the two reach a consensus, then Mwendwa will make his way to the den. “I can confirm Leopards have expressed interest in him and we are negotiating.  Should Leopards meet our demands since the player has a running contract,  then we will complete his transfer. He remains our player and we are committed to honour the terms in his contract until we agree with the interested club,” he revealed. Besides being linked to Mwendwa, Leopards are understood to be pursuing former Gor Mahia captain Harun Shakava, former Rayon Sports and Burundian international Jules Ulimwengu as well as KCCA and Ugandan midfielder Muzamiru Mutyaba. Ingwe are also seeking to reunite with their former skipper Duncan Otieno who plies his trade with 12-time Zambian champions Nkana FC. Otieno left the club two years ago
