A woman was on Tuesday charged with insulting police officers based in Riruta police station. Lonna Mwabishi was also charged with assaulting a female police officer. She was charged with creating disturbance in a manner likely to breach peace by calling police officers 'corrupt individuals who are out to take bribe and use it in prostitution'. Mwabishi is accused of committing both offences on July 3 at Riruta police station within Nairobi County. She was charged before Kibera senior resident magistrate Renee Kitagwa where she pleaded not guilty. The charge sheet says that she assaulted Walloce Bundi, a police officer who was executing her duties. She then went ahead to insult the police officers who were at the station. However, she denied both the charges and told the court that the officers assaulted her. She said the officer opened the case to have her charged as a way of hiding the issue of police brutality. Mwabishi was released on Sh 50, 000 or a cash bail of Sh20,000. The case will be mentioned on July 21.
