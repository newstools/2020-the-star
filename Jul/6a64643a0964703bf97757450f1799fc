Football Kenya Federation has assured clubs that there will be no conflict of interest as a result of donning shirts whose sponsor is deemed a rival to the new official league sponsor, Betking. Traditional football adversaries Gor Mahia and AFC Leopards will from next season be sponsored by Betsafe who are considered rivals to the new top flight sponsor Betking. Kariobangi Sharks are also sponsored by Betway while 2009 champions Sofapaka have Betika, who also double up as NSL sponsors, as their partner. On Thursday, FKF penned a five year deal with Betking, who will bankroll the elite competition for the next five years in a Sh1.2 billion deal. At the same time, FKF announced that they will run the league from Kandanda House with the Kenya Premier League tenure coming to an end. Clubs were fearful that the entry of Betking would prove suicidal for those already in contracts with betting company like it happened with Gor Mahia, who were prohibited from donning SportPesa branded shirts during continental matches since the Caf Champions League and the Caf Confederations Cup are sponsored by 1Xbet. "There will be no conflict of interest at all. Betking are aware there are clubs already sponsored by other betting firms," said FKF president Nick Mwendwa Mwendwa also assured clubs that Betking will start to disburse funds in the course of next week. "The first coin will hit their accounts within a week's time. We are not interested in controlling how clubs spend their money but we will keep on sourcing for more going forward," he added
