Makadara law court has been closed for 14 days after two judicial staffers tested positive for Covid-19. In a notice to the public on Wednesday, Makadara chief magistrate Hestone Nyaga said the court will reopen on August 5. Addressing members of the public who had come for mentions and hearing of  cases, Nyaga said that all the cases listed for the affected days shall be mentioned on the dates set out on the annexed schedule. Some who arrived as early as 7am were forced to go back as only those who wanted to pay bond and cash bail were allowed inside the court premises. An advisory from Makadara chief magistrate Emily Ominde on Tuesday read, “I have been in constant communication with the Judiciary management on the issue of the Covid-19 situation at Makadara." "I wish to confirm that the decision to close the courts with immediate effect for the next 14 days has been taken." Staff from the Ministry of Health who had gone to carry out testing had to go back because the majority of staff were not present. Nyaga said all staffers will be tested before resuming in August. He however refused to comment on the state of the judicial staff who tested positive. “I am not in a position to comment on that, what is important is that we are closing the court for 14 days and we will resume operations on August 5,” he said. On Friday last week, the court carried out fumigation. A spot check by the Star revealed that many Milimani court users do not observe social distancing rules.
