Hypertension and diabetes are the leading underlying causes that lead to the death of Covid-19 patients in Kenya, the Health Ministry has said. Acting Director General of Health Patrick Amoth on Wednesday said this category of people combined lead with a 33 per cent of the deaths. They are followed by Hypertension only at 17 per cent, Diabetes only (15 per cent), Chronic Lung diseases at 10 per cent, Cancer at 10 per cent and HIV at four per cent. So far Kenya has recorded 250 deaths since the first coronavirus case was announced on March 13, 2020. But he noted that several patients with pre-existing conditions have recovered from the disease. "I encourage anybody with any respiratory illness to visit the nearest health facility for assessment and management. All healthcare workers across the country have been trained on case detection and management," he said. Speaking during his Question and Answer Session on Twitter,  Amoth further noted that all patients with the virus are only discharged from isolation facilities after confirming that they cannot shed the virus to others. "The ministry continues to urge members of the public not to stigmatise anyone anyone who has suffered from Covid-19," he said. On July 10, Health CS Mutahi Kagwe revealed that diabetes has become the leading cause of fatal cases of Covid-19 in the country. Kagwe urged those with pre-existing conditions to take extra care during this global pandemic. In the latest KNBS report, 15 per cent of the households in Kenya reported having at least one member with diabetes. This was out of the 18.2 per cent of the households that claimed to have at least a member with a pre-existing medical condition.
