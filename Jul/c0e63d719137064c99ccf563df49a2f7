Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho and Suna East MP Junet Mohamed on Thursday evening met ODM leader Raila Odinga who is recuperating in Dubai after a back surgery. In a photo shared on Twitter, Junet said, "Finally with Baba." Junet and Joho were earlier seen in a private jet on their way to Dubai. Last week, Raila expressed gratitude to Kenyans for standing with him as he received treatment in the United Arab Emirates. In a one-minute video shared by his daughter Winnie Odinga, Raila, clad in a mustard polo t-shirt and blue shorts, said that the messages of goodwill from Kenyans made him recover quickly. “I want to thank all my friends, supporters and all our youth who have sent me so many messages of goodwill. It has just been amazing and wonderful. It makes me recover so fast,” Raila said. The former prime minister left the country in June for the United Arab Emirates. He underwent a minor surgical operation on his back. On June 26, Joho said Raila was progressing well after undergoing surgery. "We continue to pray for him. I have no doubt that within the shortest time possible, baba will be back in Kenya," Joho said.
