Last week, we told you of an Asian who wanted his case to be conducted in English and Kiswahili. This week, as suspect went to the extent of saying he wanted his charge sheet to be read in Dholuo. He said he does not understand Kiswahili or English. This surprised the magistrate because he was speaking Kiswahili. "Wewe huelewi Kiswahili?" the magistrate asked, to which the suspect signalled, “No”. When a translator was called, he quickly pleaded guilty to assault. The man had been charged with beating up his employer’s husband on instruction by his female boss. *** Suspects in court use all manner of tricks to get a free bond or lenient terms. A suspect accused of committing a traffic offence went to the extent of diagnosing as Covid-19 positive to get a free bond at a Nairobi court. "Your honour Sir, I am a Covid-19 patient. I wonder what I am doing here. I pray for a free bond so that I can go for medication," he said He had been screened at the gate and his temperature was normal and was thus allowed in. In response, the magistrate sought to know if he meant he had recovered from the novel disease. "You seem healthy. So you have recovered?," the magistrate asked. The said that he was in a “pathetic condition”. He was released on Sh10,000 cash bail. *** Another suspect opted to dictate to the magistrate the cash bail to be given.. "I don't have that money. Give me another option," the suspect told a Nairobi magistrate. It was not a not request but an order. "How can I raise Sh20,000 and I am jobless. Do me a favour," he added. The magistrate ordered him to pay the fine as awarded as it reflected the offence committed.
