The Housing and Development department will use balloting to assign stalls in modern markets. This was the same system used to allocate stalls in Westlands and Juja modern markets, the national government explained. The announcement comes days after Starehe MP Charles ‘Jaguar’ Njagua's arrest for allegedly inciting youth to forcibly occupy stalls at Mwariro market in Nairobi. “I will keep fighting for my constituents. Being a leader is tough but my resolve remains unshaken. Allocations at Mwariro market have to be fair,” he said. But in the press statement on Friday, Housing PS Charles Hinga said transparency is key in the issuance of available spaces. He said the names of successful applicants are published in the local dailies for transparency. Hinga asked those eyeing stalls in Kikuyu, Kihara, Ruiru, Mwariro and Karandini markets to fill application forms available at the Deputy Chief Constable (DCC) offices. "The applicants must prove their area of residence by providing recommendation in the application form from their area chief," the state department said. In Westlands, 134 open air market traders, 130 permanent market traders and 77 curio traders will occupy the available stalls by December. The new Mwariro market has a generator, 500 trading places, an underground water tank, a borehole, public toilets, parking and is fitted with CCTV. The market, situated at Kariokor in Starehe, was put up by the World Bank and the county government. Hinga said those who had applied for Mwariro market stalls should re-apply adhering to the set guidelines. The application process will be closed on July 17. Edited by Josephine M. Mayuya
