Former Kenya Pipeline Company MD Charles Tanui was on Thursday charged with irregular payment of Sh30 million for the supply of three transformers when he was in office. He was charged alongside Elias Maina who was chief manager in charge of the technical department and Josphat Sirima who was the chief engineer. The three are accused of abuse of office where they used their offices to improperly confer a benefit to Redline Limited by authorising the payment. They allegedly committed the offence on dates between January and February 2014, at the KPC offices in Industrial Area. The prosecution also accused the three of failing to follow procurement procedures in the award of the tender for the supply and installation of the transformers. They, however, denied the charges before Anti-Corruption chief magistrate Douglas Ogoti and were released on Sh700,000 bail each or an alternative Sh2 million bond and one surety. The magistrate also warned the accused not to interfere with witnesses. The case will be heard on August 3. Court records show that the offences were committed between 2003 and 2014 at the company’s premises in Nairobi. This comes a day after the court ordered Tanui to surrender himself. In a statement on Wednesday, EACC ordered Tanui to present himself to the Integrity Centre immediately. The EACC said it had already arrested the other two accused. Anti-graft CEO Twalib Mbarak said investigations revealed the trio were answerable for the irregular payment for supplies that were never installed. "Upon completion of investigations the file was submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions who upon independent review granted consent to charge the three former with abuse of office and making a false document," Mbarak said.
