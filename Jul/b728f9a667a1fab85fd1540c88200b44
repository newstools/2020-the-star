Wiper Party leader Kalonzo Musyoka has said the ongoing debate on revenue allocation to counties should consider population parameters. In a statement on Monday, Kalonzo said the funds are meant to be used by the people, hence population matters. Kalonzo added that the Senate should increase the money going to the equalization fund, whose purpose is to cushion marginalized counties. He said the Equalisation Fund can be increased by amending the Constitution through the BBI process and that the law governing administration of the fund should be fast tracked. Kalonzo also urged anti-corruption agencies to move swiftly and bring to book county officials embezzling funds meant for the people. “The county assemblies should move swiftly to impeach any county governor found culpable for misappropriation of public funds,” Kalonzo said. He added that the objective of devolution must not be tinkered with since devolved governance was the backbone of 2010 Constitution. Deputy President William Ruto had earlier asked Senators to end their unnecessarily divisive debate on revenue allocation. Ruto said that the Constitution envisages fair and equitable sharing of all resources and that senators “must as per its mandate structure a win-win formula that is sensitive to proposals made without hurting any county.” ODM leader Raila Odinga said the Senate should allow the country to move forward by adopting CRA report even as it considers the voices that have been raised regarding the same. Raila had also said that there is a need to encourage counties to raise their own revenue from the economic activities.
