A matatu tout who allegedly robbed a man of Sh3,000 will  serve one year in jail after pleading guilty to escaping from police custody. James Luthu, a Forward Sacco tout, was convicted on Friday by chief magistrate  Abdulqadir Lorot who ruled that he serves one year before the trial for  robbery with violence begins. Luthu was convicted after he pleaded guilty to escaping from Kayole police station where he had been taken after he was arrested on July 23. He however pleaded not guilty to the robbery with violence charges before the same court. Prosecutor Geoffrey Obiri said that the accused person sneaked out of the report office as the duty officer attended to another person and took off before he was rearrested 200 metres away. He said in mitigation that he escaped from the police station due to pressure. The charge sheet  read  in court said Luthu committed both offences on July 17 inside a minibus jointly with others who are at large. He robbed Benson Njau Maina of Sh3,000 in Njiru. The police report says Maina was attacked by men who had boarded the matatu at B centre stage posing as passengers headed to Eastleigh. His driver  saw  the incident after observing the commotion on CCTV in the driver’s cabin and intervened but other suspected gangsters had already joined Luthu to rob Maina. The matter was  reported to  Kayole police station and the accused was later arrested and charged. Luthu was arrested by other touts who launched a manhunt after they learnt he was wanted and took him to the police station. The magistrate directed the case to be mentioned on August 8.
