@Waithaka06 Laikipia Governor Ndiritu Muriithi and his deputy John Mwaniki have urged the county assembly to swiftly vet acting chief officers so services can be efficiently delivered. Muriithi said some officers are working in an acting capacity and need to be appraised so they can be formalised and operations stabilised. “Our reform programme includes even retooling our own staff. During our staff audit, we discovered that nearly 500 of them didn't have that high a level of education," Muriithi said on Wednesday. He did not elaborate. He was responding to concerns raised by MCAs led by Irene Wachuka (Nominated) over many government officers working in an acting capacity. They spoke during the swearing-in ceremony of Karanja Njora as county secretary, having been approved by the assembly last week. Njora, who is also the chief of staff, was approved after two years of wrangling between the county executive and the assembly. He was sworn in by Nanyuki resident magistrate Vincent Mativo at the Governor’s offices. Njora had been serving in an acting capacity since July 2018. Labour and Social Committee chairman George Karuiru (Olmoran) said Njora was vetted according to the procedure and found suitable. His nomination by the governor had first been rejected in 2018. Karuiru said the committee went through all of Njora's credentials in a lengthy vetting, then recommended his approval for the position. Majority leader Peter Thomi said Njora was seconded to the position by the national government after gaining experience while serving as an administrator. The Githiga MCA said the House had been moving in the wrong direction in the last two years by derailing Njora's endorsement. MCAs Mutahi Muritu (Tigithi), Minority leader Jacob Endom (Sosian), Cherubo Kaparo (Segera) and Irene Wachuka (Nominated) agreed with Karuiru. (Edited by V. Graham)
