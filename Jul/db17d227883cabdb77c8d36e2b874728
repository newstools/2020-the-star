Felix Korir is a heartbroken man after missing two international races just as his  career was taking shape. Korir had made a cut into Team Kenya to the Africa Cross Country championships in Lome, Togo and was among the favourites to represent the country at the World Under 20 Championships in Nairobi, Kenya. “I cut the team for Africa cross country after finishing second at the national cross country championships behind winner Samuel Chebolei but coronavirus pandemic forced the cancellation of the event,” said Korir. The Form Four student at Chewoyet National School in West Pokot County was to run in the 8km junior men's race. The former 1,500m runner now targeting 5,000m but revealed he is facing many challenges in individual training as part of his preparations for action once sports events resume. The 19-year-old runner from Suswa in Elgeyo Marakwet County trains alongside Africa Youth 5,000m silver medalist Jacob Krop in Chewoyet. Korir said he switched from 1,500m to 5,000m after realising that his body was too light for the three lap race. “I used to run 1,500m but I changed to 5,000m. I trained with my colleagues Krop and others and realised that I was good in 5,000m. I also realised my body was too light for 1,500m. I have also increased my mileage during training,” said Korir. The optimistic Korir said he still has a chance to run for Kenya at the postponed championships starting from the cross country all the way to the Olympic Games since he is still young and energetic. “At my age, I cannot lose hope at all. I am still young to do better in the coming years. I am always a dedicated runner as well as in my studies,” said Korir.
