A dusk to dawn curfew has been imposed on the Nakuru-Narok border after three people were killed and 17 others injured in ethnic clashes in Njoro and Kuresoi. Nakuru Governor Lee Kinyanjui said on Friday that there will be no movement in Njoro, Mau Narok and Elburgon between 6pm and 7am "starting today until August 4 when the decision will be reviewed". Carrying offensive weapons like bows, arrows and pangas was prohibited as well as screaming, which is a distress call or war cry among local communities. “All residents are advised to abide by the laws and anyone found in breach will be prosecuted,” the governor said in a statement to media houses. The  Governor called for the immediate and unconditional cessation of hostilities between groups in the areas. The violence started on Tuesday in Olposimoru along the Nakuru-Narok border after an attempted cattle theft. The fighting spread to Ndosua, Mariashoni and Nessuit in Molo and Njoro on Thursday.  More than 50 houses were torched. Thirteen of those injured were admitted to Nakuru County Referral Hospital with arrow wounds. Some had arrowheads lodged in their bodies. "The sight of burning houses and suffering families is unbearable. There are better ways of solving conflicts," Kinyanjui said. He announced that there will be peace meetings on Tuesday in Mariashoni and Nessuit under the leadership of Rift Valley Regional Commissioner George Natembeya. Kinyanjui, who visited the survivors in hospital, said he was perturbed by the recurrence of conflict in those areas. "I witnessed the pain and agony of poor citizens who have to bear additional health burden due to the conflict," he said. "With increased police presence, we hope for containment in the shortest time possible," the governor said and urged community leaders to assist in the restoration of peace and harmonious co-existence. - mwaniki fm
