The controversial Mombasa County Football Association (MCFA) that was registered recently has been dismissed as a non-starter by Football Kenya Federation (FKF) South Coast chairman, Gabriel Mghendi. Mghendi said as the duly elected football leaders at the coast, he doesn’t recognise the new outfit, saying it’s more or less a welfare group or a social grouping but not a local soccer regulatory body. Mghendi, who is eyeing the FKF Coast region National Executive Committee (NEC) representative post in the forthcoming elections, said the MCFA is an illegal organisation as it was not registered in accordance with the FKF constitution. “Mombasa falls under my FKF South Coast jurisdiction and I dismiss this group which is out to cause confusion and seek attention. I ask football stakeholders in the county to treat them with the contempt they deserve as they are jokers with nothing to offer,” he said. Mghendi termed the MCFA as a group of disgruntled election losers, former and suspended officials who are seeking refuge and relevance through the backdoor even if it means leading a ghost or non-existent organisation. “Goshi Ali for example was suspended in 2017 by FKF South Coast branch for participating in the unsanctioned Extreme Sports organised tournament but in the spirit of inclusivity was allowed to contest in the last FKF Mombasa County elections but lost to the outgoing South Coast branch Secretary Lilian Nandundu’ twice. He couldn’t even raise the required number of endorsements from the eligible clubs in Mombasa,” Mghendi charged.
