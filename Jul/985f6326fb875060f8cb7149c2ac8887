Kenya on Friday recorded 247 new cases of Covid-19, raising the country's total confirmed cases to 7,188. The new cases emerged from 4,147 samples that were tested in the last 24 hours. Health CAS Rashid Aman said Kenya's cumulative tests now stand at 180,206. The youngest of the new cases is aged one year old, while the oldest is 100 years. The CAS said a total of 39 patients have been discharged, raising number of coronavirus  recoveries in the country to 2,148. On a sad note, another two patients died, raising the total fatalities to 154. This comes after the Kenya Medical Research Institute estimate  that about 550,000 people in Nairobi and roughly 100,000 in Mombasa, have already contracted and recovered from Covid-19, probably gaining some immunity. Scientists suggest that about 2.6 million Kenyans already have the coronavirus,  after they tested donated blood for antibodies. According to the report, some could have been infected as early as March because the antibodies can linger in the blood for several months. The prevalence of antibodies to the virus ranged from 1.1 per cent in blood donated in Uasin Gishu county to 12.4 per cent in Nairobi. At least 6,000 people should also have died from the disease countrywide, based on the current crude death rate. Globally, the number of infections hit 11,018,907 on July 3 with 524,828 reported deaths and 6,175,566 recoveries.
