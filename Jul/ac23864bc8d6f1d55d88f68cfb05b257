President Uhuru Kenyatta has issued a Presidential Proclamation, announcing that the country will observe three days of national mourning following the death of former Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa. Uhuru on Friday ordered that during the three days, the Kenyan flag and that of the East African Community fly at half-mast from sunrise on Monday to Wednesday. The President said that Kenya will always be grateful for the pivotal role that Mkapa played by in the mediation process that ended the 2007-08 post-election violence and political impasse that resulted thereafter. “Our nation’s peace, reconciliation and greater unity can be directly linked to the spirited actions, wisdom, mediation and sacrifice of the Late President Mkapa and his colleagues on the Panel of Eminent Persons,” Uhuru said. Mkapa announced dead on Friday morning by Tanzanian President John Magufuli. He died at the age of 81 while receiving treatment in hospital and the cause of his dead has not been disclosed. Uhuru also said that Mkapa was a shining example of the best of humanity, a peacemaker, a builder of bridges between peoples, a tireless advocate for equality and justice and a leader admired across the globe.
