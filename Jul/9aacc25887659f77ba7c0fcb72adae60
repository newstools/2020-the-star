The Vihiga county assembly has approved Sh100 million to complete the stalled doctors' plaza. The plaza stalled two years ago after the contractor stopped work over non-payment. The county has been battling to settle pending bills of up to Sh1.8 billion but the Vihiga government said there is a need to complete construction of the doctors’ plaza so the county can be self-reliant. Budget committee chairman Patrick Akhwale said, "We realised that we had nowhere to take our patients. When this plaza is fully operational, we won’t be in this awkward scenario we are in.” Earlier, Heath CEC Amos Kutwa had accused MCAs of not allocating funds for the plaza. “We don’t have an ICU, we don’t have an Isolation chamber, and we don’t have enough space to accommodate our patients but all these problems can be solved once that plaza is finished,” Kutwa said.
