Norwich boss Daniel Farke says it is “unrealistic” to talk about avoiding relegation from the Premier League after Saturday’s home defeat by Brighton. The Canaries players appeared devastated at full time as the significance of the result struck home — with Todd Cantwell remaining on the pitch for 10 minutes after the final whistle While Leandro Trossard’s winner means the Seagulls are now well-placed to see in a fourth straight season in the top flight, Norwich are seven points from safety with five games remaining. “It was more or less our last chance to get back in the mix and we are disappointed,” Farke said. “It was more like the performance we ask for. The story of our game was the story of our season, we didn’t find the cutting edge and we then make a big mistake. After a few losses, we don’t have the right to make any fighting messages or to make any unrealistic claims. We are not naive, lets show our pride.” Farke dropped Teemu Pukki and Cantwell — his two leading scorers — but the move backfired as the Premier League’s bottom club mustered just one serious attempt on target. Belgian winger Trossard settled a scrappy match with a smart finish, sweeping home Aaron Mooy’s perfect delivery in what was Brighton’s first genuine attack. Nineteen-year-old substitute Adam Idah was denied an equaliser when he headed against the post in stoppage time. Brighton’s third away win of the season lifts them nine points above the relegation zone.
