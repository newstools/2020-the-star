Mt Kenya elders are consulting on how best to unite the region and reach consensus on the succession of President Uhuru Kenyatta. Kikuyu Council of Elder’s national chair Wachira wa Kiago told the Star on Wednesday that the region seeks to speak in one voice. “The mountain region has been split and it is high time we fostered unity. This has to be done through meetings for cohesion amongst ourselves,” he said. Kiago said they were meeting political and opinion leaders and the clergy so the region may move in one direction. “Our region needs unity so that we can achieve development. We need to establish economic blocs. Our communities need to coexist and most of all have politics of purpose not division," Kiago said. The council chair called upon the region to not be deceived on whom to follow come 2022. "The ultimate voice of the Mt Kenya region shall be that of President Uhuru Muigai Kenyatta. It's Uhuru who shall give direction to the mountain in 2022. It's called Uhuru Factor," Kiago said. He added that if the mountain listens to Uhuru, they shall be in government in 2022 regardless of who will be in State House. If the mountain fails to hearken to his voice, they shall be in the opposition for five years. "There is no magic to that," he said. The elders said they are also discussing how to fight corruption. But Mt Kenya youth caucus leadership, led by Linford Mutembei, said they want to be part of the unity talks. "We welcome all talks that lead to the unity of the region and we as the youth demand that our voices be heard and should be on board of those talks," Mutembei said. Mutembei called on the youths not to lie back and watch their fate being discussed without them having a say.
