The Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions will on Tuesday launch the new guidelines on the Decision to Charge and automated Case Management System. According to DPP Noordin Haji, the new guidelines are meant to reshape its prosecutions to serve the public better. The office of the DPP said that the traditional approach to prosecutions must change. “We have proactively taken up the challenge to modernise prosecution so that it is responsive to the needs of mwananchi and that it meets international best practices,” the ODPP said. The guidelines on the decision to charge will ensure standardisation and transparency, holding the office accountable for its prosecutorial decision making. It is also making the decision to charge without influence from anybody or any authority. Article 157 of the Constitution states that the “Director of Public Prosecutions shall have power to direct the Inspector-General of the National Police Service to investigate any information or allegation of criminal conduct and the Inspector-General shall comply with any such direction.” The decision to charge is one of the most important decisions that a prosecutor must discharge in his/her mandate and serves as the most critical screen to the criminal justice system, according to the 2019 guidelines. Haji’s office said that the new guidelines will guide prosecutors on who, how, when, where and why they are to make the decision to charge. The Case Management System refers to the use of the integrated information for receiving and allocating cases. The meeting will be attended by Haji, Chief Justice David Maraga, Interior CS Fred Matiang’I, Inspector General of Police Hillatry Mutyambai, Director of Criminal Investigations George Kinoti among others.
