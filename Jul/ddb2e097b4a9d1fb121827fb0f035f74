World Marathon champion Ruth Chepng'etich believes she has what it takes to break the world record in the near future. The record held by Brigid Kosgei stands at 2:14:04 set during last year's Chicago Marathon. Chepng'etich, who currently trains by herself in Ngong, reckons that with proper preparations and focus, she will dethrone Kosgei. Her personal best stands at 2:17:08 recorded during the Dubai Marathon in January last year. "Breaking the record has crossed my mind on several occasions and I am looking forward to achieve it in future. Even though I haven't identified the race in which I will pursue the dream, I believe once normalcy returns, I will be able to plan on how I will execute it. It starts with the mindset," she explained. Besides breaking the record, Chepng'etich, who was part of the athletes who benefited from training gear donated by the National Olympic Committee of Kenya (NOC-K), expressed confidence in winning the Olympics come next year. The 26-year old is part of the Kenyan marathoners selected in January for the now postponed Games. She will enjoy the company of her compatriots Vivian Cheruiyot, who will be making her fifth appearance in the Olympics and Kosgei. Frankfurt Marathon champion Valary Aiyabei and Sally Chepyego are in the reserve team. "I thank NOC-K for the equipment which will help me strengthen my hands and limbs. I can't wait for the Olympics where I will be aiming to claim the gold medal. We have a strong team," said Chepng'etich.
