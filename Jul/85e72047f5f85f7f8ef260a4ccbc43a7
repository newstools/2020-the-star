Comedienne Zeddy has continued to expose the dark side of Churchill Show management. Speaking to Jalango on his YouTube channel, Zeddy said the first time she cried on the show was in the lead-up to fellow artist Ayeiya's burial. She said all the creatives had been invited to Ayeiya's send-off show after which they were to travel to Kisii for the burial. "We finished performing and headed out to the bus, the trip was sponsored. Those people wrote a list claiming that only 12 people [were] going despite all of us being prepared,” Zeddy said. “A whole bus. The names were called out like [we were] kids going to a school function. I was not on the list, but I made sure I went." Zeddy said the other comedians were left stranded and begging for lifts from audience members. “The bus did not have people. It was half-empty. I’m not lying," she said. Zeddy has been highlighting the challenges comedians go through, driving them to depression and some even to their death. Recently she accused Teacher Wanjiku's husband, Victor Ber, of killing talent by denying them a chance to perform on Churchill Show.
