The body of a man from Githunguri village in Rurii ward of Ol Kalou was found in a ditch full of water on Wednesday morning. Residents said Joseph Gitera Njuguna, 28, is suspected to have fallen into the ditch and drowned along Rakeri-Mbichu road while going home amid heavy downpour on Tuesday evening. He was allegedly drunk. Valentino Njenga said the father of three worked as a carpenter in Ol Kalou town. “We suspect cold night coupled with the heavy downpour and the fact that he was very drunk caused his death,” he said. Nyaruiru Njuru said Gitera’s shoes were found about eight metres from the body and it is not clear if he or someone else took them off. His phone was, however, not found. She said it is sad that he leaves behind a wife and very young children. She gave birth recently while the eldest child is in Grade 3. Njuru said despite bars being closed due to Covid-19 men in Githunguri are still drinking heavily. She said the government needs to act urgently to salvage the situation. Hilda Njeri said, "I urge the law enforcement agencies to tighten their shoe races and pull up their socks as alcohol is being consumed too much here. If they were serious, Gitera would still be alive to take care of his family." Wairiuko Gichingiri said the fact that supermarket and wines and spirits shops in Ol Kalou town are free to operate has aggravated the situation as men, especially youth, buy takeaway spirits which the consume even without food. Nyandarua Central subcounty police commander Abdillahi Dahir said police have launched investigations to ascertain the actual cause of Njuguna’s death. He said the body did not have any injury and bore no marks. The body was moved to J.M.Kariuki Memorial hospital mortuary awaiting postmortem. Edited by R.Wamochie
