Maina Kageni is willing to help Mr Nice get in the recording booth on his dime. Speaking on his breakfast show on Classic 105, Maina said he will pay for studio time. He will help him work with Diamond's producer Lizer, Cedo and Magix Enga. "I am looking for Mr Nice. I'll pay for his studio fees and ensure he works with top producers such as Ayo Lizer and Magix Enga," he said. This comes after news that the singer was in Kenya after a two-year stint in Uganda, where he allegedly moved to after he claimed Tanzanians mocked him. He now lives in Kitengela, where he intends to keep away from the public. Mr Nice was among the biggest artistes in East African music in the early 2000s.
