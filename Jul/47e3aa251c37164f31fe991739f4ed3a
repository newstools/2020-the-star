Kenya Power customers will now be able to pay their electricity bill using Bonga Points. This was after Kenya Power partnered with Safaricom . Through the partnership, the  7.1 million domestic customers can now redeem their Bonga Points to purchase tokens or pay for their bills at the rate of 20 cents per Bonga Point. At the same time, it provides customers with yet another cash-free avenue through which to pay for power, boosting the Company’s efforts to promote measures to curtail the spread of the Coronavirus. Presently, Kenya Power customers can pay for electricity using mobile money platforms and bank transfers, as alternative to cash payments. “As an organization, we are acutely aware of the impact that this pandemic has had on many Kenyans. We are therefore calling on our customers to take advantage of this opportunity ” MD Bernard Ngugi said in a statement on Friday. Bonga is a loyalty scheme launched by Safaricom in 2007 to allow its customers accumulate points based on usage of services on its network. Through a recent initiative dubbed ‘Bonga For Good,’ Safaricom saw over 1 billion Bonga Points redeemed towards food and household items. “By partnering with Kenya Power, we hope to give our customers more options and freedom in how they utilize their loyalty points,” Safaricom CEO Peter Ndegwa said. Customers paying for electricity using Bonga Points will be subjected to the applicable electricity tariff as stipulated by the Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority.
