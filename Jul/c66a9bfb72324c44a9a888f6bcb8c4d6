I don't take money from the government or the government can as well post proof that they gave me money," she said. "The government has nothing on me. I spoke my mind because I believe in what I spoke. I asked [for] Bobi credentials and you claim you have no time. You just don't have answers. "I understand my pain as a woman and went abroad to hustle. Stop consoling yourself, otherwise, you will die in poverty.
