State Law Office CAS Winnie Guchu on Friday announced the resumption of marriage services at the Office of the Attorney General with firm restrictions. Garden weddings have been limited to 15 people while private ceremonies at the Attorney General’s office will allow a maximum of four people. Guchu announced the unveiling of a digital platform where all couples seeking to tie the knot at Sheria House in Nairobi will make all applications. This she said will prevent congestion at the office which will in turn help avert spread of coronavirus. “Before Covid-19, the Registry was serving an average of 600 clients daily and the services were being offered manually. With the pandemic, the Registry had to devise ways of offering marriage services in compliance with Ministry of Health guidelines,” she said. All garden wedding ceremonies have been limited to 45 minutes while those by the AG will be conducted within 20 minutes of which each couple will only be accompanied by two witnesses. All attendees including the couples will be required to wear masks at all times. The Attorney General’s office put on hold at least 2,500 when it suspended marriage services in May in compliance with Ministry of Health’s guidelines on social distancing.
