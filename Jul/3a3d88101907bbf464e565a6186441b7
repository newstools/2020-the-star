Businessman Humphrey Kariuki wants Director of Public Prosecution Noordin Haji to disclose and provide him with evidence in the Sh41 billion tax evasion case he is facing. He is co-accused with Stuart Gerald Herd. The tycoon is facing several counts including forgery, money laundering, tax evasion among others. Kariuki denied all the charges. The business tycoon, through lawyer Cecil Miller, told magistrate Kenneth Cheruiyot that it is now 11 months since he was charged and the DPP has not made a disclosure of material evidence he has against him. The lawyers submitted that after the charges, there has been interference and destruction of property at the company's premises, which is against his constitutional rights. Miller said they have filed an application seeking an order to compel the DPP to provide a detailed report over theft interference and destruction of property at the premises. The lawyer told the court that the application filed on June 10 has not been responded to. The prosecution is asking for 90 days to respond. But Miller urged the court to decline the request by the DPP and order that the application be responded forthwith. The court heard that over 120 employees are out of work since the factory was shut down on January 31 and they have continued to suffer great loss as a result. Miller further said the accused have remained in dilemma as to when their criminal trial will commence. The magistrate directed the DPP to respond to the application within 14 days and the same to be heard on July 31. The court further dispensed the attendance of the accused following a request by lawyers on grounds of the Covid-19 pandemic. Edited by R.Wamochie
