Popular motivational speaker and pastor Robert Burale has spoken out about his experience after he tested positive for coronavirus last week. In a social media post, the father of one detailed his ongoing journey of healing. Burale said he waited for the President to give his speech before he put up his post. “Now that the country is opened. I owe it to family, friends and people I love this information. Above all, everything we go through is for God’s glory,” he wrote. Burale said last week he was struggling to breathe and rushed to Nairobi Hospital where he was tested for Covid-19 and 24 hours later the results were out. “The doctor walked into the isolation room and she says, ‘Hello Mr Burale your results are out,’ and I reply ‘So I can go home?’ She says, ‘Unfortunately you have tested positive for Covid and we have to now take you to the isolation ward’.” He was immediately taken to isolation within Nairobi Hospital. Burale said he was really scared, but was relieved to learn that his daughter was okay and Covid-19 free. At the isolation room, he was shocked to see old men fighting for their lives. The motivational speaker said he is responding positively to medication and he hopes that he will walk out of the hospital fine. “For two days I fought for my life under the great care of the doctors and nurses at Nairobi Hospital… I saw the hand of God… my progress is good… my vitals are responding well,” he said. “For anyone who thinks this thing is a joke… may the Lord have mercy on you… I gathered courage and called a few people who have tirelessly prayed for me… and sent encouraging messages.” He advised Kenyans to take care as no one is safe from the virus. Burale said he is not sure at what point he got infected. “Where did I get it? Your guess is as good as mine …I wish I knew,” he wrote.
