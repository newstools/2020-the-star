Kenyan Muslims on Friday celebrated Idd-ul-Adha, the single-most important feast of the Islamic year. On Wednesday, Interior CS Fred Matiang'i declared July 31 a public holiday to celebrate the event. However this year, Matiang'i said the celebrations must adhere to the Covid-19 rules. "All ceremonies in celebration of Idd will be marked with minimal person to person contact and in strict and full compliance with the guidelines," he said. The holiday falls on the 10th day of the final month of the Islamic calendarÂ  also known as Dhu al Hijjah. The date moves on the Gregorian calendar by around 10 days per year. The background of Id-ul-Adha is the Islamic account of Ibrahim willingly offering up his son Ishmael as a sacrifice before an angel intervened and stopped the hand in which he held the knife. Muslims normally go on pilgrimage to Mecca to re-enact the sacrifice and take part in ceremonies held in the very places where the events are thought to have transpired.
