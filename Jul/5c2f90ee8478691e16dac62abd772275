Singer-songwriter B-Classic has released his first single, 'Baby I swear.' The Taveta-born singer describes it as a heartfelt serenade to his love interest. "It was inspired by a series of true events. It's very relatable to most young people, as it tells the story of a young man ready to do anything for a woman he loves, revealing how she makes him crazy," he said in a statement. Classic is progressively building a niche as one of Kenyaâ€™s fast-rising acts. "I am a multi-instrumentalist (bass, acoustic and electric guitar) and I breathe and live music," he added. He describes his sound as an eclectic fusion of the live instruments and electronic elements, creating a unique and fresh urban African sound. "I will take the African music scene by storm with this first release," B-Classic said.
