Former Kariobangi Sharks captain Stephen Odhiambo is itching to return to the topflight league after spending a couple of years out through injury. The versatile leftback sustained a knee injury after he was released by his boyhood club but the recent injunction on sporting activities due to the coronavirus pandemic has proven a welcome opportunity for him to resurrect his career. “I have recovered fully from the injury and I have been training with lower league teams until the government rules on social distancing came into effect,” he said. The former Posta Rangers player added: “I think this is my last opportunity to play competitive football at a high level. I have been in touch with several teams and hopefully a deal will materialize when the situation returns back to normal.” Alongside Hillary Otieno, Odhiambo was among the high profile casualties of the purge the club executed once they had settled into the Kenyan Premier League. “Every team has its objectives and maybe Sharks wanted to head in a different direction and I don’t begrudge them for that. In fact I still actively support them as I have lots of friends in the team,” remarked Odhiambo The versatile left-footer hopes to start earning his coaching badges to realise his long term goal of being an academy coach.
