Kenya Morans coach Cliff Owuor is pursuing two United States based players to bolster his chances in the 2021 Fiba Afro-Basket qualifiers in November. The tactician yesterday revealed that Alonzo Ododa and Preston Bungei are on his radar as he plans an assault in the continental championship. Ododa is a son of former national player Sebastian Ododa who is based in USA and played for Posta and KCB Lions before he left the country. “I have identified the two players and I am talking to them to see if they can join the team. If we manage to get them for the event, we will be good,” Owuor said. He said he had talked to Australia-based Desmond Owili, who is available and could be here in October if the travelling restrictions are improved. Owili said Kenya stand a better chance of joining the continental giants in the Kigali festival if they host the first leg of the championship. On the local-based players, Owuor said they are continuing with their trainings under his directions as they await the government directive on restart of activities. “They are training and I am happy with the process so far made. I have scheduled a meeting with them to see a way forward,” said Owuor. Kenya will open their Group ‘B’ campaign with a match against Senegal. They also face Angola and Mozambique with the winner joining 16 for the Kigali festival. The next phase of the five-team tournament will be held from February 19 with Kenya again starting off their campaign against Senegal. Owuor said he remains upbeat about his team’s chances, saying if he prepares well, Kenya can make it to their first championships since 1993. Kenya qualified after winning a six-team pre-qualifiers that included Burundi, Eritrea, South Sudan, Somalia and Tanzania in Nairobi in January.
