A group of youths on Monday blocked Juja Road as they demonstrated against alleged exclusion from a government empowerment project. The police had to intervene and chase the youth with some picking canisters and throwing them back to police as they blocked roads. More than 200 youth blocked the road with rocks and lit bonfires with mostÂ  coming from Mathare slums. The youth claimed that the clean up project which was meant to employ them is supposed to be done on a rotation basis, but has been done unfairly. The demonstrations interfered with transport which was paralyzed for about 45 minutes. Dozens of passersby and observers were mugged and lost their phones before police arrived. The protesting youths also stole valuables from passengers in matatus, eye witnesses said. NYS cleared the road as police dispersed the youths with teargas. Normalcy was restored.
