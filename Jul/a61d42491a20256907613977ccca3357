A section of western leaders, led by Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa, yesterday said they are not fighting for the Luhya spokesperson position, but are pushing for development and revival of stalled projects. The leaders said Western Kenya is having a paradigm shift from the politics of power to the politics of development. Eugene told ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi and Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang'ula they cannot win the presidency if they "continue rotating in Western villages". He said the "noise" being made by Musalia and Wetang'ula will only be a step back towards the revival of stalled projects in the region. Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya said they are working with the President to bring meaningful change to the region. "We could just say hi to each other with Eugene when he was in government, and I was in opposition, but now we speak the same language of development," he said. Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong said working with the government will lead to improved infrastructure and more appointments in government. "Our airstrips are being worked on and the contractors who were sleeping on the job have woken up after the goodwill of the government. He said it would be childish for anyone to associate them with fighting to get a spokesperson position in the region. The leaders were speaking at Kibabii University in Kanduyi during a Covid-19 sensitisation meeting. The CS further told off Mudavadi over the issue of forming a commission of inquiry to look into the sugar sector woes, which he said had been overtaken by events as the state had already put in place measures to streamline the industry.
