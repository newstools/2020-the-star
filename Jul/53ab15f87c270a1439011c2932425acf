Sports CS Amina Mohammed has maintained that she has what it takes to become the next WTO director general. In a 30-minute interview in Geneva on Thursday, Amina said in her many years of diplomatic life, she has come to understand how the WTO corridors function. She said if granted an opportunity, she would help the organization make progress on crucial issues to break the current circle of despair. "The organisation is being tested. It's negotiating systems have been faulted with less success in the last 25 years," she said. She added, "Trade tensions have increased and dispute settlement systems compromised." Amina said as a result, the organisation needs urgent reforms that will breathe new hope to membership."If I become the next DG, I will focus on urgent reforms, recovery and renewal of the organisation to recapture its visionary inspiration," she said. Amina said she would help the organisation develop systems that will ease social and economic recovery from the current Covid-19 pandemic. "I will ensure the organisation has updated trading systems to handle global issues like climate change. This can only be made possible by building convergence around issues that the membership can support," Amina said. She said for the fact that she chaired the Nairobi Ministerial conference is an affirmation that she is up to the task. "The skills and vision gives me hope that this is the time to take up on the leadership of WTO," she said. She said though the powers of the DG are limited, she is banking on the convening power to rally membership to deescalate trade tensions by negotiating within the WTO frame work. This is the second time Amina is contesting for the top seat after she failed in 2013.
