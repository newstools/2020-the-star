Seven employees of the Lamu Palace Hotel in Lamu Island have been quarantined inside the hotel premises after a colleague tested positive for coronavirus last week. The seven include the hotel’s top managers. They will be in isolation for the next 14 days. Reports indicate the employee was among the first two cases of Covid-19 to be reported in Lamu two weeks ago. The cases have since risen to three after a third person tested positive last week. County commissioner Irungu Macharia confirmed that the seven had been isolated as a precautionary measure as directed by the Ministry of Health. Speaking in Lamu on Tuesday, the commissioner said none of those quarantined had displayed any obvious signs of Covid-19. He said contact tracing was still on to identify those who came into contact with the three. “One of their staff tested positive for Covid-19 and as precautions require, we had them quarantined at the hotel to prevent any further infection or spread in case others had already been exposed,” Macharia said. He said contact tracing is being undertaken by a multi-agency team and has been narrowed down to Lamu town. Health Executive Anne Gathoni said samples of the quarantined staff have since been collected and sent to the Kenya Medical Research Institute in Malindi for testing. “In the meantime, they will remain inside the hotel until the results are out. Our health officers have joined hands with county administration to trace all those who could have come in contact with the patients,” Gathoni said. She said the two tested positive from 98 samples collected at the King Fahad Hospital on June 27. She said they are currently in isolation in their own homes and are being closely monitored by health workers but are in stable condition. They were asymptomatic, she said. A total of 113 people have been tested for Covid-19 in Lamu. Gathoni urged residents to take all precautionary measures seriously to help curb the spread of the virus.  Edited by R.Wamochie
