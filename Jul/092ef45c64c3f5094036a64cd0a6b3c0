EACC officers on Thursday arrested Kenya Bureau of Standards (Kebs) managing director Bernard Njiraini for frustrating graft investigations at the parastatal. Njiraini was arrested for refusing to give EACC detectives original documents related to multimillion-shilling tenders the commission is investigating. Sources familiar with the matter said Njiraini was arrested as a penal consequence for failing to comply with a notice issued to him to surrender the documents. “He has refused to comply, thereby continuously frustrating the timely conclusion of  investigations…This [arrest] is with a view of obtaining the said documents and preferring charges against him for his contravention,” a source said. EACC has been investigating allegations of procurement irregularities and payment of bribes in respect of awards for tenders for provision of pre-export conformity of goods, used motor vehicles, mobile equipment and spare parts by Kebs.
