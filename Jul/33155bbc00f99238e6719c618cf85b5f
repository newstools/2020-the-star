Elders in Northeastern have been warned against mediating defilement and rape cases in what is locally known as ‘maslah’, a longtime conflict resolution mechanism. Speaking during the launch of Kazi Mtaani, regional commissioner Nicodemus Ndalana termed as shameful, the recent prosecution of chief who allegedly defiled a Form 3 girl in Wajir. He said the government will take tough measures against elders and parents perpetuating the vice noting that everyone has a responsibility to protect children. The administrator who was concerned by the surge of the defilement cases in the region in the last three months, asked families to closely monitor their children and not to trust even close relatives. Ndalana said most of the perpetrators are mostly elderly people against whom he said tough measures will be taken if found culpable. “How can an elder with grandchildren undress before a minor, don’t you feel ashamed by your actions?” he asked. He said he has instructed police heads to ensure elders don't curtail protection of children. Maslah has been an all time declaration involving different matters, however, it has been argued that victims of defilement and rape have been silently suffering after their assailants were taken off the hook. The method allows the perpetrator’s elders negotiate with their counterparts where money or livestock is given to the victim’s family. Activists in Garissa have said the use of Maslah in defilement has led to a surge of the vice in adding that there is likelihood of other children being abused by the same suspects. “We ask our elders to leave the police and investigative agencies do their work and prosecute sexual abuse because that is the only way we can help contain this vice,” Garissa Human Rights Defenders chairman Muktar Osman said. He said the method has been a stumbling block in initiating a prosecution since the communities shield the perpetrators from the authorities. Edited by R.Wamochie
