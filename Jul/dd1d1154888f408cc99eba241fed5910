Home-based care for asymptomatic Covid-19 patients is proving to be a success story, Health CAS Rashid Aman said on Monday. Aman said this protocol will be the way to go as it has minimized use of resources as well as ensured people are taken care of within their home settings. For one to qualify for home based care in Kenya one has to be asymptomatic, that is, positive by test but does not show any symptoms of the virus. The physical state of the home also plays a big role in the qualification checklist. "Part of the recovery is psychological. In the sense that if you are in the comfort of your home, I'm certain that it has a huge influence on how people recover," Aman said. "Home care doesn't mean that people are forgotten there. These individuals are monitored through the system of health care workers that we have, particularly the community health volunteers who have been trained." According to the CAS, these patients remain well and fine in their home settings unless they show signs of progression of the disease. In which case, patients are transferred to medical facilities. Director of Public Health, Francis Kuria who was present at the briefing on Monday confirmed that as of July 20, the country had not recorded any death from the home care protocol. However, Kuria cautioned on the rise in the number of community deaths where people die before being confirmed positive for coronavirus. This comes as the number fatalities in the country rose to 238 after four more succumbed on Monday. A total of 418 more people tested positive in the last 24 hours bringing the country's virus cases to 13,771.
