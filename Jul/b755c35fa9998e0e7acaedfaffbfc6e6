Residents of Naivasha woke up to the news that a flower farm worker had been raped and murdered as she reported to her workplace. Her body was found by her colleagues around 6am bringing to three the number of workers raped and killed this year. In the latest incident, the mother of two was attacked near Prison Bridge along the Nairobi-Nakuru highway where she was first raped and later killed using a blunt object. Incidentally, another woman was attacked and killed early in the year at the same area and the killer is still at large. Emotions ran high among fellow workers as police moved in to collect the body and launch a manhunt for those involved. Worker John Kanja said that the incident could have occurred around 5am when they report to duty to one of the farms. He said the woman lived in Site Estate. “From initial investigations, it’s evident that the woman was first raped and later hit on the head using a blunt object,” he said. He added that this year, three women had been killed and over five others raped while on their way to work. “The biggest challenge in this sector have is that we report to work very early in the morning and leave very late in the evening exposing women to such attacks,” he said. Naivasha OCPD Samuel Waweru confirmed the incident adding that it was a matter of time before they caught up with those involved. Viwandani MCA Eric Gichuki, while condoling the family, called on the farmers to either revise their working hours or provide transport for their workers. “Flower farms are crucial in Naivasha as they have offered job opportunities to our people but its time they addressed their issue of transport,” he said.
