Gospel singer and worshiper Ali Mukhwana has released a new video, 'Maombi Yangu'. Mukhwana is an award-winning gospel singer, songwriter and a worship leader. Speaking to Word Is, he said the song is a direct prayer to God. "It’s a cry for help from us to Him, for Him to listen to our prayers and requests because we are faced with harsh realities of a pandemic that has killed people, killed the economy and stopped our lives for months now," he said. "My message is that, despite the fact that doctors and scientists have not yet found a cure, we should not lose hope because He is an able God and I truly believe this, too, shall pass.” He is known for his win in the Exodus to Stardom singing competition, which was organised by KBC in 2011. As the winner in the competition, he walked away with a brand new Xtrail car worth Sh1.8 million, a one-year recording deal at Lampstand Records and a TV show co-host position at Angaza Show on KBC TV (2012-16).
