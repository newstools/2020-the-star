Vihiga county will get Sh4.5 million worth of personal protective equipment from Equity Bank to help the fight against the coronavirus. Equity chief commercial officer Polycarp Igathe delivered the first consignment of the PPE to Vihiga Referral Hospital in Mbale. The PPE will help the hospital run for six months, he said. County executive for Health Amos Kutwa said health workers were vulnerable and the materials donated will offer much-needed protection. "Already two of my staffers were infected with the virus though on the last test they were negative," Kutwa said. Igathe said Equity foundation is only supplementing what the government has done in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic. The war against the pandemic is a collective effort and individuals must observe state regulations in place, Igathe said. “Mask wearing, sanitising and observing social distance should be a personal responsibility and not doing so to evade police arrests,” Igathe said. He said the bank had raised Sh1.2 billion to buy PPE to support health workers in all the 47 counties. “Kenyans are going through tough economic times as a result of the pandemic that is why we must join our hands together to deal with it,” Igathe said. Igathe said the PPE delivered are of high quality and were approved by the Covid-19 response liaison team.  (edited by o. owino)
