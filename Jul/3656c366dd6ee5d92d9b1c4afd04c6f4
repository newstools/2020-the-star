United Nations staff in Nairobi will be treated in their own health centre when a Sh1.1 billion Covid-19 facility is completed. The United Nations Office at Nairobi (UNON) conducted the ground breaking  at The Nairobi Hospital on Monday. The centre, which will be managed by The Nairobi Hospital, is a 150-bed capacity facility with Intensive Care Unit and High Dependancy Unit beds, an operation theatre, radiology diagnostics and a laboratory. It is due for completion in eight weeks. UNON director-general Zainab Hawa Bangura told the ceremony that the construction of the facility is a validation of Kenya’s leadership in medical professionalism. “The agreement for the building of this treatment facility in Kenya underscores the UN’s faith in Kenya’s human resource and expertise. It is also a reflection of Nairobi’s role as a key peace-keeping humanitarian and development hub for Africa,” Bangura said. The Nairobi Hospital conducts an average of 500 Covid-19 tests daily. It admitted the first Covid-19 patient on March 14 and has since managed over 260 cases. According to Bangura, the facility will be constructed by Kenyans using locally sourced materials. Foreign Affairs Cabinet Secretary Raychelle Omamo, who was present, said the facility will cater for Kenyans, the over 20,000 UN staff in Kenya, Africa and beyond. “This hospital is built on a solid partnership. This partnership shows the depth of the relationship between the Government of Kenya and the United Nations,” Omamo said. The Nairobi Hospital chief executive Allan Pamba said the facility will not be limited to UN and diplomatic personnel and family. “It will also be open to Kenyans,” he said. - mwaniki fm
