Diamond has warned women against tarnishing his name in public. In a post he put out on Instagram, the 'Jeje' hitmaker said, “I am very thankful for the massive love from the ladies that keeps growing day by day. I appreciate and love you more," he wrote. "But please, if you know we have never had any relations or love affair, do not go out there claiming we have. It does not paint a good picture for me. I love you and I thank you for the huge support you give me. #WCB4LIFE,” Diamond posted. This comes a few days after rumors swirled around that Tanzanian socialite Poshy Queen is four months pregnant for him. Poshy cleared the air, saying she has no time for Diamond.
