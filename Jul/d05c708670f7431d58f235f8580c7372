Detectives in Eldoret have begun investigating the Saturday night murder of Abraham Kimurgor,  the chairman of boda boda operators in Uasin Gishu. Kimurgor was allegedly attacked by a gang armed with crude weapons at the gate of his home. Uasin Gishu county commissioner Abdirisack Jaldesa said that police were hot on the heels of the gang linked to the killing of Kimurgor. Jaldesa asked boda boda operators who had disrupted all businesses in Eldoret to protest over the killing to be patient as police conduct their investigations. He assured the riders that detectives will do everything within their power to bring to book all the people suspected be to behind the murder. “I am shocked by this murder. Police have camped at the scene and it is too early to preempt the investigations. Let us give police time to complete investigations for action to be taken against the suspects,” Jaldesa said. Kimurgor was the firstborn son of the late Charles Kimurgor, an Israeli-trained soldier who was the security chief to the late retired President Daniel arap Moi. The senior Kimurgor was killed 15 years ago in a carjacking incident in Nairobi.
