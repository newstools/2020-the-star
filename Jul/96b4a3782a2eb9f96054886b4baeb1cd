The ODM party will be part of the team that will succeed President Uhuru Kenyatta, Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparany has said. Oparanya said the handshake between President Kenyatta and Raila Odinga who he deputises in ODM will give the country a new direction through the Building Bridges Initiative. He said he'll stay put in ODM no matter the circumstance. But should he leave, he'll choose Jubilee. He spoke in Luanda subcounty over the weekend. “Confusion is everywhere in this world. That's why I'm telling you to be sober come 2022 and know the right direction to go,” Oparanya said. He asked residents not to dwell on 'small village parties' in western that are there to confuse the Luhya community. Ford Kenya and Amani National Congress are two parties led by Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang'ula and former Sabatia MP Musalia Mudavadi respectively. They are both from Western. “These other parties that are formed at sub-tribe level, which future do they have in this country if not being swallowed by large parties,” Oparanya asked. ANC chairman in Vihiga Sikalo Ochiel said sub-tribe politics has made the region the laughing stock. “We won’t trade wth any community this time round. Mudavadi and Wetang’ula had been telling us to unite for the sake of our political benefit. Three years down the line we are yet to do so,” Sikalo said.
