The Wajir administration has taken over the management of the Dagahaley market. The market in Wajir South was built through the Regional Pastoral Livelihoods Resilience Project funded by the World Bank. Deputy Governor Ahmed Mukhtar said the market will improve local economy and livelihoods of residents. More that 10,000 livestock are traded on every market day, translating to close to Sh30 million transacted. Mukhtar led the official handing over ceremony on Wednesday. He was accompanied by the donors and other officials. He said he was impressed by the potential of the market and urged the residents to fully make use of it for their benefit. “This is one business we are ready to jealously protect at all costs. It is our economic mainstay and one which thousands depend on directly and  indirectly,” he said. Area MCA Ibrahim Urey said hundreds of people rely on the market for their main source of livelihood. The deputy governor also held discussions with the market users. Cess has been reduced for each cow from Sh150 to Sh100, he said. A veterinary officer will be deployed to the market to provide extension services and issue livestock movement permits. Mukhtar said majority of residents depend on pastoralism hence the need to improve the sector. The market was closed down when coronavirus cases started rising in the area, with the traders from Mogadishu blamed for being carriers of the virus.  (edited by o. owino)
