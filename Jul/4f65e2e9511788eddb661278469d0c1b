The National Treasury on Tuesday kicked off mandatory Covid-19 tests on its staff. The move came after 10 of the staff tested positive for the disease. In a notice from the Principal Administrative Secretary's Office, the cases were from 50 officers who were tested. The notice said the number represents 20 per cent of the staff and was alarming. "Towards this end, we have requested the Ministry of Hhealth to conduct testing for all staff of the National Treasury," read the notice in part. The notice indicated that the tests will continue for three days with 200 tests being conducted each day. "You are requested to generate a list of 40 persons per day to be tested. In this case kindly do the list and hand over the names to senior deputy secretary," the notice read. Kenya has so far reported 10,971 positive cases after 497 more people tested positive in the last 24 hours. On a sad note, the country lost five more patients, bringing the total number of deaths to 202.
