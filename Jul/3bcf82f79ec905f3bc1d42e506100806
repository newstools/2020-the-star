Meru Governor Kiraitu Murungi says his administration is prepared to handle Covid-19 patients after completion of ICU and renal units. Kiraitu said the county has built 404 isolation beds surpassing President Uhuru Kenyatta’s demand that counties must build at least 300 isolation beds. “The reports we are getting from the media that counties are ill-prepared to deal with the virus and that Meru has only 109 isolation beds are not true. We currently have 404 beds and we are doing much more. “You are aware coronavirus is a danger to people with underlying conditions like diabetes, high blood sugar, hypertension and others. This is why we will enhance infrastructure preparedness against corona,” Kiraitu said. Kiraitu thanked the national government for deploying one Cuban ICU specialist to be in charge of the Meru unit. Philips East Africa was given the contract. Country Manager Dr Muthoni Ntonjira, led the governor in the inspection of the project constructed by the national government. Deputy Governor Titus Ntunchiu said the renal unit is to serve over 18 patients undergoing dialyses daily. Kiraitu said the new state-of-the-art ICU and renal unit at the Meru Teaching and Referral Hospital has nine beds with specialised machines for determining a patient's cardiac output. He said the renal unit will serve 18 patients at a go. “This is a great step in taking care of our patients who require dialysis, saving them costs they used to incur as they seek treatment outside our county. Since 1939, MTRH has never had an ICU facility. “We also have an oxygen generating plant at the hospital with a capacity of 480 litres per minute which is also supplied to our other health facilities across our county,” Kiraitu said. Kiraitu said 20 ICU nurses have been trained and the county will continue to train doctors and other cadres. Edited by R.Wamochie
