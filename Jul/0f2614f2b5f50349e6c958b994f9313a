Governor Mohamed Abdi on Tuesday appealed to Wajir residents to stop disobeying measures announced by the government to prevent the spread of Covid-19. There have been growing concerns that things are slowly going back to normal, including residents not wearing masks, big gatherings as well as lack of social distancing in vehicles, especially buses. The county chief said though the reported cases in the county are not many, the numbers might surge if residents continue to disobey the measures put in place to fight the virus. Abdi spoke in his office where he received a team from the Ministry of Health to inspect Wajir county's preparedness in the fight against Covid-19. The inspectors also toured the regional laboratory, KMTC quarantine centre, Afya House, and Makoror Covid-19 Centre, where isolation and ICU facilities are being constructed. The new facility has 300 beds. “As a county, we want to limit transmission, including reducing secondary infections among close contacts and healthcare workers. This can only be achieved if residents partner with the county and the national governments,” Abdi said. He said the Health department has teams that meet frequently to monitor and review preparedness strategies. There is also a technical emergency committee to implement the recommendations, he said. The county chief said the vastness of the county and pastoral lifestyle calls for more funds to cater for its unique needs. Edited by A.N
