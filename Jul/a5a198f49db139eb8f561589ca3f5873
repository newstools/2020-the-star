Nyeri has sensitised 99 per cent of all the Community Health Volunteers on Covid-19 prevention as infections rise across the country. Also trained are 1,302 health workers from public and private facilities on Covid-19 infection prevention, case management and surveillance. The trained workers account for 73 per cent of all medics in the county. Governor Mutahi Kahiga said on Friday all the CHVs will be armed with the necessary tools needed in contact tracing and community awareness in readiness for the Covid-19 community health project to be launched this week. “We believe this initiative will be key as we work towards implementing the home-based care model for Covid-19,” he said. The county chief said the devolved unit is seeking to gradually move its main focus from hospitals to empowering families to take charge of their own health. Covid-19 infections have been on the rise in the county since the President lifted movement restrictions in Nairobi and Mombasa on July 6. The first two cases were reported in Nyeri county on May 28. The national government projects that Covid-19 cases in Nyeri may rise to 467 in September. The governor urged residents to adhere to the directives and guidelines put in place by the Ministry of Health to minimise the virus spread. They include social distancing, washing hands with soap and running water, wearing masks, avoiding physical contact, and keeping all windows and doors open when in enclosed places. Others are avoiding sharing of items such as microphones and phones, and screening of all persons entering supermarkets, places of worship, hotels, restaurants and matatus using an infrared thermometer.
