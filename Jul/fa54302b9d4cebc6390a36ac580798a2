The future of Kenyan football coaching is bright if the trend of training coaches at all levels continues at the same pace, according to Fifa Football Kenya Federation coaches’ instructor Twahir Muhiddin. Over the last four years, the federation has overseen the training of over 3000 coaches for free in the basic and advanced level as well as the Caf ‘C’ License level as they seek to build the coaching capacity across the country. “This has not only gone a long way in ensuring that youth players at the grass roots are handled by qualified personnel but has also helped bridge a capacity gap that had denied coaches job opportunities both home and abroad,” noted Muhiddin. Meanwhile, Fifa referee Instructor Dorcas Moraa and Elite Fifa ref Caroline Wanjala have praised the current standards of officiating in the country. The two said the move by the federation to waive the Physical Endurance Tests charge fee of Sh3000 has encouraged more upcoming match officials to take up the crucial technical job.
