Popular hip hop artist Juliani on Saturday hosted an exclusive meetup with 10 superfans. The goal was to have fans read and review his 'Masterpiece' book ahead of its release. The book is a deep dive into Juliani's mind. He lays out his journey to becoming who he is, his methods of processing life events and lessons he's learnt along the way. Among the fans, one said, â€œWhat excites me most, is that though it's been authored by a Christian, it's not preachy. It's a perspective. It's a book I can share with my Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist and non-religious friend, without feeling like I'm trying to make them Christian. Yeah, it's a masterpiece." The event took place at Crowne Plaza JKIA, Nairobi.
