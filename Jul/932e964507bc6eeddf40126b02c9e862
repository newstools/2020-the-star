Gospel artiste Ruth Matete buried her Nigerian husband Beloved John Olakami Apewajoye at a Langata cemetery in Nairobi on Thursday. Ruth described her late husband as a loving husband and a true lover of Christ. "That made you even love me more," she said in her tribute. The body has been lying at Kenyatta National Hospital mortuary since April 11, when he succumbed to fire-related injuries while undergoing treatment. Most of Johnâ€™s relatives and friends reside in Nigeria and were not be able to attend the burial because of the ongoing Covid-19 travel restrictions. Family and friends of Ruth and Beloved John joined them at the cemetery for the final rites. Her supportive dad Abel Amunga was also present. Celebrities who attended included gospel singer Pitson and Bire.
