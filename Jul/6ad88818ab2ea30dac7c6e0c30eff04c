Eight leaders from the Mt Kenya region on Wednesday held a four-hour-long meeting led by National Assembly speaker Justin Muturi. They are Muturi, Governors Kiraitu Murungi (Meru) , Ndiritu Muriithi (Laikipia) Lee Kinyanjui (Nakuru), Amos Kimunya (National Assembly Majority Leader), Peter Kenneth (former Gatanga MP), Senator Charles Kibiru (Kirinyaga) and Tharaka Nithi Governor Muthomi Njuki. Speaking to journalists after the meeting at Panafric Hotel in Nairobi, they said they "we were having a political lunch". "We are here to appreciate President Uhuru Kenyatta for the appointment of Kimunya and that's why we come to congratulate mheshimiwa Kimunya," Kiraitu said. "We appreciate Kimunya and we came to support. Mt. Kenya we are well represented , and we thank the President for giving us Kimunya." "The future is there for all of us , we are congratulating Kimunya, we are not creating any special impression we are working for our people." Last month, Garissa Township MP Aden Duale was replaced by Kimunya as the Naitonal Assembly Majority Leader. This followed a decision made by the party's Parliamentary Group meeting chaired by Uhuru at the KICC. Kimunya is the Member of Parliament for Kipipiri constituency. He also served as Trade and Finance Cabinet Minister under former President Mwai Kibaki.
