Eight sex workers who allegedly drugged a client before stealing from him Sh105,000 have been charged with stupefying to commit a felony. Janet Nyareba, Wendy Mwaura, Shontel Wambui, Ashley Kendi, Kelly John Tomilson, Caroline Wambui, Faith Gakii and Damaris Kagendo appeared before Makadara senior principal magistrate Â Angelo Kithinji. They are said to have jointly administered the drugs to Benjamin Wandera on July 18 at Kipkabus Safari Club, Ngara, Nairobi. The victim has been in hospital since the incident. The eight were also charged with a second count of living on the earnings of prostitution contrary to the Penal Code, a charge to which they pleaded guilty. The court heard that on July 18 at Kipkabus Safari Club, they were found living on earnings from prostitution. They were arrested after members of the public tipped off the police who raided the building and found them naked. At the time of the arrest, the officers recovered two sex toys, six HIV self-test kits, seven Smugel lubricating jelly, a bag of Sure condoms and assorted sim cards, among other items. Nyareba was separately charged with managing the brothel or being its proprietor. She was accused of permitting the premises to be used as a brothel or assisting in the management of the brothel. She pleaded not guilty to the charge. They also denied the charge of stupefying to commit a felony. The suspects caused a scene in court, accusing officers from the Kasarani police station of being inhumane by denying them their only source of income. Orderlies had to move them away from the outdoor courtroom. They claimed they were charged with offences unknown to them as their only activities at the brothel were prostitution. They were freed on Sh20,000 bail each ahead of hearings scheduled to begin in September.
