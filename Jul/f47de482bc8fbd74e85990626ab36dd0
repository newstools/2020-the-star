Footballers in Kiambu have been awarded a contract by the Constituency Development Fund to rehabilitate playing fields. The Kiambu secondary and primary school pitches have been open for use by the youths but months without activity made grass grow tall and bushes encroach. All contact sports were halted with the outbreak of coronavirus in March. Kiambu MP Jude Njomo on Tuesday inspected landscaping works by the youths. “Kiambu Primary School has been used by the public for a very long time and we thought of rehabilitating it through the help of the youths using it,” Njomo said. Njomo said the Covid-19 pandemic has rendered most youths jobless and it was a good initiative by the NG-CDF to engage and pay them. “These youths come here for fruitful engagement of their talent and by providing jobs for them, it will dissuade them from anti-social behaviour,” Njomo said. Football coach Eric Ochieng said that over 200 youths were engaged to level the ground, clear bushes and plant grass. “I have played in this field for long and no one has done anything to improve it. It is good our MP has thought to rehabilitate it. We worked on it like it is our bedroom,” Ochieng sad. Faith Njeri, a landscaper, said she engaged the youths in the area for the work. They put up a terrace for the fans and an additional pitch for netball and basketball. “For over 50 years, this field has never been rehabilitated and now, we have an opportunity to give it a makeover for the youths and school students,” Njeri said.
