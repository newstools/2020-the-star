The Kenya Wildlife Service and the police have arrested two people from Garissa and Tana River counties with 12 elephant tusks with a street value of Sh9.3 million. The two were arrested in Kona Kaliti inside the Kitui South National Reserve, where they were hiding the tusks weighing 93.4kgs. Mutomo subcounty police commander Martin Kangala said on Thursday that the two were arrested on Wednesday. “The officers based in Mutha area, who were acting on a tip-off from the public, posed as buyers and nabbed the two,” Kangala said. Kangala said by Thursday morning plans to take the two to court were being finalised. He praised the officers for a job well done and warned that they won't allow poaching in the South Kitui National Game Reserve. “I would like to send out a warning to all persons engaged in poaching or trade in wild game that the long hand of the law will catch up with them sooner rather than later,” Kangala said.
