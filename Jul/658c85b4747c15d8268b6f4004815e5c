Kieni MP Kanini Kega has urged residents of Mt Kenya region to support the Building Bridges Initiative report once it is made public. Speaking during a groundbreaking ceremony for Gakawa police station on Tuesday, Kega, the point man for President Uhuru Kenyatta in the region, said the document which is yet to be tabled is meant to benefit the region. “We want to ensure that Kenyans get equal representation through one man, one vote, one shilling. In the constituency that I represent, currently an individual gets Sh5,000 while in other areas and individual gets Sh20,000 which is very unfair,” the legislator said. The chairman of the Trade and Tourism committee of the National Assembly said he would clinch the Budget and Appropriation committee chairmanship this week. He said once the BBI report is handed over to the President and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga, he would support on the floor of the House and in political gatherings. Kega at the same castigated people who criticised the meeting between four governors from Mt Kenya region, National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi and former presidential aspirant Peter Kenneth, saying they had a right to meet. “When leaders from Mt Kenya region meet to chart a political path, they are branded tribalist but when leaders from other regions meet it is okay. We should desist from such hypocrisy,” Kega said. The legislator said the National Government Constituency Development Fund (NG-CDF) will be used to construct eight police station in the wards. He said cases of insecurity had started to escalate, especially during Covid-19, noting that incidents of cattle rustling and breaking into business premises had been reported. Edited by Henry Makori
