 Goalkeeper Levis Opiyo and defender Kevin Okumu have left newly-promoted Kenya Premier League side Nairobi City Stars. Club chief executive officer Patrick Korir confirmed the departure of the two following the expiry of their contracts in June. “Their contracts lapsed in June. We wanted to keep them but they had a desire to pursue other interests and challenges,” Korir told the Star. “It excites City Stars when any player from our ranks steps up their career. Levis and Opiyo were very loyal and dependable servants who played a key role to our promotion campaign.” Korir noted that as much as it was sad seeing the duo leave, the club considers their growth. “We are in the process of identifying their equals to fill up the voids. We thank them for their contribution in the past season and wish them all the best,” said the CEO. Opiyo and the youthful rightback Okumu, who is popularly known as Chumsy, are said to be headed to KPL giants Gor Mahia. The club have already set sights on Western Stima’s center back Maurice Ojwang  and utility defender Kelly Wesonga. Stima suffered a blow when their shirt sponsors Kenya Power pulled out. Korir reiterated that the club is in the market for at least six new additions to strengthen the team ahead of their return to the top tier league. At the same time, Korir welcomed the new top tier league sponsorship by BetKing which was announced by FKF President Nick Mwendwa. “This is indeed good news and it goes to show FKF have the interest of football in the country," said Korir. "For a few years clubs in the KPL have struggled with finances, lack off, and the partnership with BetKing, following a good shift of intent by FKF, is a decent one that we at City Stars truly appreciate.”
