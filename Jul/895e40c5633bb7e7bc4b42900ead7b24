Activists in Kwale county have raised an alarm against the increase of attacks on widows and deprivation of their inheritance  . Mohammed Mwakuyala says the Maledi and Mwangulu villages in Lunga Lunga constituency were notorious for exploitation of widows. The Justice Restoration and Child Care Organisation says it has dealt with over seven cases during the coronavirus pandemic period while many others are unreported. “We believe there might be hundreds of these types of cases but many are not reported. Luckily, we managed to solve some,” Mwakuyala said. He said the majority involve family members and neighbours who fight widows claiming ownership of land and other property left by their husbands. The official said some widows are denied justice because of illiteracy and frequent intimidation by their rivals. He said people have taken advantage of the Covid-19 pandemic to disrupt the lives of the powerless women, knowing that the government is focused on fighting the disease. The activists now want the national government to intervene and save the widows who are in dire need of help. “The poor women need immediate assistance because I doubt by the end of this pandemic most of them will have anything,” he said. Mabuti Gambari said family members normally gang up against widows and kick them out. He said the culprits work with some people believed to hold public office.  Gambari said disrespecting women and male chauvinism had frustrated women in parts of Kwale. He said the vice needed to be uprooted and women, especially widows, given their right place in inheritance. He cited the recent case of Ega Rashid Kalume who was married in 1969 at Maledi and her husband died last year. She the demise of her husband strangers had been seen moving around her property. The people have claimed ownership of the land and threatened her. Edited by Henry Makori
