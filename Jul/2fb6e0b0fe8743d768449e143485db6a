AU envoy Raila Odinga has eulogised Zindzi Mandela as an inspiring patriot who was also a victim and a witness of the events and injustices in South Africa. The daughter of the former South African President Nelson Mandela and Winnie Madikizela-Mandela died on Monday at the age of 59. Zindzi was announced dead on Monday by the Nelson Mandela Foundation. "While participating actively in efforts to right the wrongs, a responsibility thrust on her from a very tender age, Zindzi severed her country with honour, dignity and distinction," Raila said. In a letter to SA's President Cyril Ramaphosa on Tuesday, Raila said Zindzi joins the many great liberators who have departed from the continent. "Her place is secure in the history books of South Africa's and Africa's liberation," he said. Raila said Nzindi's steadfast service to South Africa and Africa will continue to inspire generations to come. "Please accept my deepest sympathies at this difficult time," he added. "She was born to fight right from year one for the simple but important things many often take for granted: freedom, justice, honour, duty, hope; thrust into the struggles of Madiba and Winnie against Apartheid, she didn’t wait. I salute her." Zindzi, who was also known as Zindziswa was the younger sister of Zenani Mandela and the third of Nelson Mandela's. She was born on December 23, 1960 in Soweto to Nelson Mandela and Winnie Mandela. Zindzi has left behind four children, including Zoleka, Zondw, Bambatha and Zwelabo.
