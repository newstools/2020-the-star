Ongoing infrastructure projects funded by the World Bank in Kiambu will attract more investors and traders to the county, Governor James Nyoro said on Tuesday. Some Sh1.9 billion from the World Bank has been channelled to the county’s six municipalities through the Kenya Urban Support Programme. The money is being used to put up street lights, tarmac roads, and improve the drainage system and waste management. Nyoro on Tuesday said movement and trading in nearly all towns in the county will change once the projects are complete. He said traders have started looking for sites to set up their businesses, owing to the improvements. “We already know that there are investors who have started looking for places to work from. Once they come, they will also create more job opportunities for our youths” Nyoro said. He spoke in Limuru town while commissioning the 1.4km Mukuru road. Limuru municipality manager Michael Muna said the Mukuru road project will cost Sh153 million. Limuru Central MCA Joseph Kahenya, majority leader Gideon Gachara and nominated MCA Nduta Muongi were also present. Limuru MP Peter Mwathi separately commissioned the tarmacking of the 6.5km Chunga Mali-Makutano road. “These roads will spur trade and ease movement,” he said. Mwathi urged politicians to support President Uhuru Kenyatta development agenda. “We must know we have a tomorrow and we must protect what we already have,” the MP said. Edited by A.N
