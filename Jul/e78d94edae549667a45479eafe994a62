Over 700 families in Msafuni and Mpeketoni divisions are urging Kenya Power to restore power after close to three months of blackout. Areas affected by the prolonged power outage are Msafuni, Bomani and Tewa.  They have not had power since May, when several transformers blew up. Locals say the Kenya Power office in Lamu has not made any efforts to restore power. Hongwe MCA James Komu accused the lighting company of laxity in replacing the transformers, leaving the streets and towns in the affected areas in darkness. He said criminal gangs have taken advantage of the situation to rob locals who return home late from work and various travels. “The transformer in Bomani village for example exploded six years back and has never been replaced.We are appealing to the KPLC to render due diligence.This people have a right to electricity and peace,”said Komu. The power company has also been on the spot for failing to conduct maintanance of transformers in the region causing them to explode frequently. Kenya Power Business manager in Lamu Bernard Kataka admitted the areas have been without electricity but promised to light it before end week. “The problem has been there for close to a month now.The delay is because those specific transformers have been out of stock countrywide but we have since gotten a new consignment. We will have power restored once we receive them from Mombasa this week,”Kataka said. A few weeks back, power was restored in Faza and Pate islands after three weeks of blackout. The two islands, with a population of over 3000 people, had been plunged into darkness following the mechanical breakdown of a 1500KW capacity Off-Grid power station that has supplied the areas since 2016.
