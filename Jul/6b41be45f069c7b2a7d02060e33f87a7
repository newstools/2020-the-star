Former Safaricom CEO Bob Colymore died a year ago. Yesterday, his family and friends commemorated his first anniversary. Among them was media personality, Jeff Koinange, who narrated how the Boys Club fulfilled the promise made to President Uhuru Kenyatta following the death of Bob Collymore. Jeff recalled when Uhuru talked about the issue during the funeral service. Uhuru said the former Safaricom CEO's friends had taken something that was reserved for him. "My one disappointment, I was supposed to go back to collect something that was reserved for a special friend, so Peter Kenneth, Oigara and crew, you have to pay. That didn't belong to you," Uhuru said. Speaking during his breakfast show on Hot 96, Jeff said the promised bottle of reserve whiskey was hard to find. "We finally found that only one bottle was remaining in the whole world, and that bottle was in Ireland with the manufacturer," he said. "So we made the call and pleaded with the manufacturer. We told them that if we didn't get that bottle we could end up in Kamiti (even though they probably don't know where Kamiti is), but we told them that it was for the President of Kenya and they had to let us have it. "Luckily we got it and the manufacturer shipped it in a crate and all. Very well packed because we could not risk having it break before it reached Jomo Kenyatta International Airport!" Jeff narrated during the morning radio show. He said members of the Boys Club presented the bottle of whiskey to the President in person, settling their debt. The late Safaricom CEO Bob Collymore's close friends on Tuesday night converged at Wambui Collymore’s home to mark the 1st anniversary since he died. They were former Gatanga MP Peter Kenneth, KCB chief executive Joshua Oigara, Scan group CEO Bharat Thakrar, Radio Africa’s Patrick Quarcoo and journalist Jeff Koinange.
