President Uhuru Kenyatta has barred all Cabinet Secretaries from travelling outside Nairobi after a surge in Covid-19 cases across the country. In a memo seen by the Star, Head of Public Service Joseph Kinyua said the CSs should not go out of Nairobi for the next one week. "You are advised not to move out of Nairobi for the next one week until advised otherwise. This directive takes effect from the date of this communication," the letter sent to specific CSs dated July 21 read. This comes days after a local daily reported that at least three CSs had contracted Covid-19 and are in self-isolation. With the cases increases by the day, cabinet secretaries have been seen racing against time to inspect and complete development projects ahead of September when they are to appear before the President for appraisals. The first quarter of this new financial year, 2020-21, will end in September and the CSs are expected to present their reports to the President on the status of projects being implemented by their line ministries. During a meeting the President chaired a fortnight ago, he assured the CSs, Chief Administrative Secretaries and Principal Secretaries that he will not sack them. Instead, the state officers will be rated based on their performance and the completion of projects. The President also ordered top government officials to get out of the comfort of their offices and tour development sites to interact with Kenyans. Since then, the CSs have been traversing the country rolling out development projects geared to consolidate Uhuru’s legacy ahead of his expected retirement in 2022. For the last two days, CSs Peter Munya (Agriculture), John Munyes (Mining), James Macharia (Roads and Transport), Eugene Wamalwa (Devolution), Mutahi Kagwe (Health) camped in the extensive Western region inspecting Uhuru’s legacy projects.
