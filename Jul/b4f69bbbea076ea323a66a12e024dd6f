"Tired feet is a reggae song that offers hope and encouragement during this time of Covid-19," she said in a statement. "It addresses the tough situation among artistes and specifically dancers during this time.

Telling the listener that no matter what has happened in your life, even if your feet are tired, you can get up and dance again."
