Limuru MP Peter Mwathi wants the one man, one vote, one shilling formula adopted for sharing revenue among the 47 counties. The lawmaker has urged senators to engage in a sober debate and make a decision on the matter. "The formula will ensure equity and fairness because money will be distributed proportionally in respective regions and this will be a major breakthrough in realising actual devolution," Mwathi said. “It is also important for leaders to know and realise that Kenyans are enlightened. They read newspapers, watch television and listen to radio and they know what leaders are saying, what is being proposed, who is opposing and much more,” the MP said on Saturday. Some senators and MPs are opposed to the formula of sharing revenue according to the number of people living in respective regions, arguing that the move will erode the gains of devolution in marginalised areas. Mwathi further observed that the recent change of guard in the Senate and in the National Assembly had seemingly created a political wedge between members and this is likely to hurt debates on crucial bills. The MP spoke when he urged residents to continue adhering to the government's directives to reduce the spread of the coronavirus. “We are worried that the number of infections is rising by the day. I urge residents to reduce movement in the villages, estates and most importantly observe hygiene and wear masks,” Mwathi said. “We must listen and obey the instructions of the Ministry of Health if we want to stay safe. It is not our wish to get the disease from our friends, neighbours, brothers or sisters, neither do they want to infect us. Let us protect each other.” Edited by A.N
