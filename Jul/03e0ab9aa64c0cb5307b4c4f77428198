Deputy President William Ruto has urged the youth to start small businesses, which he said are as important to the nation as big ones. Speaking at his Karen residence on Thursday during an empowerment programme for Nairobi county youth and women's groups, Ruto said the government will support small businesses. The DP said that the government is working with stakeholders to streamline policies on micro, small and medium-sized businesses. "We are working with leaders from sectors in the lower level to ensure they influence government policies to support their businesses,” Ruto said. He said that it is the responsibility of the government to ensure that there are policies that support every sector of the economy in the country. Ruto also called for the formalisation of the jua kali sector to create more opportunities for those involved and to earn more taxes for the government. He further said that small and informal businesses have created job opportunities for many Kenyans and have the potential to create even more jobs. The meeting was attended by Embakasi West MP George Theuri, Benjamin Gathiru of Embakasi Central, Nixon Korir of Lang’ata and the Nominated Senator Milicent Omanga. The DP urged Kenyans of goodwill to step forward and support those whose income had been affected by coronavirus pandemic, adding that government programs might not reach everyone.
