Businessman and music producer Tedd Josiah says he is currently fighting hard to keep his sanity and manage his blood pressure. Speaking to Word Is, Tedd said he is not ready for back and forth negativity. Tedd recently featured in Grace Msalame’s Unscripted with Grace on NTV where he spoke about his failed marriage with his first wife, with whom he had two children. Days later, a story was published on the blogs about his relationship with a Nigerian woman, with whom he had a daughter. The story said the two broke up and the girlfriend returned to Nigeria with the child. When asked for a comment, Tedd told Word Is: “I am going through a lot and I have blood pressure issues. “It is much deeper than what I put out on social media and so people do not know what kind of health issues I have been dealing with.” The businessman added that his three-year-old daughter fully depends on him. “Being a single parent, I would be very frank with you that my health comes first. If I pass away, I live an orphan and the people who will rejoice are those after that kind of things. “They are many. A lot of people would rather that I was in the ground and my daughter Jay was an orphan. That is why that article has been put out like that.” Asked whether he has a child with a Nigerian, Tedd said: “I don’t know what you are talking about. The story was not verified and I was not given a right of reply.” Tedd is currently focused on running his fashion business called Joka Jok, which he started after losing his wife Regina three years ago. He is also raising his three-year-old daughter and has reconnected with his two children from his first marriage. “Now I have a bond with my kids, all three of them. I love them to bits,” he said.
