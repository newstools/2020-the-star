At least 50 of Kenya's active Coronavirus patients are in Intensive Care, Director of Public Health Dr Francis Kuria has revealed. This is out of 1,179 patients who are in various medical facilities in the country. This comes as the country recorded  667 new cases of the virusÂ  raising the country's total to 16,268 on Friday. The country's fatalities were at 274 after 11 more succumbed including a child with rickets. Speaking at the daily briefing, Kuria disputed claims of Nairobi county isolation centres being full. He noted that the country's capacity is a work in progress with the current number being 12,513 normal isolation beds and 498 ICU beds. "We are making every arrangement to improve the capacity in Nairobi because this is where majority of the cases are. We will be advising the members of the Fourth Estate and the public of how we will be moving beginning next week," he said. Further, Kuria clarified that the cases announced by the ministry are from samples tested from rapid response teams. He noted that there is no need for all the staff in government offices to be subjected to testing unless there was exposure. "Our strategy still indicates that we test those who have symptoms and close contacts of those that have been identified as positive, not the entire building. It has to make scientific sense for testing for a whole building," he said.
