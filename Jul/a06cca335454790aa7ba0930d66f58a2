The CJ said the closure will allow staffers to self-quarantine and get tested before resumption of court operations. “Githongo law courts shall be closed for 14 days with effect from July 30. This will enable all members of staff to self-quarantine. The head of Githongo law courts shall issue directions on handling of urgent matters and those that will be affected by the closure,” Maraga said.
