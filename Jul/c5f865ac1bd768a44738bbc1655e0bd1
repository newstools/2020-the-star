The Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Council has requested for targeted Covid-19 mass testing to be conducted in Machakos and Kajiado counties immediately. The council raised concerns of possibility of more virus cases than what is collected from the daily sampling. In a letter to the Ministry of Health Director General Patrick Amoth, the council requested for a two-day mass testing in Mlolongo Town in Athi River and Kitengela in Kajiado. KMPDC CEO Daniel Yumbya said the National Testing Team should work with the county governments to pick out all the positive cases in the counties. "KMPDC has ground information to the effect that there could be more Covid-19 cases in the revised areas," he said. This comes as the country passed the 7,000 mark of infections on Friday. The government commenced targeted mass testing in May targetingÂ  high-risk Covid-19 areas. This was made possible by the scaled up testing capacities. So far, targeted testing has only been done in two counties in selected sub-counties.
