Gor Mahia assistant coach Patrick Odhiambo is keen to establish a football academy in Chiga, Kisumu County. Odhiambo established another academy at Awendo in Migori County during his time as defunct Sony FC coach. “When public gatherings including sports activities were banned due to the coronavirus pandemic, I came here and found young boys playing football. They have talent but they were playing aimlessly just to entertain themselves,” said “They asked me to train them. I spoke to their parents who agreed and at the moment we have 28 young boys and girls. However, due to the COVID-19 containment measures, we train in small groups.” He said he will join hands with other like-minded people in the area to establish a solid academy. “These boys are highly talented but they lack proper coaching that is why we want to join hands and establish an academy here. This talent must be tapped while still young. Youth development should be taken seriously in this country,” he said. “Now that these children are at home until January, training them here is one way of keeping them busy. We also talk to them about the importance of remaining disciplined.” Odhiambo, who has in the past coached Chemelil Sugar, Agro Chemicals and Muhoroni Youth said coaching the young stars is one way of giving back to society. “I like imparting skills to young people so that they can be better in future. Kisumu has abundant talent which should be properly nurtured,” he added.
