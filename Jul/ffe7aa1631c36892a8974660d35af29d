 Five Eastlands-based police officers caught on camera receiving bribes from transporters have been redeployed and barred from traffic assignments for the next three years. The officers "always stretch their hands inside the vehicles and immediately withdraw and put them in their pockets,” according to regional police commander Philip Ndolo in a letter dated July 21. The five, who were based in Buru Buru, Kayole and Madaraka, were filmed in Kamukunji, Makadara and Kayole sub-counties. Their targets were lorries, pick-ups and matatus. Ndolo said the Deputy Inspector General of police had “directed that none of the officers should be deployed for traffic enforcement for the next three years.” He said the deputy IG transferred them to areas with less commercial and public service vehicles traffic. The "report of officers proceeding to transfer" is addressed to police bosses in Kayole (Isaac Thuranira), Buru Buru (Adamson Bungei) and Makadara (Abdikadir Sheikh). Ndolo said the officers viewed the clips “in the presence of the Inspector General, Kenya Police Service and senior officers from the headquarters. "The officers were positively identified and never denied being the persons in the clips,” Ndolo said. Their modus operandi was stopping the targeted vehicles, opening passenger doors, closing the door in a matter of seconds and putting their hands in  pockets. The addressees were told to “ensure a copy is placed in the personal file of each officer. All to be in the new station by 27 July.” Ndolo identified the officers as corporals Nzioki Nzomo (Kayole), Daniel Kiprop (Buru Buru), Emma Kerubo (Makadara), Alvine Katende (Kayole) and Thomas Ngui (Kayole). Nzomo was transferred to Kitize (Makueni), Kiprop to Korwa (Baringo), Kerubo to Nyamaia (Kisii) and Katende and Ngui to Hola (Tana River) and Mumoni (Kitui) respectively.  - mwaniki fm
