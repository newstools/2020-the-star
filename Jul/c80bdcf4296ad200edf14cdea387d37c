The Savannah Cement Limited Board of Directors on Friday accepted the early retirement request by the firm's Managing Director Ronald Ndegwa. Ndegwa had made the request with interest to pursue other professional and personal interests. In a statement on Friday, the board Chairman Benson Ndeta said immediate international competitive recruitment process to fill the now vacant position  will commence on August 1 so as to facilitate the smooth running of the business. "Following the Board’s consideration, the request has been accepted, and a mutual separation agreement amicably reached. On behalf of the Board, I wish to pay tribute to Mr. Ndegwa, who has provided sound and strategic leadership for this business for the last six years and eight months," he said. Ndeta said the outgoing MD, who was also the CEO spearheaded the company's growth through challenging times and steered the ship steadily to its current credible market positioning as an award-winning cement manufacturer. "He was also instrumental in the formulation and ongoing execution of our five-year strategic plan that focuses on the delivery of strong financial and operational results," he said. "Ndegwa has overseen the foundational structure of our future growth that will see Savannah Cement heavily banking on the local and regional market opportunities. The commissioning of our second line featuring new generation, dust free cement manufacturing systems will also serve to enhance our environmental conservation commitments alongside the market delivery requirements which will ultimately have a positive impact on our bottom-line."
