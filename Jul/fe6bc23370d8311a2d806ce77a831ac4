A tout has been charged with intentionally and unlawfully touching the breast of a female police officer who refused to enter his matatu. Samuel Mburu was charged before Kibera senior resident magistrate Renee Kitagwa on Tuesday where he pleaded not guilty to the charges. He was charged with committing an indecent act with an adult contrary to the section 11 of the sexual offence act. Mburu allegedly touched the breast of the officer on July 3 in Uthiru location within Nairobi County. The police report showed that the officer was waiting to board a matatu to town at around 1200hrs at the Uthiru stage. At the stage, the officer was approached by Mburu who asked her to board a matatu. But the officer told him to leave her board a matatu of her choice. After that, the accused person thenÂ  insulted her and grabbed her breast without her wish. The officer then ran away and boarded another matatu. After three days, the report notes that the officer in company of other officers arrested Mburu charging him with causing an indecent act with the adult contrary to the sexual offence act. Mburu told the court that the officer assaulted him. The magistrate granted him a bond of Sh200, 000 or a cash bail of Sh100,000. The case will be mentioned on July 16.
