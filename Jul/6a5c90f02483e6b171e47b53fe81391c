A fuel pump attendant in Embu town was Wednesday charged with stealing Sh516,610 using Visa cards. Matin Mutwiri is accused of stealing the money jointly with others who were not in court. They are accused of committing the offence between February 2 and April 13 last year at Kirimari petrol station. Mutwiri also faced a second count of stealing the same amount of cash from his employer. He denied the charges before Embu principal magistrate Henry Nyakwemba. The accused applied to be released on bond. The prosecution informed the court that the suspect had been at large since he committed. Some suspects with whom the accused committed the crime had already been charged. The prosecution said it intends to consolidate Mutwiriâ€™s case with that of the other suspects and asked that the cases be mentioned the same date. The magistrate did not oppose the application and thus fixed the mention for August 18. Nyakwemba granted the accused a Sh100,000 bond with an alternative bail of a similar amount. Mutwiri pleaded with the court to reduce the bail saying he cannot afford to raise the bond. The request was declined, with the magistrate saying the other suspects were also granted similar bond terms. Nyakwemba said he could not be biased. He advised the accused to seek a review when the matter comes up mention. Mutwiri was taken to Embu G.K prison.  Edited by P.O
