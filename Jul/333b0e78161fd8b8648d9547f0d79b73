Socialite and lawyer Corazon Kwamboka has finally revealed the father of her unborn baby—Frankie Kiarie aka Frankie JustGymit. Frankie is the former husband of Maureen Waititu. Kwamboka announced she was pregnant last week and is in her third trimester. During a live Instagram session on Monday, she said she found out she was pregnant while in Diani on holiday with her mother. “I found out that I was three weeks pregnant. When I came back to Nairobi, I bought pregnancy kits, tested myself and the results were positive,” she said. Kwamboka says endometriosis had dimmed her hopes of ever becoming pregnant. “I doubted it and I did another post the following day and the results were positive,” she said, adding that she kept the news to herself for a week. “I didn’t tell my baby daddy and when I told him we agreed to have it. He wasn’t like ‘oooh that’s not my child!’” “We were all mature about it. just wanted to hear what he had to say. It was a blessing.” Kwamboka said she has had a smooth pregnancy. “The first trimester was good, I didn’t have any morning sickness and I just pray for the next few months to be safe,” she said. She is living with Frankie. “The lockdown has helped me and the baby’s father to get to know each other more, bond and build our relationship,” she said as she revealed that Frankie was the father. Asked whether Kwamboka was the reason he and his wife Maureen separated, Frankie said the two met after his marriage was over. “We met in July last year and we were from relationships and it was a sensitive time. We started talking and one day I sent her gym clothes from my brand so that she could try [them] out. We had so much in common that things just like catapulted into something else,” he said. Frankie has two children with Maureen Waititu.
