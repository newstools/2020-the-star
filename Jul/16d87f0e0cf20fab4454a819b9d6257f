A 51-year-old potato farmer in Murang'a who lost her leg in a car accident will get Sh2 million from the driver who knocked her down. Esther Ndung’u had won the case at the magistrate’s court and was awarded Sh2.5 million but the High Court reduced the sum to Sh2 million. Henry Kuria, the matatu driver, challenged the Sh2.5 million and suggested the magistrate erred in law while awarding the compensation. The magistrate had awarded her Sh1.2 million as general damages, Sh1,080,000 for loss of earning capacity, Sh230,000 to fit the prosthesis leg and replacements and Sh 125,897 as special damages. However, Justice Kanyi Kimondo reviewed the award to Sh1 million as general damages, loss of future earnings at Sh972,000, special damages Sh125,897 and a prosthetic leg at Sh 230,000. The total sum awarded by the High Court was Sh2.3 million but the court ordered that 10 per cent of that be deducted for contributory negligence. “That is to say that the appellant shall now pay to the respondent the sum of Sh2,095,107.30 plus interest at court rates from the date of the original decree till full payment,” judge Kimondo ordered. The judge further ruled that taking into account the degree of injuries, inflation and age, Sh1 million would be adequate compensation. The judge said he had reviewed the award on loss of earning capacity because, in his opinion, the victim did not lose her full earning capacity. Ndung'u had told the court that she was earning Sh20,000 from the sale of potatos from her farm and since the accident she had lost that income. According to a report by Dr Kagoda Byakika dated July 10, 2013, the loss of a limb had significant adverse physical impact. Byakika said there was the phantom limb phenomenon, which means feeling like the lost limb exists and even feeling pain in it. This can be life long and is very disturbing. The court noted that Ndung'u was aged 51 years at the time of the accident and would be impacted negatively for the rest of her life. However, Kuria’s lawyers challenged her testimony arguing that there was no documentary evidence to prove that she earned Sh20,000 from selling potatoes. Edited by Henry Makori
