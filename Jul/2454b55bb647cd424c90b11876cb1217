The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission is probing allegations of embezzlement and misappropriation of public funds by an official at the National Treasury. The commission on Friday said for the last five years Deputy Director External Resources at the National Treasury, Charles Muia Mutiso has amassed over Sh36 million in four bank accounts between 2015 and 2020. “Preliminary investigations have established that Charles Muia Mutiso is employed at The National Treasury as Deputy Director of External Resources since 16th Jul 2014. He joined the Ministry of Finance and Planning (External Resource Department) as an Economist on 31st Jul 2002,” the commission wrote on its Twitter account. The Twalib Mbarak led commission said further investigations have revealed that Mutiso earned a monthly net salary of Sh144,675.60, as at 30th April 2020 and an average net of Sh118,691.17 from 1st April 2015 to 30th April 2020. During this period, Mutiso earned a cumulative net income of Sh7,148,991.25 The commission said it applied to the court for warrants to investigate accounts held in various banks by the suspect. “On the basis of court orders, the Commission obtained bank statements in respect of the said bank accounts. Analysis of the flow of funds in his bank accounts revealed that he received numerous unexplained inward remittances, EFTs and cash deposits outside his salary from the National Treasury,” the commission said. According to EACC, investigations further established a pattern of frequent large cash deposits made mostly through the ATM or the dropbox. “For instance, in June 2015, he made five cash deposits of Sh400,000 each into his account at Absa Group account amounting to Sh2 million over just a few days. EACC obtained preservation orders to freeze Mutiso’s assets that include two ABSA Group Ltd accounts with Sh23,452,775.65 and Sh5,843,390.35 respectively,” the commission said. EACC said another account at Co-op Bank account with Sh1,932,167.53 and KCB account with Sh5,557,735.20 have also been frozen. “Investigations have confirmed that he has a total of Sh36,786,068.73 in his various bank accounts which EACC has frozen. His other properties include LR No Nairobi/Block 140/775, LR No 209/12108, LR No 209/16764, Donyo Sabuk/Kiboko Block 1/908 and Matungulu Sengani/3503,” the post read in part. The commission said it is apparent that there is a huge disproportion between Mutiso's assets and his known legitimate income. “In accordance with the law, he shall have an opportunity to explain as investigations continue,” EACC said.
