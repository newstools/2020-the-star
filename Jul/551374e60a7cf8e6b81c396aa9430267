A police officer in Busia has been quarantined after having consensual sex with a woman in Covid-19 quarantine. The incident occurred on Thursday night at Busia Agricultural Training Centre quarantine facility along the Busia-Kisumu Highway. It is being investigated and the county’s top medical officer said the health department was exploring taking legal action against the officer. Police, meanwhile, said it was not confirmed the man was a police officer. County Health director Dr David Mukabi told the Star on Friday night the woman was interrogated and said the sex was consensual and they used a condom. She said it was not rape, as some people had alleged. “The issue was raised by people in quarantine who saw the officer go past the red line,” Mukabi said. The red line in quarantine centres is the boundary beyond which nonmedical personnel are barred. “The patients stormed the room where the officer was seen entering. They found them in the sex act and wanted to take action but the officer’s colleague rescued him,” Mukabi said. “We had treated it as rape but after interrogation the lady revealed the act was consensual and they used protection.” The officer had to be quarantined since he had come into a contact with a person in quarantine for possible infection with the coronavirus. County police commander John Nyoike said his office will issue a detailed report after investigation. “How do you conclude the man is a police officer when investigations are still ongoing?” he asked the Star. “And how do you conclude it is rape as claimed when we have not received a medical report?” He said the public should give police time to investigate the incident that sparked criticism of police across the county.
