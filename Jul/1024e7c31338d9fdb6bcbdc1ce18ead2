ODM party leader Raila Odinga has expressed gratitude to Kenyans for standing with him as he received treatment in the United Arab Emirates. In a one-minute video shared by his daughter Winnie Odinga, Raila, clad in a mustard polo t-shirt and blue shorts, said that the messages of goodwill from Kenyans made him recover quickly. “I want to thank all my friends, supporters and all our youth who have sent me so many messages of goodwill. It has just been amazing and wonderful. It makes me recover so fast,” Raila said. The ODM chief flew out on June 21 and underwent successful minor surgery after doctors at a Dubai-based hospital identified the problem in his back. ODM communication chief Philip Etale said, "It was minor and a procedure carried out successfully. He is now on bed rest like every other patient who gets out of the theatre would. He is recuperating and will be back home soon." ODM party deputy chair and Mombasa Governor Ali Hassan Joho had said that Raila was progressing well. "We continue to pray for him. I have no doubt that within the shortest time possible, baba will be back in Kenya," Joho said.
