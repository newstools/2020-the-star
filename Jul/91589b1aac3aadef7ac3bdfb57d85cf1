Amani National Congress (ANC) and Ford Kenya party leaders have suspended planned meetings in Western region. The decision was reached during a meeting led by ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi and his Ford Kenya counterpart Moses Wetang'ula among others on Thursday under the Western Union Solidarity Movement. They urged all leaders to do the same and support President Uhuru Kenyatta in the fight against Covid-19. “In light of this grim scenario and after broad consultation, we have suspended our outreach programmes which involved scheduled meetings in the Western region," their statement read. "It's in this spirit of containing the Covid-19 spread that we also challenge other leaders to put the lives of Kenyans first by emulating our stance." Mudavadi had earlier called upon the ministries of Interior and Health to ban all political gatherings to curb the spread of the virus. He said the meetings are exposing vulnerable Kenyans, especially those in rural areas, to the risk of contracting Covid-19. The leaders have also asked the government to be clear on the issue of clearing debts in the sugar industry. They said that the government has not availed documents to confirm that the debts have been successfully cancelled. “If indeed debts have been cancelled, why is there still a receiver manager in Mumias Sugar Company?” The leaders also said privatization of sugar companies should be left to the Privatisation Commission. The two leaders also raised concerns over the company granted the rights to mine  gold discovered at Lirhanda Corridor.
