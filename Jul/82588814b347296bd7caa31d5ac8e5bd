A deputy OCS and a scene of crime officer were on Monday charged with conspiracy to defraud Kenya Police Pensions Department of Sh3.4 million. Before Milimani chief magistrate Martha Mutuku were Milton Odhiambo, who is the Narok deputy OCS, and James Thuo, a crime officer based in Kilifi. They are accused jointly with others not in court of fraudulently preparing and approving payment of Sh3,482,451 pension to Samwel Kiprotich between 2017 and 2018 at Vigilance House. They allegedly did that knowing that the claim documents were forged and Kiprotich was ineligible for payment. They denied the charges and pleaded for lenient bond terms. Their lawyer told court that the officers had cummulatively served the police service for 27 years. “We have young families who depend on us and we are not a flight risk”, they said. The magistrate released them on Sh500,000 bail or Sh1 million bond each. The case will be mentioned on July 20.  - mwaniki fm
