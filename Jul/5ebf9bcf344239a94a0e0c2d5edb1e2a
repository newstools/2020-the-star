A month after assuring her fans her marriage is fine, Gospel singer Size 8 now says the thought of divorce is giving her sleepless nights. The mother of two shared this during a segment on her and hubby DJ Mo's reality show, 'Dining With The Murayas'. This is after DJ Mo accused her of being a ‘nag’. Defending herself, she said: "The reason I call him that much is because I have my own reasons. The truth is I have been doing all he is accusing me of," she said. "There are times when paranoia, lack of security and lack of trust hits me." Asked if she was incessantly calling because she suspects DJ Mo is up to no good, she said she was not calling him to offend him. "Sometimes my heart is not at peace," she said. "I love my husband and the thought of divorce is giving me sleepless nights, and I do not want it in my house." DJ Mo accused his wife of always calling to know his whereabouts and coming to conclusions when he gets home late. This, he says, has made his marriage to start feeling like a troublesome job.
