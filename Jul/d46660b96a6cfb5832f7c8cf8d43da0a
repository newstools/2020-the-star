Kenya has reported 497 new cases, bringing the total to 10,791. This was out of a sample of 4922 samples, CAS Mercy Mwangangi said during her daily briefing on Tuesday. Out of the 497 new virus patients, 480 are Kenyans while 17 are foreigners. 318 are males while 179 are females. Nairobi (292) followed by Kiambu (62), Kajiado (51), Machakos (30), Mombasa (28), Busia (10), Uasin Gishu (8), Nakuru (5) and Makueni (3). Nyeri, Narok and Meru had two cases each.

Five more people have died in Kenya, bringing the total number of deaths as a result of the virus to 202. 71 more people have been discharged from hospital after fully recovering from the virus, bringing the total number of recoveries to 3,017. "The figures will keep rising and should worry all of us. The capital city continues to lead with high numbers," Mwangangi said. Nairobi was leading with 292 cases registered on Tuesday. She said that 518 cases have been registered in Nairobi in the last three days. "Residents should be alert," she said. Mwangangi appealed to Kenyans to stop profiling people with coronavirus. "Elevating stigma does not add value to this fight and ends up making it harder to contain the situation," she said. "We have seen people sharing videos and pictures of COVID-19 patients leading to profiling…This is unacceptable. It is important to note that contracting the disease is not a crime. Anyone can get it." The CAS further warned Kenyans that new information shows that Covid-19 is not only affecting the respiratory organs but is becoming systematic. "Covid-19 is actually a systemic disease that has effects on your heart, kidneys, clotting of your blood," she said. Earlier, 41 workers from Pumwani Maternity Hospital tested positive for the coronavirus. Acting Health Director General Patrick Amoth said that 41 healthcare workers from the facility tested positive from 290 samples. He said the remaining 100 staff members will also be tested. The cases involves different staffers who work within the premises of the hospital, including 14 nurses, two medical officers, two clinical officers, and one laboratory officer.
