Western Stima chairman Laban Jobita is confident of keeping most of their players despite the withdrawal of title sponsors Kenya Power. Kenya Power ended their association with the Kisumu-based team last week, throwing the management and players into panic. National Super League sides Nairobi Stima and Coast Stima also lost sponsorships. Jobita said he is currently looking for a sponsor. “We want to have a sponsor on board before the league starts. I hate seeing players suffering,” noted the former footballer. “I’m not the type that clings onto players. However, we hope to keep most of our current crop," said Jobita. He confirmed the imminent departure of strike prodigy Benson Omalla who is said to be heading to Kenyan Premier champions Gor Mahia. “Omalla can play for any team in Kenya. We cannot stand in his way even if he wants to go to Gor Mahia or AFC Leopards,” added Jobita. The Kisumu Day Form Four student is reported to have cancelled his contract with Stima already. Another youthful player, national Under 20 midfielder Fidel Origa is also said to be on his way out. The midfielder has attracted interest from a couple of KPL clubs. Jobita further confirmed plans to rename the team. “I’m flexible on the issue of renaming the team. We want this team to be owned by the people of Kisumu. Community clubs enjoy more support from locals than corporate teams,” he noted. He revealed that the club is willing to collaborate with Kisumu Hot Stars which plays in the National Division One. “Kisumu Hot Stars is one of the oldest teams in Kisumu and it enjoys support. It’s good if the team plays in the top tier league,” said Jobita who played for Hot Stars in his heydays. Western Stima struggled to attract fans in Kisumu and Jobita believes rebranding, which will include change of name will work magic for Salim Babu's side. The current Kenya Premier League season remains indefinitely suspended due to the coronavirus pandemic.
