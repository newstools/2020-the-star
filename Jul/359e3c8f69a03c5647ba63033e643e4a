Kenya Rugby Union (KRU) will conduct their Annual General Meeting (AGM) tomorrow virtually as they seek to reflect on the impact of Covid-19. KRU chairman, Oduor Gangla, termed the meeting as key especially with the game being in unchartered territory due to the Covid-19 pandemic. "We will be looking at what we have attained  in the past one year since our last AGM as we seek to strengthen other areas of the game. We also want to look at the possibilities of resumption," he noted. The Kenya Cup and other leagues were first cancelled before being suspended due to the Covid 19 pandemic in March. The national Sevens series which was to start this month is also a major doubt as the union awaits the Ministry of Sports to give direction in as far as resumption of sports is concerned. Elsewhere, KRU and Rugby Africa have partnered to provide quality assurance training for educators and trainers. The first webinar was held over the weekend and it will be a monthly affair. Rugby Africa regional training manager, Denver Wannies and development manager, Johnbosco Muamba presided over the first session, which attracted nine  participants. Wannies said: “It is important to understand the importance of having compliant educators and trainers that role out training and education in the union. Going forward, there will be focus on good quality educators and trainers and this  webinar is aiming to achieve that."
