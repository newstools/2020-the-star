Rapper Icy Lando has teamed up with Jamaican-American rapper Sean Kingston on his hit Options. Options is an artful display of Icy’s passion for music. Icy told Word Is that in 2007 when Sean Kingston released Beautiful Girls, he had just joined a high school band and they did a rendition of the song. “I loved the vibe of the track and it inspired me to be an artist. Thirteen years later and I have the privilege to release a single with my idol,” he said adding that Sean Kingston’s music has influenced his music journey. Icy got the chance to work with Sean Kingston via his manager who has been working with Icy Lando on previous singles.
