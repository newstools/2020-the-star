Residents of Gem have welcomed a plan to split the subcounty into two administrative units, saying it will ensure equal distribution of government services and resources. West Gem MCA Susan Okwiry said the move was welcome and will allow residents to tap more resources from the national government. Residents have proposed to have a new subcounty, a division and police headquarters. Dalmas Achol Nyang’a said they want three headquarters in Kayieye, Apuoyo and Nyagondo and that they will not accept anything less. Okwiry said consultations should continue to ensure all the three locations get equal resources. Nyang’a asked Gem MP Elisha Odhiambo to consult residents through public participation so he can articulate their thoughts. Okwiry promised to ensure that the headquarters are located in different locations as per the wishes of the residents. Gem subcounty has been subdivided to form Gem Wagai and Gem Yala sub-counties in Siaya county. Earlier Gem MP Elisha Odhiambo had asked some area MCAs to stop being reactionary, saying the subdivision was progress in development. Some had staged demonstrations to oppose the split. Odhiambo said subdivision will double the number of police officers in the area, hence tame the escalating cases of insecurity. "With the subdivision, we are going to have two OCPDs manning our constituency unlike before," the MP said. Odhiambo said apart from enhancing security, job opportunities will also be created as the establishment of a new subcounty headquarters will demand more human resources. "The MCAs opposing the split of Gem should take it easy because I am cognizant of the fact that politicians are employed to politic but they should not mislead residents while politicking," Odhiambo said. He said the public ought to be given the right information to make an informed opinion on any issues affecting them.
