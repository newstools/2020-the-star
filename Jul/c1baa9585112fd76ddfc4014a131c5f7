We must invest to fight the virus and take individual responsibility to save your child, your mother, your father, your friend. Let’s save each other." "You save me, I save you. That is what is called personal responsibility. If we agree, we are going to save each other. Take the responsibility of saving your family, friends and the public in general. And by observing the containment measures we can do that," Kagwe said.
