The Inter-Governmental Relations Technical Committee has warned that differences between the national and county governments are a hindrance to service delivery. But the situation will improve as its incoming members are optimistic they will find a solution to end the rivalry and revive stalled projects and programmes. The new team said plans were under way to turn the committee into a commission with a six-year tenure.  They spoke during a retreat at a Naivasha hotel. They intend to develop a new strategic plan for 2021-25 to address the outstanding challenges between the two levels of governments. The plan, according to interim chairman John Burugu, will encompass diverse views from all sectors. "We are and will be working with the Council of Governors to ensure synergy in addressing any inter-governmental issues that may arise," he said. Burugu said the committee was optimistic they will deliver on their mandate and were keen to work with other stakeholders. “We are ready to tackle the pending disputes between counties and government agencies and we shall seek the support of the state in reaching our objectives.” They are collaborating  with the Ministry of Devolution to draft a framework for the six regional blocks. "This also applies to the Alternative Disputes Resolution framework as we seek to apply mediation, negotiation and reconciliation as avenues of resolving disputes that may emerge from the counties," Burugu said. He at the same time praised the coordination mechanisms put in place by the two levels of government in mitigating the effects of Covid-19 pandemic. He said it was through close coordination and co-operation that the challenges facing the two levels of government will be addressed. The other board members are Angeline Hongo, Perminus Ndimitu, Linet Mosa, Alfred Khangati, Alice Kemunto, Saadia Abdi and Wilson ole Pere. - mwaniki fm
