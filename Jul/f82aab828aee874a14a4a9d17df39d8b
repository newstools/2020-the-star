President Uhuru Kenyatta has directed the executive to prioritise the completion of the ongoing projects for the financial year 2020/2021, which started on July 1. In a virtual meeting held at the State House Nairobi on Tuesday, the president said that his administration will focus on the implementation and completion of the ongoing priority projects and programs as set out in his Administration's Transformative Agenda for the Nation. The meeting was attended by the senior ranks of the executive including the CSs, CASs and Principal Secretaries. Uhuru said the ongoing programs must be strictly implemented within set timelines and budgets, reiterating that no new projects will be initiated except with his express authority. He also said that the completion rate of projects and programs will be adopted as a key performance Indicator for all CSs, CASs and the PSs, which will also serve as a measure of accountability. The President said that collective responsibility should be demonstrated by enhanced presence and visibility of government on the ground through inspection of projects and robust public engagements. He also reminded the government departments to settle pending bills as a key priority and to ensure that pending bills are the first charge on each ministryâ€™s budget. All the state departments and state agencies have also been asked to give preferential procurement to Kenyan Made Goods and Services as a demonstration of the Buy Kenya Build Kenya agenda. Uhuru further warned the government officials against corruption and malfeasance saying there's no room for the vices in his administration.
