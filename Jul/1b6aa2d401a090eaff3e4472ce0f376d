Three more persons in Kitui, including two health workers, have tested positive for Covid-19. Health chief officer Richard Muthoka said on Monday one is a nurse while the other a lab technician. They tested positive during a mass testing drive for health workers. Muthoka said the third person is a 68-year-old resident. He said that since health workers were central in the fight against Covid-19, the county government has embarked on mass testing of all medics to ensure their safety and those of their patients. “Our health staff interact with patients daily and are at risk of exposure. We have therefore decided to have all of them tested to ensure they are safe,” Muthoka said. He said a special isolation and treatment centre for the health workers has been set up at the Kitui Multi-purpose Training Institute. Edited by A.N
