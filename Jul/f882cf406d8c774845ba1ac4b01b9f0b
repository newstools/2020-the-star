Legendary Tanzanian musician Mr Nice is in Kenya after a two-year stint in Uganda, according to reports. In 2018, Mr Nice allegedly moved to Uganda, where he tried to work after he claimed Tanzanians mocked him. He indicated his strong feelings on Instagram at the time, saying, "I prefer staying where I make money. Or do you (Tanzanians) prefer I stay home so you keep laughing at me? That is not appropriate, our President John Magufuli urges us to continue working hard and stop gossiping." The ‘Fagilia’ hitmaker has tried his success in the three East African nations amid claims he has fallen on hard times. He recently moved to Kenya and lives in Kitengela, where he intends to keep away from the public. A source told Word Is he is doing okay but does not want any attention from anyone.
