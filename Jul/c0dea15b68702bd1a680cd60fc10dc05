The Kisumu county assembly is testing its members and staffers for coronavirus in efforts to curb the spread of Covid-19. The 47 MCAs are part of the more than 100 people targeted in the testing that began Friday morning. Assembly staffers, casual workers and drivers will also be tested. Kemri medics were invited by the Kisumu Health department, which encouraged staffers and MCAs to undergo the test. Assembly speaker Elisha Oraro was the first person to be tested. He noted that the process was voluntary but urged his colleagues to take part. Oraro said that the MCAs will be going on recess soon and it was prudent that they know their status. “The MCAs interact with many people [in the wards] hence the importance of this,” he said. The speaker further noted that the window of testing is open until Monday. More than 50 people had already been tested by 1pm on Friday and the process is ongoing. Governor Anyang' Nyong'o had said that all county staffers will take Covid-19 tests as an example of commitment in fighting the disease. Kisumu has reported 24 Covid-19 positive cases. One died. Five of the cases are community infections while the 14 are imported. (edited by o. owino)
