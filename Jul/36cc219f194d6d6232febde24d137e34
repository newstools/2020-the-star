A police officer  attached to Lamu Police Station has been sentenced to life imprisonment for raping a woman who had gone to report a case at the station. Rodgers Ouma, 28 years old will also serve 10 years for abuse of authority and pay Sh400,000 damages to the victim. Director of Public Prosecutions said the prosecution had proved its case beyond reasonable doubt that Ouma had lured the 26-year-old woman to his house at Langoni Police Lines in December 2019. Haji in a statement said the woman had gone to report that her husband was forcing her to take abortion pills to terminate an unwanted pregnancy. “The woman had braved the rains and was on her way home when somebody stopped her. The person identified himself as Police Officer Ouma from the Lamu station, perused through her complaint, got her mobile number and said he was willing to help,” read part of DPPs statement. “…the woman trusted the officer as a person in authority, genuinely willing to follow the case. The officer asked that they walk together as they were going in same direction. He offered her shelter for rains to subside,” the ODPP said. Presiding Magistrate Allan Temba said Ouma had misused his position of authority by promising to help the woman with the case she had gone to report. “He won her trust to the point she accepted his offer for shelter at his house, as there was a heavy downpour at the time.
