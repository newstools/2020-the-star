Eleven refurbished diesel train units Kenya bought from Spanish firm Serveis Ferroviaris de Mallorca (SFM) are on their way to the country. The train units (10 double and one triple) were sold to Kenya Railways Company for a total of 9.6 million euros (Sh1.17 billion), SFM said. They will be transported by boat to Barcelona and from there to the Port of Mombasa. Urban Development PS Charles Hinga on Thursday said the units will arrive next month. The units have an additional life span of about 25 years and are expected to help Nairobi move commuter railway passengers from about 300,000 a month to three million, he said. Operations have started at the SFM workshops in Son Rullan, where the train units have started to load. The rest of the units will be moved at the end of the year. The sale agreement was signed on April 20, 2020 in an act in which the Minister of Mobility and Housing, Marc Pons and the Kenyan ambassador to Spain, Richard Opembe ; Kenyan Railways chairman Pastor Awitta and Kenya State Railway Company managing director Philip Mainga participated. The negotiation process started in December 2018. The sale of the 11 units includes the price of the units, spare parts, wheel profiling and training of Kenya Railways staff by internal SFM staff.
