Kenya on Monday crossed past the 8,000 mark in Covid-19 cases. This is after it recorded 181 new cases of Covid-19, raising the country's total confirmed cases to 8,067. The new cases emerged from 2,131 samples that were tested in the last 24 hours. In a statement sent out on Monday, Health CS Mutahi Kagwe said Kenya's cumulative tests now stand at 191,394. A total of 179 of the new cases are Kenyans, while two are foreigners. By gender, 123 are males, and 58 are females. The youngest is a four month old infant, while the oldest  is 79 years. Another 127 patients have from various hospitals, bringing to 2,414  the total number of recoveries. However, another four patients have died, raising the fatalities to 164. The rise in numbers comes as President  Uhuru Kenyatta earlier announced a phase reopening of the economy. He lifted the cessation of movement in Nairobi Metropolitan Area, Mombasa and Mandera counties from Tuesday. "By reopening Nairobi, Mombasa and Mandera, we are more at risk than we were when the restrictions were in place," he said during an address at Harambee House. "We must, therefore, exercise cautious optimism, and avoid reckless abandon. I believe that, although the path to recovery is rocky and uneven, it is navigable. And this is why I must give two qualifications to the phased re-opening." Uhuru extended the nationwide curfew currently in place between 9pm and 4am by another 30 days. He also ordered a phased reopening of places of worship, with a maximum of 100 participants allowed per facility which will only be allowed one hour sessions. However, Sunday Schools and madrassas remain suspended as worship gatherings are restricted to congregants above 13 years and below 58 years.
