Health CS Kagwe has urged Kenyans to save each other from this virus as the numbers of positive cases go up by the day. The CS was visiting Embu to asses the county’s preparedness to handle Covid-19. The county has recorded two positive cases that recovered. Twenty-one people are in quarantine. Giving the daily Covid briefing in Embu, Kagwe said personal responsibility means saving yourself and saving another person. "This disease is here with us. We must invest to fight the virus and take individual responsibility to save your child, your mother, your father, your friend. Let’s save each other. "You save me, I save you. That is what is called personal responsibility. If we agree, we are going to save each other. Take the responsibility of saving your family, friends and the public in general. And by observing the containment measures we can do that," Kagwe said. He asked people to assume that the person beside them is positive and if they approach them they might get the virus. "Follow the measures  in place and we can save each other," Kagwe said. The CS praised Embu county for establishihng more than 360 beds and an additional 18 ICU beds to manage Covid-19.
