ANC Leader Musalia Mudavadi and Moses Wetang'ula will meetÂ opinion leaders at the home of Kimilili MP Chris Wamalwa in a bid to forge unity in the Luhya community. However, Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa and Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya are leading another faction to meet elders, openly showcasing the rivalry in Luhya politics. Due to Covid-19, Mudavadi has not left Nairobi for the last 104 days. The Kitale meeting will be his first to be followed by a series of others in Kakamega and Busia this weekend. Mudavadi will also visit the ANC office in Kakamega which was last week torched by arsonists. "We are strongly behind Mudavadi and support the unity between him and Ford Kenya leader Wetang'ula," Lugari MP Ayub Savula said. More than 15 MPs from Western are attending the meeting at Wamalwa's home. Eugene arrived in Kitale town and took a tour with Oparanya before heading to Kitale Technical College to meet the elders. The two were endorsed at a meeting held at the home of Cotu boss Francis Atwoli two months ago. They were endorsed by some leaders at the meeting to spearhead Luhya unity and pursue development programmes with the government. Rivalry between the two factions is expected to highten political activities in the region where DP William Ruto has also made inroads ahead of 2022. Edited by R.Wamochie
