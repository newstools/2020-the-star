Chief Justice David Maraga was at the Milimani law courts on Thursday to oversee the beginning of the transition to the e-filing system. Maraga on Wednesday officially launched e-filing which will see Nairobi courts go digital. Under the new electronic system, all lawyers, police, DPP and members of the public are required to register themselves through a portal to log into the Judiciary system. The portal is on https://efiling.court.go.ke. After logging in, one is expected to upload documents and also assess court fees. Subsequently, one has to submit the files to the registry online for the matter to be filed and placed before a judge for hearing.
