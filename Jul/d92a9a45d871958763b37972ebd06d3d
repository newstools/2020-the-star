An article claiming that the European Union has banned Kenyans from entering Europe due to the COVID-19 pandemic is PARTLY FALSE. The article further claims that citizens from Uganda, Ethiopia, Zambia, and Rwanda will be allowed to visit Europe beginning July 1, as the continent eases travel restrictions after closing its borders in a bid to contain the spread of COVID-19. In an official statement released on June 30 by the EU Council, the region, which comprises 27 countries, gave approval to leisure or business trips from 14 countries beyond its borders. From the nations mentioned in the claim, only Rwanda made it to the initial list. China has also been included in the provisional list, but its citizens’ entry into Europe depends on if Chinese authorities will allow EU citizens to visit the country. Reciprocity is a condition of being on the list. The statement says non-essential travel restrictions for the 14 countries will be lifted effective July 1, “with this list being reviewed and, as the case may be, updated every two weeks”. According to the commission, the plan to select the countries was drawn up based on health criteria, including recording a decrease in the number of new infections over the last 14 days.
