The Kenya Union of Special Needs Education Teachers has asked the Law Society of Kenya to keep off teachers matters. Union secretary general James Torome said it is the responsibility of President Uhuru Kenyatta to either reappoint or dismiss Teachers Service Commission CEO Nancy Macharia. In a press conference in Narok town at the weekend, Torome said the work of the Attorney General is only to notify the President of a vacancy. "We demand that the lawyers keep off teachers' matters as we have never interfered in judicial matters,” he said. Union chairman Amos Karanja wondered why an issue affecting teachers had become everyone’s business, yet teachers never interfered in matters involving other professions. He asked that teachers be respected, saying Macharia has stood with teachers through trying times. The LSK wrote to the Attorney General Paul Kihara, warning of the renewal of Macharia’s term as secretary and CEO without subjecting the process to competitive recruitment. Macharia’s term ended recently amid uncertainty on whether it will be renewed for another five years. Her tenure has been characterised by strong-arm tactics, especially when dealing with the Kenya National Union of Teachers. It is during her term that Knut secretary general Wilson Sossion was deregistered as a teacher.
