More than 15,000 Kaza Moyo villagers in Kinango subcounty have to walk over 20 kilometres for health services. They have attributed the long distance to many deaths. Ambulances cannot respond on time due to poor road networks and the nearest health facility is at Silaloni in Samburu town, they said. Mejumaa Ronald Beja lost one of her twins on the way to the hospital. She said since there was no means of transport at night, they had to ride on a bicycle. Beja said the discomfort caused by the ride made her deliver one of her babies on the way. The second died in Mariakani Hospital. “When we reached Silaloni it was already morning and we were referred to Mariakani but it was late, the twin had died in the womb,” she said trying to fight back tears. She said the dead infant had to be removed through caesarian section, adding that had there been health centres nearby, she would still have her two babies. Mwaka Mzomba said her mother almost bled to death when she was about to deliver as she was rushed to Voi health facility. “God is great. When my mother was being taken from here we knew she wouldn’t make it. Hopes became even minimal when the Silaloni dispensary sent her to Taita-Taveta,” she said. Emanuel Mwayaya Mnyika said his relative died from a snakebite due to delayed medical attention. Kaza Moyo is a Swahili phrase which means ‘take heart’. The village has no electricity and experiences constant water shortages. Resident Mwarua Gumbau said they depend on “Mitsara” water pans and a few earth dams which dry up during drought. He said domestic animals and people have to compete for the little water. The residents said they survive through God’s mercy and in case of an outbreak of a waterborne disease, they might be wiped out quickly. “You have to get in the water to fetch it, animals too drink it,” Mzomba said. The villagers have classified themselves as alienated. They have asked both the county and national governments to intervene.  Edited by R.Wamochie
