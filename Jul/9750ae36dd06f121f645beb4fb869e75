Patients who go for dialysis at the Kakamega General Hospital are unable to access the services over lack of supplies to the unit. Those who visited the facility on Monday were turned away after waiting the whole day without help. The hospital is now referring the patients to facilities of their choice to continue with their therapy. "We went as usual and were kept waiting for unusually long and when we decided to enquire what was happening, we were told there were no consumables for our therapy and asked to go home," a patient who receives dialysis twice a week said. Some 75 patients get the services at the facility and have been divided into groups of 15 to attend the clinic on different days. The unit has eight machines, each accommodating two patients at a time. They were issued with referral letters to help them seek help from alternative facilities. "The above patient was diagnosed of chronic kidney disease and staged as CKD G5, secondary to diabetic kidney disease and attendant hypertension since June 2019 with permanent catheter that later was substituted with arteriovenous fistula since November 2019," a referral letter dated June 16 reads in part. "He has had remarkable sessions in our facility when renal supplies were sufficient. However, due to current challenges in the supplies for renal sessions, he has requested to be referred to a facility of his choice for continuation of the sessions. Please accord him the necessary support," it adds. County Health Services executive Rachael Okumu acknowledged there is a problem at the unit. She said the consumables requisitioned by the hospital in April were not delivered by the close of the last financial year. "Yes we have a problem. Because of the lack of the required items, we cannot continue offering services. We are, however, working on the procurement within the current financial year, " Okumu said. Edited by F'Orieny
