Alego Usonga MP Samuel Atandi has said that ODM is in the handshake agreement for a better shot at the presidency. Atandi said the only route to State House is through President Uhuru Kenyatta who has the instruments of power. The MP spoke in Siaya town on Sunday while commissioning the Kowet police station built by CDF to tame rising insecurity in the area. The MP asked Siaya residents not to doubt President Uhuru Kenyatta's truce with ODM leader Raila Odinga. “We are committed to the handshake because we want to ascend to power come 2022 and the only route available is working with President Uhuru Kenyatta,” Atandi said. Atandi fronted The East Africa Legislative Assembly MP Oburu Oginga for the Siaya Senate seat in 2022. MP Oburu did not oppose the endorsement but asked residents to maintain peace. Oburu said they are not going to repeat common mistakes of previous elections that have cost ODM the presidency. “We have consistently failed to ascend to power despite winning elections, not knowing that we were in the wrong side of the system,” Oburu said. He urged residents to support handshake and the BBI to maintain peace and unity to compete and win fairly to avoid enmity after elections.
