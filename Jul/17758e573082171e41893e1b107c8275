MC Jessy used to do Nameless’ hair before he got into comedy. In a post on Instagram, Jessy said Nameless used to give him clothes. He wrote: “Today I just want to appreciate one person who has seen every step of my life. At one point in my life when I had two to three T-shirts to wear, this man @Namelesskenya allowed me to raid his closet and pick anything I wanted. "I used to be mtu wa mkono for this good friend of mine juvinaris chalo (extreme left). We used to go and roll dredi za Nameless and that’s where we knew each other." He said the artist's family is generous. "@wahukagwi I still miss zile tumbukiza zako thank you for believing in me," he wrote. In a past exclusive interview, MC Jessy said he used to sell mandazis before venturing into other hustles and later making it in the comedy industry.
