One person died and four others suffered serious spear wounds after two communities in Makueni and Kajiado clashed on Saturday morning. The 3am incident occurred in Mikululo neighbouring Chyulu National Park and which the Kenya Wildlife Service set aside as a dispersal area for grazing. Communities in Makueni and Kajiado have both laid claim to the land, each claiming it's in their county. Mikululo resident Peter Muthiani told the Star one person who was killed was still at the scene at 11am. “The Maasai from Kajiado stole 11 cows from us. We reported the matter to the police and they were told to return them but they only returned eight,” Muthiani said. Muthiani said in retaliation, they stole 14 of the Maasai's cows but have since returned them. A herder caught up in the conflict Wilson Ndulu said the attackers also destroyed their makeshifts. "The one who died and the injured were attacked with spears. The injured have been rushed to Makindu Subcounty Hospital with multiple injuries," Ndulu told the Star on the phone. He said they had reported the matter to Makindu police station. Makueni county commissioner Mohammed Maalim confirmed the morning incident but could not give the details. Maalim said he had no facts about the casualties and had dispatched his deputy and his security team on a fact-finding mission. He said he spoke to his Kajiado counterpart Joshua Nkanatha at 5am and shared the information, and that both agreed to send their deputies to Olorien, the troubled land. Maalim also said he has ordered a police patrol posted to contain the situation. Edited by R.Wamochie
