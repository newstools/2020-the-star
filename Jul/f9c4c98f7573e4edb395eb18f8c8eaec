Actress Njambi (Njeri Gachomba) of 'The Real Househelps of Kawangware' says she named her son Reign because he is a rainbow baby. Njambi welcomed Reign, her second-born late last year, a year after she suffered a miscarriage when she was five months along. Reign has brought joy into Njambi’s life, and it is evident with how she pampers him and the numerous cute posts on her Instagram. Posting a cute photo of her fast-growing baby, Njambi wrote, "Anaitwa Reign juu yeye ni rainbow…. Baby!!.. OK bye." While introducing her son two months ago, the mother of two said she lost one baby but God blessed her with exactly what she had asked for, a baby boy.
