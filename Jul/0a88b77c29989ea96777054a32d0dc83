Standard Gauge Railway operations between Mombasa and Nairobi will resume next Monday, Transport CS James Macharia has said. This follows transport protocols being put in place to curb the spread of the coronavirus. The CS on Wednesday said that the first trip will start from Nairobi at 8am and is expected to arrive at Mombasa at 12pm. The same trip will depart from Mombasa to Nairobi an hour later and is expected to to reach Nairobi at 6pm. Macharia said passengers will have ample time to reach their homes before the curfew starts at 9pm. The CS said Kenya Railways Corporation will deploy 10 coaches for passengers with a one-way total capacity of 600 in order to ensure that social distance is maintained. "The train will be allowed to carry 50 per cent of the total capacity," Macharia said. There will also be an isolated coach ready to pick the passengers suspected to have the virus. The government will provide a new commuter service operating that will link the Nairobi SGR terminus in Syokimau to Nairobi CBD. "This service shall run from Nairobi CBD to SGR terminus at 6:35 am in the morning." Madaraka Express was stopped following the outbreak of coronavirus in the country in March. The resumption follows President Uhuru Kenyatta's announcement on Monday of a phased reopening of the country. Kenyans have however been asked to be responsible to curb the spread of the virus that has claimed more than 160 lives.
