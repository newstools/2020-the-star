Residents of Bomet will get free legal services on public interest matters from lawyers in the county. Bomet Law Society of Kenya chair Kiprono Kadet said they are aware of the challenges faced by residents due to high costs of legal fees which are out of reach for many. Kadet said that they will ease the burden the residents have had in seeking justice on various issues affecting them in the community. He said they are concerned about the interests, rights and positions of all members of society hence their resolve to offer free services. The official said that protests are limited in what they can achieve but their intervention can assure fair representation and solutions to disputes. “Demonstrations are sometimes unhelpful and that is why as lawyers we are asking the aggrieved members of society to raise such complaints with us for proper actions through the legal way which is the sure way,” Kadet said. He cited land and environmental cases and infrastructural works as those that affect the people in the region.
