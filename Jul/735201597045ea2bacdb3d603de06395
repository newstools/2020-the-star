Ugandan singer Julianna Kanyomozi lost her first son Keron Raphael Kabugo six years ago. Keron died from asthma at the Aga Khan Hospital in Nairobi at the time. He would have turned 12 if still alive, and Juliana took to Instagram to pay tribute to him in a series of messages. "Six years today! I miss you so much my baby, my KK. Wish you were here with us, but I know you are watching over us. We love you so much. Your mummy and little brother Taj," she wrote. Juliana welcomed another child in May this year. She went ahead to reveal the gender and name of the baby. “It's a boy! Say hello to Taj 12-05-2020. We are thrilled! To God be the glory,” she captioned a photo holding her little angel in hospital.
