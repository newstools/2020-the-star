A Sh9.6 million modern male ward is set to be built at Kwale hospital to expand health services in Matuga subcounty. Speaking on Thursday while launching the project, Deputy Governor Fatuma Achani said the facility will be completed in 105 days. The ward will have 20 beds to effectively handle the surging number of patients. "The structure will be spaced enough to cater for male patients who will require admission," she said. Achani warned that the county will not pay for shoddy and substandard work. The contractor was also urged to prioritise residents when employing casuals. She cautioned that labourers should not be exploited. "Some contractors hire young men and then subject them to poor pay or don't pay at all. That should not be the case in Kwale," Achani said. In the war on Covid-19, Achani said Kwale has procured 340 beds. Kwale hospital has 30 isolation beds, she said. "I can confidently say that we are prepared to handle the worst," she said.
