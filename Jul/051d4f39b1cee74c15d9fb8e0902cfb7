Luanda MP Chris Omulele has hit back at his critics, challenging them to come up with programmes that would rival his record. He said his detractors said everything he did was wrong. “What I am doing is within my capacity and goodwill. I am not a superman to meet all the needs of the 100,000 people of Luanda constituency at once.  It is impossible,” Omulele said. The MP  spoke to the Star by the phone on Sunday while in Nairobi after his office was accused of unfair distribution of food in the constituency. Omulele said what was being distributed across the subcounty was not relief food or help from the NG-CDF but from his  pocket. He said his aim was to help the most vulnerable people within the constituency. "In this programme, I am only focusing on those who are totally disadvantaged during this Covid-19 pandemic,"  he said. "I have been distributing food across the entire constituency. Each ward has been receiving 20,000 packets of unga from my  pocket. “Those who are accusing me of unfair distribution of food, what have they done?” Omulele asked. He urged Luanda residents to avoid cheap politics when the nation was in the middle of a crisis. “I would urge my brothers and sisters out there that we join hands to support our people in this pandemic first. Politics will come and go but a life once lost will never come back,” the MP said. He said people should not be obsessed with politics at a time of great danger. Edited by Henry Makori
