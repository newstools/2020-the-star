Kariobangi Sharks chairman Robert Maoga is worried of striker Sydney Lokale's knee injury and subsequent surgery since it put his dream move to Europe in Limbo. Lokale  landed a six-month loan deal with Finish side HIFK Fotboll AB last year with an option of joining them permanently should he impress but suffered a blow after tearing his knee meniscus while in training. The national U23 Emerging Stars striker went under the knife at the start of the week and is expected to be sidelined for months. Maoga feels the injury will impede the youngster from securing a permanent deal with the club, home to former Harambee Stars goalkeeper Arnold Origi. "It is our wish as a club to have Lokale remain in Finland. However, the injury is likely to work against this plan. His progress was good before COVID-19 struck and we hope the club will retain him and even give him a lengthy contract," he said. Meanwhile, the administrator revealed that the Finish side would foot his hospital bills until he fully recovers."They are taking care of everything," he said Born in Lodwar but raised in Nakuru, Lokale was spotted by the defunct All-Stars while at Flamingo Secondary School and would join Sharks in December 2017. He made his debut with Rising Stars during  the Africa U-20 Cup of Nations qualifier match against Rwanda in April 2018 and upgraded to the U-23 in an Olympic qualifier against Mauritius in November the same year. He debuted for the Harambee Stars during a Chan qualifier match against Tanzania played in August last year at the Moi Stadium, Kasarani.
