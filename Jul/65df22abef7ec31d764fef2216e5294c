Nairobi and Mombasa remain hotspots for the virus. Some Kenyans are optimistic that they may also be reopened on June 6. The legislator urged Othaya residents to be vigilant and strictly adhere to guidelines put in place by the government if restrictions are lifted. “They include sanitising or washing of hands with running water and soap, wearing masks and keeping social distance,” Mugambi said. He urged farmers to step up their activities’ as they may need to support their relatives who have lost jobs until the economy stabilises. Mugambi spoke at Mbari ya Ngai area in Othaya where he had gone to inspect the construction of the Gikeu and Mbari ya Ngai roads. The two roads were damaged by rains. The MP also donated maize flour to needy families in the area. The lawmaker also called on the youth to take advantage of the Sh2 billion national government projects ongoing in the area and work on the sites to earn a living. The projects include upgrading of murram roads to bitumen, rehabilitating tarmac roads and the expansion of the area sewerage system. Mugambi said the Kenya Rural Roads Authority would be doing 50km of roads in the area. The government, the MP said, has also embarked Othaya town for upgrading where about 20km of road will be constructed.  Edited by A.N
