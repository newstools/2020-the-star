A political party will petition Parliament to address the current challenges facing Lake Naivasha. With tens of hotels flower farms and homes flooded due to a rise in water levels, the Civic Renewal Party (CRP) called for State backing for the affected businesses. This emerged when members of the party embarked on a two week tour of all the lakes in the Rift Valley whose water levels have risen sharply. According to the party ambassador James Mwangi, investments worth millions of shillings had been lost due to the flooding in Naivasha. Speaking after a tree planting exercise and a tour of the lake, Mwangi noted that tens of people had lost their jobs due to the rise in water levels. He called on national leaders to stop politicking and seek ways of assisting the closed investments around the troubled lake. “After this tour, CRP shall petition the parliamentary committee on environment to seek ways of assisting the farmers due to this calamity that has been caused by climate change,” he said on Sunday. Mwangi noted that the flower farms played a critical role in the economy of the country through foreign exchange and employment opportunities. CRP is headed by Murang’a Governor Mwangi Wa Iria, who has announced his ambitions to view for the presidency in 2022. The party environmental expert Samuel Mwangi added that they were doing a two week survey on the damages caused by the flooding lakes. He said that they were keen to create environmental awareness among residents bordering the lake so that they could wisely utilise its resources. “The flooding has done a lot of damage around the lake and as a party we are keen to work with the national governments and other stakeholders in addressing the challenges,” he said.
