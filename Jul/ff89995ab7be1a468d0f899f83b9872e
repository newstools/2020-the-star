Wolverhampton Wanderers boosted their hopes of qualifying for the Champions League with a 3-0 home win over Everton in the Premier League yesterday Victory lifted Nuno Espirito Santo’s side up to sixth in the standings — four points behind fourth-placed Leicester City who play Bournemouth last evening. Wolves took the lead in first-half stoppage time when Daniel Podence was fouled by Lucas Digne and Raul Jimenez maintained his 100 percent penalty conversion rate this season to score his 16th goal of the league campaign. Leander Dendoncker doubled the lead straight after the interval when he directed a glancing header past the outstretched arm of Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford. Diogo Jota made it 3-0 after midfielder Ruben Neves found him with a pinpoint cross-field ball and the Portuguese forward chested it down before firing an emphatic half-volley past Pickford at the near post. Everton remained in 11th place with three matches left in the season. Elsewhere, Wolves manager Nuno Espirito Santo said a decision about whether Adama Traore will need surgery for a shoulder injury is unlikely to be taken until the end of the campaign as the striker can play through the pain barrier. Although the 24-year-old Spaniard dislocated his left shoulder for the fourth time this season early in Wednesday's match with Sheffield United, he played for 79 minutes and the team went on to win 1-0. Asked if Traore required surgery, Santo told reporters: "I don't know. During this period when we didn't compete, Adama was able to do a special programme for his shoulder. "What happened in the game was a setback, but he's able to deal with the pain, he's able to deal with the competition side of the game. You can see that he's almost normal. "It's something he has to overcome mentally and after, we have to address it in a proper way. But I'm confident that for now, he's okay... I think he needs a scan, he needs to have a good opinion from the doctor and then we'll decide."
