Five people died on Thursday night in a road crash involving two 14-seater matatus and a lorry in Kingaatuani area on the Machakos-Kitui road. Five others sustained serious injuries and were taken to Machakos Level 5 Referral Hospital. The driver of the lorry, which was heading to Kitui, lost control and hit a matatu. The matatu consequently hit the other matatu. The two matatus were heading to Machakos town. Police are yet to establish the total number of passengers who were in the two matatus. Confirming the incident, Mwala subcounty traffic base commanderÂ  Jack Ila urged drivers to be careful and follow traffic rules. "It's quite unfortunate and disappointing that we keep losing lives to reckless driving," Ila said. The bodies were taken to Machakos Level 5 Referral Hospital mortuary.
