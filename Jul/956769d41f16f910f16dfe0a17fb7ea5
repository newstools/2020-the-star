Immediate former Kabras Sugar RFC head coach Henly Du Plessis is optimistic the team will remain dominant in the local competitions despite his exit. The South African tactician said his love for the team was not in question and explained that his resignation was purely due to the Covid-19 situation. “I was forced to travel back home purely due to the current Covid-19 situation and personal reasons but I will still be in touch with the team,” he added. Du Plessis said: “With the prolonged coronavirus break, I had to make painful decision but this doesn’t mean the end of me at Kabras. I will always have that connection with the team,” he said. The tactician led Kabras RFC to the 2018/2019 Kenya Cup final in Kakamega and also catapulted them to the top of the Kenya Cup log for 2019/2020 before Covid-19 halted the play. Under his tenure, Kabras were also on course to defending Enterprise Cup. “I have enjoyed every moment at Kabras. They have great talented players with a lot of potential and good management that made my work easy. They will remain in my heart and whenever I visit this country after Covid-19, I will make a point of paying a visit to the team,” he noted. He wished the players the best of luck as the incoming coach picks from where he left. “I believe the team has everything required to dominate local competitions.” He said rugby growth in Kenya is so rapid and on the right trajectory if the kind of structures and stiff competition being witnessed locally is anythiong to go by. Kabras RFC are 2016 Kenya Cup title holders and were leading Kenya Cup standings with 74 points from 16 wins before Covid-19 struck. Arch-rival KCB were second with 71 points.
