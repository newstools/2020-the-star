Religious leaders in Taita Taveta county have urged their faithful to pray relentlessly for the war against Covid-19 to succeed. Anglican Church of Kenya Bishop Liverson Mng’onda said resumption of worship service will open a new chance for believers to get spiritual nourishment. “Many people have been affected by this pandemic. Reopening of churches brings hope to the entire country because we now have time to pray together,” he told the Star on the phone. The state ordered the immediate closure of all places of worship on March 24 as one of the raft of measures to contain the spread of Covid-19. The bishop further asked all religious leaders to strictly adhere to all the set guidelines by the government, noting that violation of the protocols might trigger a new wave of infection. He, however, observed that churches with bigger congregants might be unable to hold 100 people per service. “It is our hope that going forward the government will increase the number of people per service. Some churches are in a dilemma on how to hold the services bearing in mind that they have a huge following,” he noted. Reverend Benjamin Kisenge, the pastor-in-charge of AIC Voi, applauded the government for reopening places of worship. Kisenge said pastors have been unable to reach out to all their members despite the use of social media platforms. “We have had online services but we cannot reach everybody. This is a new opportunity for us to pray for the nation and give our contribution towards the fight against Covid-19,” he said. He noted that the church had adhered to all the protocols prior to the reopening. Emily Mwende, a worshiper at AIC Voi, said the reopening was timely as many faithful need spiritual nourishment. “It is so amazing to be in church once more after months of closed doors. This is going to help very many people who have been psychologically affected by the difficult moments,” Mwende said.
