Enterprise Cup champions Kabras have set their sights on seven players once the transfer window opens later in the year. The Kakamega-based side, who a fortnight ago hired former Zimbabwean international Mzingaye Nyathi to take over from South African Hennley Du Plessis have identified the players needed to bolster the squad as they chase a second Kenya Cup crown. Chairman Phillip Jalango said he could not disclose the players they have identified as it will be prejudicial but added the process of recruitment has started. “The technical bench has been working since the season was stopped to look at our targets and to see those who will come in and add value to the side," said Jalango. "We want to build depth and a formidable roster to challenge for as many trophies as possible once the season resumes,” noted Jalango. Jalango revealed that former Kenya Simbas coach Jerome Paarwater, who is now director of rugby at Kabras, will work alongside Nyathi in readiness for the season ahead. “The two have very impressive credentials and experience and I know they will come up with a good brand of rugby which will steer the club to greater heights,” added Jalango. Preparation for the new season has started in earnest and the club has had management meetings to plan adequately. The sugarmillers topped the group phase standings with 74 points and were on course to romp top the final with a semifinal tie against either Impala or Mwamba. Champions KCB were due to face the winner of the other playoff tie pitting a resurgent Homeboyz vs Menengai Oilers. The Kenya Rugby Union(KRU) canceled the season but later suspended it following an outcry by clubs and stakeholders. The union is awaiting on government directives on when contact sports can resume.
