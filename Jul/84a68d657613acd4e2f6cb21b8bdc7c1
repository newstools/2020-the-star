A Homa Bay MCA is nursing serious injuries at a hospital after he was attacked by a gang at Got-Adhiambo village in Kibiri, Karachuonyo constituency. Ruma-Kaksingri West ward rep Peter Asoyo is recuperating at a Kisumu hospital following an attack by six men on Thursday evening. The MCA was attacked together with his East Kamagak counterpart Joshua Nyabola. The gang armed with a panga and other weapons cut the MCA on his left shoulder and head as he tried to defend himself. Aide Danish Yambo said Asoyo was attacked while they traced a motorbike he claimed was his. The motorcycle was allegedly stolen in February from a rider in Homa Bay town. Yambo said they saw the motorbike with a rider on Thursday. “Mheshimiwa signaled the boda boda rider to stop but he refused. He directed his driver to trace the rider after he diverted to a different route which led into a bushy place,” Yambo said. They tried to follow up the man for about a kilometre before he abandoned the motorbike and disappeared with the key, the aide said. “We rushed with Nyabola to take the motorbike as Asoyo remained behind. Shortly, a group of six people emerged with three motorbikes and started assaulting the MCA after a verbal exchange." During the fracas, a suspect hacked the MCA on the shoulder and head. Rachuonyo North subcounty police commander Sarah Chumo said they are looking for the assailants. “The MCA was first taken to Kandiege health centre before he was referred," she said.
