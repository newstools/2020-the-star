Kenya Wildlife Service rangers are searching for a lion that was spotted near a geothermal well in Olkaria, Naivasha, and later in Hell's Gate National Park. Kengen staffers and residents from the nearby community were gripped by fear that there could be more lions in the locality. It is suspected that the lion is part of the pride that fled from Lake Nakuru National Park earlier in the year and has been killing livestock in the area. Two months ago, lions invaded a home in Olkaria and killed one cow and twelve sheep. John Ole Naipuya, a witness, said the lone lion was first spotted in Hell's Gate National Park a couple of days before disappearing. Naipuya said the animal was later sighted lying near one of the wells in the bushes, forcing workers on duty to flee for their lives. “We suspect that this lion was the same that was seen in Hell's Gate National Park and we hope that it will be tracked and caged before it attacks human beings,” he said. Hell's Gate warden in charge Lillian Ajuoga said that they were tracking the lion. She said that they suspected that the lion was part of a pride that had been spotted in various farms and game ranches in North Lake. “Our team is on the ground tracking this lion which we suspect travelled from Lake Nakuru National Park and it’s a matter of time before we get it,” Ajuoga said. Meanwhile, stakeholders around Lake Naivasha are calling for urgent measures to open closed wildlife corridors to reduce cases of hippo attacks. David Kilo, chairman of Lake Naivasha Boat Owners Association said there are over 1,000 hippos in the lake. “We are asking KWS to conduct a fresh census and establish the real number of hippos around the lake as a group of visiting scientists said that the numbers had doubled,” he said. He said that the closure of wildlife corridors coupled with rising water levels had reduced grazing grounds for the animals, making them hostile. (edited by o. owino)
