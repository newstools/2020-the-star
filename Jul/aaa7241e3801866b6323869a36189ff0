A 38-year-old alleged serial thief has been handed six months suspended jail term after pleading guilty to stealing his aunt’s two chickens worth Sh2,000. Meru resident magistrate Maureen Odhiambo found Wilson Mugambi guilty of stealing the chickens and alternatively handling stolen goods belonging to Esther Nthangi. Odhiambo said she was satisfied that the prosecution had proved its case beyond any reasonable doubt. “I have also noted the time he spent in custody, as such the accused is sentenced to serve six months imprisonment. This sentence is suspended. I have considered accused's mitigation," she ruled. He was accused of committing the offence at Igoji area, Imenti North subcounty, at around 6pm. Prosecution told the court the complainant received a call from her daughter informing her that the suspect who is a mason had broken into the poultry house by cutting the wire mesh and stole the birds. Nthangi informed the court she went to her house where she found a crowd in her compound and that the convict had been caught red-handed stealing the chicken. The mob had apprehended the suspect before frog marching him to Meru police station where he was charged with the offence. The court dismissed the suspect's defence saying it was a mere denial and could not overcome the recognition and totality of the prosecution’s case led by state counsel Adams Chelule. In mitigation, the convict asked for leniency. “The suspect is a serial offender and has been found culpable of stealing farm produce in a case number 486/2020 but was discharged,” Chelule told court. While sentencing him, the magistrate warned the convict against committing any offence during the period of his sentence, otherwise he risks serving the sentence in prison. Edited by Henry Makori
