Workers at a construction site along Nairobi's 3rd Parklands Avenue on Monday fled when NMS director general Mohammed Badi arrived dressed in military gear to reclaim the land. Badi, accompanied by area MCA Jayendra Malde, Westlands MP Timothy Wanyonyi and police arrived at the site and stopped construction works. The foundations for the building had already been done and work on concrete pillars was ongoing for proposed high-rise flats. “All construction that is going on has been stopped. Anybody coming here should be arrested and prosecuted,” Badi told journalists at the site. He said the Nairobi Metropolitan Services will repossess land in other areas which have been grabbed. Badi said construction of a public hospital will begin at the site soon. Reports indicate the Highridge clinic had been constructed at the site before unknown entities demolished it, secured ownership documents and started developing it. “I came with Governor Sonko here some years back to repossess this land but after one week I was arrested by EACC officers at my house,” Malde said. He said there are many plots that have been grabbed in Westlands area and high-rise buildings have been constructed without approval. “What belongs to the public, let's give it to the public,” he said. Wanyonyi urged Badi to help repossess other grabbed lands in the area “to make Nairobi the city that was before.” “Nairobi is the headquarter of this region and we cannot allow it to deteriorate. We are happy as elected leaders and we support,” Wanyonyi said. Badi said a plot near Westgate and another near Gigiri meant for a fire station will be repossessed soon. He said what belongs to the state must always remain to be for the state. "Hapa sasa ni kwenu (this is now your place)," he told residents who had gathered at the entrance of the site.
