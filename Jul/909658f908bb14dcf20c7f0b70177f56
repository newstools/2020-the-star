President Uhuru Kenyatta has directed that places of worship in the country will be reopened following the protocols developed by the Inter Faith Council. The President said the places of worship will resume to its normal activities under strict measures to curb further spread of the disease. Addressing the nation on Monday from Harambee House, Uhuru said the country will commence a phased reopening of places of worship, where a maximum of 100 participants will be allowed in. He added that a service should not last for more than one hour, but said Sunday Schools and madrassas will remain suspended. Uhuru also announced congregants should be above 13-years old and below 58-years-old under the new guidelines. He, however, said that the places of worship should be reopened in a period that does not exceed three weeks after they had the opportunity to fully engage with their colleagues. Uhuru added that the places of worship should not be opened to people with underlying health conditions. The head of the state said the Inter-Faith Council will share all the guidelines given out to all church leaders across the country. The reopening of places of worship comes hours after the council handed over its first report the Interior CS Fred Matiang'i and his health counterpart Mutahi Kagwe. Places of worship were closed on March following the surging cases of coronavirus in the country. Several church leaders had called upon the president to reopen places of worship adding that they were ready to adhere to the measures issued by the Ministry of Health. More to follow...
