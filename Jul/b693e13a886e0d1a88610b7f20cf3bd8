Flood victims in Tana River have decried diminishing food support from the national government, pushing them to starvation and malnutrition among children. "The rains have stopped as has the relief food from the government for the past month, it is a hard life,‚Äù Fatuma Ishamael said. Speaking to the press on Tuesday, Ishamael, who has been in the Madogo camp displacement from Mororo, said the situation in the camps was demeaning and discouraging hence the need to start temporary establishments as they await government support. Another victim in Tana Delta camp Asha Mohammed claimed that their tents are prone to invasion by snakes and scorpions endangering the lives of their children. Mohammed, who resides in the Minjila Camp with 3,000 others, noted that the only means to escape the harsh conditions is to have an establishment in the camp, pending government plans. She said the tents were wearing out and tearing, exposing the IDPs to extreme weather conditions. In Galole, the IDPs have started renovating their houses that had been damaged by floods after realising there is no hope for a quick solution to resettle them. However, county commissioner Oning'oi ole Sosio asked the victms to be patient as talks into resettle them were almost concluded and plans for them to be supplied with food supplies are going on. Sosio said stakeholders have mapped out the affected areas and will forward the report to relevant authorities for action. Edited by R.Wamochie
