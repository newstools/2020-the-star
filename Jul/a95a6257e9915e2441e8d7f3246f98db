Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru has accepted the list of seven people picked to lead the reconciliation process between her and MCAs whose bid to have her sacked failed. They are; J.S. Mathenge- Kirinyaga Elder/Former PS- (chairman), Archbishop Anthony Muheria (chair of committee picked to determine when churches should reopen) and Paul M. Maringa- PS Ministry of Transport. Others are; Nancy Karigithu -PS, Mary Kimonye- PS, John Njiraini- Former KRA Commissioner General and Charles Ndegwa Mwai- Pastor Mwea. "I have accepted the following names of persons who have been proposed to oversee the peace and reconciliation process between the County Executive and the County Assembly," Waiguru said. The team will come up with terms of engagement and convene reconciliation meetings between the two. "We will ensure that the expectations and aspirations of our people remain the focus of our programmes and projects so as to move the county higher," she added. This comes a week after a Senate committee report recommended that the toxic relationship between Waiguru and the county assembly should be looked into. MCAs impeached Waiguru, but she was saved by the Senate. In the report, the committee observed that the proceedings before it exposed the 'acrimonious, contemptuous and cold' relationship between the MCAs and the governor. "That threatens to grind the county to a halt. It is inconceivable that in these circumstances, the people of Kirinyaga county can be enjoying the benefits of a devolved government," the report read. The Senate committee said urgent measures should be taken to bring the two protagonists to the table to find an amicable solution. "The committee recommends that the Senate, through its relevant organs, immediately assumes jurisdiction and invites the county assembly and the governor to a consultative process that will restore a functioning government to the people of Kirinyaga county," the report read.
