KRU Championship side Masinde Murilo University of Science and Technology (MMUST) captain, Samuel Mbeche is almost ready for  action after undergoing surgery in March. “I’m currently undergoing rehabilitation and so far so good and my strength is back. I’m doing some little jogging but will intensify in the coming weeks,” said Mbeche. He added: “I’m waiting for the travel restrictions to be lifted so that I pay my doctor a visit in Nairobi. I’m sure he will be glad to see my latest shape. With the free time occasioned by the Covid-19 pandemic, I have put some good effort and I can assure you that I will be better when I return to action.” The centre underwent knee surgery in March at Kijabe Hospital, ruling him out for six months. He is targeting to return to action in August. Mbeche is confident  that his team will be promoted to Kenya Cup next season. KRU suspended the 2019/2020 season due to the coronavirus pandemic. Initially, KRU had cancelled the entire season, a move that was opposed by clubs, forcing them to rescind the decision. However, Mbeche says MMUST who are  coached by Ochieng Ahaya deserve to play in Kenya Cup. MMUST finished second on the KRU Championship log during the regular season, sealing an automatic semifinal place together with leaders Strathmore Leos. Leos finished top of the table in the regular season with 76 points, followed by MMUST with 67. “With Western Bulls and Kisumu relegated, two teams should be promoted from Championship. We are ready for the semifinals once action returns,” added Mbeche.
