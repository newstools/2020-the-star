Lurambi MP Titus Khamala has faulted the government’s decision to bar the elderly from churches when they reopen. Khamala said the elderly were equally entitled to spiritual nourishment and a mechanism should be developed to cater for their spiritual needs. President Uhuru Kenyatta on Monday said people aged 58 and above and children under 13 will not be allowed to attend church. Services should last a maximum of one hour to check the spread of the coronavirus. Uhuru reopened the containment of Nairobi and Mombasa amid fears that the move could trigger a rush to the villages that could infect the elderly upcountry. But on Wednesday, Khamala, who is the head of the Cornerstone Ministries in East Africa, said churches should be allowed to develop programmes similar to those by the Catholic Church where the elderly would attend their sessions alone. “Though I fully support the President’s decisions because they are meant for the good of the masses, the issue of age on church services is unfair. This means that pastors aged above 58 will also not be allowed to preach,” he said. Khamala said the restriction on Sunday school was detrimental because children need the church more for guidance. “I am appealing to the government to rethink the requirements for reopening of churches.” Churches have remained shut for over three months following the Covid-19 pandemic that has brought the entire world to a standstill. The legislator also appealed to the National Treasury to release the National Government CDF funds to constituencies to pay contractors. He said most projects started by the NGCDF have stalled due to delays in releasing the funds. “Paying contractors will go a long way in mitigating the Covid-19 effects because the money will circulate within the localities. Most of the labour on these projects is locally sourced and when contractors are not paid the effects are felt to the villages,” he said. Edited by R.Wamochie
