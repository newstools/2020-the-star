Roche Kenya Limited has announced that patients in Kenya have enrolled into the Clinical Research Unit of the Aga Khan University Hospital, Empacta. Empacta study is a global Phase III clinical trial, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled and multi-centre study that will evaluate the efficacy and safety of Roche’s medicine Actemra (tocilizumab) in the treatment of Covid-19 associated hospitalised pneumonia. According to Dr Beatrice Nyawira, a medical director at Roche Kenya Ltd, disparities and lack of diversity in medical research holds the global community back. “The Covid-19 pandemic continues to evolve rapidly in Kenya and around the world and Roche is doing everything we can to contribute. Our people are working day and night with the aim of developing, manufacturing and supplying key tests and medicines where they are needed most,” Dr Nyawira said. She added that “This is a watershed moment for Kenya and us at the Aga Khan University Hospital, Nairobi, that we can participate in an international clinical trial that is testing the effectiveness of this novel drug on our patients here.” Both public and private sector patients in Kenya were eligible to participate in the trial. Dr Nyawira also said that it is an opportunity for the country to contribute knowledge and experience about our capability and the outcome of our patients to the international community. This is an addition to another group of about 200 Kenyans who had registered to take an experimental coronavirus vaccine when a trial comes. Senators were also offered the chance to take part in a trial but declined. The Kenya Aids Vaccine Initiative director Prof Omu Anzala, who is leading the project, said they are still looking for more volunteers. "We have engaged communities in the counties and so far 200 participants are ready for the trial," he said yesterday, during a meeting with the Senate Health Committee.
