University Education PS Simon Nabukwesi has urged youths to refrain from harmful activities during the lockdown of learning activities. He cited reckless sexual activity, crime and drug abuse as some of the harmful activities the youth are engaging in as a result of being idle. Schools in the country remain closed since March 15 to stem the spread of coronavirus. In May, the government raised concerns about a spike of teen pregnancy in the country. Education CS George Magoha in July announced schools will remain closed until January. This increased fears that the period would hurt vulnerable learners further. Nabukwesi said the government is concerned about the safety and hygiene of the youth and is doing its best to ensure learning institutions re-open once all the required measures to curb the virus are met. He said this while launching the national hygiene programme Kazi Mtaani at Amalemba grounds in Kakamega county. The project aims at ensuring community hygiene as it provides youths with a source of income. Some 4,181 youths from informal settlements and 139 supervisors from Kakamega and Mumias counties are engaged in the six and a half months long activity. During the launch, the PS distributed face masks donated by Maseno and Masinde Muliro universities to the youth. He urged them to observe proper hygiene by washing hands, wearing face masks correctly and observing social distancing so as to avoid contracting coronavirus. Kazi Mtaani, which is ongoing in all the 47 counties, aims at engaging the youth in activities that enable them to earn some income and later begin individual or group income-generating projects.
