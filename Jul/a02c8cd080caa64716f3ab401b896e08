Education CS George Magoha has confirmed school fees that had initially been paid by parents for the second and third terms will be forwarded to next year. The CS also clarified that the fees for the second and third terms will only be refunded if a parent paid in advance "Some parents had paid school fees in advance. It shall be carried forward to next year. However, fees for term one will be considered to have been spent," Magoha added. Speaking during a preparedness inspection tour at the Coast Institute of Technology in Voi, Taita Taveta County on Wednesday, Magoha said the learning centre will have to adhere to all government protocols before opening. The CS said that Vocational Training Institutions will be reopened in September. "The ministry is closely working with higher education institutions to ensure that learning resumes," he said. The CS said boarding secondary schools shall also be given priority in opening since students will remain in school. Magoha on Tuesday announced 2020 had been virtually wiped off the education calendar. The CS, however, said universities and technical colleges were free to open in September on condition they take all measures to protect students from the spread of Covid-19. The proposal to reopen in September was part of the initial recommendations to President Uhuru Kenyatta by a team established by Magoha in May. But this was quickly followed by a second recommendation in June, instead favouring reopening in January 2021. It will be the first time since the inception of the 30-year-old KCPE and KCSE tests that they will not be taking place. The ripple effects of this will see those currently in primary school spend nine years and those in secondary spend five years in classrooms. In effect, the decision will mean no intake in Grade 1, Form 1 and Preprimary 1, all which take place in January each year. Universities, colleges and technical institutions will also miss their annual intake in 2021.
