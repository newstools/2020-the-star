The historic Fort Jesus has lost more than Sh10 million since the coronavirus first hit Kenya in March. The fort’s peak season is usually in April and August but this year it has been closed since March. Last year, the fort received 42,000 visitors from April to June but this year there are no visitors due to the closure. Speaking to the Star at her office in Mombasa, chief curator Fatma Twahir said the effects of the loss will be felt in keeping the fort strong. “We use the money in maintenance of such sites, to renovate them and  to ensure that the information we give to the public is available, up to date, and is acceptable to our visitors,” she said. Twahir said they were doing their best to ensure the site does not go down. “We are trying our best so that the sites do not have a downturn because we also have a challenge of getting money to cater for them for now,” she said. The fort is expected to reopen soon to the public after complying with directives to ensure there are no infections of the virus. “We have organised that every section has a small number of people so that there are no gatherings in one area,” Twahir said. Visitors will be required to do online booking for the fort's administration to know the number of people who will visit and organise accordingly. Other measures to be undertaken upon arrival include maintenance of 1.5 meters distance especially in the ticketing area, temperature testing, hand washing and sanitising. Hand washing points will be placed in different areas inside the fort. “We will make the visitors understand that if their temperature is more than 37 degrees then we will not admit them,” Twahir said. Cash will not be allowed. Visitors will be required to use cashless systems in case they do not manage to book online. The fort staff will be working in shifts. The fort has 59 workers. Regular cleaning will be conducted and disinfection of the area every time. Edited by Henry Makori
