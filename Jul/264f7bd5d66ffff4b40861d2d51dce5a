It's a bizarre incident involving a public arrest, an identification parade and a suspect who disappears after police allow him to go for a short call. Frustrated by reports that the suspect had been raping women, children and committing other crimes, the public arrested him and took him to Langas police station in Kapseret,                                                            Uasin Gishu county. Still, police held an identification parade and boda boda rider Haroun Kemei were among those who singled him out. But while in the cells, and with a crowd gathered around the station, officers in duty allowed the suspect to go for a short call. He did not return. Angry residents barricaded the  Eldoret - Kisumu road demanding that the man is rearrested and prosecuted. They said the suspect has been giving them sleepless nights and police laxity had allowed him to escape. Kemei said that most of the police officers are reluctant in their duties and some have over stayed in the area. Uasin Gishu county police boss Johnstone Ipara said they are investigating the matter and combing the area to ensure the suspect is rearrested and taken to court. Ipara urged residents to be calm. He said an officer with the rank of inspector general will be deployed to man the station. Human rights activist Kimutai Rono said the suspect had been arrested in Kapsabet awhile back and released in unclear circumstances. Kimutai said the residents took their own initiative and arrested the suspect but police let him go. “This is an informal settlement and is prone to criminal activity  hence leaving such a person to roam the  estate is very risky,” he said.
