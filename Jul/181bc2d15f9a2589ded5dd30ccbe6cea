Health CAS Rashid Aman has dismissed reports that the government has barred all the Cabinet Secretaries from traversing the country amid a surge in coronavirus cases. The CAS said the purpose of the circular from the office of the Head of Public Service - which prompted the reports - was to reinforce the containment measures. “The purpose of the circular was simply to reinforce the measures that the government had put in place for civil servants and public servants to observe,” Aman said. He spoke on Wednesday at Afya House while updating the nation on the Covid-19 situation. The clarification followed reports that President Uhuru  Kenyatta had barred Cabinet secretaries from touring the country as part of efforts to curb spread of Covid-19. However, Aman warned CSs against nonessential tours. Aman said that there is no lockdown of government offices, adding they must function because they are essential service providers. According to the memo from Head of Public Service Joseph Kinyua, the CSs were asked not to go out of Nairobi for the next one week. "You are advised not to move out of Nairobi for the next one week until advised otherwise. This directive takes effect from the date of this communication," the letter sent to specific CSs dated July 21 read. This came days after a local daily reported that at least three CSs had contracted Covid-19. The country recorded 637 new positive cases in the last 24 hours, adding the total cases to 14,805, while 499 more people recovered from the disease, bringing the total number of recoveries to 6,757.
