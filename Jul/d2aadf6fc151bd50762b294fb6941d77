Tusker holding midfielder Hashim Sempala reckons that the Kenyan Premier League title will be theirs to lose next season. However, the Ugandan enforcer believes this will more or less depend on how they start life in the new season, still surrounded by uncertainty due to the coronavirus pandemic. The hard-man was part of the brewers squad which lastly won silverware in 2016 under the tutelage of Paul Nkata and was lucky to add a second last year with Gor Mahia. Sempala, who joined the Ruaraka-based outfit in 2016 observed that slow starts has been their major undoing and called on his colleagues to put their best foot forward from the opening fixture. Sempala decamped to Gor in April last year but lasted only four months for what he termed as off the pitch issues before rejoining Tusker. The former Bul FC man also cited that the quality of new players the technical bench will add and support from management will be important ingredients in their quest. “We have a chance of winning the title if we start the season well. Before COVID-19 disrupted sporting activities, we had gone for more than 15 matches without losing and if we pick from where we left, then we will bag our 12th league title," said Sempala. "We have a strong squad which I believe will punch above its weight if we remain intact. The management has plans to win the league and with their support we will achieve." He revealed he is challenging his teammates on the significance of winning the national title and has even gone as far as linking up with members of the 2016 title-winning team seeking to inspire the current generation. Their aim? To end Gor Mahia's dominance. “I have been sharing with my teammates the pride of winning the title and I hope they will be inspired to fight for it next season. Majority of the players who won it in 2016 are friends of the club and have been helping me in challenging the rest as we seek to end Gor's dominance,” he added.
