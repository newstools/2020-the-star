Youth from Madogo in Tana North on Wednesday protested against the allocation of all the 2,800 slots under Kazi Mtaani programme to Hola township. When contacted on the phone, Tana North deputy county commissioner Philip Soy said the slots were meant for Hola. He said following consultations, his office wrote to the Office of the President to consider Madogo, Chwelle and Bura. "It’s true Tana North did not benefit from the recent slots, but following consultations with senior officials at the Office of the President, something is being worked out for Madogo, Chewelle and Bura," Soy said. He urged the youth to get information on the programme from his office. "I want to urge our youth to seek information on issues touching on them before resorting to street demonstrations. My office is open and although I am away, the person I left in charge has the all the information," Soy said. "Had they sought this information, I really don’t think they would have demonstrated. Even ACC at Madogo is aware." Soy said his office ‘expects positive feedback from the Office of the President within the next two weeks’. Speaking on behalf of Madogo youth, Saddam Shora claimed that the young people from the area are always discriminated against whenever opportunities arise. He said some have resorted to crime because they have no source of income. "Things have become even more difficult for them (the youth) due to the effects of Covid-19," Shora said. "We are giving the county commissioner and the county government of Tana River one week to resolve this issue, else we shall be holding daily demonstrations in Madogo until we are given a satisfactory answer." The Kazi Mtaani initiative piloted in April this year has been rolled out throughout the country and is meant to engage the youth in national hygiene projects. Phase II of the programme targets over 270,000 vulnerable youth in informal settlements. Edited by A.N
