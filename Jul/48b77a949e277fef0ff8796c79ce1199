A matatu tout has denied indecently touching a policewomanâ€™s bottom and breasts. Kenneth Gachie Kimaru allegedly touched traffic officer Saida Mwihaki Yahya's buttocks and breasts against her will at mid-day on June 27 along Racecourse Road in Nairobi. Makadara senior principal magistrate Steve Jalang'o was told that Kimaru, 29, approached Saida and told her she had nice buttocks. He is said to have stretched his hands and touched her buttocks and breasts, as the officer, who was on duty, resisted, watched by the public. Saida said the incident happened too fast and she was unable to act. However, she raised the alarm and a matatu conductor intervened and chased Kimaru. The accused threw a knife at his pursuer, which luckily missed him. A police officer who was on duty with Saida joined the chase but the tout managed to escape. Kimaru, who works for Neema Travellers Sacco, was later arrested and taken to Kamukunji police station. The court granted him a Sh200,000 bond to await the mention of his case on July 13. - mwaniki fm
