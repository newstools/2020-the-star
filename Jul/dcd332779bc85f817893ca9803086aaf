Kenya have confirmed entry in the Africa Cup 3 on 3 tournament slated for Uganda in November. Kenya Basketball Federation (KBF) first vice chairman, Hilmi Ali, said his focus is to have Kenya placed at the top of the chart in Africa. Kenya is ranked third. Hilmi plans to have the senior and junior teams entered for all continental events which will earn them points and improve the teams’ rankings. After the Kampala show, he said the national under-23 side will also go for the National Cup, whose dates and venue will be confirmed later. The winners of both championships will book a direct ticket to the World Cup in 2022. There is the U-18 and U-17 Africa Cup whose qualifiers will go for the Youth Olympics. “If Kenya does well in these events, Ali noted, “We will have a strong chance of being ranked top in Africa in both the senior and junior cadres within a short time.” Hilmi remained optimistic 3 on 3 will pick up in schools after many teachers qualified as co-ordinators and promoters during a recent virtual training conducted by Fiba. “The number of 3 on 3 coordinators in the country have increased to 30 after the trainings attended by many teachers. This is a plus for us,” he said. Many schools are interested in introducing 3 on 3 in their institutions, considering it can improve a player in a very short time. “This development will spur growth in schools as they will be having inter classes which will be done as per Fiba requirements,” he added.
