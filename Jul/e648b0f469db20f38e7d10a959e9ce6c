Residents of Maledi in Lunga Lunga constituency of Kwale are seeking experts to help control rats as fear of an outbreak escalate. Rats in homesteads are believed to have been caused by the decline of urban waste due to closure of eatery places in efforts to combat Covid-19. Residents said the rodents have become a menace especially at night when they battle over stored food in homes. Led by Chizi Mlamba, they have expressed fears of acute hunger by December due to the destruction of their maize produce. "A two-acre land of maize farm has been destroyed and if it goes on like that, we will starve, " Mlamba said. The residents said they have tried to trap the rodents unsuccessfully, suspecting 'some sort of witchcraft'. Mlamba said the rodents have taken control of their homes as they continue to make huge losses. Fatuma Bora said they compete for food with the rats. "We are not able to keep food or stock because the moment you step out, the rats attack, " she said. The villagers decried that they get sleepless nights saying the rats eat their feet at night. Bora said they are worried that diseases related to rodents might break out. They asked the government to intervene. The noise they make while fighting for food on rooftops is a nuisance, another resident said. Bakari Ali said the rats are destroying clothes and other valuable items at home. "They get in wardrobes and eat our outfits, it is upon the government to help us now because we don't know what to do, " Ali said. Edited by R.Wamochie
