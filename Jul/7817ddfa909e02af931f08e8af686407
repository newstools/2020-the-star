Meru First Lady Priscilla Murungi has expressed concerns over caregivers' failure to guide, protect and counsel teenagers facing the danger of pregnancy. She said lack of parenting exposes teenagers to drugs, especially now that they are out of school due to the Covid-19 crisis. The wife to Governor Kiraitu Murungi spoke on Tuesday when she distributed food and other aid items to vulnerable women across the county aimed at reducing the pandemic crisis. Priscilla noted that both the boy and girl child face equal risk due to the advances in technology which have exposed them to many dangers. She said due to exposure of children to online activities, the children are lured and enticed to practice what they see. Meru County Assembly Women Caucus chair Secondina Kanini and the assembly Health committee chair Mworia Martin Kiongozi said there is a need for concerted efforts for a healthy society. “As mothers, we also need to realise that the dangers of child defilement can very well be perpetuated by close family relatives and friends and as such, I call on you to be extremely vigilant and speak regularly to the children to ensure they are safe even as we navigate through this pandemic with them at our homes,” she said. She said the donations' distribution programme will be spearheaded at ward level to help widows and other vulnerable women and their families facing the hardest of economic times.
