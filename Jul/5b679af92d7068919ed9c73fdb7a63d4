Deputy President William Ruto on Friday bought a matatu for Ngong Boda Boda Sacco in Kajiado county. Ruto was spotted taking pictures with the youths as he  hang on the matatu like a tout. The matatu paid tribute to the Rastafarian culture with the words 'dub dub dub' and pictures of cannabis, popularly referred to as 'ganja', and a man with dreadlocks. Ruto, who wore maroon khaki pants - which is the uniform of conductors - a dotted black and white shirt, a black cap, sports shoes and a reflector jacket gave the vehicle kkeys to the youths. Ruto was seen trying to mimic how touts normally call for passengers enticing them to board their matatus. "We have a duty to nurture, encourage, lubricate and protect small businesses because they not only sustain our huge population but also inspire innovation and stimulate economic growth by generating jobs to the youths," he said. The deputy president said the government is intensifying his efforts to invest in viable dreams. "...by providing the requisite capital and technical know-how to community-focused projects; this will boost the livelihoods of the vulnerable and provide a fertile ground for the youths to unlock their potential," he said. Ruto  also supported other groups from Kajiado County with water tanks, catering equipment, public address system, car wash and tailoring machines. The deputy president has been on a roll for the past one month investing in different small businesses in the country. On June 26, Ruto was spotted bargaining to get five modern seats from two carpenters whose work of art went viral earlier this month. Stephen Odhiambo and Dennis Otieno had designed a moving seat to also act as a garden or park bench when folded and a table seat when unfolded. It is this creativity that wowed many Kenyans including the DP who invited them to his Karen office and made an order. Even has he did this, Kenyans were able to see the other side of Ruto as he bargained with the two carpenters.
