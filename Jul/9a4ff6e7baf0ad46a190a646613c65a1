Mlango Kubwa MCA Patricia Mutheu has asked the Inspector General of Police  Hillary Mutyambai to sack the four officers who assaulted her on Tuesday at City Hall. In a letter to Mutyambai, Mutheu says she was assaulted by police with no provocation and they caused grievous harm to her. Through her lawyer Cliff Ombeta, Mutheu has also asked the IG to accept liability for the what the officers did to her. Ombeta says police brutality has been the trend recently even after the IG promised to root out such behaviour. “It's with such in mind that we demand from you as the Inspector General of National Police Service to accept liability and it appears that you are now not able to control such rogue officers under your watch and command,” Ombeta said. "We wants the police officers in question to be removed from police service immediately arrested and charged with assault that has caused grievous harm to our client without provocation.” The MCA said they cannot accept a police force that keeps on relying on brutality when dealing with Kenyan citizens. The Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji on Tuesday directed the National Police Service and Ipoa to hasten the probe of police brutality on a female MCA. Haji said he had reached out to the office of the Inspector General of Police Hillary Mutyambai over the matter and was informed that the investigations are at the advanced stage on the matter.
