The Sudanese army says it has started legal action against activists and journalists, accusing them of insulting the military. In a statement, it said they had crossed "the bounds of patience". Activists and rights groups complain that the army has blocked investigations into the killing of scores of protesters in June last year. The Sudanese military denies this, and says those who committed offences will be punished. Last month, tens of thousands of people took to the streets of several cities calling for faster reform and greater civilian rule. Following the overthrow of long-serving ruler Omar al-Bashir in April last year, Sudan is being led by an interim government made up of senior military men and civilians.
