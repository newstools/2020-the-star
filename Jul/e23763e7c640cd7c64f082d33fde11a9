"We have never had this kind of appointment. This is based on her efforts because she is very passionate about education matters,"Â  Okisai said. The unionist said an acute shortfall of teachers in Busia county should be addressed urgently. "The shortfall of teachers is a very big challenge in Busia county. As we talk, there is a shortage of 1,644 teachers in our secondary schools so we expect to start seeing positive changes soon," Okisai said.
