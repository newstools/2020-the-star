Youths in Vihiga county now want ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi not to expel Kakamega Senator Cleophas Malala and nominated MP Godfrey Osotsi. They say the two are the only youthful leaders in the region. The youth wing said Malala and Osotsi were key players in the ANC and they should not be expelled at any cost. Speaking to journalists in Mbale town on Sunday, the youths said cartels are fighting young leaders in the party to ensure Mudavadi does not listen to them. The youths were led by Newton Mudaki, Shila Mwaniga and Claire Musimbi. "We are not going to accept these continuous wars in the party targeting to rattle young leaders. The youths must be given space and be listened to". “We are always disadvantaged as far as the leadership of this country is concerned, even in parties. We are appealing to Mudavadi to come to our rescue in ANC,” Mudaki said. They said they have previously been in full support of ANC party for considering youths in leadership. However, they said, cartels have hijacked the party and are misleading Mudavadi to rattle young leaders within the ANC. Young leaders have got fresh ideas that can help  Mudavadi to clinch the top seat in the coming presidential contest, they added.
