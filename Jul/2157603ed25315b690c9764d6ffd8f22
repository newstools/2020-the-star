A Mombasa businessman was on Thursday charged with fraudulently obtaining money and issuing bouncing cheques to a number of people including his former mother-in-law. Fahim Salim Said pleaded not guilty to several charges including fraud and theft  before Shanzu magistrate Yusuf Shikanda. Fahim is accused of stealing Sh10 million from Fahma Mohamed. He was also accused of issuing bad cheques amounting to nearly Sh1 million to his former mother-in-law. He faced another charge of defrauding businessman Esmail Noor of four Samsung phones valued at Sh420,000 He pleaded not guilty to charges of obtaining Sh650,000 from Nabill Salim pretending he was in a position to sell him Gypsum board, knowing it to be a false promise. The middle-aged man allegedly issued bad cheques amounting to Sh690,000 to Khamis Salim. The accused was remanded for two more days as the court was expected to issue its ruling on his bond application on Friday. The state opposed releasing the suspect on bond citing the seriousness of the charges facing him. State counsels Daniel Wamotsa, Eugene Wangila and Caroline Ng’ang’a who represented complainants said the accused person was likely to abscond court if he was granted bail. The counsels said no one knew where the accused person resided, therefore police would not know where to get him if he absconded. But defense counsel Jared Magolo objected to the application to have the accused remain in custody. Magolo said the prosecution had failed to produce in court evidence that Fahim was likely to abscond court. Edited by Henry Makori
