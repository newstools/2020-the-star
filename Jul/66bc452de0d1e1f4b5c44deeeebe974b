Coronavirus ruined our wedding plans, Tanzanian rapper Billnass has said. There has been speculation that the couple do not have money for a wedding, but Billnass says this is not the case. Speaking to Tanzanian media, Billnass set the record straight. “I planned to marry her even a week after the engagement. When I marry, I’ll do so according to my financial capabilities,” he said. The artiste proposed to his girlfriend, singer Nandy, in April on live TV. The engagement, which took place as Nandy performed on Tanzania’s TVE, was dismissed by some fans as a publicity stunt. Billnass said he is currently working towards becoming financially stable so he can offer Nandy the life she deserves. “Becoming financially stable before marriage is not a bad thing. There’s a certain life that I would like for my wife to live. I want Nandy to live like a queen,” the artiste said. “She is the first woman I have proposed to and I don’t think I will do it with another woman again. I know my fiancée and every reason why I proposed to her.” Nandy and Billnass were lovers before going their separate ways in 2017. Nandy then dated Tanzanian media personality Ruge Mutahaba, who passed away after a long illness. Nandy and Ruge were set to get married before his hospitalisation and death in South Africa.
