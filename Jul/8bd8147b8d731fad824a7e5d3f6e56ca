A St Paul's University student was on Monday charged with raping his former lover in an estate when he visited to pick his belongings. Denis Abuga was charged before Kibera chief magistrate Abdul Lorot and denied the charges. Police say Abuga committed the offence on July 9 in Dagoreti subcounty in Nairobi. He allegedly forcefully had sex  with the complainant without her consent. He was also charged with the second count of committing an indecent act with an adult contrary to Sexual Offences Act. The accused allegedly called the woman and informed her that he was paying her a visit to pick his belongings. She agreed. When Abuga reached the house, police say the complainant left him in the sitting room  and went into her bedroom. The accused followed her and sat on the bed. The police report says Abuga wanted to talk to the woman but she told him she wanted to leave the house to her workplace. The accused became violent, grabbed the woman and threw her on the bed, tied her with her handbag and raped her. She called the neighbours who escorted her to Kilimani police station where she reported the matter. Abuga denied the charges and through his lawyer asked court for lenient bond terms. He told court that he was booked for an operation at a city hospital and needed to be freed on bond. The prosecution requested court that a sample be taken from the accused for a DNA test. The magistrate ordered that the accused person pay Sh200,000 bail with a surety of similar amount and ordered the suspect to presents himself at Kilimani police station for extraction of a sample for DNA testing on Wednesday next week. The case will proceed on August 3. Edited by Henry Makori
