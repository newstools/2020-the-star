Kenya is set to negotiate a post Brexit trade agreement with the UK. This follows a private conversation between president Uhuru Kenyatta and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson. According to State House Spokesperson Kanze Dena, the negotiations are expected to be finalised ahead of the UK's exit from the European Union (Brexit) on 31st December 2020. Kanze said the two leaders agreed that the negotiationsÂ  will be conducted within the Kenya-UK Strategic Partnership Framework established in January 2020 and the East African Community (EAC) parameters in order to enhance regional integration. "In the telephone conversation, President Uhuru Kenyatta and Prime Minister Johnson also discussed several Kenya-UK bilateral interests among them the two nation's response to the global Covid-19 health crisis," she said in a statement. Kanze said Uhuru thanked the British Government for extending visa over-stay amnesty for Kenyan nationals in the UK who cannot travel back due to the Covid-19 travel restrictions until 30th May 2020. "The visa amnesty, the head of state noted had enabled Kenyans especially students and workers, to apply for long-term visa renewal in the UK without having to travel back to Kenya as has been the norm," she said. She said Uhuru also thanked the UK Government for supporting Kenya's Worker Protection Scheme which he said will benefit garment and horticultural sectors so as to avoid massive staff layoffs during the current Covid-19 global economic disruption. "On Britain's support for Kenya's successful bid for the recent UN Security Council elections, President Kenyatta thanked Prime Minister Johnson for his country's endorsement," she said. Kanze said the two leaders affirmed their strong support for the Commonwealth and committed to work together to ensure stability, continuity and the deepening of solidarity among Commonwealth nations.
