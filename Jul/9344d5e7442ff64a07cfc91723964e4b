Despite uncertainty over the return of sporting activities, Kenya Police head coach Charles Omondi is confident of securing automatic promotion to the top flight in the new season. Police have come close in the past campaigns but an ambitious Omondi believes if he retains his top civilian players in his team, he will steer the team to the senior league. The tactician, christened as Korea, said the decision by Football Kenya Federation to use the first leg results to promote the duo of Nairobi City Stars and Bidco United served as wake up call to him, and will aim to finish the first half of the season within the promotion bracket. “Gaining automatic promotion to the top flight in the new season is our irreducible minimum. The past season has taught us that the first leg performance matters a lot and we will seek to start well and maintain a winning culture. Parting company with outstanding civilian players has been our major undoing in the past and this time round, we are keen to retain them.The management is aware of my plan to work with them and it is my hope they will keep them by all means,” he revealed. In the meantime, Omondi who disclosed that he had dropped his bid to muscle for the FKF Nairobi West branch seat, said his players who are in the service were training from their respective stations. While a handful of local coaches have regretted that the break would water down the fitness levels in their camps, Omondi said his boys had not been affected,  thanks to the nature of their official job. “After the government stopped sporting activities, all our players in the service were required to return to their job stations where they train from. Our job is not different from the others as we work eight hours a day and spare some time to train for the sake of our fitness levels. They are used to juggling between official duties and football since this has been the trend in the past seasons,” he said.
