More than 75 KRA officers who were arrested in May last year over bribery and tax evasion allegations want their case terminated. Their lawyers, led by Prof Tom Ojienda, told High Court judge Luka Kimaru that it is unfair to have pending charges for over one year. “DPP to direct endless investigations and rush the suspects in court without enough evidence is a violation of their rights,” the lawyer said. Lawyer George Kithi submitted that the case by DCI against the officers must be terminated because they were investigated by a body not authorised in law. He said corruption matters are investigated by the EACC, hence the DCI has no powers to probe such matters. In May last year, KRA had said 75 staff members were suspected of involvement in activities that undermined the institution’s mandate by abetting tax evasion and facilitating access to services through bribery and corruption. The 75 are suspected to have facilitated the irregular/fraudulent clearance of cargo, fraudulent amendment of tax returns to help taxpayers evade taxes and the irregular issuance of Tax Compliance Certificates. Of the 75 affected, 61 are from Domestic Taxes Department and the remaining 14 are from Customs and Border Control Department. To date, the officers have never been charged with any offence. Hearing continues on August 5. Edited by A.N
