When jobs are threatened, people, especially politicians, can attempt to do anything to survive. This was the case that House leaders Amos Kimunya (Majority) and John Mbadi (Minority) had when they attempted to remove a member from a once-ignored committee of the National Assembly.  The man said he better be left to serve in the said committee on grounds its chairman has made it vibrant. Corridors gather that the said committee did not have avenues for members’ fringes, which the creative current chairman has introduced. The chairman is said to be good at making vibrant, any committee that he joins.  Governor Mike Sonko caused laughter at the Senate’s County Public Accounts and Investments Committee (CPAIC) with his insistence that a lunch invite extended to his by chairman Senator Sam Ongeri must be accompanied by a beer. The governor, who got many asking what he was drinking from a bottle labeled ‘whisky’, said there would be no better lunch than one in a place where one can take some beer as they wait to be served. The flamboyant county boss even hinted he was ready to buy the lunch at his preferred location. It seems Suna East MP Junet Mohamed enjoys dressing down his peers at the plenary with his hard-hitting statements laced with a light touch.  The Minority whip has way of tearing into his colleagues’ space as he did to Kikuyu MP Kimani Ichung’wa when communicating how the latter was reduced from a powerful Budget committee to Parliament’s catering committee. Junet went on to remind Ichung’wa that it would be on him should there be a problem with Mandazi’s and tea served in Parliament. But the light comments, as some MPs were overheard complaining and asking the MP to be humble, appear to be rubbing those they don’t target the wrong way.
