Opening dates for learning Institutions will be communicated by the Education CS George Magoha, President Uhuru Kenyatta has said. During his 10th national address on the coronavirus pandemic on Monday, Uhuru said Magoha will call for a meeting with all education officials to discuss reopening dates. "The ministry will then communicate with parents and students on a way forward in regards to their studies," he said. Uhuru said any government institution, including all sporting facilities, stadia and educational institutions, upon designation by the Health CS as a public health facility, shall be availed to the ministry for isolation and quarantine purposes. CS Magoha had previously announced that schools will resume in 2021. Earlier this month, Magoha announced that primary and secondary schools will resume next year in January with a phased reopening of colleges and universities. Magoha said stakeholders have also shelved the reopening of candidates in 2021. The CS confirmed this year's school calendar has been declared null and void due to the coronavirus. Magoha said all students will remain in their current class in 2021. "In consultation with Ministry of Health we have agreed schools to reopen when daily Covid-19 cases reduce consistently for 14 days. Social and physical distancing is the most critical factor in ensuring safety of learners," the CS said. "Inter-county movement of students will cause severe challenges with high incidents of infections. We are happy to inform Kenyans that the president accepted the recommendations."
