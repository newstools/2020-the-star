A police officer in Meru is nursing injuries after he was allegedly cut by a Form 1 student. The cop attached to a Tigania East station was cut with a panga as he attempted to arrest the boy who had allegedly disagreed with his father and threatened to kill him. The boy reportedly ambushed the officer who raised alarm and called for reinforcement. Speaking shortly after the alleged offence, the boy denied wrongdoing. His father said, "My son has for the last three days been threatening to kill me. He insisted he was thirsty for blood and would cut off my head." When the police came and approached him, he cut his legs and tried to flee, he added. Chief Jeremiah Muriira confirmed that the boy has been a threat to his father. “The officer had orders to arrest the boy. He thought it was a minor case. The officer has been discharged from hospital," the administrator said. "It is a crime for a child to threaten his parents and unfortunately, true to his threat, he put the life of an officer in danger,” Muriira added. The chief appealed to parents to instil good morals to their children. The boy’s father complained about the boy's indiscipline and asked for deterrent punishment. “I don’t care if he is my son. Threatening to kill me is  unimaginable and also attacking an officer shows he should not be part of the community,” the father said. The names of the father and son have been concealed until the boy is arraigned. Edited by R.Wamochie
