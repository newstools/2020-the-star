Two commercial sex workers are among five people who have tested positive for coronavirus in Kisii. Also found positive is a hotel waiter, a matatu driver and market trader. The driver plies the Kisii-Nairobi route while the waiter works at a church-owned restaurant in the town. Authorities said the driver stays in Mwembe, a sprawling Kisii town suburb with more than 30,000 residents. The other patient was a from Marani in Kitutu Chache North constituency. The new infections add to the six others that had been confirmed in the county over the last two months. Kisii Governor James Ongwae said five of the patients have recovered. "With the discharge of the five, then it means we have six active cases, five being the new cases," Ongwae said. The sex workers are from Ogembo and operate at a bar Kisii town. They turned up for mass testing from where their samples returned positive, officials said. The waiter hails from Siaya county but works at an eatery in Kisii. Health officials said he stays in Daraja Mbili in Kitutu Chache North. Already, 22 contacts believed to had interacted with the patients are being sought, Kisii health director Richard Ongware said. "Our surveillance teams are already out looking for them. In fact, a few have already been traced," he said. Ongware said all of the five new cases have been isolated at the Kisii Teaching and Referral Hospital. "They have already begun treatment at our isolation wings. They are mainly asymptomatic and our hope is that they will be out soon," Ongware said. He asked hoteliers to take extra measures to stem infections in their eateries. "We also place alerts on clients to exercise social distancing and also maintain the regular washing of hands," Ongware said. Edited by P.O
