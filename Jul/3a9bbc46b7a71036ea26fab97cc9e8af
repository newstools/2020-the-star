Kenya Premier League side, Kisumu All Stars  are resigned to losing first choice goalkeeper Gad Mathews. Club chief executive officer, Nicholas Ochieng, confirmed that the 24-year-old Mathews’ six months contract has expired.  He joined the club on deadline day in the mid-season transfer and has been the first choice keeper. “It is a very tricky situation here but we will try and negotiate with him,” Ochieng said. According to sources, the former Kariobangi and Wazito FC goalkeeper has attracted interest from at least two Kenya Premier League clubs. Ochieng said: “We are in extraordinary times. We hope to keep the players we have until we play our play-off against Vihiga United when the committee formed by Sports CS Amina Mohamed decides on the fate of sporting activities. There is also a case in court  and we also have to wait for that. At the moment, we are in limbo.” Some clubs moved to the Sports Disputes Tribunal to challenge FKF's decision cancel the 2019-2020 season. “If the committee recommends the return to action and the FKF has their way at the tribunal, then the federation will give us three weeks to prepare for the play off,” added Ochieng. He, however, expressed confidence that all their players will stick with the club  until the season is concluded. The players, he added, have been training on their own in various parts of the country. “We want them to keep their fitness levels high so that if the league starts, we will be ready within the shortest time possible,” noted the CEO. Clubs in Europe were allowed to extend contracts of players which expired in June until the end of the season. Ochieng says this should also be implemented in Kenya.
