Hamisa Mobetto says she bought her new Prado with her own money, and that her baby daddy Diamond Platnumz did not contribute anything. Sharing the photo of the car on her Instagram page, Hamisa wrote, “I work hard right now. I have had like three sleepless weeks. I look sleepy. "I bought that Prado myself. I sold my old car and topped up to buy myself this Prado. I bought it with my own money, no one ever contributed to buying me the car. “If Diamond helped me, I wouldn’t refuse to acknowledge him.” This comes after Zari Hassan said Diamond topped up to help her purchase her new posh ride. Zari shared a photo on her Insta-story, posing next to a new Bentley with a caption, “Sante Baba T for the top-up.” Edited by T Jalio
