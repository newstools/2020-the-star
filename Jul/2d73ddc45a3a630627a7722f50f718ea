Singer Bahati has officially ditched the gospel industry. In an interview with MC Jessy on his new YouTube segment, Jessy Junction, Bahati made it clear that leaving the gospel industry doesn't mean his faith and belief in God have been compromised. "The Gospel is Christ. I have Christ in my heart and I believe in God and he is the reason I’m at the top. I cannot leave Christ but the gospel industry is rotten." Bahati told Jessy. He says for his peace of mind, leaving the industry was the best decision. "I was fought a lot in the gospel industry so when I do a gospel song, I do it for God, not for the people. I just separated myself from the gospel industry for a while, but I’m in Christ and the Lord is my personal saviour." Bahati said the audience for his secular music is just not people in the secular world but the very same church members who criticise him for his kind of music. "I think right now 'Wanani' is the most played song in the country, and it’s because ina-requestiwa both na watu wako secular na watu wako church because I’m still a son of Christ." Bahati, who has had a controversial year after having his label signees arrested, faced criticism after the song’s release. According to critics, his music this year does not befit the gospel music genre since it lacks spiritual content. Bahati has collaborated with secular musicians, among them the Kansoul in 'Kererembe'. A comment on YouTube reads, “Huyu ni yule Bahati aliimba ngoma ya ‘Barua’? Grace ya Mungu na content ni kweli huisha aki. Wacha niendelee kusikia 'Tuheshimu ndoa' ya Stivo Simple Boy, wasee.” Edited by T Jalio
