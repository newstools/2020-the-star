Kitui value addition specialist Temi Mutia has disclosed that the county has received mango flake orders in Europe. Temi said mangoes from the county which are believed to be the sweetest have been facing market challenges for years. In April, he started scaling up mango cooperatives which have since gained up to 3,000 members with over 80,000 mango trees. Temi urged all mango farmers to register to cooperatives as the county will focus more on solar drying the mangos to flakes. “We will not focus more on processing of mango juice but we will use sun dryers to make mango flakes, use the mango leaves to make health drinks, extract oil on the seed to make beauty products and fortification of yoghurt from outer parts of the mango,” Temi said. The first consignment of the export flakes will be shipped to Europe in March. Europe has a big market for the flakes which they import from India, Philippines and China. The only countries in Africa that export the flakes used to make breakfast cereals are South Africa [2,500 tonnes], Burkina Faso [1,900 tonnes], Ghana, [1,500 tonnes]. “The abroad market has ordered 500 tonnes from Kenya to test whether we can sustain their demand, from there on, we can produce as much as possible,” Temi said. Nzawa chief John Mathwa said his area is very dry and lauded farmers for venturing into mango farming. Mathwa urged those who have not registered to cooperatives to do so. He also urged farmers to offer jobs to over 500 youths who have been trained by the county government on management of the mango trees for increased yields across the county. John Kalikanda, a mango farmer in Nguutani who has 120 mango trees, said the ongoing training are helpful to farmers. He called upon farmers to plant more mango trees as they withstand harsh climatic conditions. “I urge fellow farmers to form cooperatives as it is easier to get better sales than as an individual since brokers have ruined the market prices,” Kalikanda said.
