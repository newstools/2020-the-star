Children at Shofco Kawangware last Sunday received 1,000 meals from Mama to the Rescue, an initiative supporting frontline workers and vulnerable communities. Through various partners, the organisers have been able to reach more than 15,448 health workers and communities across the country. Over 6.2 tonnes of hot meals have been served so far. The top priority is to support to the health workers to help curb the pandemic and not forget those impacted by the virus.
