Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe has said the number of coronavirus cases in Mombasa might surge in the coming weeks. The CS said the reopening of the economy by President Uhuru Kenyatta will attract more local and international tourists to the county, raising its risk for recording more cases. "Mombasa is a place where everybody in Nairobi and elsewhere has been waiting to visit as soon as the cessation of movement has been lifted," Kagwe said. "Hopefully, this will not mean that there is a surge of cases, but realistically we can almost imagine that this is likely to happen." The CS who was briefing the nation about the virus cases on Thursday from Mombasa said that the county should be prepared to handle the situation. "Mombasa must, therefore, raise the number of beds and so on so that it can be able to handle the increased cases. Kagwe has also asked governors to ensure that they have adequate staff manning their facilities and that all protocols are observed. Mombasa is the second county with the highest number of confirmed cases after Nairobi. The country recorded its highest figure on Thursday, with 447 positive cases in the last 24 hours. This pushed the number of positive cases to 8,975 out of 200,311 samples collected since the virus hit the nation on March 13. The CS has asked Kenyans to stay vigilant by observing the guidelines issued by the government to curb further spread.
