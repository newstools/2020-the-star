The national government has pumped an additional Sh100 million towards the completion of the Sh1.3 billion Riatirimba engineering plant in Masaba South, Kisii county. The funds will be used to construct classrooms and offices for lecturers, area MP Ezekiel Machogu said on Tuesday. Machogu said the institute would open its doors in January for student admissions. "With this allocation, we are optimistic that by the start of January the institute will be operational and allow the first batch of students to begin studies,‚Äù Machogu said. Engineering equipment worth Sh1.3 billion donated by the Chinese government have been lying unused at the unfinished complex for the last 10 years for lack of funds. Education CS George Magogha and Interior CS Fred Matiang'i separately visited the plant last year and promised to fast-track its opening. Mechanical spare parts will be produced at the plant once it is finished, he said. Machogu said the delays in opening the plant affected students from the locality who want to do engineering courses. "We want many of the students from the county and beyond to capitalise on this facility to acquire skills to enhance capacity in engineering works in our country," the legislator said. He urged residents to begin building rentals to accommodate students who will study there. On infrastructure, the MP told the contractor working on the Getengereirie-Ramasha-Kiomiti road to hasten up work to help residents access markets on time. Currently, only 3km of the 14km stretch have been tarmacked. Machogu said he was not satisfied with the slow pace of work by the contractor. "Let him hasten up. It would be good that is finished to start benefiting our people," Machogu. He said his office has so far disbursed more than Sh130 million in bursaries to needy students. Edited by Henry Makori
