Harambee Starlets’ utility player Ruth Ingosi is targeting a proper pre-season with FC Lakatamia as she seeks to work on her targets. Ingosi joined the Cyprus-based club early in the year and did not have the chance to properly train with her new team-mates. Their league was ongoing and the team had already played almost three quarters of their matches. The defensive midfielder played in only four matches but managed to score two goals as Lakatamia finished fifth in the 12-team league. With the team set to return to training next week ahead of September kick off, Ingosi reckons that a top two finish is their target if they are to guarantee themselves Europa League spot. On individual objectives, she wants to hit double figures as far as scoring goals is concerned. “We are all starting on the same footing and I believe pre-season will help me gel and understand my teammates better. There was no time to perfect on our rhythm when I joined but I now have the opportunity to steadily learn from the team,” said the 22-year old, who will be celebrating her 23rd birthday in November. “The quality, morale of the team and the effort we put in every time matters lot. We have what it takes to grab the runner up position and test ourselves in the coveted Europa League competition. I also want to lead the scoring charts and 10 goals won’t be a bad return in my full season,” said the former Eldoret Falcons player. Ingosi was part of the Starlets team that won the Cecafa women’s Challenge Trophy in Tanzania in December last year. She was instrumental in Starlets’ failed attemptto qualify for OlympicGames as David Ouma played her in the defence. Apolon Ladies won the Cyprus league and Ingosi wants to perfect on her speed to match the rigours of the league. “One area I definitely need to improve is speed. I also want my execution to be spot on,” she added. Ingosi is one of the many Kenyan players plying their trade overseas.
