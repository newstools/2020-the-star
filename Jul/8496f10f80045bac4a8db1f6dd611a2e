Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi on Friday urged Kenyans to wear masks and follow government directives to avert the spread of the coronavirus. He spoke when Health CS Mutahi Kagwe and other government officials visited Kilifi during their tours to assess county preparedness. Kilifi now has a total number of 71 Covid-19 cases - this puts it at at the number 10 position for counties with the highest numbers. The county has 61 recoveries since the first coronavirus case was recorded in the country. Kingi said, “Don’t wear a mask just because an official or an officer is watching you. We have to take measures into our own hands and stay safe so as end this virus. What is left is Kenyans to play their role." Kagwe said cases in the county are likely to keep rising as the country opens up as it is a tourist destination. He reminded Kingi of the time he was the first governor to contact him on how to handle the virus after Deputy Governor Gideon Saburi was confirmed to be among the first cases. This was after he travelled to Germany and did not self-quarantine upon his return. "I don't want to embarass you, but maybe one day you can tell people about your experience having self-quarantined," Kagwe said. Saubri came under fire for putting other at risk, however, he denied being aware he was positive. Kingi had to self-quarantine for 14 days having been in contact with Saburi. He tested negative. Kingi called for caution. “If you don’t want to get the virus, you will not walk around recklessly without staying safe by washing your hands with soap and water, sanitizing and wearing masks," he said. “We expect an influx of travelers into the county and each Kenyan must take responsibility for their own health."
