The US Agency for International Development (USAID) has announced Sh5 billion to support Kenya’s response and recovery efforts to meet the immediate and long-term challenges experienced since the coronavirus pandemic hit the country. While announcing the contribution on Wednesday, US Ambassador to Kenya Kyle McCarter said the US is keen to ensure that the resources get to the targeted communities. “The American people have always been generous to those in need around the world, and today Kenya is facing the compound challenges of Covid-19, flooding, and locusts," McCarter said. He added, "We are focusing on ensuring resources get to the counties and communities because Kenya’s communities are Kenya’s greatest asset in overcoming these challenges." In May, McCarter delivered 10 Toyota Hilux pickups to the Directorate of Criminal Investigations and the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission. The ambassador said the vehicles will help investigators from the two agencies combat corruption and drug trafficking. The donation was made by the United States Department of Defense US Africa Command (AFRICOM) in coordination with the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and US Homeland Security Investigations (HSI).
