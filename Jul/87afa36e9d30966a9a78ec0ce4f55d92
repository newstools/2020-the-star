Kenyans with diabetes have been advised to eat healthy food and keep their blood sugar at manageable levels. Health CAS Rashid Aman on Saturday said those with diabetes should stay at home and only go out when absolutely necessary. The CAS noted that of those who have succumbed to Covid-19, 15 per cent had diabetes as a comorbid condition. He added that diabetes and hypertension combined account for 47 per cent of Covid-19 deaths in those with comorbidities. Comorbidity is the presence of more than one disorder in the same person. “We have 500,000 Kenyans living with diabetes, it is to them and their loved ones that I am speaking to at this moment,” Aman said. The CAS said when people with diabetes become infected with Covid-19, they have a higher chance of experiencing serious complications and the outcome is usually devastating. The situation is worse in diabetics who do not manage their condition well. “Let us also emphasise that obesity also predisposes people to many ailments, diabetes included. Many patients with type 2 diabetes are obese and obesity is also a risk factor for severe infection,” he said. People with severe abdominal obesity, Aman said, have mechanical respiratory problems resulting in poor ventilation of the lungs thus increasing the risk of pneumonia. “With Covid-19, this combination of conditions can be deadly.”
