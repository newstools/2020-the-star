Unilever East Africa has donated personal hygiene products worth Sh500,000 to Mbagathi county hospital to help fight against the Covid-19 pandemic. The firm announced that it will focus its help on people safety, essential suppliers and community support during the handover ceremony at the Mbagathi hospital. “We hope that our consolidated donation of soap, sanitiser, bleach and food will make a significant contribution towards protecting people’s lives and cushioning the society against the ravages of this pandemic,” CEO Unilever E.A, Justin Apsey, said. Unilever’s employees earlier announced that they have collected another Sh460,000 to be used to purchase 178 care pack valued at Sh2000 each to be distributed to mothers in Mukuru slums who have lost their livelihoods and those with children living with albinism in Kibera and Kawangware. Each of the pack contain maize flour, wheat flour, cooking oil, rice, grains and soap. The employees estimate that each care park will last the affected families at least two weeks and the company said its actions are designed to help protect the livelihoods of its multiple stakeholders. This includes its consumers and communities, customers and suppliers, and its workforce under its quest to lead in creating a brighter future for all Kenyans. The hospital’s deputy medical superintendent, Keizah Nathan said that there was still short supply of personal protective equipments and therefore called upon more companies to step forward and help out in the fight by donating.
