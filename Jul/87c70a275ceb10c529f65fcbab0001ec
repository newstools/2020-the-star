A judge has ordered the forfeiture of properties worth millions of shillings purchased using NYS money. Anti-corruption court judge Mumbi Ngugi on Thursday held in favour of the Asset Recovery Agency (ARA) and directed the government to take over a house in Kasarani, a parcel of land in Ruiru and four Prados. The properties in question belong to Sam Mwandime, Susan Mndanyi, John Vandame, Anthony Gethi, Charity Wangui Gethi, John Ndungu, Paul Gachoka and James Kisingo. Granting the forfeiture order, the judge had this to say: “It is my finding, therefore, and I so hold that the assets the subject of this matter owned directly or indirectly by the respondents are proceeds of crime.” In the case, the eight did not oppose the forfeiture application by ARA despite being served with suit papers twice.
