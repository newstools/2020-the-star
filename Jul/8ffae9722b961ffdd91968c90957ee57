Everton must target maximum points from their three remaining home games this season to keep their European qualification hopes alive, manager Carlo Ancelotti said on Wednesday. Everton suffered their first loss since the restart to Tottenham Hotspur on Monday. Ancelotti said the focus is now on winning their home games as they look to secure a continental berth. “The game against Tottenham has gone. The key point (to reach Europe) will be to win our home games and then try to win at Wolves or Sheffield United,” Ancelotti told reporters in a virtual news conference. “We still have a chance to qualify for the Europa League ... it will be really important to win our three home games.” The Merseyside club’s last campaign in Europe was in the 2017-18 season when they were knocked out in the group stage of the Europa League.
