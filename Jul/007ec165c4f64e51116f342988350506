The Kenya Maritime Authority directo general George Okong’o has resigned. Okong’o, who was appointed to the seat on October 2018, was a retired Kenya Navy major who served for 20 years. On Wednesday, Maritime PS Nancy Karigithu confirmed that Okong’o has tendered his resignation. “Yes, he (Okong’o) wrote a resignation letter. KMA commercial shipping manager John Omingo is now serving in an acting capacity,” Karigithu said in a phone interview. However, the PS did not give a reason for Okong’o's resignation. Sources said Okong’o might have resigned following the controversy surrounding the construction of the Sh1.8 billion 15-storey KMA complex in Mbaraki. Okong’o took over the position from George Mc’Goye, who served in acting capacity after the exit of Karigithu in December 2015 to become PS. However, before his resignation, Okong’o extended the period on return of empty containers. This means cargo owners are now allowed seven days to return the empty containers for transit cargo during which there will be no penalties charged. For cargo bound to local destinations, the free period is three days. Okong’o, in a notice on July 3, said the directive took effect on July 1 and is valid until the Covid-19 pandemic challenges subside and a further directive is issued at an opportune time. “This means that cargo currently held at border posts will enjoy seven extra days free of demurrage penalties by shipping lines,” Okong’o said. He said under the prevailing Covid-19 circumstances, it is important that penalties associated with delay in cargo clearance and return of empty containers reflect the circumstances on the ground. He said KPA extended the free period for transit traffic and considerations are also underway for local traffic. “In an effort to have shipping lines, through their local ship agents, two consultative meetings were held by key stakeholders in the maritime industry,” Okong’o said.
