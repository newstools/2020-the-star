Yesterday Nairobi Senator Johnson Sakaja resigned as chairman of the Senate Covid-19 committee. He was arrested at 1am on Saturday morning drinking at a bar in Kilimani. He refused to leave so the police were forced to arrest him. He will appear in court today. Yesterday he apologised to Kenyans for breaking the curfew and said the law should take its course, even if it means him going to jail. Sakaja has done the honourable thing by resigning his chairmanship and apologising. For that, he should be commended. However his previous behaviour, and of many politicians, was unacceptable. Politicians seem to believe that they are not only above the rule of law but beyond the law of nature. They hold rallies in Western without masks and social distancing. They sit apart in the National Assembly but then cluster together without masks to chat. Politicians are drinking wine but preaching water. They should realise that no-one is immune â€“ look at Papa Shirandula. We are all at risk and, as our leaders, they should show us the way forward. Let the police discipline all politicians over Covid in future. Quote of the day: "The concept of whiteness could cover a multitude of sins."
