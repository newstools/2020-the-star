Two time All Africa Games champion Ben Jipcho is set to be buried this morning at his Kisawai home in Trans Nzoia County following his death last week after a long illness. Jipcho's son David Kwenden, said the body of the 1968 Olympic Games 1,500m silver medallist, left Moi Teaching  Referral Hospital (MTRH) yesterday afternoon and the funeral service will take place this morning before the burial. Kwenden said the two-time Commonwealth Games champion,  who was the family pillar has done a lot for the country in as far as athletics is concerned. “He was a great man and father. We depended on him for guidance and we feel his demise came too soon as we still needed him as a family,” added Kwenden. Jipcho, who won double gold at the 1974 Commonwealth Games in 5,000m and 3,000m steeplechase, will be remembered for pacing legendary Kipchoge Keino to gold medal in the 3,000m steeplechase at the 1968 Olympic Games, where he settled for silver. “Our father was respected worldwide and his demise is a blow to us. The fact that his demise is coming during this Covid-19 period means that he won't get a decent send off. With the flights set to resume tomorrow, It means his international friends who would have loved to attend his funeral will not manage to travel,"  added Kwende. Athletics Kenya (AK) western region chairman, Patrick Kipsang, said they have lost their main guide in as far as athletics in the region is concerned. “He was a great runner in the region. Despite leaving in Trans Nzoia, Jipcho came from Mt Elgon in Bungoma county— the hub of top-notch runners in the country,” said Kipsang.
