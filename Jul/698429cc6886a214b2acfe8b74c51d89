Comedian Njoro (George Maina), popular for his Churchill Show appearances, has been battling depression due to family and personal problems that left him suicidal. Speaking to Zeddy, who visited him at his home in Nakuru, Njoro said she was the first and only comedian to reach out to him. "Life has not been easy at all and I contemplated suicide three times, but all of them failed. That’s God’s plans," he said. His mother even thought he was dying. "Life has drained me mpaka nikaingia depression and it was bad. I’ve been on medication but things aren't good," he said. "My dad was diagnosed with stomach cancer. I have four kids to take care of, and I lost everything." Njoro came to the limelight after he featured on Churchill Show. He says his friends have disowned him and no longer call to check on him. "Last year in October, November and December was bad, and I did not post anything because I was in a bad state," he said. He recounted a day he almost committed suicide at Viewpoint, but God sent someone to rescue him. "I was saying my last prayer when a truck driver heard me. He put a towing rope on my car and after I was done with prayers. I was ready to die but the car wasn’t moving. He told me ‘hutafanya hio kitu’ and we attracted a crowd," he recounted. "The first suicide attempt, I took rat and rat and the second attempt, I bought dawa ya ng’ombe (a chemical used in cattle dips to clean animals)," he said. "Another time I tried chopping off my wrist, but they all didn’t work. I lost everything, friends, and that’s what triggered depression." He admitted that he stopped taking alcohol and would like to visit trained personnel in mental health to counsel him, and asked well-wishers to give him a job. "Sahii comedy is no. Kama kuna mtu ako na kazi, aniite ata kesho nitaanza," he said and attached his phone number: 0746 426336. Edited by T Jalio
