Kiss FM co-host Felix Odiwuor, popularly known as Jalang'o, has declared he will be on the ballot box in 2022. Speaking on Mpasho Live yesterday, Jalango said he will vie for Langata MP seat. "You are speaking to the MP of Langata," he said. "There are only three years to go and I will be the MP," he said. Jalang'o is currently pursuing an undergraduate degree in Community Development at Daystar University. He was set to graduate this year. He says he enrolled for the course to help him understand how to manage and interact with his constituents once elected. "There is very little you can do to society if you are not influential. I want to go and make a difference in Langata and make them great again," he said. “I choose community development because as MP for Lang’ata constituency, I have to be able to take care of community matters." He said he wants to join politics because he is tired of crying for change yet he could make the change himself. ''It is hard for a common 'Mwananchi' to bring that change we are all looking for but not for a politician. It is easy to bring that change if you are in politics and not out," he said. Jalango is working alongside Kamene Goro on Kiss FM every weekday morning from 6am to 10am. "East or West, Home is Best. Kiss Family, help us welcome," Kiss FM posted on Instagram. Jalang'o has been a radio presenter for years and has even worked with Caroline Mutoko when she was a Kiss FM presenter. "Things have really changed as there was no social media back in the day. Kamene and I are now blending in with the young and the elderly. I mean, it's about the listeners," he said. On how much he is paid, he said he has not signed the contract, and for him, it's not about money but the passion he had for working with Kiss FM. He also said he wants to own his own media company, and he has already started Jalang’o TV on YouTube.
