Gender CS Margaret Kobia has lauded President Uhuru Kenyatta for addressing the plight of gender-based violence victims. Uhuru directed the National Crime Research Centre to move swiftly and investigate increasing cases of gender based violence and teenage pregnancy. The Head of State on Monday said his administration is concerned by increasing tension within homes across the country. "I applaud the President for capturing the big picture regarding GBV and the rising cases of adolescent pregnancy as an attack to the institution of family," she said. "The directive for the National Crime Research Centre to study the root causes and provide advisory solutions is good news to all those working toward an equal inclusive society." Last month, the Education ministry dismissed alarming figures of teenage pregnancies in the country released by the Childrenâ€™s Department Technical Working Group during the celebrations of the Day of the African Child. The report was released by Machakos children's officer Salome Muthama, indicating that 3,800 girls over 15 years and 200 others under 14 years became pregnant between January and May. The report escalated a debate across the country, prompting Education CS George Magoha to intervene and cast doubt on the numbers. The gender-based violence hotline launched on April 15 had received 289 cases as of May 3 and is an intervention in response to the increasing number of gender violence cases in the country.
