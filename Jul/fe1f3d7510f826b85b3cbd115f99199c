Activists rally each year on July 7, marking the date in 1990 when opponents of late president Daniel Arap Moi launched a bid to open up multiparty politics. The protest is called “Saba Saba” - “seven seven” in Swahili - because of the date. This year, protesters have been galvanised by mounting accusations of police brutality during the coronavirus lockdown.
