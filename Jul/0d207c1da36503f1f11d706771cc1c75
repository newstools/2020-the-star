A 57-year-old farmer has been arrested for allegedly defiling a five-year-old girl in Kathiani subcounty in Machakos on Thursday evening. Kula Muindi was arrested that evening after the victim’s mother reported the matter to police. Area chief David Ngunzu said the suspect had gone to cut Napier grass on his farm when he encountered the five-year-old girl and her three older sisters. He gave the older girls his phone to watch videos and took the youngest girl to his farm, Ngunzu said. “When the girls noticed their sister was missing they began to search for her and found the suspect with her in the act. They threw his phone at him and ran home,” the chief said. The girls’ mother had gone to the market. “When she came back home she found the girl crying and that’s when the sisters narrated what had happened,” Ngunzu said. The girl was taken to a healthcare center where it was confirmed that she had been defiled. Kathiani deputy county commissioner Kennedy Nyamboga said the suspect is being held at Mitamboni police station while officers investigate. A few days ago an assistant chief from Masii in Mwala subcounty was also arrested for defiling a Class 8 pupil in Machakos. (Edited by V. Graham)
