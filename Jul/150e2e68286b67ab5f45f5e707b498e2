President Uhuru Kenyatta on Tuesday sent a message of condolence to the family and associates of businessman and author John Murenga. Murenga, a former civil servant and the chairman of Chancery Wright Insurance Brokers, passed away on Tuesday morning. He has left behind a wife, Mrs Magda Murenga, four children, t10 grandchildren and one great grandson. In his message to the family, Uhuru described the deceased as a distinguished public servant who made a successful transition from the civil service to the private sector where he has been a huge inspiration to upcoming entrepreneurs. "Mr Murenga leaves behind a huge legacy of success in both the public and the private sector, a feat that's not easy to accomplish," Uhuru said. The Head of State eulogised Murenga as a mentor to many successful businessmen in the country and singled out his book, Destined to Leave A Legacy, as an invaluable resource that will continue to inspire future generations. The deceased is an alumnus of Nyeri High School, Makerere University and Oxford University. Uhuru wished the family God's comfort as they mourn their departed patriarch. At Makerere University, Murenga was a student of former President Mwai Kibaki and the two later became close business associates. On his part, Kibaki eulogised Murenga as a single-minded individual whose pursuit for excellence in whatever he set his sight upon yielded remarkable outcomes. "He abhorred ostentation and self- congratulation. Because of the content of his character and unique personal preferences, not many of his otherwise exceptional exploits were readily acknowledged outside the immediate circle of close associates," Kibaki said in a statement. "Yet John's is a legacy bedecked with enviable triumphs. To his name are countless proteges who drew inspiration from his zeal to excel."
