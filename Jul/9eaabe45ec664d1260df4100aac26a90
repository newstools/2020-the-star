Sleuths from the DCI have arrested two suspects in Eldoret in possession of explosives devices, detonators, detonating cords, safety fuses and boosters. The operation was carried out on Saturday by Anti-Terrorism Police Unit (ATPU) and the Special Services Unit (SSU) in Chepkatet village, in Kapseret Sub-County. The two suspects Mohamed Ahmed Bisher (59) and a foreign national Nasanga Ibrahim (68) were arrested during the raid and are in police custody. The two will be arraigned once the investigation is completed. As similar operation was carried out early this year in Eastleigh, Nairobi where 43 terror suspects were arrested. President Uhuru Kenyatta had directed authorities to crack down on terrorist activities. On January 17, while addressing the Annual National Security Review and Planning Conference in Mombasa, Uhuru ordered police to mount operations to flush out terrorist operatives and all sleeper-cells.
