Despite battling partial blindness,former AFC Leopards’ skipper Martin Imbalambala says he is far from hanging his boots. The towering midfielder opened up on his ambition to return to the pitch should he fully regain his eyesight after meeting top brass sports officials drawn from the county government of Vihiga. “My time to hang boots was not yet. I am appealing for help to regain my eyesight. I miss going back to the field as I used to before the unforeseen happened,” he said. The Vihiga County acting chief officer Dominic Luvavo, who was appointed following the suspension of Agava Makhumbili over gross misconduct, pledged to support the ailing midfielder. “We want to come up with a permanent solution to see Imbalambala back on the field. I think that will be the best thing we can do for now,” he said Imbalambala lost his eyesight two years ago while training with Bidco United in Thika but he has since returned to his village in Sabatia Sub-county in Vihiga. “I lost my sight on September 12, 2018 and from then up to now life has been unbearable.  “ It has now turned me into a beggar and  I can’t believe it. Things are getting out of hand as I have been unable to meet my monthly check-up costs Sh4,000. During my active days, I was self-reliant and my family depended on me. I need help,” said a tearful Imbalambala. Luvavo said all the hospital expenses for the player will be catered for in a bid to ensure he gets back to playing football. He thanked sponsors and well-wishers who have rose to the occasion to help the player and urged more well-wishers to stand with Imbalambala on his road to full recovery
