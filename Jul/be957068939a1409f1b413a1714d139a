Popular actor Maina wa Ndungu says just like any other business, Covid-19 has been a blow to the film industry. Speaking to Word Is on Monday, Maina said it has hit the film industry in a bad way. "Our industry involves big numbers of cast and crew," he said. "So the moment Covid came then curfew followed, that's where my fellow artistic family more or less lost their jobs. Most people's sources of income has been affected greatly by Covid." The actor is currently making moves on local dramas like 'Kina' and 'Nganya' on Maisha Magic Plus and Maisha Magic East respectively. "In 'Kina', I play as Ezzy, although I have another film that I did last year that is yet to be released, which is also a good highlight." But what does he think of the film industry? "The Kenyan industry is still a sleeping baby who is about to wake up. Although the last couple of years, there have been some progressive changes," Maina said. "I really feel if all stakeholders can adhere to all the implementations, it would be better than it is." He hopes to feature in a  Hollywood blockbuster movie, but first wants to completely win the hearts of people at home. "I need to conquer Africa and do collaborations with other  African countries . The African film market is still untapped and has a bigger potential for growth." Maina urged filmmakers in Kenya and Africa to work together. "This industry is big enough for all for us to make a living from it." Despite the pandemic, Maina has described the rest of the year to be a busy one for him. Maina is the 2020 AMVCA student winner for the film 'Promises' and East African best film winner in the project 'Plan B'.
