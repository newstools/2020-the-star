Nigerian artiste Chike has released the third single Nakupenda, featuring Ric Hassani. “To be loved is a great thing. If you meet the right person, shoot your shot, do not hesitate to tell them Nakupenda. Love is expressive and it’s imperative to serenade the one you love at all times.” The track marks another milestone for Chike whose album Boo of the Booless has garnered more than 20 million streams globally since it was released earlier this year. The single is from Boo of the Booless released on Valentine’s Day. Nakupenda is about a top client who plays out a fashion film as he fights for the love of a top model against Ric Hassani, a noted photographer.
