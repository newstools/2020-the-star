A man suspected to be involved in the murder of a woman found dead outside a Kilimani apartment block will remain in custody until the conclusion of investigations. Sheila Njeri Muruge was found dead near a flower bed on July 17 after a night of partying. Milimani senior principal magistrate Kennedy Cheruiyot on Thursday allowed detectives to continue holding Shem Lwanga'ula Ng'eno until Monday to complete investigations. Ng'eno's co-suspects Christine Awour and Claire Chepkoech were freed on Sh100,000 bail each. Their lawyer, Cliff Ombeta, told the court that the two were unwell and that detaining them at a police station would expose them to Covid-19 as the police do not have masks for suspects. Cheruiyot directed them to report to the Kilimani DCI office daily until Monday when the case will be mentioned. Senior state counsel Kennedy Panyako had asked the court to allow detectives to continue holding them for five more days to complete investigations. The trio was arrested on July 17, 2020, at Santonio Courts. Corporal John Mmasi said Murageâ€™s body was lying near a flower bed and had injuries on the back and bruises on the waist. Blood oozed from the nose. Her clothes were torn. Police preliminary investigations showed that the deceased and some people, the suspects included, had been drinking and having fun in Chepkoech's house - No B03. The suspects gave contradicting statements when questioned on Murage's whereabouts, the Mmasi said. The victim's body is awaiting a postmortem examination to establish what killed her. The suspects were detained on Monday pending investigations. Their case will be mentioned on July 27.  - mwaniki fm
