The Africa Concours d’Elegance show earlier scheduled for September this has been postponed by one year due to the current Covid-19 crisis. The organisers of the classiest event said the throngs of spectators who throng the venue to witness the show makes social distancing difficult hence the health limitations make it impossible to have it this year. Accordingly, the Alfa Romeo Owners Club anticipates the postponed event will most likely be listed for September 26, next year. The lack of the Concours this year is bad news for the competitors and their helpers who have already spent money and many months preparing their magnificent cars and bikes. The disappointment will be felt beyond Kenya’s borders as 24 Ugandans had  already submitted entries. This year’s event would have marked the 50th anniversary for Concours and an opportunity for owners of well kept machines to showcase them at the Nairobi Racecourse.
