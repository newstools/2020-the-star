A 35 year-old man was killed by a mob in Rangwe constituency after he hacked his younger brother to death on Saturday. Joel Oriko was killed by residents of Kangire village after it was reported he killed Rodgers Oriko, 26, on Friday. The siblings are reported to have been embroiled in a domestic feud. Chief Daniel Nyakolo said the two brothers disagreed on Friday night. Joel used a panga to hack his brother to death. “Rodgers was rushed to Homa Bay Referral Hospital after he sustained serious cuts to the head but died at the hospital,” Nyakolo said. On Saturday, information about Rodgers' death angered residents who started looking for Joel, but he had already fled. He is said to have disappeared into Kodera Forest after word that residents were after him. “The irate mob found him in the forest with some cattle. They killed him with crude weapons,” Nyakolo said. He died on the spot. Rangwe police commander Jane Sang said it was wrong for the residents to take the law into their own hands. She said investigations were underway and police would arrest residents found culpable. “Let people arrest suspects and report to police for investigations. Killing suspects interferes with investigations,” Sang said. Joel’s body was taken to Rachuonyo South Subcounty Hospital mortuary in Oyugis. Edited by R.Wamochie
