Greensharks captain Victor Osiche has called on the Kenya Hockey Union to counsel players before making any decision in regards to return to action. The coronavirus pandemic has led to loss of jobs and most players are suffering from mental trauma and with the uncertainty surrounding sporting activities, Osiche said mental nourishment will help players adjust to the new normal. “The pandemic has been disastrous with job losses tough to bear. Through the team managers, most affected players can be identified and put in a session to help them cope with life," said Osiche. "Mental issues is very common occasioned by the global crisis. Players look drained and it’s always hard to control a player who is bitter or who is not comfortable in life.” At the same time, the maverick forward said any decision taken by the union as far as the season is concerned will be welcome. KHU had earlier said teams will be put into pools and play up to the finals or alternatively play tournaments to keep players fresh. Osiche said whatever the scenario, the players are just keen to return to action. “Pools are possible because we’ve done it before and it won’t be a big deal.  At the end of the day, KHU has the final say and we will abide by any decision they will take. It’s better if all government directives are followed to the letter  but if other countries have returned to action why not us? asked Osiche, who guided Sharks to a fourth-place finish last season. He also said three weeks will be enough for players to train should action resume. The KHU league was suspended the moment the first case coronavirus  was reported in Kenya in March.
