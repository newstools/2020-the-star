About 150 children in Kwale county have been rescued from sexual abuse since the coronavirus pandemic was reported in Kenya, Kesho Kenya has said. Director Evans Odhiambo said cases of child exploitation have become common in Matuga and Msambweni subcounties. “We have managed to save quite a number of young people enrolled into commercial sex in Diani and the rest of the Coastal beaches along the Matuga belt,” Odhiambo said. He said the closure of learning institutions and cancellation of international flights due to Covid-19 had exposed many school children to commercial sex locally. Over 18 cases of defilement were recorded between May and June in Kwale, according to police statistics. Odhiambo said parental negligence and higher levels of poverty caused by the pandemic have facilitated the vice. He spoke to the media on Saturday in Ukunda. He said the two problems are of great influence in recruiting children to sexual exploitation. The officer said some of the rescued children are already exposed to various diseases. “We realised that there are some of the minors who have developed health complications putting their lives at risk,” he said. The activists said they are working in close relationship with the Health ministry to ensure the children get safe recovery and get back to school as well as lead a normal life with the rest of the society. Matuga children’s officer Jonston Kivuli said the defilement reports are alarming in Kwale advising parents to be very protective.
