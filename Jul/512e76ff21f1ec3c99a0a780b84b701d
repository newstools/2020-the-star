Retired extrovert pro Athanus Nzau is calling on boxers to consider joining paid ranks while still young and energetic. He reckons that turning pro at an early age enables pugilists to fight more competitively thereby realising their protential in the bare- chested game when they have the energy to do so. Nzau said many boxers turn pro as late as past 35 years while the reality is that you can never make it unless a miracle happens. “The best age to turn professional is between 19 to 22. I honestly believe we waste so much time in amateur ranks because we lack good promoters. Professionally, good trainers and managers guide boxers to the next level.” Nzau went on: “I always believe that if I get a promoter to work with and get fighters who are dedicated to work with, I’m sure I can produce a champion of the world because I know what pro boxing is all about and what it takes.” He added that boxers need to be encouraged to turn pro when still young, just like in South Africa, UK and United States. “They can chose to start boxing and go directly to pro since not all can fit into national team.” Meanwhile, the National Olympic Committee of Kenya (NOC-K) Elite performance team held a session with Tokyo-bound National boxing team at BFK offices in Rehema House, Nairobi. Present during the session were the boxers who have qualified for Tokyo Olympic Games Christine Ongare, Commander Nick Okoth, head Musa Benjamin, deputy head coach Dave Munuhe, coach Waweru and Geoffrey Kimani who was the facilitator.
