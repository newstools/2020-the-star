The East Africa Business Council has endorsed the nomination of Amina Mohammed, for the World Trade Organisation’s (WTO) Director-General position. “Ambassador Amina Mohamed joining the WTO will be timely as Africa is keenly focusing on the African Free Trade Area (AfCFTA),” EABC said in a statement. It said the sports Cabinet Secretary is a strong advocate for the actualisation of the AfCFTA and has also chaired the WTO’s 10th Ministerial Conference held in Nairobi in 2015, the Dispute Settlement Body and the WTO’s General Council in 2005. EABC said her passion for international trade, exemplary strategic leadership, diplomatic and negotiation skills makes her the right candidate. The council said Mohamed's success to the position will be a great opportunity for the EAC bloc and Africa towards championing global economic policy to increase the continent’s share in global trade. “The business community in East Africa is assured that Mohamed will steer the WTO to greater heights and it will be an honour for the continent to have the first African and first woman as the Director-General of the WTO,” said the Executive Director Peter Mathuki. He said Mohamed will ably push for the full implementation of the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement which will reduce trade transaction costs for businesses, by cutting red tape, simplifying and streamlining customs procedures for exports and imports. The WTO is mandated to administer trade agreements, trade negotiations, settling trade disputes, reviewing national trade policies, building the trade capacity of developing economies and cooperating with other international organisations. Africa’s active and strategic participation in the negotiations at WTO is vital to unlock the economic potential of the continent and increase access to international markets.
