Health worker unions have called on the government to implement the reopening of the economy in phases, with a priority given to health training and other tertiary institutions. They however want reopening of primary and secondary schools put on hold until the number of Covid-19 cases steadily decline. They further want reopening of churches put on hold. Speaking on Wednesday, the unions said reopening of the economy in phases will enable the country to beef up its capacity to handle a surge in cases. The unions represented include the Kenya National Union of Nurses, Kenya Union of Clinical Officers, Kenya Health Professionals Society, Kenya National Union of Medical Laboratory Officers, Kenya National Union of Pharmaceutical Technicians and Kenya Union of Nutritionists and Dietitians. On Sunday, Health CAS Mercy Mwangangi said health workers will be paid their allowances. "We are happy to note that funds are available and health care workers will be paid and it is a process that should be happening going forward," Mwangangi said. She urged county governments to continue supporting healthcare workers who are working to ensure this virus is stamped out. She also stated that counties need to bear responsibility to ensure the country combats the coronavirus. "We expect county governments to enhance testing capacity and surveillance andÂ  deploy rapid response teams and health facilities need to be readied," the CAS said.
