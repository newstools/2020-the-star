Mombasa businessman Said Abdalla, alias Saido, has urged Kenyans to turn to God for help amid the coronavirus pandemic. Speaking at Uwanja wa Mbuzi on Saturday, Saido said the country needs God now more than ever. “It is high time we all do some soul-searching and mend our wicked ways. We need to turn back to God,” Saido said. He spoke after distributing thermoguns, sanitiser and masks to religious leaders in Nyali subcounty. Kenya Muslim National Advisory Council chair Sheikh Juma Ngao praised the government for reopening churches and mosques. Sheikh Ngao said prayers are stronger when faithful pray together than when they do so individually. “That is why I thank President Uhuru Kenyatta for hearing our cry and ensuring that mosques and churches are reopened, although under very strict guidelines,” he said. Saido said it is unfortunate that some Kenyans still doubt there is Covid-19 and act recklessly. “This disease is real. Take it seriously. You may not be showing any signs but you may have contracted it. Better safe than sorry.” So far, Saido has distributed more than 500 thermoguns to different churches and mosques in Nyali. He said he will distribute more once he gets funds from his friends and his Saido Foundation. Bishop Karisa Charo urged the government to provide thermoguns, masks and sanitiser to all places of worship. “We cannot be allowing individuals like Saido, who have big hearts to bear the burden of their people. The government has been receiving grants for Covid-19. Let us see the funds at work,” the cleric said. Charo said Covid-19 may be a punishment from God because people have turned their backs on Him. “The Bible says there will be the seven plagues. Recently, we witnessed the locusts then Covid-19. God could be talking to us. We need to listen and turn back to Him,” he said.
