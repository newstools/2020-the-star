Health CAS Rashid Aman has acknowledged that there are laboratories approved for testing coronovirus that could be producing false results. Speaking on Wednesday during the daily Covid-19 press briefing, Aman said the ministry is aware of these claims and is organising a re-evaluation for the adversely mentioned labs. "A wrong result in a disease like this can create a lot of anguish," he said. Affected labs are said to face the law if found guilty of negligence. According to the CAS, the accuracy of a test result can be affected by the sample transportation, lab processing or the period of storage. "...You could lose the RNA in the processing. Also, the longer you keep a sample, the viability goes down and the chances of being able to pick up that nucleic acid also goes down," he said. Samples remain viable for a true result for about two to three weeks if they are properly stored in the right medium and are kept frozen fright from the field, Aman said. A cold chain has to be maintained for both samples and reagents. Further, he said a failed result could also be a result of a system error in terms of instruments used, sensitivities or control. However, Aman said the government has come up with a way to ensure that tests can be reproduced across different labs. He said a process of review has been set up to validate the tests. "To ensure that labs are producing the right results we have a quality assurance protocol where we send samples to these labs from time to time just to check and see if they are doing the right thing," he said. Currently, the country has testing capacity in 28 facilities across counties.
