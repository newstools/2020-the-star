Women and girls in Samburu, Marsabit and Moyale counties are set to receive sanitary towels for free for the next three months. This is courtesy of Amref Health Africa and FGM2STEM in partnership withÂ  Heels4Pads. The flagging off took place at Amref Health Africa offices in Nairobi. Sanitary towels remain a critical challenge for many young girls in Kenya due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The groups will also be holding a 30-minute session with the girls to educate them on FGM and early pregnancies.
