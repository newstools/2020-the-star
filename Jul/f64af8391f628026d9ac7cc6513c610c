Flair by Betty beauty parlour owner Betty Kyallo took to Instagram on Thursday to clarify she is in Kenya after Kenyans on Twitter (KOT) suggested she might be in Dubai. This was after it was reported Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho and Suna East MP Junet Mohamed travelled to Dubai to see ODM leader Raila Odinga, who is recovering from surgery done on his back. In one of the photos of Joho and Junet on a private jet, Kenyans on Twitter were quick to notice a handbag on the ground and started - albeit wrongly - to link Kyallo to it. Kyallo has previously been linked to the governor and in an interview with lifestyle magazine True Love in 2017, she admitted to having dated the county chief, but said things did not work out because she was career driven and he was looking for a stay-at-home partner. At the time, she said, "We had a culture and religious clash. I also wanted to be a strong woman. I wanted to make something for myself and my daughter. I wanted to start a business because I am young and energetic. But he wanted someone who was chilled. There was a conversation of me quitting my career and just staying at home. We did not see eye to eye on this. It was devastating.” Kyallo on Thursday took to Twitter to say, “Hey guys. I hear I’m in Dubai. I’m not in Dubai. I’m actually going to get some delicious nyama choma." Kyallo recently launched the new location of her beauty parlour in Kilimani with Raila's wife Ida Odinga being the chief guest. She quit K24 in May, citing lack of appreciation.
