Tennis Kenya have named a 17-man task force to draft modalities geared towards their return to action plan. The task force is expected to carry out risk assessment of current Covid-19 situation. Areas of interest will include development of health and safety guidelines;  propose timelines  as well as ensure compliance measures are in place. The committee  includes TK president James Kenani, vice presidents Francis Mutuku, Phillip Ilako, secretary general Wanjiru Karani, and treasurer Rose Wanjala. Others are club representative Peter Njuguna, officiating commission chair Patrick Kamuhia, coaches’ representative Joe Karanja, coaches’ commission chair Francis Rogoi, national coach Carol Oduor, Junior Tennis coordinator Veronica Osogo, schools-cum-institution representative Peter Wachira,  county representative Nickson Wekesa, wheelchair representative Martha Tirop, secretariat’s Nancy Nduku and Ministry of Health representative Erastus Karani. Karani said they are awaiting word from the government on when they can resume activities. “We hope the government can give us the greenlight to resume tennis in the country due to the fact that we are a non-contact sport and we are following the protocols set by both government and the ITF. We hope we can resume soon,” said Karani. “The task force, I believe, will come up with good plans for the resumption of tennis in a safe and controlled environment with all protocols being observed,” added Karani. Last week, Health Chief Administrative Secretary Rashid Aman had hinted on  resumption of non-contact sports but no timelines were issued. Sports Cabinet Secretary, Amina Mohamed, had last month formed a committee to chart a path for the resumption of sports but they are yet to give any recommendations. The government suspended all sporting activities in March following the first case of Covid-19 in the country.
