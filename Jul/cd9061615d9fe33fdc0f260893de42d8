Nominated Senator Naomi Shiyonga has been elected unopposed as the chairperson of the Kenya Women Senators Association (Kewosa). The ODM lawmaker takes over from Jubilee's Mary Seneta who resigned from the position on Wednesday morning. Senator Christine Zawadi (Jubilee) will deputise Shiyonga in the association. It was not immediately known why Seneta resigned but sources in the association said "she made Kewosa dormant". Senata is among the five senators who faced the Jubilee disciplinary Committee for snubbing President Uhuru's Kenyatta's meeting at State House in May. The Jubilee senator earlier this month was also involved in a physical confrontation with Senator Beatrice Kwamboka and Mary Seneta during a committee election. Shiyonga told the Star that she will immediately convene a meeting of the 21-member Kewosa to receive proposals from the members on how the association can come up to life. "We will get the views of everyone. We have been a bit dormant but now we are coming back. We want to support Bills sponsored by our members in the senate and we also have programmes on GBV" she said.
