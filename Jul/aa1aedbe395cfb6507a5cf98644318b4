Top flight club chairmen have voted in the quintet of Dan Shikanda, Robert Maoga, Daniel Aduda, Erick Oloo and Ken Ochieng to oversee the transitioning of the competition from the Kenyan Premier League management to the Football Kenya Federation (FKF) Premier League. The five serve as AFC Leopards, Kariobangi Sharks, Tusker, Ulinzi Stars and Zoo FC club chairmen respectively. The five will be tasked with advising the federation on the way forward as the KPL mandate is set to expire in September. The five were endorsed by ten clubs out the 17 in a virtual meeting attended by 16 KPL chairmen alongside FKF President Nick Mwendwa. Mathare United chairman Bob Munro, Homeboyz’s Cleophas Shimanyula, Nzoia’s Evance Kadenge, Bandari’s Edward Oduor and a Wazito representative who stood in for Ricardo Badoer voted against the five.  Sofapaka’s Elly Kalekwa did not honour the invitation.
