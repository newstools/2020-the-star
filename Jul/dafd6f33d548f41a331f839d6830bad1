Kenyans are waiting with bated breath for President Uhuru Kenyatta's announcement as the extra 30-day Covid-19 restrictions end today. Opinion is divided on whether the national curfew and the restriction on movement into and out of Nairobi, Mombasa and Mandera should be lifted. On one hand, the pandemic is choking the economy and is slowly driving it towards recession. Lost jobs, shattered dreams, broken families and uncertainty in the education sector are just some of its casualties. On the other hand, the lives of millions remain at risk as the pandemic continues to spread unabated. As at Sunday, the number of infections stood at 7,886 with deaths rising to 160. Though Kenya's fatality rate averages two percent and is still below the global average of 6.5 percent, there is reason for concern. Our health sector cannot cope with a surge in infections, which will definitely lead to increased deaths. There has been limited observance of curfew hours, travel restrictions and prevention measures, raising the question whether the public can self-police if left to go about their daily business. Definitely No! This, therefore, calls for a balance between opening the economy and  containing the spread of Covid-19 for without lives there will be no one  searching for a livelihood.
