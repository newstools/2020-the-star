The Vihiga administration has been urged to carry out more testing to get a true picture of the coronavirus situation in the county. County commissioner Ochillo Oyugi said it would be unwise to assume residents are safe yet numbers are rising across the country. He said the virus could be spreading in the countryside as more people move from urban to rural areas. The number of cases in Chavakali is rising as well as in Cheptul market, Kaimosi, Mago, Mbale, Luanda and Majengo. Most residents no longer observe the coronavirus regulations. “We need to have some order and responsibility among ourselves to curb this pandemic,” Oyugi said. He spoke at his office on Thursday after he received a donation from Equity Bank. “What we have received as a county we will utilise it for the intended purpose, that is fighting the Covid-19 pandemic,” Oyugi said. "If that is not done then we will have failed as a county and we will have failed the Equity Bank Foundation." Oyugi urged other financial institutions to come on board and help the state fight the pandemic. “We need to join hands in this fight. The government alone can’t win this war,” he said. Oyugi said Kenya is likely to start recording 1,000 cases a day going by the current trajectory. The country recorded 796 cases on Thursday, the highest number so far since the first case was confirmed in mid-March. The nationwide caseload stood at 15,601 as at Friday morning, with  7,135 recoveries and 263 deaths. Edited by Josephine M. Mayuya
