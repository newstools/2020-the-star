Safaricom has discontinued its Platinum package for an 'All in One bundle'. In a statement on Wednesday, Safaricom said the all in one bundle or the Karibu Postpay plan will offer more voice and data with no expiry. "The customers under this category will be migrated by August 30 to the postpay plan,"the telco said. Those who have auto renew services will be upgraded to the plan while customers who purchase the Platinum plans on a one off basis can select on the plans available on mysafaricom app. "This can also be done by dialing *544# and selecting option three, normal data with expiry, then option one 'All In One' bundle," it said. "All affected customers can choose from alternative Safaricom services that suit their needs." In early 2018, SafaricomÂ introduced the Platinum plan, a product that focused on people on the go without worrying about depleting their units. It came in two packages: Basic and Plus. The latter is equipped with additional units (data, voice, and SMS). The product was probably preferred by the business community because it also offered international minutes.
