A man was found dead along a road on Thursday at Nyakenyomisia in Nyamira. The body of George Nyarangi Maina, which was spotted by passers-by, had serious injuries. County commissioner Amos Mariba said the motive for the murder was yet to be established but police had launched investigations. "We cannot clearly establish the motive of the murder but we suspect the incident might have taken place in the night of [July] 15 and the body dumped at the scene by unknown assailants," he said. Maina's family said he was last seen at 2pm on Wednesday. Residents are worried about their security and have urged police to increase patrols. Edited by Josephine M. Mayuya
