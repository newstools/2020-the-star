Several Shabana players have asked the National Super League side to release them. According to sources, up to three quarters of the team want out of the struggling former giants. National Division One side Gusii FC who are under the tutelage of former Shabana chairman, Paul Mayieko, are eyeing at least three players from Shabana. Team manager, Jared Sani, confirmed that some players have indeed asked for release letters. “Some players have approached me asking to be released. They want to join other teams ahead of next season and it’s a very tricky situation for us,” Sani said. He added: “We went through a lot of challenges last season but I want to thank the management and fans because they ensured that we honoured all matches.” He said most of the players have been training on their own while six are stuck at the club house after travel restrictions were put in place to curb the spread of coronavirus. However, following the lifting of the restrictions, they  are expected to  leave for their  respective homes. “We are waiting for the committee formed by Sports Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohammed to recommend on resumption of sports activities so that we start our preparations for next season. Right now, we can’t do anything,” he added. Shabana’s ardent supporter Wesley Mokua says that the club should work on keeping key players. “For the last three seasons, we have been assembling a team few days to league kick off. We have never had a proper pre-season. The management should address this issue,” said Mokua. Shabana legends led by Peter Kamau recently indicated that they are willing to help restore the club’s lost glory. They want the club to put structures in place and have proper management. Club vice chairman, Nyandoro Kambi, said a meeting of stakeholders will be held before the beginning of the season to chart the way forward for the club.
