A 24-year-old man was on Monday evening lynched by an angry mob for raping a woman in Matondoni village, Lamu West. Armed with a panga and threatening to cut off her head, Nyanje Charo is said to have forced the 26-year-old woman from her house at around 8pm into a bush where he raped her. The woman, however, raised the alarm before neighbours rushed to rescue her and lynched the man on the spot. Neighbours said the man was a notorious criminal and rapist in the area who made a habit of disappearing once he committed a crime and reappearing later. The woman sustained serious cuts on her face as the suspect kept cutting her face each time she screamed for help. “We heard a woman screaming inside the bush and when we went, we found the man was trying to rape the woman who was struggling with him. We know him and he has been doing that for years and always gets away with it," Rama Yusuf said. "He was slashing the woman’s face viciously and it was obvious that he wanted to kill her. The villagers killed him there.” The deceased was feared for incidents of robbery with violence in the area. The incident was confirmed by Lamu county police commander Moses Murithi who, however, warned residents against taking the law into their own hands when aggrieved. “Residents who responded to save the woman lynched the man after he attempted to attack them with a panga too. We don’t encourage people to take the law into their hands no matter the situation they are in,” Murithi said. The woman who has since come out of a coma is currently recuperating at the King Fahd Hospital in Lamu island. The body was moved to the same hospital's mortuary. Edited by Henry Makori
