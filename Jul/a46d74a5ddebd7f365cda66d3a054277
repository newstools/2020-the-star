The US embassy will celebrate Freedom day at a later day and not on July 4th, ambassador Kyle McCarter has said. The Independence Day is a federal holiday in the United States commemorating the Declaration of Independence of the United States, on July 4, 1776. Via Twitter on Saturday, McCarter asked the US residents in Nairobi to keep faith alive and wait for the celebration. "Celebrating Freedom today. Happy 4th of July America. Our big party in Nairobi is not cancelled, only delayed! Stay tuned," he said. McCarter said that this year has been tough adding that it might look different but Americans must celebrate. "US and Kenya have shared values and believes. The American people are thankful for longstanding friendships, like the one with Kenya, that help make our nations even stronger," he said. "We look forward to expanding our friendship in ways that benefit all our people. Tuko na nguvu pamoja na tutafaulu pamoja.‚Äù
