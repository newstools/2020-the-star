The Kakamega government has launched a Sh90 million water project to ensure residents access clean water. Governor Wycliffe Oparanya on Monday launched the construction of a 5,000-cubic metre water tank in Lirhanda, Shinyalu constituency. "I promised that during my tenure, all households will access fresh and clean piped water for domestic use in their homes," he said. He said water is an essential commodity and if used for agricultural production, it can help boost the economy of the county. The tank will provide clean water to citizens in Shinyalu and its neighbouring subcounties, including Ikolomani, Lurambi and Mumias. He said the county is set to launch similar projects in all the 12 subcounties to ensure every homestead has access to clean water at their doorsteps. Similar water projects in all subcounties are; Kuvasali Water Treatment Plant in Malava, Butwekhe Water Project (Ikolomani), Nandamanywa (Shinyalu), Musembe Water Dam (Lugari), Lumino (Likuyani) and Koyonzo in Matungu. Others are Mumias town water connectivity for Mumias West, Ebubole water plant in Mumias East, Misango phase 1 and 2 (Khwisero), Shibanga (Butere) and Muyenga in Lurambi. Water CEC Barasa Wangwe said the department is investing in green energy to cut on the cost of pumping water. "We are using solar power to pump water. It is cost-effective and efficient. We are committed to ensuring all people access clean water," Wangwe said. Edited by R.Wamochie
