Kalonzo Musyoka's Wiper Party  has broken ties with NASA. Wiper said in a statement on Tuesday that it had signed an agreement with Jubilee and Kanu in line with the emerging political realignments in the country. “That the Wiper takes this step following the realization that the National Super Alliance (NASA) Coalition has become totally dysfunctional. That Wiper moves ahead with speed to enter into a Coalition Agreement with the ruling Party, Jubilee, in line with the emerging political realignments in the country,” Wiper SG Judith Sijeny said in a statement. The SG sent the statement following a virtual meeting of the National Executive Council of the Wiper Democratic Movement-Kenya. ANC had earlier said that all NASA affiliated parties must respect the agreement or follow the law in quitting the coalition. “That a Special National Delegates Conference be convened as soon as possible to ratify the NEC resolution concerning the envisaged Coalition,” the NEC said. The NEC also adopted the report of the Wiper Disciplinary Committee that recommended the expulsion of the former Machakos Senator Johnston Muthama. “That the Party shall move with speed to write to the Registrar of Political Parties to have Muthama's name struck off from the Party register,” the SG said. The coalition comes barely a month after Kalonzo signed a cooperation agreement with Jubilee which allowed the two parties to cooperate within and outside Parliament.
