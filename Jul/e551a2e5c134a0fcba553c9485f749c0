Makueni County Commissioner Mohammed Maalim has blamed chiefs and their assistants for not providing timely information to avert the Makueni - Kajiado border conflict that left two people dead and three others injured. A 21-year old man died during the attack while the second died while being treated at Makindu Sub-County Hospital. Three others suffered spear injuries when two communities clashed at Mikululo area, neighboring Chyulu National Park on Saturday morning. According to a medic, two have been discharged. "We have discharged two of the injured but one is still with us at the facility," said the medic. Maalim claimed the area chiefs and their assistants in Makindu and Mashuru sub-counties had failed to provide timely information on the attack for action. "Where were they when the attackers planned until the time they executed the crime? We have instructed the Director of Criminal Investigations in both counties to line the national government administrative officers for questioning in the probe," Maalim told The Star. He said the attackers will be pursued and charged. The administrator also said more security officers have been deployed in the area to restore peace after the new wave of conflict caused tension at the border. The two communities have been fighting over the land set aside by Kenya Wildlife Service as a dispersal area for grazing. Last year, a man was killed after two groups armed with bows, arrows, spears and club clashed in the area over pasture. The two communities lay claim to the 54- acre land with each side claiming it is in their county.
