Kabras Sugar coach Edwin Achayo is disappointed with the postponement of school games, owing to the coronavirus situation. He said the move will see them miss out on young talented stars who were expected to join different ranks within the club after their Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education examination. Achayo regretted that Covid-19 situation had made it difficult for them to plan ahead of the season with most of their programs halted. “We are an ambitious club with set out targets and objectives and we are always working out on improving the team and making it better each day,” he noted. “We always have new players joining our ranks but with the change in the school calendar following the coronavirus, we will have to wait and see when rising stars we scouted will be able to join us,” he added. Like any other club, he said they will continue to adhere to health regulations and conditions considering life of each player and official is important. The defending Enterprise Cup champions  Kabras were eying the Kenya Cup when Covid struck. Meanwhile, Achayo said despite Covid-19 situation, the club had embraced technology to keep the players fit during this period. “Because of the challenges we have, we are forced to be a bit creative and use technology to interact with the players as we seek to pass key information to them,” he noted. “We have tailor-made training programs courtesy of our strength and condition coach to ensure players are training. We also use zoom meetings to discuss the way forward just in case we resume the league sometime soon,” he added. He said this has helped a lot because they have been able to meet the needs of each and every player.
