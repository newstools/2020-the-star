A 40-year-old man from Imenti Central constituency on Thursday surprised residents when he moved around the streets of Meru town with a placard demanding development from politicians. Mutembei M’nthaka proceeded to the Meru county government offices waving his placard with the message, “Meru county tunataka maendeleo hatutaki siasa” (Meru county wants development not politics). He said Meru residents voted but the leaders had started thinking about 2022 elections. “We want them to work for the people and when time comes we will make a decision who is good and should be reelected and who should not,” M’nthaka said. He said the squabble between Meru Governor Kiraitu Murungi and Woman Representative Kawira Mwangaza was not good for the county. Already Mwangaza has said she will vie for governor in 2022. She recently accused Kiraitu of sending county revenue officers to raid her Baite TV in the pretext of collecting taxes. Kiraitu accused her of mudslinging his administration through daily broadcasts that tainted him as a failure on Baite TV. Agriculture CS Peter Munya has not been in good terms with Governor Kiraitu either. Their allies have been constantly attacking each other, a clear indication Munya might vie for governor, the post he lost to Kiraitu in 2017. M’nthaka said Woman Representative Mwangaza was right to tell the county government to account for funds but she should also tell residents what she was doing with the National Government Affirmative Action Fund. He said if leaders did not bring development he would go to court to hold them to account. Edited by Henry Makori
