Deputy President William Ruto has said he will invest in the business of two men who created innovative furniture that can transform from a table to a bench. He made the pledge when the two - Stephen Odhiambo and Dennis Omondi -visited him at his Karen residence to collect their balance for making the DP the furniture. In a tweet on Thursday, he said, “ I had their balance, which they asked me to top up and buy a specialised machine that will help them fasten their workmanship." The two men rose to fame after they showed their craft to the public. They made a garden seat that can transform to a table and a bench seat. The DP hosted them at his Karen home a few weeks ago. He offered to buy their products for Sh150,000 after the sellers offered to sell their product for 100,000. “I promised to invest in their dream and support their hustle,” Ruto said.
