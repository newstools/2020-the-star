A total of 90,000 poor families in Kisumu county are set to benefit from a medical insurance scheme. Deputy Governor Mathews Owili said on Wednesday the scheme would enable the needy to effectively access proper healthcare services. The scheme is an initiative by the county government to cushion vulnerable groups from the effects of Covid-19. The county, he said, will next week on Tuesday sign an MoU with the National Hospital Insurance Fund. Owili said the county government will pay insurance for the first batch of 45,000 indigent groups in the first three months. After 45 days, he said, the county will pay for an additional 45,000. “Eventually we’re going to cover 90,000 in this special scheme where the county is paying and ensuring those unable to pay are catered for. Such a scheme is the first in Kenya,” he said. “We expect the groups to start enjoying the benefits of indigent health insurance scheme after a month.” He spoke during a meeting of the civil society and business community on Covid-19. Owili further urged residents to heed measures put in place by the national government to combat the spread of the coronavirus. He said the county government has put in place measures to handle cases of the coronavirus. Owili said the county is working on giving stipends to vulnerable groups once they receive funds from the National Treasury. “The stipend will supplement the one by the national government. We thank President Uhuru Kenyatta for the initiative for the vulnerable groups,” he said. Currently, he said, no county has received funds for June. On April 10, Governor Anyang' Nyong’o launched county Covid-19 response fund. The county targeted to raise Sh800 million for the kitty. Edited by A.N
