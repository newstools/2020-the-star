A house help was on Monday charged with poisoning drinking water with chemicals, hence endangering the lives of her employers in Kilimani. Janepher Mpapale denied the charges before Kibera senior principal magistrate Sharon Maroro. She was accused that on July 1 along Timau Road in Kilimani in Nairobi, she unlawfully putting an unknown substance containing methanamine, high level of Permamanganate and hydrogen sulphide to be taken by Eunice Mukabura and Nickson Wanjohi with intent to cause harm. According to the police, Eunice was relaxing at her house when her husband went to the kitchen to drink water. When he poured it into a glass, it had a unique smell, prompting him to tell his wife. They then previewed the CCTV footage, which clearly showed the house help committing the offence. The matter was reported at the Kilimani police station, leading to the arrest. The police report says the accused said she decided to mix clean water with dirty water which she had used to wash her face because the complainant was using abusive language against her. She was freed on a Sh200,000 bond with the surety of similar amount. The magistrate directed the matter to be mentioned on July 27. Edited by R.Wamochie
