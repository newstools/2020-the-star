The Covid-19 Emergency Response Fund Board has said it will supply Personal Protective Equipment for the next 18 months. Board chairperson Jane Karuku said the board had set aside Sh1.4 billion to buy PPEs to distribute to health workers throughout the country. She spoke at Kiambu Covid-19 Centre in Limuru on Monday, where she accompanied Equity Bank chief executive James Mwangi to donate 100,000 PPEs to health workers. They were accompanied by Governor James Nyoro, Limuru MP Peter Mwathi, county health executive Ng’ang’a Murega, county commissioner Wilson Wanyanga and Limuru deputy county commissioner Charles Mukele. Karuku  urged hospitals, government and other institutions to utilise PPEs and other equipment well. They should also be prudent in use of financial support they will get from the board and well-wishers, she said. “We all know that this disease requires adherence to the instructions we are given daily to control it from spread. If we can all observe hygiene, use the PPEs and other equipment wisely, then I am sure we shall reduce the spread of the disease,” the board chairperson said. Mwangi applauded the governor for converting one hospital to deal with the disease. The Equity CEO revealed that bank had set aside Sh85 million to help doctors and nurses attending to Covid-19 patients. “We know some of our health workers will in one way or the other need some psychosocial treatment. They are working hard to deal with the disease and we need to support them,” Mwangi said. Edited by Henry Makori
