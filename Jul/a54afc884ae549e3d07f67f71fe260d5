Kenyans are divided after President Uhuru Kenyatta lifted the cessation of movement into and out of Nairobi effective July 7. Uhuru, during a national address on Monday, said that should the situation deteriorate and pose a challenge to health infrastructure, the phased reopening of the country will be reviewed. But this did not sit well with some Kenyans who claimed that the reopening was a reckless move. Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen said that Uhuru should have not opened the counties despite pressure. "Cessation of Movement in and out of Nairobi and Mombasa is a BIG MISTAKE," he tweeted. Here are other reactions: The President, however, extended the nationwide curfew currently in place between 9pm and 4am by another 30 days. "By reopening Nairobi, Mombasa and Mandera, we are more at risk than we were when the restrictions were in place," he said during an address on Monday. He said the order will only bear fruit, if Kenyans exercise shared responsibility. "My intention is to reopen and to remain open. The ‘claw back’ option is not on my wish list at all," he added. Uhuru has previously hinted at lifting the restrictions imposed since March. However, on Saturday, he warned of worse times ahead for the country.
