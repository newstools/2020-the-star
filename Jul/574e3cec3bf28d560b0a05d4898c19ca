Newly promoted Kenya Premier League side Nairobi City Stars’ box to box midfielder Charles Otieno Oduro aka Chale is back to action after four months out with injury. Oduro suffered a knee injury—a complex tear to the lateral meniscus—which saw him miss games which were played in February and March.  He is now looking forward to return to action once the new season starts. At the same time, defender Edwin Buliba who suffered a patella tendonitis and IT band syndrome back in February, is also getting closer to recovery.T The two have been undergoing weekly rehabilitation at the Muchatha Health Care, a renowned physiotherapy and sports injury clinic, since mid-March. Brian Otieno Odongo has been keenly attending to the two, among others. “Oduro has highly improved and he is at the last stage of recovery. We grade his injury at 86% recovered,” Odongo told the club’s website. As for Buliba,he said: “He is still on rehab with an appreciated progress.” Speaking to City Stars' website, team coordinator Samson Otieno noted the progression of the players with excitement. “We are happy to see a number of players now leave the doctor’s perch. We are down to the last two and by the time we kick off the pre-season, we will have a fully fit squad,” said Otieno. In March, winger Jimmy Bageya, strikers Vincent ‘Jamaica’ Otieno and Ezekiel Odera, defender Wycliffe Otieno and keeper Levis Opiyo were all being treated for various injuries. They are all fully healed and are looking forward to pre-season preparations if the committee formed by the Sports Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohamed recommends a go ahead for resumption of sports activities.
