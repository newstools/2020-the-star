President Uhuru Kenyatta has said closing the country will not help Kenya fight the coronavirus pandemic at this point. "Kufunga nchi haitasiadia (closing the country won't help) the government cannot be on the door of every Kenyan, the responsibility is ours," he said. Uhuru said the government can only arm its people with the resources required to fight the pandemic instead of "pretentious" issues. "This is not tribal, this is not politics, we are talking about lives," Uhuru said. "There are countries hiding truths and facts, as for us...we are a very free and open society...a democracy. We are not sweeping anything under the carpet but are telling each other the honest truth." Speaking during his address at State House on Monday, Uhuru said Kenyans should learn to help themselves. "We are asking for God to give us strength but you need to help yourself first before He helps you," he said. Uhuru further cautioned Kenyans against adopting a careless attitude amid efforts to contain the coronavirus. "It is evident that those who have displayed such a careless attitude have suffered greatly and in this case, we are not special. Let us not follow those examples that will hurt us in the end," Uhuru said. The governors had previously called for a lockdown to arrest the rise in infections, but changed their stand. Health experts had said it was upon the county chiefs to manage cases as they arise. County bosses have thus concluded there would be no need to restrict the movement of people, especially into and out of Nairobi. Council of Governors chairman Wycliffe Oparanya told the Star they want Nairobi left open "as it is the hub of Kenyaâ€™s economic activities." The pandemic has claimed more than 250 lives in the country since its outbreak on March 13, 2020. Forty-four out of the 47 counties have reported Covid-19 cases. Only Baringo, West Pokot and Samburu have not confirmed any cases.
