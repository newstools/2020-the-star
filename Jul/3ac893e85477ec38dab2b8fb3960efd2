 Meru MCAs want all public land that has been grabbed throughout the county repossessed. The county assembly's lands committee chairman Robert Kithinji said they will recommend that all grabbed public land is repossessed. The Nyaki East MCA said they will involve the National Land Commission and courts to see to it that the plots are surrendered to the county government. Kithinji said their report is ready and available to the public. “There are many areas where development has stagnated as it is not known where the public land is," Kithinji said. He said the public should come out and expose the grabbers. He said residents have until September 8 to give information to the committee on land matters for more input. He said they will summon the alleged grabbers to shed light on the claims. “It does not matter how much they have built or developed public land, we will pull down the structures,” the MCA said. Municipality MCA Elias Murega said it has been hard to get reports on public lands statements from the committee. He said they have finally received an inventory on public land from Governor Kiraitu Murungi. Murega said the county government is the custodian of public land that has been grabbed by private developers. He said the lands committee has the power to summon anyone to answer to queries on land grabbing. The ward representative noted that land remains an emotive issue with many cases still pending before the court in Meru. “The National Land Commission has the power to revoke land titles that are dubious. The courts can also do that,” he said. He said there was no space for industries and other development projects in Meru town because land for public utilities has been grabbed.  Edited by P.O
