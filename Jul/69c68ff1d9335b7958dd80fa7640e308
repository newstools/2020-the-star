It is now the responsibility of everyone to ensure coronavirus does not spread among communities. Garissa county commissioner Meru Mwangi on Monday said the war against the virus can only be won if residents cooperate. He spoke when he witnessed donations of PPE by Equity Bank to boost the fight against the Covid-19 in Garissa county. The equipment included disposable gowns, surgical masks, N95 respirator masks, nitrile gloves, head/hair covers, shoe covers and gumboots. The administrator urged residents to maintain high standards of hygiene and other protocols issued by the Health ministry to arrest the spread of coronavirus. He said residents of Garissa town and refugee camps need a lot of awareness  to avoid a spike in infections. “Human resources are very important that we ought to protect at all costs because after the virus, we can embark on how to revive our economy,” Mwangi said. Garissa county has so far confirmed 35 confirmed cases, out of which 18 have recovered. The bulk of the cases are from Garissa town and the Dadaab refugee camp. Equity Bank regional manager Alfred Mwangi said the equipment donated was worth Sh237 million. He noted that the donations will be distributed to public hospitals for use by healthcare workers handling Covid-19 patients. The banker said the Garissa County Referral Hospital is among 68 health facilities identified by the Ministry of Health to receive the equipment. He said the PPE was manufactured locally in line with President Uhuru Kenyatta’s Big Four agenda of building local manufacturing capacity. The handover was also attended by county secretary Abdi Sheikh, Finance executive Roble Nunow among other senior officials. Edited by P.O
