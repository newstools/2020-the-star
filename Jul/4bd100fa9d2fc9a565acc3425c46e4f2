Athletics Kenya (AK) Central Rift Region are considering postponing the annual  Ndalat Gaa cross country championships that normally kicks off the calendar. The region’s chairman, Abraham Mutai, said the coronavirus has been a blow to all sporting world, forcing sponsors to rethink their strategy in as far as spending money is concerned. He told counties to review their calendar and see how they can run their programmes in the wake of coronavirus. "This is the time to sit down as committees and decide on what you can handle as a county," he added. “We are are likely to postpone Ndalat Gaa although  we are yet to make that decision. Looking at the current situation and the remaining time, I guess it won't be possible to get the kind of sponsorship needed. However, we will meet soon and deliberate on the final decision," he added.
