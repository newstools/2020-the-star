More youth will be hired in the second phase of Kazi Mtaani to improve hygiene in Vihiga, county commissioner Ochillo Oyugi has said. He said the programme targets to hire more than 5,000 youths in the county. Oyugi urged those selected to adhere to Covid-19 regulations while on duty. “We are going to partner with the county government to provide water and sanitiser in various working stations,” Oyugi said. Among the tasks to be executed by the new recruits include; beautification, planting trees, roads maintenance, maintaining government facilities, solid waste management, cleaning ditches and opening of culverts. Addressing the recruits at the county headquarters during the event, Oyugi urged the youth to work hard work. He said Kazi Mtaani is meant to create income during the pandemic. The Kazi Mtaani drive started on Tuesday with over 2,500 youths selected across the county. This was in line with President Uhuru Kenyatta’s directive to establish the project at the grassroots level to cushion youths from the effects of Covid-19. The County Implementation Committee, Oyugi said, will report to the national government daily on the progress of the project, assuring that payment will be done through mobile money for transparency and accountability. Deputy Governor Patrick Saisi commended the President for the move, noting that it will keep the youth busy and at the same time enable them to earn income. “In addition to what the state has offered, the county government has set aside money in 2020-21 for the same purpose,” he said.
