Strathmore University coach Tony Ochieng wants Kenya Basketball Federation (KBF) to conduct virtual elections in a bid to save time. He said as they await the announcement by the Ministry of Sports on the resumption of sporting activities, there is need to have the new office in place. “We need to hold virtual elections now so that as soon as the ministry announces the sporting action kick off, we will be ready with our programmes,” he said. KBF secretary, Vitalis Gode, this week hinted that they could be forced to resort to virtual elections as is happening in other parts of the world due to Covid-19 pandemic. Ochieng observed that KBF need to meet all the stakeholders on zoom so that a decision is reached on way forward. “The sooner this is done, the better. There is need to engage all the team managers on way forward. We need to know if we will do a one leg league or if we will adopt the Fiba system,” he added. He said besides the league, they have the FIBA Africa Zone Five women’s Club Championships as well as the men’s Basketball Africa League (BAL) to plan for. “These are three serious programmes that need to be run this year and we are already in August. We need to think ahead or else it will be very tight,” he observed. KBF elections were planned for April 25 but were called off due to the pandemic. Only Nairobi County had done their elections by then. The 2020 basketball activities were scheduled to throw off on March 21 but the outbreak of Covid-19 stalled the programmes.
