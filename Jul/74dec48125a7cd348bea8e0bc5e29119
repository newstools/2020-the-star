A woman who was charged with possession of 30 rounds of ammunition claimed they were left in her house by her boyfriend without her knowledge. Loise Muthoni told Embu principal magistrate Henry Nyakemba the bullets in a magazine were left in her house by her boyfriend whose name she gave as Kelvin. Muthoni who was arrested in Majimbo estate, Embu town, begged for leniency. Nyakweba released her on Sh100, 000 bond and surety of similar amount or Sh50,000 cash bail. Muthoni said her boyfriend visited her and left the ammunition in her house without her knowledge before policemen stormed in looking for them. “Your honour, I request you to reduce the bond because it’s too much and I cannot afford it. In fact those items were left in my house by my boyfriend Kelvin without my knowledge. Your honour it was not my fault,” she begged The accused was charged that she was found in unlawful possession of the magazine with the ammunition, which are government property, on July 19 at Majimbo in Embu county. She denied the charge. “I can’t reduce the bond because what you are telling the court cannot be ascertained since the dangerous items were allegedly found in your house,"the magistrate said. The accused was escorted to the Embu  Prison since she could not afford the bond to wait for hearing  of the case on August 19. Edited by Henry Makori
