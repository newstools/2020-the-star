Nairobi Govenor Mike Sonko is seeking an adjournment of the meeting convened to grill him over 2015/16, 2016/17 and 2017/18 audit queries. The county chief on Wednesday told the Senate county Public Accounts and Investments Committee that he does not have documents to submit to the panel to explain the queries. He cited the deed of transfer of the county functions to Nairobi Metropolitan Services and the court case that blocked him from accessing his office or interacting with county staff. Sonko argues that NMS illegally took his staff thereby disrupting the normal operations of his administration. "NMS has been seconding staff illegally, interrupting my operations and therefore I have been unable to get the documents to table before this committee," he said. The governor added that magistrate court Douglas Ogoti barred him from setting foot or interacting with the county staff. "On December 9, 2019, I was charged in a criminal court and barred from accessing my office. I was also banned from interacting with the county staff," he said. But the committee chaired by Kisii Senator Sam Ongeri questioned why the governor was accompanied by county chief finance officer Halake Waqo if he was indeed barred from interacting with county staff. "I came here alone. I did not come with him. He came on his own. I am not even supposed to talk to him," Sonko said. The governor was accompanied by among others county attorney Lydia Kwamboka, PA Ben Mulwa, chief of staff Brian Mugo and legal advisor Paul Musyimi. The committee is currently deliberating the "the unique" Nairobi situation before making a ruling. Migori Senator Ochillo Ayacko wanted to know whether the governor had sought the intervention of the courts and DPP on his planned appearance at the Senate Majority Chief Whip Irungu Kang'ata recommended a brief adjournment of the session to allow the committee deliberate the governor's submission before making a final determination.
