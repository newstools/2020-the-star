Police officers on Saturday morning dispersed a meeting at the home of Hamisi MP Charles Gimose where MPs allied to the Tangatanga camp had assembled. Led by former Kakamega Senator Bonny Khalwale and former Majority whip Ben Washiali (Mumias East MP) had converged at Gimose’s home with several Vihiga MCAs. Washiali accused the state of frustrating lawmakers affiliated to Deputy President William Ruto. "Ruto is a Kenyan like any other Kenyan, he has a right to hold any political rallies in the country," Washiali said. "Why is it that members of the Parliament allied DP Ruto we are not allowed to conduct any meeting as opposed to the other groups?" he asked. Initially, security agencies had fully manned roads to Gimose’s home to ensure the planned meeting does not take place. However, the delegation sneaked in via another route prompting the police officers to storm the home in full to disperse the gathering. Edited by R.Wamochie
