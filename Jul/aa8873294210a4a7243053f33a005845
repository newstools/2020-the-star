Kandara MP Alice Wahome has asked Jubilee Party not to allow major committees in Parliament to be led by the Opposition. The MP said it was contrary to the law to allow members of the Opposition to manage departmental or select committees as they are not part of the government. Wahome said the Constitution is clear on the role of the Opposition and its seats reserved. She said allowing the Minority in Parliament to control the committees was tantamount to arming your enemy while weakening your soldiers. “If a party does not have a cooperation agreement which allows it to be part of the ruling party, then it should not enjoy committee leadership,” she added. The Jubilee Party has signed deals with Wiper Democratic Movement and Chama Cha Mashinani, led by Kalonzo Musyoka and Isaac Ruto respectively. But Wahome noted that the nine points agreed upon by the President and ODM leader Raila Odinga when they had the handshake did not include parliamentary committee leadership. Last week, nominated senators Beatrice Kwamboka (ODM) and Mary Seneta (Jubilee) engaged in a physical scuffle over the Health committee vice chairmanship. Senata had accused a section of members including Kwamboka of colluding to have her removed from the position and disputed the election of Narok Senator Ledama ole Kina. The scuffle started when Kwamboka, also the Minority deputy leader, confronted Seneta. But Wahome said such scenes should never occur. “As a lawyer, I want to go on record saying that this is destructive politics and should not be allowed to happen. A Minority leader should not be allowed to lead a committee on a government department,” she added. Wahome asked the Jubilee party to ensure that the seats which were taken away from radical party members are retained in the party. Edited by Henry Makori
