Some 29 Covid-19 patients are currently in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Acting Director General of Public Health Dr Patrick Amoth on Friday said out of the 29 patients, 14 are admitted in public health facilities while 15 are in private facilities across the country. Amoth said while 13 of them are on ventilators, 16 are under supplemental oxygen. Amoth further said the management of asymptomatic cases has become an expensive affair thus government is seeking alternatives including home-based care. He said for instance a patient who is asymptomatic will have to part with Sh21,300 per day while those with mild symptoms part with Sh21,400. "Those with severe conditions pay Sh51,000 per day and those on ventilators pay Sh71,000. It is evident that these figures are overwhelming," Amoth said. He said currently the government is fully catering for the bills of the patients who die in public health facilities. "With regards to those who die in private facilities, the government only moves in to intervene and negotiates on behalf of the families for the hospitals to waive the bills," he said. So far Kenya has reported 154 deaths after two more patients succumbed in the last 24 hours. Amoth said the deceased had other underlying diseases that had weakened their immune system. He said a combination of high blood pressure and diabetes was leading on the list of underlying diseases. Others are cancer, HIV and Aids and other chronic conditions. Amoth said currently the country has a fatality rate of 2.29 per cent compared to the 6.7 per cent globally. This he said is fairly low compared to other countries. "In our case we have a recovery rate of between 30-50 per cent because we only discharge a patient on the fourteenth day. WHO recommends discharge on the eighth day, that is why other countries following WHO guidelines might seem to have a high recovery rate," Amoth said.
