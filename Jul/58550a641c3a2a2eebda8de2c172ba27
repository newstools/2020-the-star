The search for two bodies of a middle aged woman and her 17-year-old daughter who are said to have drowned in Masinga Dam after their speed boat capsized has begun. The vessel was carrying five passengers from Wamboo village to Ekalakala in Masinga division but capsized in the middle of the dam on Monday morning. Masinga Sub County Police commander Francis Siror said three people were rescued alive. The 17-year-old was a Form Two student at Wamboo Secondary school. One of the survivors said the boat hit a log which made it overturn. The survivor said he and his friend managed to swim across to the shore while the other one was rescued by residents. Their family and friends are helping the police on the search mission. Siror urged residents to be extra careful while crossing the dam adding that similar cases have been recently reported in the area. In May, hippos from the dam killed a boy and mauled another after moving to the banks following extreme flooding. One of the boys, 17, was mauled to death by a hippopotamus in Murangâ€™a Ndogo village when he went to fetch water for the family. Riakanau senior chief Kimeu Musyimi, under whose area the two attacks took place, said hippos in the hydroelectric dam have moved to the banks and are causing terror.
