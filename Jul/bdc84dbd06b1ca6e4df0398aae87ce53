The High Court will rule on the Ford Kenya leadership wrangles in September. The parties agreed that the court should use their written submissions to write a ruling. During a virtual hearing of the mention before Justice James Makau, the parties told the court that there would be no need of highlighting their submissions. Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang'ula moved to the High Court to challenge the changes made to the party leadership. Lawyer Nelson Havi who appeared for Wetang'ula confirmed to the court that they had filed all submissions. He said they had been served with the submissions from the respondents on July 2. Havi said the court should rely on the submissions to make its decision on the case. The Registrar of Political Parties and interested parties agreed to the suggestion by Havi but asked for a sooner date. Judge Makau said he had so many matters still pending and his court was giving October dates. “However, in view of the nature of this matter I might squeeze you a date in September,” he said. The court said the ruling will be delivered on September 25. Last month, the judge suspended implementation of a gazette notice announcing the removal of Wetang'ula from the helm of Ford Kenya party. On June 8, the Registrar of Political Parties Ann Nderitu gazetted a notice announcing the intended removal of Wetang'ula and replacement with Kanduyi MP Wafula Wamunyinyi. Nderitu also noted that the party’s national organising secretary Chris Mandu had been removed and replaced with Josephine Waungu. The court directed the Registrar not to acknowledge or transact the party's business with Eseli Simiyu and Wamunyinyi. Ford Kenya’s National Executive Council on May 31, 2020 resolved to dismiss Wetang'ula as party leader on the grounds of gross misconduct. Edited by Henry Makori
