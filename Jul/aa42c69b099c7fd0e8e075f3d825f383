A self-proclaimed youth movement leader in Kitui who threatened Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka has been released after spending five days on remand. Moses Munyalo alias Mose issued threats to Kalonzo in a phone call on July 17 and asked the former vice president to leave Governor Ngilu alone. In the video that went viral on social media, Munyalo told Kalonzo to take his advice let Ngilu work for the people of Kitui. He did not say what will happen to Kalonzo if the advice is not heeded. Ngilu's supporters believe the Wiper party leader is behind the wrangles involving the governor and MCAs. Munyalo was arrested by detectives while hiding in a thicket on the outskirts of Kitui town, a day after he issued the threats. It is said he called Kalonzo at noon and the audio soon went viral, attracting the attention of detectives. Munyalo quickly learned about his impending arrest and went into hiding. But the detectives tracked his mobile phone and traced him to a bush. He was presented before Kibra chief magistrate Abdulqadir Lorot on Monday. The DCI asked to be allowed to hold Munyalo for 14 days to complete investigations. The detectives were planning to charge the suspect with a cyber-crime offence. Munyallo did not take a plea and was remanded at the Industrial Area Prison until Wednesday when the court granted him a Sh100,000 bail. He was ordered to present himself to the DCI detectives on Friday within the Nairobi area. When Munyallo first appeared court, his lawyers Moris Kimuli, Stanley Kiema and Jennifer Mutua argued that it was improper to charge him in Nairobi when a court that could handle the case was in Kitui. Munyalo has in the past been accused of terrorising perceived political enemies of Ngilu in Kitui, including MCAs. He has pending cases in court where he is charged with assaulting KivoiÂ  MCA Charles Maema and threatening to kill James Munuve (Kanziku). Munyalo is also facing charges of being illegally in possession of a firearm.
