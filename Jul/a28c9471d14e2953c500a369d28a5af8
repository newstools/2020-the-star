The High Court has declared invalid a decision by the National Transport and Safety Authority to phase out 14-seater matatus. Justice Weldon Korir has ruled that there was no public participation. “The respondents have failed to prove that there was public participation in the enactment of the impugned regulation,” Korir ruled The judge also faulted NTSA for not submitting the legal notice to Parliament for approval before it was gazetted. The notice states that the authority shall not license any new public service vehicle as commuter service vehicle whose carrying capacity is less than 25 passengers. The court noted that the authority did not place any evidence to confirm that there was public participation but that they instead attempted to shift the burden of proof upon the matatu owners. “It is the respondents who enacted the challenged legislation and it is only them who have the evidence as to whether there was public participation,” the court ruled. Korir further ruled that the law on public participation is now well developed in the country and public participation is a mandatory requirement in the process of making legislation including subsidiary legislation. However, the court declined to quash all the other directives by government including BRT, yellow lines on the matatus, seat belts and speed governors. The court noted that the laws were already in place and there is no need to stop what is already in force. “As pointed out by Kenya Bureau of Standards, the standards have been established. The petitioners made a generalised complaint about the products being substandard but did not avail evidence to support their claim,” the court held. Edited by R.Wamochie
