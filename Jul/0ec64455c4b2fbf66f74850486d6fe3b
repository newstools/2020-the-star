Three men suspected of robbing a man at gunpoint have been charged with robbery with violence. Humphrey Minyata, Jahan Timothy and Ibrahim Hussein denied the charges before senior resident magistrate Zainab Abdul on Friday. They are suspected to be three men armed with a pistol and knife caught on CCTV robbing Paul Omanyi on June 25 along Rose Avenue in Kilimani. The three are accused of stealing a Macbook Air, iPhone 11 Pro, Magic Keyboard, Apple adapter, Magic Mouse, eye glasses, HTC One phone, backpack, power bank, Samsung Note 3 and two passports, all valued at Sh396,733. They are also accused of threatening to use actual violence after the robbery. Hussein was also charged with a separate count of handling stolen property. He is accused that on June 30 at Kawangware in Dagoretti, Nairobi, he dishonestly retained stolen goods. Lawyer Katunga Mbuvi asked the court to free them on bail but the prosecution objected, sayingÂ they may interfere with witnesses as their photos are all over social media. The prosecution said all three have no fixed abode and are a flight risk. The accused were detained at Kilimani police station pending bail ruling on July 8. Edited by Josephine M. Mayuya
