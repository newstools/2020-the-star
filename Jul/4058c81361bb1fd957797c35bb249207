Ride hailing firm Uber has started tightening measures set to protect drivers and users against the spread of COVID-19 after the President recently reopened the country. “As cities begin to reopen and the public transport sector begins to move again, it is important to proceed with caution and safety top of mind as the measures were put  in order to flatten the curve,” said Brian Njao, Uber Kenya’s Country Manager. Uber has been doing their best to support drivers and riders since Covid-19 hit the country,to limit it's spread. They added new features and policies to help ensure their health and well-being while operating across the platform such as mask verification but as the country reopens they have added more features. “We have worked with manufacturers and distributors to provide drivers, carriers and delivery people with disinfectants and cloth masks and drivers have been sent tips to follow to help keep themselves and the Uber community safe,” said Njao. Drivers and riders can also cancel a ride without a penalty if a rider isn’t wearing a mask or face covering. The Uber app will also have new options for feedback,for instance if a rider or driver is not wearing a mask they risk losing access to Uber’s apps. “We are providing up to 14 days of financial assistance to drivers and delivery people diagnosed with COVID-19 or ordered to self-quarantine by a doctor or public health authority,” said Njao. The firm’s food delivery app UberEats has also put in place more safety measures to ensure less contact during food and grocery delivery. The firm has also recently launched Uber Cash, a contactless payment option, allowing more people to use Uber’s apps, especially those who don't have cash or cards at hand. “Coronavirus will be around for some time, and to get through this we need to stay focused and  continue finding ways to adapt to the new normal while working on innovating to meet the ever-changing demands of the consumer,” Njao concluded.
