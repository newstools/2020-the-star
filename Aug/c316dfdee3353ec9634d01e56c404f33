Long serving George Mutira has tipped Amos Barkibir, Calvins Kanu and Festus Onyango to effectively take up the striking role at Butali Warriors when he decides to exit the scene. The mercurial centre-forward, who turns 32 in February next year, said his priority at the moment is to nurture the trio into top class forwards. He said he expects the three to reach dizzying heights considering they are all below 25 years. He acknowledged that the trio have what it takes to become formidable and is ready to help them polish their game. “It is good to see young people coming up in my ranks. I have played for more than a decade and I know what winning is all about. I will help them where I can but I believe they are on the right track. It is a joy watching the lads play and giving their all in matches.” Mutira has won five premier league titles—two with Strathmore, two with Butali and one with Sikh Union. He also guided Sailors to from the National league to the top tier in 2015, where he emerged as the top scorer. In his first season at Butali, he guided the sugar millers to their third Premier league trophy and also won the top scorer’s award after netting 23 times in 2018. Last season, the burly striker managed 10 goals. In the meantime, Mutira said he aims to stay fit as the union awaits the directive from the government on resumption of sporting activities. Despite the competition for places, he said he will use his experience to gain regular playing time. “Staying healthy is always a priority. The pandemic has shown that nothing is permanent. The squad is always improving and for me, I will always give my best when chance presents itself. As you grow older, you mature into the game. I am managing myself and hope to perform to the optimum.”
