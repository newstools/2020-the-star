Taurus Musik-signed artiste Tallie is back with the song 'Get It' after making headlines with 'Bugia'. 'Get It' hints at Health Ministry CS Mutahi Kagwe’s message that citizens should be careful as anyone can 'Get it', referring to the coronavirus. This comes about a couple of weeks after her sophomore single from Taurus Musik, 'Bugia', which was well received due its Gengetone genre and its mature nature when it comes to the video. “I don’t think there’s a female in Kenya claiming the Gengetone throne. It’s a genre that’s growing and might define the Kenyan music industry as a new, fresh genre. I'm coming for the throne!" Tallie said.
