Kenya Premier League strugglers Kisumu All Stars have advertised positions of the entire technical bench. The club’s chief executive officer, Nicholas Ochieng, said they are seeking to recruit a head coach, assistant coach, physical trainer and goalkeeper trainer. The club is seeking to replace Andrew Aroka (head coach), Jeff Odongo (trainer) and Fredrick Onyango (goalkeeper trainer), who were appointed in February in an interim capacity to help the team off relegation zone. Aroka is the longest serving member of the Kisumu County-sponsored side which made their debut in the KPL this season. In January, the club sacked veteran coach the late Henry Omino alongside  his assistant Aroka and goalkeeper trainer Joseph Ongoro after a string of poor results. German-based Arthur Opiyo was appointed in an interim capacity until February when he returned to Germany. Yesterday, Ochieng said the current technical bench is free to apply for the positions. “They signed a short term contract which has elapsed. However, they are free to apply for the positions. We expect to name a new technical bench by next month. The head coach must have a Confederations of African Football C license,” said Ochieng. The new technical bench is expected to get a baptism of fire against National Super League side Vihiga United when the government gives a go ahead on resumption of sports activities and when a case against the cancellation of the season by the Football Kenya Federation is decided. Sports Cabinet Secretary, Amina Mohammed, appointed a task-force to review possibility of resumption of sports activities. All Stars finished 16th on the KPL log while Vihiga United finished third in the National Super League and will engage in a playoff (home and away) to decide the last place in the KPL.
