President Uhuru Kenyatta on Saturday urged Kenyans to take advantage of this time to travel around the country and enjoy the country's beautiful scenery. Uhuru said keeping safe from Covid-19 does not mean one is limited and must be locked within their doors. "You have the ability to take advantage of the wonderful gift God has given this republic and to be able to tour with your family. Despite Covid-19, you are as safe as you want yourself to be," he said. Uhuru was speaking during a live video link with  Tourism CS Najib Balala when he hosted Marathon world record holder Eliud Kipchoge at the Maasai Mara Game Reserve. The Head of State said he turned down recommendations to reinstate lock down because he believed Kenyans can responsibly look after their livelihoods. "Let us be able to continue with our lives. We cannot just lock ourselves down.  Covid-19 is here with us and we cannot run away from that. However it is up to every single Kenyan to see how they can continue with their livelihoods while at the same time keeping themselves and others safe," he said. With the resumption of international flights, Uhuru welcomed foreign tourists willing to obey all protocols put in place. The President announced the resumption of both local and international flights  under strict guidelines in the country's planned phased reopening. Balala revealed that hotels at the Mara were already filled up by local tourists who witnessed the spectacular  10,000 wilder beast crossing the Mara river from Serengeti. "There are challenges definitely in the hotel industry but we have all accepted that we have to balance between lives and livelihoods," he said.
