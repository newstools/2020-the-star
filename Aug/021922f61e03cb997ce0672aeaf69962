The county government of Kiambu is teaching residents how to make kitchen gardens from waste materials. The gardens are made from empty cement bags, sacks and plastic buckets. Governor James Nyoro's economic adviser Njoki Wamitugo said the programme will benefit residents who live on small plots of land and rentals. Wamitugo, who spoke at Kinoo chief's office in Kikuyu constituency, said the containers will be used to grow vegetables. "These are vegetables that we use every day.Â  They are nutritious, and the gardens can be managed easily," she said. "The containers can be placed outside the house or in the washing area." Wamitugo urged landlords and agents not to be too hard on their tenants and allow them to practise that type of farming. She was accompanied by area chief and constituency youths officer Edward Ng'ang'a. Edited by A.N
