A group of supporters of Kakamega Senator Cleophas Malala have blocked a section of roads in Mumias Town demanding for his release. The group on Tuesday morning lit bonfires on the roads as they protested and demanded their senator be freed. Malala was arrested on Monday from Nairobi and driven to Mumias to face charges of contravening Covid-19 pandemic rules. This was after he was captured addressing a crowd and distributing sanitisers in the town on Sunday. Senator Malala alongside his counterparts Bomet’s Chris Langat and Samburu’s Steve Lelegwe were arrested and driven to their counties for grilling. Langat was accused of administering an oath to more than 200 youth to cause chaos while Lelegwe was accused of an incident of cattle rustling in his county. The other two were released on police bond while Malala is expected in court today. The arrests of the three triggered a political storm in the Senate that saw angry lawmakers rail at the state for trying to circumvent the will of the people exercising their mandate through their elected representatives. Emotions ran high during the debate with senators pointing an accusing finger at state functionaries for unleashing terror on their colleagues holding divergent views. Senators immediately linked the trio's arrest to the debate on the contentious formula for revenue sharing among the counties, which is deadlocked in the Senate. The three senators are aligned to a group christened Team Kenya which brings together marginalised and less populated counties and those standing in solidarity with them.
