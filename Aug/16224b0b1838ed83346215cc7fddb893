Kitui county Trade CEC Philip Mumo was on Thursday charged over a fake degree certificate. Mumo appeared before the Kitui senior principal magistrate Margaret Kasera and pleaded not guilty to all the three counts related to the offence. Mumo denied the offences of giving false information to the Kitui county government contrary to the leadership and integrity Act and deceiving the county. He further pleaded not guilty to uttering a false document contrary to the Penal Code. Mumo was released on a cash bail of Sh400,000 or a bond of Sh500, 000 with a surety of a similar amount. Kasera ordered the case be mentioned on September 10 and the hearing to take place on January 20, 2021. On Thursday morning, EACC detectives arrested Mumo before he left for work and whisked him to the Kitui police station where he was held as the process to charge him for forgery was being finalised. Kitui Central subcounty CID boss Singi Nzioka confirmed that Mumo was arrested for faking academic degree documents.Â  He, however, said the EACC had the full details of the supposed offence. In December last year, Mumo was impeached on grounds he used fake MKU degree certificates acquired from River Road to secure the job. After being impeached, Mumo moved to court to challenge the decision but lost at the High Court in July. However, he remained in office since Governor Charity Ngilu had declined to formally relieve him of his duties.
