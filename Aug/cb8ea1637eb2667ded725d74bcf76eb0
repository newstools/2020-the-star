The Event Managers Association of Kenya (Emak) has appealed to the government to allow businesses to hold small meetings and events to promote and market their products and services. Emak chairwoman Zuhura Ogada-Odhiambo spoke about the effects of Covid-19 in the MICE events and hospitality sectors. She said the industry is one of the hardest hit in this pandemic. "Even with the phased reopening of businesses by the government, our industry is still shut down with the restriction of public gatherings," she said. "Our appeal to the government is to allow events that will host more than 100 people, which will allow companies to hold product launches, small training trainings and conferences, exhibitions, enabling our members to run businesses and slowly revive the industry." The association will ensure the set guidelines are adhered to during the events.
