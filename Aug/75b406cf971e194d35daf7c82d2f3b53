The Naivasha law courts have been shut indefinitely for fumigation after four members of staff tested positive for Covid-19. Monday's closure of business came barely a week after a suspect who had been held at Gilgil Police Station arrived in court with high fever and was isolated. Pleas will be taken via video, according to a notice signed by chief magistrate Kennedy Bidali. “Kindly note that the court will not open on Monday for purposes of fumigation,” the notice said. A senior health officer said they were tracing contacts of all the officers and orderlies who came into contact with the infected people. “There are four people in the Naivasha law courts who have tested positive for Covid-19 and the facility is being fumigated as we move in to test all the contact persons,” the officer said. Naivasha OCPD Samuel Waweru confirmed that pleas were being taken at the police station. “We have been requested [by the courts] that all persons from different police stations in Naivasha and Gilgil take their pleas here as the courts are fumigated,” Waweru said. Meanwhile, an inquest file has been opened after a police officer said to have been a deserter, was last week run over and killed by his colleague in Kasarani. The Recce Unit officer died four days later while undergoing treatment. The colleague reported the incident and recorded a statement at Kongoni Police Station. The deceased died of head injuries incurred when he was ran over as he tried to enter the colleague's car. OCPD Waweru said the two were from Kasarani estate and were good friends who had joined the police service the same time. He said, “We have opened an inquest file following the incident. Our officers have recorded statements from those who witnessed the incident.”  - mwaniki fm
