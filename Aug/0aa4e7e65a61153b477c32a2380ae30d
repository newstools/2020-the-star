Nyandarua county government has expressed concerns over the soaring cases of Covid-19 in the rural areas in the last couple of days. Two weeks ago, the county had only two cases but this has soared to over 30, with the recent lifting of the lockdown and relaxing of health regulations blamed for the increase in the cases. Despite the rise in the cases, the department of health said it was prepared to handle the cases and that all mitigation measures had been put in place. Health CEC John Mungai said out of the positive cases, 19 were men while the rest were women, all undergoing treatment in various facilities and homes. He said the county had achieved a 330-bed capacity against the recommended 300 by the Ministry of Health. “Of the number people who infected by this virus, 18 are undergoing home-based care while the rest are recuperating in county hospitals,” he said. The CEC was speaking in Engineer Subcounty Hospital in Kinangop where he had gone to address the crisis caused by conversion of the maternity ward into an isolation facility. According to him, the decision had since been reversed after an outcry from members of the public who had been forced to seek maternity services in Naivasha. “There was communication breakdown over this matter and it has been resolved and the maternity wing is now fully operational,” he said. Mungai defended the county over accusations that they was an acute shortage of PPEs in public hospitals. “The county has invested heavily in health workers during this period and we have enough protective kits in all the health facilities,” he said. Hospital chairman John Karanja said the crisis had been resolved. “We are fully operational and expectant mothers seeking any service including delivery can get them here any day or time of the week,” he said. Karanja added that the county had invested heavily in the facility which was one of largest in Kinangop by buying state of the art machines. Edited by R.Wamochie
