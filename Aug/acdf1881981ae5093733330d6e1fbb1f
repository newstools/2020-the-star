Samburu Senator Steve Lelegwe was on Monday evening taken to Maralal police station in Samburu Central for questioning following his arrest earlier in the day. Lelegwe was expected at the Senate to vote for the revenue sharing formula. Hundreds of residents led by some MCAs stood outside the police station as the senator was escorted by DCI officers to an office at Maralal police station for questioning. Ndoto MCA Raisy Letura accused the government of intimidating senators opposed to proposed county revenue sharing formula. “People in this country cannot stand such kind of intimidation. Senator Lelegwe is a clean senator, we know he has no criminal record and we know today he is being harassed because the government wants him to vote on that formula, a move that is backward and cannot be appreciated in any democratic country,” he said. Letura said residents and leaders are fully behind their senator. Samburu assembly Leader of Majority at Samburu Christopher Lentukunye said his supporters will wait for him until the questioning is over. “I'm here with residents of Samburu and my fellow MCAs just to see what government and police are asking our senator,” he said. Fred Leakono, a resident of Samburu county, urged the government to be considerate in the county revenue sharing formula so as not to marginalize some counties. “When senators fight for resources for their counties through the county revenue sharing formula, there is no problem," he said. Leakono asked the government to respect senators who are fighting for development in their regions.
