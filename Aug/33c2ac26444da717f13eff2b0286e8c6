Embattled Malindi MP Aisha Jumwa has said that she is ready to face corruption charges when she appears in court in Mombasa on Monday. "Everybody knows the court had directed that I be in court tomorrow (Monday) and we had come to plan ....we are ready for tomorrow," she said. She addressed journalists after surrendering and recording a statement at Port Police Station on Sunday afternoon. Police sources say she was quizzed for about one-and-a-half hours before leaving the station. Jumwa and six others who appeared in court on Friday are wanted in connection with mismanagement of Sh19 million CDF funds. The prosecution told Mombasa Chief Magistrate Edna Nyaloti on Friday that they were unable to trace Jumwa after she switched off her phone. But she denied the claim she had been on the run. "I don't think there is anybody who looked for me. I have been in Nairobi...I have not been in Tanzania or Uganda...I have not heard anybody had been looking for me," she told journalists who had to trail her for about eight minutes before finally agreeing to stop her entourage to address them. She said that she couldn't have been on the run since there are many DCI offices in Kilifi and Mombasa. "All is well," she said before one of her security men whisked her away when a journalist sought a clarification about her writing a statement. Jumwa's co-accused who took plea on Friday include manager Wachu Omar Abdallah, officers Sophia Said, Bernard Kai, Margaret Faith Kalume, Robert Katana and government engineer Kennedy Otieno Onyango. They face of conspiracy to commit an offence of corruption, willful failure to comply with the law related to procurement, conflict of interest, money laundering, acquisition of proceeds of crime and forgery.
