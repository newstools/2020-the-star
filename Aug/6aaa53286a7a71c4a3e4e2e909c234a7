Chief Justice David Maraga says unless the Judiciary is given sufficient financial support, the ICT system will collapse. Maraga on Thursday said the recently launched e-filing system is doing well except for a few challenges which are being addressed. The CJ said 67 per cent of court users in a newly released poll said they are happy with services and improvements in the Judiciary. Maraga told National Assembly Budget committee chairman Kanini Kega it is the panel's duty to have a view of the affairs of the nation. He said the Judiciary plays a balancing role in Kenya's affairs considering that it's also an arm of government "The moment you lose sight of its role, it will be underfunded and backlog of cases will be there," Maraga said. Kega said as the new chairman of the committee, he will look into the Judiciary budget issue. Speaking at the launch of the Judiciary Performance Management Report, Kega said there will be a supplementary budget soon. "As your 'ambassador', I will make sure nothing happens to you," he said. The MP also lauded the Judiciary for looking inwards and focusing on what it can do. National Gender and Equality Commission Chair Joyce Mutinda also commended the Judiciary for allowing NGEC to audit them. She appealed to other arms of government to follow suit and undergo an audit on gender discrimination."I congratulate the Judiciary for achieving gender parity of 50/50 and also the inclusion of PWD," Mutinda said.
