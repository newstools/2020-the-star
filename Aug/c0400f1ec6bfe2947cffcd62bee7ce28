Gem MP Elisha Odhiambo has accused the Senate of failing the counties by the prolonged stalemate on the revenue allocation formula. Odhiambo said senators should have consulted earlier and reached consensus before the matter reached the floor of the House. The Senate has tried and failed seven times to agree on how Sh316 billion allocated to the 47 counties is shared. But Odhiambo said if the Senate was serious about the issue, they could have devised an equitable mechanism in the last three years. He added that politics is about consideration of the minority views and not the majority. “If you look at the Bill, it’s disadvantaging the Coast and the Northeastern regions, which have always been disadvantaged,” Odhiambo said. He said the Bill needs not divide Kenyans but to ensure unity for development. The Gem MP said counties such as Kisumu and Kiambu can attract private investors to invest heavily in essential services like health facilities unlike counties in Northeastern. Odhiambo said it's foolhardy to use population in revenue allocation formula for counties that are still struggling and favour the already developed counties. He said all Kenyans deserve to feel the fruits of devolution as they all pay taxes at all levels. Jane Kiriagai, the Commission on Revenue Allocation chairperson, said the existing gaps can only be bridged through an increase in the equitable share allocation to counties going forward. The adoption of the third formula will pave way for the enactment of CARA 2020-21 to avoid service disruption at the county level. It has been more than one year since the CRA tabled its recommendation for the third basis for revenue-sharing for consideration by the Senate.
