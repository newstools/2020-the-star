Mosques and churches in Garissa are breeding grounds for the coronavirus. That's what the county's Covid-19 committee has said, warning of stern action against the increasing number of people violating health protocols to prevent spread of the virus. Speaking to the Star on the phone, committee chairman Abdullahi Salat expressed alarm on Tuesday that most residents are slowly returning to the dangerous old ways of crowding together and not wearing masks. He also said most places of worship were not adhering to guidelines, including social distancing, to prevent spread of the virus. "We are seeing people getting close to each other in mosques and churches, in total disregard of the health guidelines. Unfortunately, our places of worship are the breeding grounds of the virus,” Salat said He said that the committee of the churches and mosques will hold people individually responsible for violating the guidelines. "We will not allow a few irresponsible people to put the lives of millions of Kenyans at risk," he said. On Monday, the Ministry of Health announced 52 new cases in Garissa, the county's highest single-day total. Reacting to the figure, Governor Ali Korane urged residents to observe physical distancing, avoid crowded places, wash their hands frequently and wear masks. “Only when we follow the guidelines will we be a safe society. Any ignorance and indifference will be catastrophic. Let us all be responsible and disciplined," Korane said. The national government and the county Health department are fumigating all government offices and compounds. Addressing the press outside his office, county commissioner Meru Mwangi said both county and national offices will be fumigated. "This disease is real, it is claiming lives and there is no known cure for now," Mwangi said. Among the offices that have been fumigated are the regional commissioner's office block that houses the county commissioner's office and most national government offices. (Edited by V. Graham)
