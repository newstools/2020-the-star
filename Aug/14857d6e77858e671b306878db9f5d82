Chang'aa brewers in Kisii have been asked to find alternative business activities or face arrest after the administrative authorities declared war on illicit alcohol. County commissioner Stephen Kihara on Sunday declared a crackdown on chang'aa brewing and asked chiefs and their assistants to work with police officers to arrest offenders. He said regular crackdowns will be carried out in notorious areas of Kiogoro, Boronyi and Bobaracho. “Those engaging in the illicit brew are advised to look for an alternative way of earning a living before the law catches up with them,” Kihara told the Star on the phone. He warned that stern action will be taken against administrators found taking bribes from the brewers to allow the business. Kihara lamented that some school children have taken to drinking chang’aa given that schools are closed because of Covid-19. “We cannot sit back and watch as the brewers sell changa’aa to school children. They should understand that it will not be business as usual,” the administrator said. His warning came after Kisii University chaplain Lawrence Nyaanga blamed the police for doing little to end chang'aa brewing in the region. Nyaanga accused police officers of taking bribes to allow the businesses to thrive.
