More than 100,000 residents in four major urban centres of Taita Taveta will be connected to piped water in a Sh2.5 billion project funded by the World Bank. Esther Mwanyumba, Water and Environment executive said the project will solve the acute shortage of the commodity in the area. It is also partly funded by the national government. Mwanyumba on Friday received the first batch of water pipes at the Tavevo Water and Sewerage Company offices in Voi. She said the department is committed to ensuring that the project funds are well utilised. “Residents who for a very long time had lacked better access to water and sanitation services due to inadequate, old and dilapidated infrastructure are set to benefit,” she said. She said besides the donor funds, the county has set aside money to rehabilitate and develop new water projects. Tavevo managing director David Ngumbao said his company will also get technical support as part of the project. “Tavevo will receive monitoring vehicles, water bowsers and exhauster trucks. All these will be vital in meeting our obligations and offering improved services,” Ngumbao told journalists in Voi. He said the project will supplement the existing water supply network as the county awaits the implementation of the multi-billion Mzima II water project. The Sh42 billion Mzima II water project will connect water to all the residents in the region, he said. The Mzima II project shall inject at least 65,000m3 per day thus fully addressing the perennial water shortage in Voi, Wundanyi, Taveta and Mwatate subcounties. The surplus will serve neighbouring Kwale county and the coastal city of Mombasa. “Once this project is complete, the problem of water shortage in Taita Taveta will be a thing of the past,” he said. It is among the government's flagship projects in the region. (edited by o. owino)
