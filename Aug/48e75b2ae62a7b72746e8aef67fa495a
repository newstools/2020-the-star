The voice that took you to echelons Of African affairs spoke in English  The voice that took you to summits Of Tanzanian affairs used Swahili  Today you rest near Ndanda hills Your voice is mute, listen William.  Perhaps the path is ready ahead For you now bear along it…..  Perhaps it is the shadow ahead That like the sun you follow it!  When the birds here and bards Sit still and listen to silence….  The sun will shed blue tears And in the skies echoes arise  Now to speak to us as you did Mkapa the skywalker, you are:  He who walks where suns set Touching hearts with words…..  Risala ya Rambi Rambi yake Mzee Mkapa  Iendapo mwanga, basi hapo giza hukaa Panapo matanga, kote chozi hutapakaa  Imepulizwa mbiu, ya mgambo wa anga Naona mie kiu, ya Mkapa leo tunaganga  Kaamka jabali, bondeni kwa waMakonde Mtwara mbali, walia wapiga nyoyo konde  Likatamba mbali, kisomi, kisiasa, kidiplomasia Likamwaga asali, ya hekima, kheri kama masia  Ikaja tetemeko, kifo mbona hauna huruma? Kanda msisimko, walia wote hadi Wasukuma  Leo nalilia wino, ya alotuachwa mwanga wetu Nasaga mie jino, naam Mkapa katoeka kati yetu  Njiwa pepeperuka, kwenye mawimbi ya Afrika Zifikishe Tanganyika, rambi rambi za East Africa!
