The Sol Generation family is set to expand this month after Polycarp Otieno, aka Fancy Fingers, announced his baby's due date. Polycarp said his wife, Lady Mandy, is expected to deliver their firstborn on Saturday. The baby's due date coincides with the day Sauti Sol will be launching the Midnight Train album. Polycarp acknowledged he has been asked what will happen should the baby arrive during the concert. He wrote, "Ok ok false alarm! Everyone asking what if the baby comes during our concert? 22nd August. 9pm (Which happens to be the due date, by the way). I guess we will just have to wait and see what happens." The much-hyped online concert is a celebration of the band's fifth album, 'Midnight Train', released on June 5.
