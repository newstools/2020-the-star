National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi on Wednesday cautioned MPs against making roadside declarations on issues raised with their respective offices. Muturi warned MPs against issuing such directives, saying they risk being booked for disorderly conduct as they do not have such powers. The speaker said any decision of a committee must be debated in the House and the same adopted for the same to apply. He said nothing stops any concerned MP or chairs of committees for that matter from reporting transgressions to investigative authorities.“Desist from issuing such declarations that we have stopped this, we have stopped that and so on,” Muturi told MPs. “You have no such authority. You have to bring a report to the House then the members will debate and adopt or reject the recommendations as they are or amend the same.” Muturi cited reports of MPs visiting projects to which they invite media crew and give instructions to concerned persons handling projects they provide oversight to. “Some of you are so excited about appearing on television giving instructions and so on. You have no such power. Come to the House with a report…convince your colleagues there is need to stop something,” he said. The speaker said the House works through resolutions made in plenary and not street declarations. Muturi spoke following sentiments by Kilifi North MP Owen Baya that a committee recommendation on investigations on an injustice reported to it can be taken up before a vote.
