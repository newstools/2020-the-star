More than 100 orphans from Nyanza and Western could be left homeless should Rang'ala orphanage close its doors for lack of funding. Sister in-charge Mary Esther Okome said the facility has been heavily relying on donors from the Netherlands and Germany but funding has declined because of the coronavirus. Okome said donor countries have diverted resources to support themselves, leaving the 20-year-old institution cash-strapped. She said they now rely on local well-wishers who are not consistent because they, too, are suffering. Some of the children at the facility were rescued from pit latrines, the streets or from neglect after death of parents. Okome asked the government for support. “Most of the humanitarian facilities like the children’s homes and homes of the elderly that majorly rely on well-wishers and faith-based institutions should be supported to operate,” she said. Sister Okemo spoke on Tuesday while receiving foodstuffs, sanitary towels, diapers and sanitiser, among other donations, from Flex Gym. Flex Gym manager Emmanuel Otieno said he responded to the distress calls from the facility management and lobbied for help from his clients. “We were touched by the food shortage story that had engulfed the orphanage and decided to donate the foodstuff to sustain the over 100 children at the orphanage,” Otieno said, promising to establish a kitty to support the children.
