The Kenya Urban Roads Authority has notified the public of an interruption of traffic flow along the Mbagathi Way this weekend. The interruption between August 28-29 from 6 am to 6 pmÂ will allow the contractor to install a footbridge truss. Motorists have been asked to use alternative routes during the time given to avoid inconveniences. Those who will be driving to CBD are advised to use the Muchai drive from Shell Petrol Station before joining Ngong Road. Alternatively, motorists will make a U-Turn before approaching to Shell Petrol Station and use Upper Hill-Mbagathi Link Road leading to Hospital Road. Kura has also recently finished installing footbridge at Outer Ring Road. The installation was carried out on August 23, causing traffic interruption during the day. Last Saturday, Thika Road motorists were stuck in traffic for more than two hours. The Kenya National Highways Authority (KeNHA) had announced that a section of the Thika Superhighway would be closed for five days starting August 21. The closure at the Garden City Mall that was in effect until August 25 was to allow for the erection of a footbridge.
