The body of a 51-year-old secondary school teacher is yet to be interred 60 days after her mysterious death, with the family blaming the police for the delay. Jane Waruguru Ihure Ngunjiri's decomposing body was found on the banks of Kamiti river along North Airport road on August 15. She had been missing since June 14, the day she left home to sign a cooperative loan guarantee form for a colleague at St Angela's Karura Girls High School, according to husband Samuel Ngunjiri Ndegwa. The retired Kenya Defence Forces major hopes to bury his wife of 20 years andÂ  mother of his three children at their Umbui village home in Mahiga, Othaya, on Saturday. The family says Waruguru should have been buried soon after the DNA test result showed the body was hers. But this was not to be as the police refused to release the body for interment, citing ongoing investigations. The Ndegwas pray that they will find closure on Saturday. The family had frantically searched for their loved one in hospitals and mortuaries. When the body was found and they positively identified her, the police demanded a DNA test. And even after the DNA test yield was 99.98 per cent positive, the police would not release the body to be transferred from the City Mortuary to the KU mortuary. Ndegwa accused the "DCI officers of still erecting roadblocks," and implied he might resort to swearing an affidavit for the High Court to issue a release order. "It is frustrating that after the two months of search, then grief, we cannot be given the body without hustle. It is sad," he said. Burial arrangements are taking place at the family's Ambosell Estate home in South C.  - mwaniki fm
