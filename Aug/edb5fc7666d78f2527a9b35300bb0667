More than 70 families have been asked to move out of Mugumoini village in Lari constituency to pave the way for the construction of a modern market. The county government of Kiambu told residents that the village sits in an area meant for a public market. Residents were illegally allocated those plots in the early 1990s. Trade and Industrialisation executive Kigo Njenga on Monday asked residents who have built in the area to demolish their houses and vacate the land so the contractor can start work. He said construction of the market, which will be funded by the national and county governments, will be built in three phases. The first phase will cost Sh11 million. Njenga spoke during a public participation session of the proposed market in Mugumoini village. Lari Kirenga MCA Joseph Karichu attended the meeting. During the meeting, some traders and residents opposed the move, urging the county government to look for alternative land to build the market. David Mungai, who opposed the idea, said the market would be built behind shops. "Why can't the government look for a better place near the highway?" Mungai asked. A tenant who lives in one of the buildings set for demolition asked the government to give them time to look for houses and move out. "We are confused since most of us are casual labourers in this centre. We don't know what to do or where to go," Joram Chege said. A representative of the Kikuyu Council of Elders, Thiong'o wa Gitau, urged residents to support the idea, saying the market will benefit generations to come. "This is a long term project. We do not know about tomorrow. I will also remove my house next week," Gitau, a retired chief, said. Edited by A.N
