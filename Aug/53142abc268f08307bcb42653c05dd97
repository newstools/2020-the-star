Suna East MP Junet Mohamed has threatened to sue former Kakamega Senator Boni Khalwale  for alleging that he has been paid money meant to fight coronavirus. Through his lawyers, Junet said Khalwale’s sentiments had caused him gross distress and embarrassment while subjecting him to grave panic, fear, mental anguish and pain. Junet said Khalwale, while attending a public gathering in Busia early in the month, had alleged that he had been paid by Kemsa money meant to mitigate Covid-19 effects. Khalwale further alleged that Homa Bay woman MP Gladys Wanga had been placed in the Finance committee to facilitate the deal. According to the lawyers, Khalwale claimed that President Uhuru Kenyatta should fire Health CS Mutahi Kagwe for allowing Covid-19 money to paid to Wanga, Jubilee’s Party Sec-Gen Raphael Tuju and Junet. “The statements in their ordinary meaning are calculated to mean our client is corrupt, dishonorable, unscrupulous, deceitful, untrustworthy, disreputable, unpatriotic a conspirator with others in the commission of criminal activities, immoral and above all a criminal,” read part of a demand letter seen by the Star. Junet said as a result of the "reckless egoistic, careless and defamatory statements clothed with unparalleled impunity", he has suffered injuries on his reputation while subjecting him further to public ridicule and odium. “Our firm mandatory instructions are to demand from you an immediate and unconditional withdrawal of the misplaced, wrong, malicious and illegal statements,” the demand letter said in part. According to Junet, Khalwale in the said withdrawal, should publish it in broadcast media and print of wide circulation across the country. "He should also tender an unconditional apology to our client after which the issue of quantum of damages and any other appropriate remedy may be discussed,” the lawyers said. The lawyers said if Khalwale does not meet the demands in three days, legal proceedings will be commenced against him.
