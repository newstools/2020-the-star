Nairobi City Stars' head coach Sanjin Alagic’s training approach convinced me to sign for the newly-promoted team, teenage midfielder Timothy Ouma has disclosed. The Kenyan Premier League returnees, christened Simba wa Nairobi, signed the former Laiser Hill Academy player on a long term deal. “I had been training with City Stars occasionally and I was blown away by the coaches’ approach to training," said Ouma. “I was asked to return after school and I am more than elated to have been considered and handed a contract ahead of next season,” an excited Ouma told the club’s website. Ouma, also known as Babu – same as another new signing Rowland Makati, is the Chapa Dimba Rift Valley Most Valuable Player, an accolade bestowed on him in early March 2020 at the Kericho Green Stadium after he led Laiser Hill past the dreaded Kapenguria Heroes to grab the regional title. During the final, which Laiser Hill won on post match penalties after a 1-1 scoreline in regulation time, Ouma endeared himself to Alagic. Prior to the tournament in Kericho, Ouma had been accompanying his sibling Elvis Noor Ojiambo for City Stars training during school holidays. City Stars’ team coordinator Samson Otieno: “He proved himself early when he attended our training sessions. Only schooling kept him away from us but he has since concluded his studies and can now focus on football.” “His qualities are there for everyone to see and we believe he will fit in well in the soonest time possible with the rest of the squad. We welcome him onboard,” added Otieno.
