Harmonize has revealed that Diamond Platnumz was the reason he broke up with actress Jacqueline Wolper. He said this to the crowd while performing in Dodoma over the weekend. "We had a party at Diamond Platnumz's place and without shame, she wanted Diamond to be her lover. She told Diamond she would bear a boy for him. At the time, Diamond only had a daughter, Latiffah," he said. "She told him she was with me (Harmonize) just to be close to him (Diamond)." He went on to narrate how Wolper was playing him with a Burundi man. "I went to the US and she went to Burundi, and there is a guy who was driving her and she told me that he was her brother," he said. "Before that, she went to China and I gave her TSh30 million to take stock for her fashion house. "And when she went there, she was with a man and she told me she could not date him. Right now, they are lovers, it means they started dating a long time ago." HarmonizeÂ  recounted when he surprised her with a German car. "I bought her a car worth TSh 15 million and when I was surprising her, the man from China called her and she had saved her 'My Love' on her phone. I was very hurt and angry. For the first time, I read her messages and got messages from different men." Edited by T Jalio
