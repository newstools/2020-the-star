The motion by Tharaka Nithi Senator Kithure Kindiki to adjourn a Senate sitting until arrested senators are freed was defeated on Monday evening. Kindiki had moved the motion pursuant to the House Standing Orders 105, 60(h) and 1, seeking adjournment of the Senate without Notice, until the release of three senators to allow them to discharge their duties. After voting, the two parties tied on 29-29 votes, hence the adjournment motion was lost. The adjournment would have been the second in one day following another adjournment on Monday morning pushed by Kithure Kindiki and supported by Minority Whip Mutula Kilonzo Jnr. Kakamega Senator Cleophas Malala, Bomet senator Christopher Langat and Samburu senator Steve Lelegwe were arrested on Monday. The three are among the team opposing the Third Basis revenue sharing formula which is yet to be decided by the Senate. The debate which was meant to decide the fate of the proposed revenue-sharing formula turned to a solidarity debate for the arrested senators. The majority of the senators called upon Speaker Ken Lusaka to restore the dignity of the House. "We and all others who believe in freedom as deeply as we do would rather die on our feet than live on our knees," Senator Murula Kilonzo said. More to follow...
