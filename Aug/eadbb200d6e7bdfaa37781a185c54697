Tragedy has struck former and late Changamwe MP Ramadhan Kajembe's family as his daughter passed on on Wednesday. Reports say that Langoni Kajembe, who had been admitted at Pandya Hospital and was in the ICU for weeks, succumbed in another suspected case of Covid-19. Langoni's death comes barely two weeks after the late Kajembe was buried, and a few weeks after both his first and second wife died. Sources say Langoni, the first daughter to the late MP, succumbed at 10pm Wednesday night. She had been on oxygen support. Kajembe's daughter was not able to attend to her father's burial due to her admission in hospital. He died on August 7 due to Covid-19 complications, barely two weeks after his wife succumbed to the same. The family had last week protested against Health CS Mutahi Kagwe's claims thatÂ  Kajembe's son refused to self isolate days after testing positive for the virus. The Star confirmed last week that at least four of Kajembe's children had tested positive for Covid-19. The late MP had sired a total of 16 children from two of his wives.
