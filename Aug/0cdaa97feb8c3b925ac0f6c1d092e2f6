"Ojwang, a defender, is expected to beef up our central defence department ahead of the 2020/21 season. "The defender has been with Stima for the better part of his career. He had a short stint with Gor Mahia in 2019 before returning his Kisumu-based side in January,” said the club on its official portal The stocky defender vowed to fire up the club's performance after an underwhelming campaign last season. “I am happy to join Wazito FC. This is an ambitious team and it’s an honour to be part of this great project. I am here to work hard and do my best for the team. To the fans, I want to promise them that we will deliver good results,” he stated. The club's head  coach Fred Ambani said the arrival of Ojwang would seal the loopholes at the rear.He praised the defender for his skills in stopping strikers and challenged him to work hard for him to realise his full potential. “Ojwang is a very good defender and definitely a good addition to the team. He is a good tackler, strong and very good in the air. He has all the qualities of a good defender and he can only get better,” said the former Kenyan international.
