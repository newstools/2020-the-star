Deputy President William Ruto has again said that he is not afraid of the so-called ‘deep state’ or 'system' which he says is determined to frustrate his presidential bid. Ruto said that if he was a coward, he and President Uhuru Kenyatta would not have formed the current government. “If President Uhuru and I were cowards, we won’t have formed the government under JP. We were threatened with various allegations, including our ICC cases by then, which was false,” Ruto said. The DP spoke on Tuesday at his Karen home where he hosted a delegation of community leaders from Kajiado South Constituency, led by MP Katoo Ole Metito and Senator Mary Seneta. His remarks are seen as a response to EALA MP Oburu Oginga that his brother and ODM leader, Raila Odinga, has ‘the system’ to propel him to power in 2022. It also comes after Jubilee vice-chairman David Murathe said Kenyans should prepare for a Raila presidency come 2022. Murathe had argued that Raila has struggled for the country and he should be rewarded. Ruto said that voters will determine the outcome, ruling out the influence of the ‘deep state and the system.’ “The same thing is happening today. We are being threatened that there is a system, a deep state, that our votes will not count even if we vote in big numbers," he said. "That there are certain people sitting somewhere who will decide.” Ruto added that voters will have the final say in the 2022 General Election. The DP urged elected leaders to stand firm against any forces that may be keen on derailing the efforts to meet their election pledges. “As elected leaders, we must stand firm against any forces that may be keen on derailing our efforts to fulfilling our election pledges. We must rededicate our energies to service delivery and uniting our nation without fear of intimidation and blackmail.” On August 6, the DP held a development meeting with political and religious leaders from Narok and had earlier met some politicians from Nyamira.
