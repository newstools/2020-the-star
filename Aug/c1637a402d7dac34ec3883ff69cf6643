President Uhuru Kenyatta's virtual speech was on Monday interrupted after a participant failed to mute his microphone. Uhuru  was presiding over the closure of the Covid-19 conference on Zoom that involved stakeholders drawn across the country. As he was in the middle of his speech, the man by the name Hubert Perr was heard talking in the background. "We will make sure that our country is ready for any terror or any disaster..." Uhuru said before he was interrupted. Perr who was not quite audible said: "Sir, Sunday you went for ....yesterday." Uhuru responded, "Thank you.. I am finishing if that is what your problem is." But with this response, the man, who was still unaware of what was going on went on to ask a question. "Which place are you going?" Perr posed. Uhuru said, " Who am I talking to? A Hubert Perr somebody, nyamaza kidogo nimalize ile nasema (keep quiet so I finish what I was saying)," A Google search reveals Perr to be an expert in budget support and private sector development. During his speech, the President directed the Ministry of Health to come up with a transparent mechanism through which all tenders and procurement done by Kemsa are available online within the next 30 days. "The ministry should come up with a transparent, open method through which tenders done by Kemsa are available online," he said. Uhuru said the ministry should do this for transparency purposes. "...so that we can see who has awarded the tender and who was evaluated among others," he said. "This is an issue to all government procurement departments.. we need to work together .. " Technology struggles did not only affect the President - DP William Ruto was also cut short after his screen went off.
