Justice James Makau has temporarily stopped Education CS George Magoha from implementing the Community Based Learning Project that was to be launched countrywide. He certified urgent a case filed by a parent seeking to bar Magoha from implementing community based learning. Joseph Aura had argued as a parent since the state ordered for closure of schools due to Covid-19 in March, his children and others across the country have been at home indefinitely. He also wanted the CS compelled to reopen schools for third term. “I have lodged these proceedings as a parent on behalf of my children and on behalf of millions of voiceless children enrolled similarly in learning institutions across the country,” Aura says. The father of three says in-person learning is the best when it comes to the education of children rather than virtual or any other method. Aura wants the court to order Magoha reopen all schools from September this year for the next academic term. He further wants the court to compel Health CS Mutahi Kagwe to reopen of all play areas and recreational centres for all children across the country. “The oppressive psychological and mental torture inflicted on the school going children because of the open-ended closure of schools effected by the ministry from March till now has gravely injured them,” reads the court documents. Through Lawyer Harrison Kinyanjui, Aura says many countries who had high number of Covid-19 cases have since reopened their schools and Kenya should also follow suit. Some of counties he cited include France, Japan, Nigeria, Tanzania, Senegal, Gambia, Namibia, Ghana among others even though some opened partially for finalists.
