A poor family from Esikoma village in Butula subcounty, Busia, is appealing to Good Samaritans to assist them raise Sh500,000 for the treatment of a six-month-old child they say has not passed stool for the past four months. Speaking to the Star at their home on Sunday, the mother Catherine Akinyi and father Paul Onyango said they are unable to raise the money for corrective surgery at Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital in Eldoret. Akinyi said medics at Busia County Referral Hospital gave her son drugs that briefly brought some relief but the condition persisted thereafter. "We were referred to Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital but since we were not in a position to raise the required money, we have no alternative but to stay at home with our ailing child," she said. Onyango said the baby cries a lot due to pain forcing them to spend sleepless nights. "We are appealing to well-wishers to come to our help or else we will lose our child," said Onyango. Marachi Central MCA Partick Obuya called upon Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital administration to admit the child as the family looks for the money. Well-wishers can send a donation to the family through 0742098792. Edited by Henry Makori
