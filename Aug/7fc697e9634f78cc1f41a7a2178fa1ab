A whopping 90 per cent of people tested for Covid-19 in three US states in July carried barely any traces of the virus, and there is a likelihood that tests are 'too sensitive', according to experts. According to an article on the Daily Mail, health experts say PCR testing - the most widely used in the US - is too sensitive. Kenya also uses PCR testing rather than other forms such as antibody tests. The experts said there is a need for the tests to be adjusted to rule out people who have insignificant amounts of the virus in their systems for it to be contagious. Meanwhile, a majority of U.S. states have rejected President Donald Trump administration's Covid-19 testing guidance, according to Reuters. At least 33 states continue to recommend testing people who have been exposed to Covid-19 and have no symptoms, spurning guidance published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) last week that said testing may be unnecessary. Sixteen states did not immediately respond to requests for comment and North Dakota said it had not made a decision. Among the states breaking with the federal government are conservative-leaning Texas, Oklahoma and Arizona. Public health experts said a rupture of this magnitude with the CDC may be unprecedented and shows deepening distrust of the Trump administration and its response to the pandemic.
