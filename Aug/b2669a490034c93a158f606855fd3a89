KFC has suspended its 64 year old slogan, 'Finger lickin good' temporarily because it "doesn't feel quite right" with the Covid-19 guidelines. The slogan was blurred out on the latest advertising posters on the fried chicken chain company's YouTube page. Officials say the slogan will return 'when the time is right'. "We find ourselves in a unique situation — having an iconic slogan that doesn't quite fit in the current environment,"global chief marketing officer at KFC,  Catherine Tan-Gillespie said in a statement according to CNN. "While we are pausing the use of ‘It’s Finger Lickin’ Good’, rest assured the food craved by so many people around the world isn’t changing one bit."
