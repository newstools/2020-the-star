The Food and Agriculture Organization has in the last three years invested Sh19,596,681 to help 1,087 youths from Kiambu county start agribusiness projects. Through the Rural Youth Migration, Social Protection and Value Chain Development project, the youths from 58 groups are now rearing chickens and pigs, and growing indigenous vegetables, herbs and spices. Beneficiaries get seeds, fertiliser, livestock (poultry, pig), vaccines and other equipment to support production at farm level. Governor James Nyoro said on Monday that the youths from six subcounties – Kabete, Gatundu North, Gatundu South, Githunguri, Lari and Limuru – have also been trained on organisational development, good agricultural practices and community banking schemes. "To complement the effort of the youths, the project has adopted the Farmer Field School (FFS) approach, where farmers learn by doing. This is being done through the establishment of demonstration sites," Nyoro said. Beneficiary Regina Wanjiku from Kiganjo ward, Gatundu South, said the project has helped her acquire 800 one-month-old chicks. “We are grateful for the intense training on poultry and other value chains which we hope will turn us into future millionaires,” Wanjiku, a member of Gitare Good Hope Youth Group, said. Faith Njoki, a member of Pillars of Shakaina Youth Group from Githunguri subcounty, has also acquired 500 one-month-old chicks with the help of the project. "The training helps us to manage our ventures.” In June this year, Agriculture CAS Ann Nyaga visited several agribusiness ventures driven by young people in Kiambu, where she reiterated government's commitment to assisting the youth overcome challenges they face when starting income generating activities. She said the ministry has rolled out programmes to help the youth access markets, affordable financing and information. Edited by A.N
