The government has set up a Sh650 million kitty to issue low-interest loans to small and medium enterprises. Industrialisation, Trade and Enterprise Development CAS Lawrence Karanja said no collateral will be required. He spoke during a tour of Malindi Constituency Industrial Development Centre on Monday. Karanja said his tour was meant to inform jua kali artisans in the town of the fund. "The fund is meant to cater to the people who cannot access funding from the banks in a conventional way," he said. Karanja said the ministry has bought equipment worth Sh500 million to be distributed to the artisans through their associations. The equipment will be distributed according to the needs of each association. "The equipment include machines used in woodwork, vehicle spraying, welding and embroidery, among others," he said. Karanja said the government will help SMEs market their products through the Brand Kenya Board. Famau Mohamed Famau, chairman of Malindi Jua Kali Association, urged the government to support SMEs since they drive the economy. "We thank the government for the move but we still need more support to benefit the economy," he said. Edited by Josephine M. Mayuya
