A non governmental organisation has accused parents of being the cause of teenage pregnancies across the country. The Shinning Hope for Communities (SHOFCO) CEO Kennedy Odede said the organisation’s clinics in Kibera have recorded over 200 pregnancies involving teenagers in the past two months. “The over 200 cases are the ones we know so far. There are those we do not know. We are a losing a generation and this should worry all of us,” he said. Speaking during a webinar on Tuesday , Odede said there is need for all community stakeholders including the church to come together and address the crisis. “It is the right moment to ask ourselves if there is a crisis. And if there is, we need to do away with our beliefs and call even the pastors to talk to our children. We need to listen to the teenagers too,” he added. “Some parents are traumatizing their children. Parents should not pretend that children above five years of age do not know what they do at night. So as they grow up, they want to experiment it." He emphasized on the need for sex education among children from a tender age. “Sex education is very important. Parents should stop telling their children, babies are bought. We need to change the way we are communicating with our children. The role of the parents and guardians is to speak the truth,” he said. With schools closed and many source of livelihoods disrupted due to coronavirus pandemic, there have been upsurge in teenage pregnancies across the country. During the discussion, many girls attributed too much free time to the spike in pregnancies among the teenagers. The prevalence rate of teenage pregnancies is high in the informal settlements.
