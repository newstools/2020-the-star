Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni has released a second home workout video in a bid to encourage people to keep fit at home during the coronavirus pandemic. The 75-year-old appears jogging barefoot in a spacious living room, before performing 40 push-ups as a younger voice counts. He said it was a challenge to his bazukulu - an informal Ugandan reference to youth, but which some people find patronising. Here is the video: President Museveni released a similar workout in April after he had banned outdoor exercise to curb the spread of the virus. The ban was lifted in June. In the video, the president, barefoot, starts off by jogging around the room to warm up. He then gets down to do 21 press-ups in one go, as his press team counts along. He does 30 press-ups in total. On Wednesday, the president banned exercise in public as a control measure against coronavirus, after videos and photos of people working out in groups around the capital Kampala were posted on social media, despite the country being in a lockdown. This is not the first time the president has brought his own health into focus. The President told the nation last year that he had lost 30kg (five stone) because he had started to focus on his health and fitness. In January Mr Museveni walked 200 km (125 miles) through the Luweero triangle, where he had his bases as he fought the war that brought him to power. The country is set for an election in January 2021 and the electoral commission has banned campaign rallies, urging candidates to reach to their supporters through TV and radio instead
