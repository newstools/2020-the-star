Delivery firm, Glovo, has reported an increase in deliveries and cashless payments on its platform since the onset of Covid-19 in Kenya. The Barcelona-based startup applied a raft of protective and precautionary measures to its delivery operations at the beginning of the pandemic as the company prioritised the safety of its customer, couriers and partners. During this period, Glovo saw cashless payments made by bank card increase by 50 per cent and mobile payments by 14 per cent in Kenya. Regarding deliveries, grocery orders in Kenya rose by 30 per cent, while the company also saw a 25 per cent increase in the sale of cleaning agents and hygiene products. A report by global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company dubbed “Meet the next-normal consumer” revealed significant changes in shopping consumer preferences with an increase in e-commerce deliveries and general digital services. In a bid to cushion consumers from the ravages of Covid-19, Glovo partnered with Naivas Supermarkets to offer free deliveries. It also partnered with Standard Chartered Bank and MasterCard to encourage the use of electronic payments as safe platforms for transactions and to facilitate contactless deliveries between the customers and Glovo riders thus mitigate the spread of the virus. “With the increased consumption of digital services worldwide, we will continue to see a sustained momentum of Kenyans still embracing online delivery services and other e-commerce platforms going forward even as the economy now reopens. During this period, we have witnessed changes in shopping patterns due to the shift in preferences by consumers in the country hence this has helped us to focus more on addressing what the consumer needs.” said Priscilla Muhiu, General Manager, Glovo Kenya.
