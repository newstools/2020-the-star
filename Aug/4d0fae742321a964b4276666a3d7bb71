The idea of abolishing boarding schools is misguided. In boarding schools, children learn effectively away from their parents or guardians. They have the opportunity to interact with others and to become independent. At the end of the day, they are able to stand on their own two feet and face whatever challenges life throws at them. Boarding schools help to foster a national identity in our children as they interact with people from all corners of the republic, not just folk from their villages. In boarding schools children have a lot of time to concentrate on their studies, to do their homework and revise. At home, children spend a lot of time running errands for their parents or guardians, even their neighbours. This makes it difficult for them to concentrate on their studies. In boarding schools, children are sheltered from many societal ills. Some parents are too busy to offer guidance to their children, many of whom end up developing antisocial behaviour. Besides, most parents have little or no training on how to handle adolescents, while teachers have the skills and tools to guide teenagers. Such guidance can be found in boarding schools where teachers have more time with our children. Whoever supports the abolition of boarding schools is misguided. We are not saying day schools are bad, but if parents can afford to take their children to boarding school, why bar them? I disagree with Kenya National Union of Teachers boss Wilson Sossion, who supports the abolition of boarding schools. His explanation is inadequate. There is nothing wrong with having boarding and day schools. The Shinyalu MP, and educationist, spoke to the Star
