Malindi MP Aisha Jumwa has been released on a sh2 million cash bail and an alternative Sh5 million bond. Mombasa chief magistrate Edna Nyaloti on Monday said the court could not deny the MP bond as she was not a flight risk and the prosecution had not proven so. Nyaloti said Jumwa might be harbouring bigger political ambitions and therefore the court could not stand as a stumbling block to her dreams. "I have considered the submissions from the prosecution and also the defense counsels. I have also considered the laws on bond and bail.The accused is an MP and therefore she is not flight risk,"said Nyaloti. Jumwa was charged with six counts including money laundering, acquiring proceeds of a crime, conflict of interests as well as fraud. The court further reviewed bond terms of six accused persons charged on Friday. Nyaloti reduced their bond from Sh5 million to Sh2 million as well as the cash bail from Sh2 million to Sh500,000. She said the terms will be further reviewed downwards if the accused fail to raise the bond. The matter will be mentioned on September 21.
