Two boys who went missing late last month in Ngarariga village, Limuru subcounty, were on Wednesday evening found dead in Manguo swamp. The bodies of 13-year-old John Njenga and 10-year-old Kevin Kariuki were found by boys who had gone to the swamp to swim. Residents called police and St John Ambulance officials to retrieve the bodies. Njenga’s grandmother Eunice Mumbi said her grandson was with Kariuki when he went missing on July 25 in the evening. “Residents told us they had seen three boys herding sheep near the area on the day the two went missing. However, Njenga and Kariuki never came back home. The other boy returned home with the sheep. He is a neighbour but I can't recall his name,” she said. Mumbi said the third boy told them that Njenga and Kariuki had asked him to accompany them to Manguo swamp, but he declined. He told them he would be punished by his parents for leaving the sheep unattended. “We want the police to investigate the incident since we have been left with so many unanswered questions." Ngarariga chief Michael Kang’ethe said the families of the missing boys had gone as far as Maai Mahiu in search for them. Limuru police boss Joseph Ireri said they are investigating the incident. “We have people who have reported missing children, but as of now we have to do identification, DNA tests and postmortems since the bodies were decomposing,” he said.
