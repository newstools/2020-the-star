Deputy President William Ruto has urged all the civil servants to deliver services to Kenyans without bias. Ruto said the government was elected to serve the interest of the people and not that of leaders. He spoke on Thursday during a prayer meeting with religious leaders from Kiambu at his Karen home. “The government does not serve the interest of leaders. It serves the aspirations of its people, the millions of Kenyans and that is the government that we believe in and that is the government that we elected,” Ruto said. “I want to tell every public officer and every police officer in Kenya that they must serve professionally in accordance within the Constitution and the law and nobody should blackmail or intimidate them to run political errands or political agenda for anybody.” The DP had earlier ctiricised the arrest of three senators on Monday when the Senate was debating on the revenue sharing formula to counties. He said that the abuse of police and the criminal justice to bully citizens, threaten and intimidate leaders and blackmailing the senate was wrong. The three were Cleophas Malala (Kakamega), Christopher Lang’at (Bomet) and Samburu senator Steve Lelegwe. They were all interrogated at their counties before being released. Appearing before the Senate Security Committee on Wednesday to answer the arrest of three senators, Interior CS Fred Matiang’i ruled out that the arrest was in connection with the ongoing revenue debate. The CS was accompanied by the Inspector General of Police Hillary Mutyambai and the Director of Criminal Investigations George Kinoti. ODM leader Raila Odinga condemned the arrest, warning the state agents against actions that would claw back the hard-won democratic space in the country. "The warlords need to stop beating the drums of war or financing the divisive rhetoric and our legislators involved in this matter need to search their souls in all honesty and put public good above private gain," Raila said.
