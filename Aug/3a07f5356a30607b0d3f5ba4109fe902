Gospel singer Christina Shusho says most women prefer having a guy who protects and cares for them as their father did. Speaking on her YouTube channel, Shusho said when a woman leaves her father’s home, the pain they feel is noteworthy, and the man who becomes their husband should transition into that father-figure role himself. "Close the gap created when she leaves her father’s house. Become the father figure she is missing and love her without holding back," Shusho said. The 'Unikumbuke' singer said most marriages experience troubles due to a lack of knowledge from the man’s part. Shusho left her marriage and even left her husband’s church after she claimed God gave her an assignment, adding that she and her husband had a sober discussion on why each of them needed to go their separate ways.
