A section of senators now back a blend of Nairobi Senator Johnson Sakaja's proposal and his Meru counterpart Mithika Linturi amendments as the only solution to the revenue sharing formula stalemate. Linturi had proposed further amendments to the Sakaja's proposal which is currently before the Senate. The Meru senator's amendments retains most of parameters in the Sakaja's formula but only seek to to reduce base from the proposed Sh316 billion to the new base of between Sh250 billion and Sh270 billion. The team said any amount above the agreed base will be subjected to the Sakaja formula. "We are supporting an amendment sponsored by Linturi which is a further amendment to the one sponsored by Sakaja," Elgeyo Marakwet senator Kipchumba Murkomen said in a statement on Friday. Murkomen admitted that there has been protracted engagement in the Senate concerning the basis for allocating among counties. He said the exact amount of the amendment shall be agreed upon once the negotiations are complete. "Anything above the agreed figure as indicated above shall be shared using the formula proposed by the Senator Sakaja," Murkomen said. Sakaja was tasked to work with Linturi in consultation with other senators to ensure that they give the final document on or before Monday. Both Senators will agree on how to co-sponsor the approved version. "We believe that the proposed solution(s) will bring to an end the prolonged debate on this matter and that on Tuesday, 11th August, 2020 the Senate will pass the final version unanimously," Murkomen said. We appreciate the people of Kenya for exercising patience as we navigate through these complex negotiations on resource allocation. Senators Ledama Olekina (Narok) and Agnes Zani (nominated) were among senators who attended the Friday briefing at a Nairobi hotel.
