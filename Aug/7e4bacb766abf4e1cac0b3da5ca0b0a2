Ronald Koeman has been named the new head coach of Barcelona two days after the club sacked Quique Setien. The 57-year-old left his role as Netherlands boss, with two years left on his contract, to sign a two-year deal with the Spanish giants. He played for Barcelona between 1989 and 1995, helping them to four league titles and the European Cup. The Catalans finished second in La Liga last season, failing to win a trophy for the first time since 2007-08. The five-point gap to champions Real Madrid and the humiliating 8-2 defeat by Bayern Munich in their Champions League quarter-final last week culminated in the dismissal of Setien on Monday. The club also announced Ramon Planes as the new technical director. He was the assistant to Eric Abidal, who left his role as sporting director on Tuesday.
