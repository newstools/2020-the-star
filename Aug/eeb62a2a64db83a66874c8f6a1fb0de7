A group of Wajir MCAs have filed a notice to impeach Wajir Governor Mohamed Abdi. The notice was filed by Benane Ward MCA Abdi Mohamed Sheikh in a document dated August 7. The MCAs accuse Abdi of gross misconduct. However, Abdi denies the accusations, saying he remains the governor. In February, Abdi told a Nairobi court that he did not order the withdrawal of Sh25 million. He was testifying in a case in which three county officials were accused of conspiracy to defraud the county of Sh26.1 million.
