An Ethiopian court on Wednesday ordered the release of Kenyan journalist Yasin Juma. Juma was reportedly working for an Ethiopian opposition leader when he was arrested. Sources indicate Kenyaâ€™s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been working behind the scenes to secure his release. OMN journalist Melese Diribsa and three other individuals have also been granted bail. This is after police failed to present evidence to prove they committed a crime according to their defence team. Juma had been arrested following protests over the assassination of popular singer Hachalu Hundessa which led to more than 80 deaths. Juma was arrested last month and is facing charges including incitement and involvement in violence
