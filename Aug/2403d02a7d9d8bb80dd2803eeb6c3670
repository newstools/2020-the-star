Isiolo Governor Mohamed Kuti has hailed senators who have defended the interests of counties in the contentious revenue-sharing formula. He urged the Senate to put the nation first to resolve the stalemate to avoid stalling operations.  Addressing Journalists in at Isiolo hotel, Kuti said once elected, leaders should commit themselves to taking care of the interests of the whole nation and adopt an approach that ensures the country remains united. The governor noted that any formula that makes some people feel like winners and others like losers will end up dividing the nation. The ongoing stalemate at the Senate has led to adjournments for a record nine times, as the House formed a 12-member committee to come up with a formula that will be favored by a clear majority of senators. He said that even if the formula arrived at increases funding to Isiolo but reduces funding to any other county, it would not be pleasant "as only a win-win formula will leave a united nation". Kuti, however, expressed optimism the Senate committee will soon come up with a formula that will lead to a breakthrough so that devolved units can start receiving funding to pay health workers who are on the frontline in the Covid-19 fight. The governor, who also chairs the Health committee at the Council of Governors, said the deadlock is happening at a time when county governments desperately need money to improve their preparedness to handle the pandemic.
