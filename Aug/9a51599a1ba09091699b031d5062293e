New Catholic bishop of Kitui Joseph Mwongela was on Saturday installed in a colourful ceremony at St Charles Lwanga School grounds. The ceremony was led by Apostolic Nuncio to Kenya Hurbertus Van Megen. All parishes in Kitui sent 25 representatives. Mwongela was appointed by Pope Francis in March this year but due to Covid-19, his enthronement had to be delayed. The function was earlier slated to take place on August 8 but was pushed to August 29, 2020, due to the spike in Covid-19 infections in the country. In a letter dated July 30 and addressed to religious men and women as well as all Christians of the Catholic Diocese of Kitui, Archbishop Antony Muheria said the delay in the installation of the bishop was meant to allow at least 1,000 people to attend the ceremony. “In view of the pronouncement by His Excellency the President and of other considerations, it has become clear that we can only hold our celebration as planned on the 8th of August with a maximum of 100 people attending,” wrote Muheria, Mwongela's predecessor. Archbishop Muheria said the new bishop faced a Herculean task in his new responsibility. He prayed that he will be guided by God’s grace to perform to expectation. The Saturday event brought together religious leaders, politicians and government leaders. Among those present were His Eminence Cardinal John Njue and Bishop Mwongela’s predecessor Antony Muheria, who is the Nyeri Archbishop. Also present were governors Charity Ngilu (Kitui), Alfred Mutua (Machakos) and Makueni's Kivutha Kibwana. Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa, Kenya ambassador to Uganda Kiema Kilonzo, former Kitui Governor Julius Malombe and former Nairobi Deputy Governor Jonathan Mueke were present. Others were Kitui Senator Enoch Wambua, Kitui Central MP Makali Mulu, his Kitui West counterpart Edith Nyenze and former Mwingi West MP Benard Kitungi.
