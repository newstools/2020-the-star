Former Likoni MP Masoud Mwahima, who succumbed pn Monday night following asthma complications, was buried on Tuesday. Mwahima, 78, was buried after 1pm prayer at a family graveyard in Vyemani. The graveyard is about 100 metres from his home. Hundreds of mourners showed up at Mwahima's home as early as 11am. Mwahima's firstborn son, Mohammed Mwahima, eulogised his father as a peace-loving person. He said the former legislator has left a legacy. "He built schools, hospitals, roads. He will be remembered by many Likoni residents," he said. He said Mwahima was jovial. "He went to Mombasa town, visited Blue Room Restaurant and Pwani Dishes," he said. Former Kisauni MP Rashid Bedzimba said he was with Mwahima in the 11th Parliament. "We are here to condole with the family. He was a very moderate person and understanding," said Bedzimba. President Uhuru Kenyatta, through a speech read on his behalf by Likoni Deputy County Commissioner Francis Kazungu, said Mwahima was a great grassroots mobiliser. He said Mwahima helped his government purchase the Waitiki farm and settled thousands of Likoni residents.
