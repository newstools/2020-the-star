Two robbery with violence suspects have been arrested after luring the public with fake nursing job alerts. Martin Wabale and Richard Wafula were arrested by a team of detectives based at Langata and Karen on Monday. DCIÂ  director George Kinoti via Twitter on Monday said a man was lured to a deserted street in Karen-Miotoni road where he was robbed. The two took his mobile phone, a glucometer, a dust coat, cash among other valuables at gunpoint. "The two suspects who fled from Nairobi after the incident were arrested at Kimilili in Bungoma County," DCI said. Kinoti said the two are believed to belong to a wider syndicate that operates by luring victims to lucrative job vacancies. "...and after the victims show up, they direct them to secluded areas whereby they rob them at gunpoint," he said. "Further check on their social media pages reveal public outcry from victims." Last week, two men were charged with two counts of gang rape and robbery with violence. Gideon Mwangi and Sunny Mugendi denied the charges before Kibera senior principal magistrate Derrick Kuto. In the first count, Mwangi and Mugendi are accused of robbing Pricillah Irungu of her mobile phone valued at Sh1,800, Sh500 in cash, a jacket valued at Sh1,000, and a pair of open shoes worth Sh500 in Githurai. They were armed with knives during the alleged robbery.
