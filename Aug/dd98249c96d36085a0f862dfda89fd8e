Casual workers and support staff in Kirinyaga county hospitals have been trained on how to protect themselves from contracting Covid-19. Governor Anne Waiguru said the county government requested Kenyatta National Hospital to train the workers, so they can protect themselves as well as patients from getting infected. The casual workers and support staff were trained alongside 92 technical health workers and 80 non-technical staff from Kerugoya County Referral Hospital, and Kianyaga, Sagana, Kimbimbi, Thiba and Baricho health centres. KNH chief executive officer Evanson Kamuri said infection prevention and control is one of the most effective ways of combating coronavirus.  Edited by A.N
