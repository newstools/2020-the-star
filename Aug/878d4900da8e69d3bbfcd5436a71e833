The youth have been urged to make good use of the available opportunities offered through government programmes. Youth Affairs CAS Nadia Ahmed said the national government is committed to advance the youth agenda though programmes such as Kazi Mtaani, Youth Enterprise Development Fund, Ajira Digital Youth Empowerment Programme and Presidential Digital Talent Development Youth Programme. She spoke ahead of International Youth Day on Wednesday. Ahmed said the youth are the key drivers towards the realisation of the Big Four agenda, Vision 2030 and other development programmes. “The government remains committed to all efforts directed at the realisation of the youth potential in nation-building in line with our Constitution,” She said. Kajiado Governor Joseph Lenku and Gender CS Margaret Kobia urged the youth to take advantage of the digital revolution during the Covid-19 pandemic to create jobs. "Formal employment is currently diminishing and I ask the youth to be job creators and not jobseekers. Maximise the new digital revolution posed by the Covid-19 pandemic," Lenku said. Kobia said the rise in teenage pregnancies and gender-based violence needs a multi-agency consultation approach. "Covid-19 came with a lot of misfortunes. A lot of jobs have been lost and poverty levels are increasing in the country. This is why we are seeing a rise in these cases,"she said. Edited by A.N
