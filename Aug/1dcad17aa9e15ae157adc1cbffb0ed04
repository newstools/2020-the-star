President Uhuru Kenyatta should resolve a several decades-old land dispute at the Mwea settlement scheme, a former advisor to Embu Governor Martin Wambora has said. Joshua Kanake lamented that the land dispute at the scheme started way back in the 1970s but has never been resolved. He said the last attempts to resolve the issue in 2016 and the land be distributed to 7,232 beneficiaries were met with violence leading to one death and the maiming of eight others. The process was subsequently stopped by Interior CS Fred Matiang'i and his Lands counterpart Faridah Karoney. He said settlers who have been living in the land for decades were left out and most of the land given to rich outsiders. “The President recently issued out thousands of title deeds to Nairobi residents including Embakasi which have been under dispute for many years. May I remind him that we also have the Mwea settlement scheme over which a dispute has lingered for decades yet no title deeds have ever been issued. I urge him to intervene,” Kanake said in Embu on Saturday. Kanake expressed disappointment that elected leaders have been silent over the land issue as the squatters suffer.
