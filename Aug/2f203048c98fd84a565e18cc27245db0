Two Nyandarua county employee died on Monday after an ambulance they were in crashed on Gilgil-Nyahururu road. Jane Nyawira Ndarathi (nurse) and Peter Thairu (driver) were returning to Ol Kalou after making a referral to Kenyatta National Hospital. Thairu lost control of the vehicle at Karunga, Gilgil. Gilgil subcounty police commander John Onditi said the two died on the spot after the ambulance rammed into a culvert near Ngechu Secondary School during the 3am accident. They sustained head wounds and multiple fractures and the ambulance was extensively damaged. Onditi said the driver must have been speeding and lost control while avoiding a pothole. Nyandarua Health executive Njenga Mungai said the two left JM Kariuki Memorial Hospital for KNH at 8pm on Sunday. He said it was a sad moment for the county to lose dedicated employees, especially at this time of the coronavirus. Mungai said the county administration and medical fraternity will join hands, support and mourn with the bereaved families. Meanwhile, anger is simmering at JM Kariuki Hospital, with talk of a possible demonstration following the deaths. Some medics say the accident could have been avoided had the driver, who doubles as a morgue attendant, not been overworked. Members of staff who sought anonymity said Thairu, who had worked as a casual for more than 10 years, had complained of exhaustion, having been on duty for several days, and pleaded to be allowed to rest, but nobody listened to him. “When you are a casual employee, nobody listens to you. If you defy the orders, you are escorted to the gate and told to never return,” one medic said.
