Speaker Ken Lusaka has asked the Senate Security committee to summon Interior CS Fred Matiang'i, IG Hillary Mutyambai and other relevant officials by Wednesday over the arrest of three senators. "...the committee should summon them by Wednesday ," he said during senate proceedings on Monday. This was after Senator Yusuf Haji said that CSs who were told to appear in the Senate claimed that they were on leave. "They've sent an SMS and one of the officers at the office of the CS did inform us that the CS is on 10-day leave which was given by the President, therefore he was not available," Yusuf said. "And by extension, the PS, the IG and the DCI cannot come without being accompanied by the minister. Therefore the committee decided to report accordingly. Mr. Speaker you can give us further direction." Steve Lelegwe (Samburu), Christopher Langat (Bomet) and Cleophas Malala (Kakamega) were arrested on Monday before they could appear to take a vote on the revenue sharing formula. Makueni Senator Mutula Kilonzo Jnr told the speaker to be strict, adding that the issue is contemptuous. "We will not live on our knees. If you direct that we proceed there will be chaos. We cannot proceed when senators are being taken across the country on the highway," he said. "This is not a laughing matter. We must speak as a Senate. Enforce your direction my speaker. You are not an inferior person to the CS." Senator Kithure Kindiki said theÂ report by the security committee was extremely underwhelming. "The Parliament of Kenya must face the Executive head-on. The Parliament must face the Judiciary head-on. There's no way we are going to entertain any arm of government to run this institution, we will not allow it."
