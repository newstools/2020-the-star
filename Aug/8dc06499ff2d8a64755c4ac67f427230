Nigerian superstar Patoranking is set to release his first single off his upcoming album. Patoranking says 'Abule' is all with the theme of representing and protecting your hood. “I’m proud to be from my abule, Ebute Metta, because to have made it coming from there, it’s only by God’s grace,” he said. "It’s made me who I am today and it’s part of my story. So I waste no opportunity to let people know about my ghetto. I feel it’s important through this new song to give my fans a chance to celebrate their own abules. And to protect their abules, too." His album is called 'Three', denoting the three themes love, life and happiness. "If you are listening to any of the tracks, even if it is a dance track, I want you to feel love,” he said.
