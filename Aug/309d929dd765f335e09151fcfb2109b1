The national government has commissioned two key jetties in Lamu that have been under construction for the past one year. The Sh48 million Manda airport jetty and the Sh35 million Lamu mangrove terminal jetty were commissioned on Tuesday in an event presided over by Transport CAS Wavinya Ndeti. Jetties are a crucial arm of Lamu’s water transport system as they are the main entry and exit points for passengers and cargo to Lamu town and adjacent islands. The launch comes as a great relief to over 10,000 water transport users who have had to contend with difficulties while the jetties were under construction. The national government is constructing the Sh599 million Mokowe customs jetty, which is 53 per cent complete. The Sh72 million Mtangawanda jetty in Lamu East has been completed and awaits commissioning. Ndeti said the government had enough cash for improving Lamu's infrastructure. “Apart from the jetties whose construction is ongoing in various parts of Lamu, the government has also prioritised building of a new jetty in front of the King Fahad Hospital. Works on the new jetty will begin anytime,” she said. The Sh599 million Mokowe customs jetty, the largest in the region that is under construction, will be ready by February next year, according to chief structural engineer in the State Department of Public Works Hillary Nyaanga.
