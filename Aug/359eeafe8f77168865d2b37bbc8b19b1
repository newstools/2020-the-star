@robertomollo3 Homa Bay clerics have formed a council to oversee the implementation of Covid-19 protocols in worship places. The Homa Bay County Interfaith Council will monitor how both Christians and Muslims ensure a minimum of 100 masked people attend services, sessions last one hour and management provides sanitation equipment. The clerics said they do not want their worship centres to be an agent in spreading the virus. They elected Abrahams Odongo as council chair at the meeting held at Voice Of Salvation and Healing church in Homa Bay town. “Let’s all comply with Covid-19 preventive rules during worship to help us contain the spread of the virus. We expect faithful to have the necessary protective gear,” Odongo said. Peter Midodo was elected vice-chairman, Paul Odhiambo Misaki (secretary), Sheikh Omar Were (organising secretary) while Cyprine Atieno is the treasurer. Odongo said the Homa Bay office will coordinate with the National Interfaith Council leadership in Nairobi in their endeavours to contain the virus. “The committee will ensure all rules for preventing the spread of the virus are observed,” he added. Midodo and Misaki told residents not to relent on the war against the virus. “The disease kills and we shouldn’t give it any chance by failing to comply with the preventive rules,” Midodo said. Misaki said the county committee will be working closely with all eight subcounty committees to ensure the protocols are adhered to. “We’ll be visiting worship places to enable us to know how the rules are observed,” he said. Were and Atieno asked the national government to consider donating sanitiser for hygiene and thermoguns to help screen congregants. (edited by o. owino)
