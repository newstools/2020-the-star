Governor Jackson Mandago says he has achieved most of his development objectives in Uasin Gishu county but will strive to complete pending projects ahead of his exit in 2022. Mandago says his administration performed well in the last eight years. ”We have achieved a lot in line with my vision but I will ensure that all the projects initiated by my administration are completed before the lapse of my term in two years’ time,” Mandago said. He said the county has improved healthcare, infrastructure, water, and agriculture to transform lives. Mandago’s projects cost more than Sh3 billion but progress has been affected by the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. “We will ensure that we work on our economic recovery plans as we also ensure that we adhere to the Covid-19 control measures,” Mandago said. He spoke on Saturday when he inspected the completed and ongoing projects in Ng’enyilel Ward, Turbo subcounty. Mandago said he was happy that women and youth, along with people living with disabilities, were involved in most county activities and projects. He toured Chepsaita road, which is being upgraded, and assured the residents that he will see to it that the road is expanded and completed. The governor later inspected the completed Osorongai milk cooling plant, which is ready for commissioning and use by dairy farmers. He also inspected the Ngenyilel Vocational Training Centre, which will be the centre of excellence in the region. He also inspected the construction of Kipkaren Multipurpose Market, which is about to be completed. During the tour, Mandago was accompanied by Turbo MP Janet Rotich, county Roads executive Gideon Birir and MCA Nyenyilel David Sing’oei. The county operates a budget of more than Sh8.5 billion annually. “We now have better roads, easy access to clean water, we have helped farmers to diversify their activities and also strengthened the co-operative movement in our county,” Mandago said.
