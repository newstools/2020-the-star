Kenya Ni Yetu Initiative has stepped up to produce a virtual 24-minute music concert to celebrate the spirit of Kenya on August 29. Speaking about the concert, Homeboyz Radio general manager Somoina Kimojino said with the creative and entertainment industry being immensely hit by the pandemic, they are reimagining this new reality and adopting innovative strategies aimed at protecting as many jobs as possible. Kenya Ni Yetu will bring to stage the best that the Kenyan music industry has to offer. "Andrea Bocelli did it for Italy at the height of the pandemic. We had a similar momentum here with Kenya Ni Yetu. We reached out to some of the largest names in the Kenyan music industry," she said. The virtual concert aims to uplift the spirits of Kenyans and unify communities across the country at this time of social separation and anxiety. Suzanna Owiyo, who is set to perform at the virtual concert alongside Sauti Sol, Samidoh and Eric Wainaina, said the future of live music is bright. "Even in the middle of the crisis, music has not died. Itâ€™s a matter of accepting the change and coming up with different innovative ways to keep it alive," she said. Suzanna said the pandemic has made her reflect a lot on the purpose of life. "Life can drastically change. I have realised we are not in control of our destinies," she said. "It's high time we recognise the value in people around us. Every creature on earth is worthy of our respect and care. We can only succeed through cooperation. Crisis of this magnitude requires cooperation on all fronts." The inaugural and official launch of these productions will be aired on a digital platform to be able to reach the huge masses that have access to a phone with Internet connectivity.
