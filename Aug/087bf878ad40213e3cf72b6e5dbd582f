Detectives arrested six Malindi National Government Constituency Development Fund committee members over alleged theft of Sh20 million of public money. The six were arrested by detectives from the Financial Crime Investigations Department at the DCI headquarters Nairobi. Those arrested were NG-CDF manager Wachu Omar Abdalla together with members Sophia Said, Bernard Kai, Margaret Faith Kalume, Robert Katana and government engineer Kennedy Otieno Onyango. The officers were also pursuing Malindi MP Aisha Jumwa in relation to the corruption case. The suspects were ferried to Mombasa where they will be taken to court and face corruption charges. Mike Muia, the head of the Financial Crime Investigation Department said his team has been probing the Malindi education office that cost Sh20 million to construct. He said the procurement process for the construction was flawed. "The DCI has been investigating a case in relation to embezzlement of CDF funds in Malindi where there was an issue about the construction of an education office block,"he said. Muiya said out of five of the applicants for the contract, four were close relatives of the MP. Among the four were Jumwa's son and daughter together with other relatives. Muiya said the tender evaluation committee did not observe due diligence. He said most of the funds that were allegedly stolen were wired back into the legislatorâ€™s personal accounts and those of close relatives. Muiya said during the tendering process there were no professional engineers to give the bills of quantities, adding that no procurement official was involved. "After payments were done, most of the payment was wired back to the MP's bank accounts. That's the reason we have been able to come to Malindi. We have been looking for seven suspects," he said.
