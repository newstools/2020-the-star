The government has approved Sh4.9 billion for the construction of 63km Kisumu-Mamboleo-Chemelil-Muhoroni road after two decades of neglect. The road, which is in a sorry state, links Kisumu to neighbouring counties. Treasury CS Ukur Yatani in a letter to his Transport counterpart James Macharia on August 5 stated that the funding was provided for in the 2020-21 budget. Leaders and residents have for more than 20 years been demanding that the road be repaired. The road is dotted with potholes and motorists have been incurring huge losses in repairing their damaged vehicles. Mamboleo residents have on several occasions demonstrated over the poor state of the road. The announcement is also a huge relief for the Nyanza region's sugar belt as the road passes near three major millers. Other projects approved include the construction of 25km Marsabit-Shegel road (Sh2.3 billion), the improvement of 63km Barpello-Tot-Marich pass road (Sh2.7 billion) and Sh1.5 billion for the construction of 6.85km access roads to Mai-Mahiu and Suswa SGR station. The objective of these projects is to enhance transport in areas with high livestock farming, agriculture and tourism potential. Yatani indicated that the concept notes and feasibility study report have been submitted in line with Treasury Circular No.16-2019 on the public investment management guidelines. He said all preliminary conditions for approval, including land acquisitions, detailed designs and regulatory approvals, have been satisfied. “The purpose of this letter therefore is to grant you approval to implement these projects within the provision of the Public Procurement and Disposal Act 2015, among others,” he stated.
