All mitumba importers shall be required to register with Kenya Bureau of Standards as well as obtain certificates of conformity. This is part of the new regulations given as the state eases restrictions on business operations including the lifting on the importation ban. Kebs on August 16 lifted the ban on mitumba and this was reiterated by President Uhuru Kenyatta during his speech on Wednesday. In a meeting on Thursday between Uhuru and representatives of Mitumba Association of Kenya led by their Chairperson Teresia Njenga, it was agreed that all second hand clothing shall be packed in bales that do not exceed 50kg. Statehouse spokesperson Kanze Dena in a statement said the two sides also  agreed that all  mitumba importers shall obtain pre-shipment fumigation certificates in addition to complying with health protocols as directed by the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Industrialization and KEBS. "Importers will ensure that fumigation is undertaken before baling in compliance with the established standards," she said. Furthermore, for ease of contact tracing and tax compliance, importers and wholesalers of mitumba will be required to submit to the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) and KEBS, a register of their first tier customers. The bureau had suspended the importation of mitumba following a declaration as a possible source of new infections of coronavirus. " Mitumba importers will be required to adhere to the Kebs standards and ensure that prohibited items are not imported into the country by instituting necessary sorting and categorization mechanisms before baling. The members of the association have committed to observing this requirement and have been made aware of the sanctions associated with its violation," Dena said. On top of that, importers should expect random inspections for compliance by both KRA and Kebs. The lift on importation of second hand clothes is a relief to many youth who depend on the the trade for livelihood.
