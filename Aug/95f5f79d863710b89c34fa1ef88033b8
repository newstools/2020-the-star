A Mandera Member of County Assembly has been told to stop engaging in propaganda and theatrics over development funds allocated to his ward. Morothille ward, which Abdullahi Yunis represents, has received more than Sh136 million in development funds in the last five years, according to Governor Ali Roba’s office. Chief of Staff David Ohito accused the MCA of turning a blind eye to the support his constituents were getting from the county government. It "is dishonest and a show of hypocrisy from the honourable leader,” Ohito said in a press statement. The allocated funds were spent on education, road networks, electricity, boreholes, dispensaries and market sheds. A few days ago, Yunis accused the county government of skewed allocation of development funds to the wards. The governor's office said the accusation was ironical as Yunis was until last week when he was de-whipped by Jubilee, a member of the Assembly Budget committee. “If he has not offered oversight to funds going to his ward and those of his 29 counterparts and how they have impacted the lives of his people, then, it appears, he has abdicated his mandate and is sleeping on the job,” Ohito said.  - mwaniki fm
