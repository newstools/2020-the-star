Vesha Okello, Akothee's daughter, says her parents' separation took a toll on her. She says she was left very confused and angry as she could not comprehend why they could not work things out. Speaking during an interview with Massawe Japanni, Vesha said, "My parents separated when I was in class four. I could not understand why they had to break up," she said. "One day they were arguing and I locked them up in a room and told them I would not open until they reconciled. I used to see on TV that divorced parents could still work out, so I didn’t understand why mine were not making things work." She said her mother left home and cut all communication for a while. "No one knew where she was. We did not hear from her for like two months. My dad then left us with his mother and went to look for a job," she said. Even when the divorce was hard on the kids, Akothee always instilled in them the heart of forgiveness. Especially towards their father. ‘"I felt like I could not forgive him but my mum kept telling me he was still my dad and I had to forgive him," she said. "At the time, I felt like he was the problem. All this time he never explained why they were arguing in front of us. To date, he has never explained why the two separated. "But right now we are very good friends. We talk and he advises me, now that I'm grown up I understand things better." Edited by T Jalio
