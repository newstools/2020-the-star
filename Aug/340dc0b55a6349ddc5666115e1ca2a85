A police officer accused of defiling and impregnating a 14-year-old girl in Matuga subcounty was chatged before Kwale magistrate on Friday. Nathan Kimaru Rono is facing two charges of defiling a minor and supplying drugs to facilitate abortion. The investigative report confirmed that the minor was 10 weeks and two days old pregnant, and the drugs recovered can cause abortion. Court records show the officer is alleged to have committed the offencesÂ  between September 19 and December 31, 2019. It is further alleged that he bought the girl's silence by Sh100 and body lotion after defiling her. The girl is in Class 7 in one of the schools in Matuga subcounty. The suspect is accused of defiling the girl in the police station and at his home. "On December 19, 2019, the girl had sought treatment in Shimba Hills Hospitals when she met the accused in police uniform who lured her in Kubo police station lines where he defiled and gave her sh100," says the report. He was arrested on February 28 and charged on March 2 after the parents reported to the police. The suspect pleaded not guilty in all the charges before the resident magistrate Christine Auka. In Friday's session, the minor testified under the witness protection. Seven more witnesses are expected to testify before magistrate Auka. The court had earlier refused to grant Rono more time after he said he wasn't ready to proceed. "The witnesses are here and last time you said the same, we will proceed with the case today at 11:30 am," Auka said. The girl is still under police protection and has been taken back to a rescue centre in Ukunda. The accused is out on a bond of Sh100, 000 with a similar amount of surety. The next hearing is scheduled for October 13. Edited by EKibii
