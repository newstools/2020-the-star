Classical music is thriving thanks to Ghetto Classic, a programme run by Elizabeth Njoroge to mentor and train young people about this genre of music through The Art of Music Foundation, which she created in 2009. Elizabeth Njoroge who runs Ghetto Classic, spoke to Classic 105 about the music industry in the times of Covid-19. She expressed joy at being a part of Kenya ni Yetu virtual concert sponsored by Stanbic Bank and the Media Council of Kenya, set for August 29 from 8pm. "I was very keen to be a part of it. It's a wonderful idea and something we can do as Kenyans to bring people together in these trying times," she said. "It’s a wonderful expression of who we are as Kenyans to come together through music." Elizabeth said the industry has been hit hard by the pandemic. "Our existence is our audience. We bring people together in celebration to share our art. We’ve had to find ways and some are through an online platform," she said. Despite the challenging times, she always find ways to make things work out. "We are teaching in smaller groups, because of social distancing rules," she said. Eric Wainaina, Sauti Sol, Elizabeth Njoroge, Susan Owiyo, Samidoh, Hart_the band, Sir Elvis and Redfourth choir are some of the big names fans should expect to see give an amazing musical performance. The inaugural and official launch of these productions will be aired on a digital platform to reach the huge masses that have access to a phone with Internet connectivity. The concert will also be on all TV stations, including Kiss TV, NTV, K24, KTN and Citizen TV as well as on yetulive.com. All Radio Africa radio stations will also broadcast the concert.
