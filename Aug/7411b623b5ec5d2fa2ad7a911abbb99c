Majority Chief Whip and Murang'a Senator Irungu Kang'ata says he regrets being a bully in high school. Kang'ata was hosted by Jacque Maribe in the second instalment of her political web series, titled 'The Hot Seat'. Reminiscing his life in high school, he said he regrets some of the things he did. "Bullying was part of the school culture. I remember the kind of things we used to tell the form ones to do," he said. "That is one of the things if I had the chance to do again, I would be at the forefront to fight against such practices. It was so entrenched in Thika High School." His first and second year at school saw his grades decline, and he lost interest in school. "I started writing anonymous letters to the principal, complaining we need tea at 10am, there is corruption here," he said. "I wrote so many letters until one day the school started investigating to find out who writes the letters. I would write and sneak them into the principalâ€™s office, under his door. "The letters were objective because I was raising various issues affecting the students. Somehow, they found out I was the author of those letters. I would sign off as Kiboro. Not as Irungu." Kang'ata says he was expelled but went and complained at the Thika education county office and got a suspension instead. Since then, he started studying hard and he moved from being the bottom student to the best. Edited by T Jalio
