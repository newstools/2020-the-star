Early on a cool morning, we found a mating pair of lions near no 8 junction. The one-eyed male was in his prime and is known to many people as Kitili. After some checking and consulting with “Mama Simba”, we concluded that the lioness was called Serena. Numerous social media reports suggested that they had been on a “lion honeymoon” for at least the last three days. We sat quietly, watching the “honeymoon couple” for almost two hours. Lions have some very different ways of ensuring there is a future. While we were there, they coupled on about 10 occasions. The actual mating act is actually very quick and usually results in a bit of snarling from the lioness that is mostly due to the series of reversed barbed spikes on the lion penis (thought by scientists to increase ovulation). Kitili also licked her head and dominated her by biting her neck gently! A mating lion couple can continue for about five days with intervals of about 15 min, and can have as many as 250 couplings. The reason for this is to increase the possibility of pregnancy. If successful, it takes about 110 days before cubs are born (normally two or three). Let's hope that Serena can show her cubs in November, time will tell! The lion population in the park has had serious challenges in recent years, mostly due to domestic stock issues that result in them being killed outside the park, so it is always exciting to see newborn cubs. I noted that most of the people watching this lion activity were well behaved, as they witnessed special creative moments of a prime couple attempting to ensure the future of the Nairobi National Park Lions. Let us hope their efforts are successful, and that this “lion honeymoon” will result in cubs. For more information you can link to the following website: www.kws.go.ke
