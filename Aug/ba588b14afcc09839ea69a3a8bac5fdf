A man was charged on Monday with impersonating a magistrate. Victor Kiprono Ngeno allegedly made a magistrate ID card 384739 purporting it to be a job card issued by the Law Society of Kenya (LSK). He was charged before Kibera chief magistrate Abdulqadir Lorot. He pleaded not guilty. The charge sheet says Ngeno committed the offence on June 15 in Kilimani area, Kibera, Nairobi. Ngeno was also charged with two other counts of making a document without authority. He allegedly made an LSK card and refused to permit a police officer to take his photograph at Kilimani police station. On Monday when he appeared in court, chief magistrate Lorot ordered he be taken back to the police station for a photo session and be brought back on Tuesday. “I order that the suspect be taken back to Kilimani police station for fingerprint taking and thereafter be availed in court tomorrow for more direction,” he said. Lorot said for the case to proceed smoothly, his photo was very important.
