Tourism stakeholders in Kilifi want a share of the Sh53.7 billion stimulus package. The tour drivers, operators, guides and curio traders said they generate a lot of revenue for the country but no one has thought of cushioning them. They addressed journalists in Malindi on Friday. The operators said they have not made any income since the new coronavirus was reported in Kenya in March. Their little savings have been depleted and life has become unbearable, they said. They asked Tourism CS Najib Balala to intervene and help them get a share of the funding. Richard Saidi said the government has been promoting domestic tourism, but there are no plans to support actors in the sector. He is chairman of the Freelance Tour Drivers Association, which has more than 100 members. Saidi said their vehicles have been grounded and licences have expired so it will be difficult for them to resume operations. "We are stakeholders from Malindi. KWS recognises our work, especially in Tsavo East. Surprisingly, during hard times we are not recognised despite the fact that we work directly with tourists to make the country a better destination," he said. Saidi said Balala only promotes domestic tourism in the Masai Mara and has forgotten Tsavo, which is also a major destination. He asked Balala, who will be in Watamu on Thursday, to meet them and listen to their grievances. Frederick Mbugua, chairman of Malindi Curio Operators, said they have no funds to renovate their premises or buy new stock. Lucy Sasa, a tour operator, said no one stops to think that they too are affected by disasters. "We are being deceived that the season will pick up again, but we have no food and money. How will we survive with our families?" she said. Carlos Dume, a tour guide, said they deserve recognition for their contribution to the sector but clearly they are taken for granted.
