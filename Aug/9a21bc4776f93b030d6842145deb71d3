They say every cloud has a silver lining and for Migori Youth coach Robert Ojienda, the suspension of sports activities due to the coronavirus pandemic has helped him unearth football talents at his home in Nyakach, Kisumu County. The coach, who was initially engaged in rice farming, started training young boys at Oremo Primary School and he is impressed with the progress. “We have enormous talent here. These boys who are in primary, secondary and colleges only lacked coaching. When we started training with my former team mate Bernard Ges, we had a handful of them but we have now been forced to handle them in intervals,” said Ojienda. They have categorised the players into age groups thus —under-12, under-15, under-17 and free age. “Since we can’t handle all the boys at once, we train age grade boys from morning up to 3pm then the free age from 3pm,” said Ojienda who is popularly known as the Dutch Master. He added: “This is one way of giving back to society. The boys are talented but they lack skills and someone to give them direction.” He, however, expressed fear over the sustainability of the program once sports activities resume. “We are trying to come up with a sustainability program. If we don’t do it, the gains we have made in the last three years will be lost. We have done a five- year strategic plan but we need sponsors,” said Ojienda.
