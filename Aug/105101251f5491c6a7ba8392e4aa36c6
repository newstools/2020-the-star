US ambassador to Kenya Kyle McCarter has welcomed the move by President Uhuru Kenyatta to step-up investigations into the alleged Kemsa graft. The ambassador was making his remarks on Wednesday night in an interview with one of the local televisions. McCarter said there is a need for accountability and transparency in the country like it has never been before. “There is a need for transparency in Kenya like there is never been before, especially during this time of Covid-19,” McCarter said. He said the 21 days given by the president to the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission should not exceed. “21 days is 21 days,” he said. ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi had also urged EACC to do a thorough job when investigating the authority. Mudavadi warned the anti-graft agency not to "deliver a shoddy job" that will let the culprits get away scot-free. "Following the Presidential directive Kenyans expect the investigative agencies to deliver in 21 days comprehensive results with sufficient evidence to meet the test of prosecution," he said via Twitter on Thursday. On Wednesday, in his 11th address to the nation, Uhuru broke his silence over the KEMSA theft, saying that heads would roll irrespective of those involved if culpability is established. Uhuru ordered an investigation into the suspected loss of public funds to fight coronavirus be concluded in 21 days. The alleged loss of Covid-19 donations due to irregularity in awarding tender at Kkemsa has led to the suspension of some officials, including CEO Jonah Mwangi. The reported scandal has caused led to demonstrations across the country, human rights activists calling for the arrest of the people behind it.
