Ford Kenya's National Executive Council has recommended the expulsion of three legislators pending the General Council meeting to approve the resolutions. Speaking after an NEC meeting in Nairobi on Monday, Kiminini MP Chris Wamalwa said members had resolved to expel Tongaren MP Eseli Simiyu, his Kanduyi counterpart Wafula Wamunyinyi and nominated MCA Cynthia Mutere. Members resolved to hold the General Council as well as National Delegates Congress on or before September 20. "The party decided to subject the trio to subsequent disciplinary proceedings which NEC deliberated on today," Wamalwa said. Eseli and Wamunyinyi however dismissed the move saying it was illegal. "I'm still the interim party leader. Those were not NEC members but people in party colours and uniform," he said. Simiyu said they are the true official party officials and are considering expelling Bungoma Senator Moses Wetangula. "I am still the secretary general. I want to warn Wetangula that we may have a by-election in Bungoma if he continues like that," he added. Last month, the Wamunyinyi team said it read mischief in a court's move to push for two months the determination of the party leadership wrangles case. The faction had questioned whether the High Court has powers to handle the matter. The High Court last week scheduled the ruling for September 25, despite certifying the case as urgent last month. But Kiminini MP Wamalwa dismissed the Wamunyinyi team, terming them "cry babies". He said the Judiciary is an independent institution and does not take orders from any side. “They are the ones who are frustrated because the coup failed and it was dead on arrival,” Wamalwa said. “It was through the backdoor and it failed. They [Wamunyinyi team] are embarrassed because of the external hands, and they have no explanation to their sponsors.” The Eseli team said they would remain respectful of the court process but condemned employing the process to undermine the sovereignty of the party.
