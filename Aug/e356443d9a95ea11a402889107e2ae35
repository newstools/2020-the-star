A research and development team has been tasked to develop an affordable, energy efficient device to mitigate the current learning crisis occasioned by Covid-19. Commissioned by ICT Authority chief executive Katherine Getao on Monday, the team aims at coming up with a homegrown digital learning concept even post-Covid pandemic. Gateo said the current technology is inaccessible to most learners countrywide, especially those in remote areas. This creates the need for the team to develop an affordable, environmentally friendly device which can be bought by many Kenyans considering the income levels in households. The device should also address the challenges faced during the implementation of the Digital Literacy Programme Phase I, where harsh climatic conditions such as humidity and high temperatures have impacted batteries. “The team will look at the functionality of the device, that it can maintain charge for a longer period, present content, enable internet connection and most importantly focus more on social impact than commercial interests and benefits,” the statement said. The gadget will seek to empower and educate parents to equip learners and to support a home learning environment. The move by the authority comes days after President Uhuru Kenyatta appointed Professor Fredrick Owino as the ICT Authority Board chairman effective August 7. The team is made up of experts from the Ministry of Education, the Teachers Service Commission, Dedan Kimathi University, Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology, Kenyatta University, Moi University and the Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development. Schools were ordered closed in March to counter the spread of Covid-19 in the country and according to Education CS George Magoha, schools will remain closed until January next year.
