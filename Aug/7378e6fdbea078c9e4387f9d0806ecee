We are in top gear. The amendments brought by Nairobi Senator Johnson Sakaja will fall flat. They are populist, negative and their intention questionable; we will reject them. We have made parliamentary decisions or legislation and policies before, and none has ever divided the country. What is so special about this third generation formula? We are ready, we have the numbers. Sakaja’s amendments will be shot down. We will propose the motion moved by the Finance and Budget committee chairman, Charles Kibiru, as it is. There are no two ways about it. The formula proposed by the committee is the best. Tomorrow (today) there will be a serious showdown on the floor. They (opposing faction) cannot fight the government. Which numbers do they have? They are just fear mongering. Even those who opposed Senator Irungu Kang'ata’s amendment motion have all of them shifted. Twenty-eight of us support this motion as it is. After discussions with senators who were perceived to be "losing", we have a group that now supports us and is pushing for quick operationalisation of the Equalisation Fund. We have met a number of times and caucused ahead of tomorrow (today). They told us to kill them now, we are going to kill them quick. They told us to kick them now. We will deal with them on the floor. But it is not about politics. It is about our constitutional obligation, which we want to fulfil. The counties that have been gaining at the expense of others, what do they have to show for the money they get? Nothing. One man, one vote, one shilling is a principle of equity. You can’t give the same amount of money to Kiambu as Mandera or Kilifi. In fact, we still cannot match some of the counties said to be losing. For instance, Nandi is gaining and our allocation will be about Sh8.8 billion but we still cannot match Mandera, which will still have Sh9 billion even after losing.
