The Nyeri county government plans to instal solar-powered street lights to provide cheaper and green energy. Transport executive Muthui Kariuki said the move will also enable residents to get value for money. Currently, the county government has been footing the bill for street lighting in the county. Kariuki said the county will instal street lights, tarmac roads and fix the drainage system in a bid to transform Nyeri town. The county government will also mark roads and increase the number of parking slots. The CEC said the county government has put aside Sh87 million for rehabilitation of Nyeri town roads. The programme would be replicated in other towns across the county. “This will go up to next year when we hope to complete these projects in Nyeri Karatina, Othaya, Mukurwe-ini and parts of Naromoru,” Kariuki said. He spoke on Monday when he accompanied Governor Mutahi Kahiga to inspect the construction of Nyewasco–Library road. Kahiga said the construction of the road was part of the bigger agenda to refurbish Nyeri town. “This is a programme that has been ongoing since we took over. This year alone, we are able to spend in excess of Sh177 million, money that is being spent to do new roads here, in Karatina and outside Nyeri town,” he said. Edited by A.N
