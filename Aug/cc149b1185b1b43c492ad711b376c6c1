West Pokot school heads are improperly and immorally selling public school property, exploiting the Covid-19 pandemic to enrich themselves. Governor John Lonyangapuo said some heads have taken advantage of the pandemic and are selling property, ignoring the fact that schools will reopen and the property is needed. He spoke at Roponywo Primary School where he said the school head teacher had sold the school's trees for Sh100,000. He denounced school heads for disposing of public school property without following the correct channels. The school head did not pick calls seeking comment. "You cannot turn school property into your own property and dispose of it when you choose. There are procedures to be followed before any public property is disposed of,” the county boss said. He blamed head teachers for selling school property without consulting the school committee. “School property should be well guarded. We should not take advantage of a pandemic to misuse learning institutions' property,” the governor said. He said a number of school heads have already exhausted school funds and asked auditors to scrutinise the books of some schools. Schools have turned into business hubs as school heads "line their pockets," the governor said. He urged residents to raise the alarm and report to authorities when they notice any school head selling school property. “The community should be the watchdog for the school property since they will be asked to fund the projects that have been looted. I urge you to raise the red flag when you spot anything unusual taking place in our schools,” Longyangapuo said. Parents from Raponywo Primary School expressed their concerns, saying it was wrong for the head teacher to sell the school's trees without consulting the committee.  (Edited by V. Graham)
