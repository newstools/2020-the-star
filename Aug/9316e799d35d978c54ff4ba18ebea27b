A judge has ordered Kenya Power to pay a Bomet man Sh150,000 as special damages for his cow electrocuted in 2017. Joseph Korir could get more compensation because High Court judge Asenath Ongeri directed the matter back to the magistrate's court for general damages. Korir had appealed at the High Court in 2018 after the magistrate's court declined to issue him with general damages of Sh900,000 he had asked for. He argued that his was a dairy cow and was three months pregnant at the time of the death. Judge Ongeri ruled that the trial court should have assessed general damages since KPLC had consented to take 80 per cent liability for the negligence. “I, therefore, find that the trial court was duty-bound to assess general damages payable to the appellant in respect of the loss of the cow,” the court ruled. The judge said the court should have considered that the cow was three months pregnant and had provided Korir with milk and other related cow products, including manure. The court also directed that the matter is heard by a magistrate other than the one who dismissed the claim for general damages. The trial court had ruled that no particulars of loss were given save for the loss of the cow. It said Korir had raised a new head of damages in the submissions when he sought Sh900,000 in general damages.
