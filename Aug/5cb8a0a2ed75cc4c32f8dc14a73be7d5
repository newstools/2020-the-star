DJ Pierra Makena has for the first time spoken about being depressed during her pregnancy, which led to weight loss. She was speaking on her YouTube channel in an aim to support other people struggling with excess weight. "Before pregnancy, I was 50-52kg, but at some point, I was feeling a little depressed so, at the first trimester, I was weighing 49kg," she said. Makena says the weight loss was worrying. "My doctor was getting worried because you are not supposed to be losing weight while pregnant. I would try and eat but nothing worked for me at the time. Even when I delivered, I was still not gaining weight." Her family decided to join her and help feed her, and that is when she started adding weight. "After I gave birth, three months later, I was still not gaining weight, yet I needed to produce enough milk for the baby," she said. "My baby started feeding well but my clothes could not fit." As a first-time mother, she panicked when she started gaining weight. Makena said once the public got a glimpse of her, they trolled her, saying she had let herself go. "I attended an event and I was all over the newspapers being trolled. I became depressed because I was even referred to as an elephant," she said. Her family was, however, very supportive. She learnt it is important to surround yourself with people who support you. "Later on, I learnt that I needed to love and appreciate myself," she said.
