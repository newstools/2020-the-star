For the first time in two years, Willy Paul has introduced his son to the public while celebrating his second birthday. Pozze described his son, Damian Radido Ouma, as God's gift to him. "I love you, king Damian Radido Ouma. The best gift that The Lordsâ€™s given me so far," he posted on Instagram. "May you live to be a great and intelligent man. May The Lord that I serve watch over you for the rest of your days! Nakupenda kijan. Happy 2nd birthday," he added. Two years ago when his baby mama gave birth, the 'Hallelujah' hitmaker refused to comment on the issue and has since managed to keep it on the down low.
