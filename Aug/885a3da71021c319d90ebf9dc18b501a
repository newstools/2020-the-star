A Bungoma activist accused of stealing a file containing the 2020-21 budget from the county assembly on Tuesday failed to appear in court on grounds he was in quarantine. Lawyer Lempaa Suyianka told a Kibera court that Barasa Nyukuri developed a fever and a running stomach after using public means to commute. He had been freed on a free bond on August 10. Lempaa told Kibera senior principal magistrate Derrick Kuto that Nyukuri needed 21 days for self-quarantine. “I request the court to allow my client to stay at home for 21 days for the sake of everyone,” he said, noting that they were well prepared for the defence. The charge sheet indicates Nyukuri allegedly stole an original spring file on July 7 at the Bungoma county assembly jointly with others not before court. Early this month, the same court freed Nyukuri and exempted him from the curfew order so that he could travel to attend the hearing of his impeachment petition against Bungoma Governor Wycliffe Wangamati. His petition for the removal of Wangamati is pending in the county assembly and he was scheduled to appear before a committee on Tuesday. Kibera senior principal magistrate Charles Mwaniki released the activist on the grounds that there was no sufficient evidence to detain him. The police had requested the court to detain the activist for 15 days to complete investigations. Kuto on Tuesday directed that the plea be deferred and ordered the matter to be mentioned on September 3 so that the two cases can be consolidated.
