Gospel singer Rose Muhando says she was told she was going to die in 10 days. This, she says, is part of the hardship she has had to undergo the past few years. Muhando, who started recording in 2004, has blessed many with her songs but last year, she went viral after a video of her being prayed for by Pastor Ng’ang’a made headlines. Speaking to Wasafi media on Sunday, Muhando said, “Before I went through what I went through, there is a man of God who said I was going to go through four hard things and the fourth one will be the hardest,” she said. “I went through all that and when the fourth time came, I was in Nairobi. Ten days before that, I was told they will make sure you are no longer existing under the sun.” She did not elaborate on who that 'they' was. The ‘Nibebe’ hitmaker also spoke about her experience in Kenya. “Bishop Ng’ang’a saw the vision and prayed for me and when I got my consciousness, I found myself in hospital. I was not in a good state and they thought I was just sick, but I thought it was my time," she said. "That’s when I met God and he filled me with strength and courage, and I have known God because he has a reason why people go through what they go through.” After healing, the mother of three released the song ‘Kenya Ulindwe’ to thank Kenyan people and President Uhuru Kenyatta.
