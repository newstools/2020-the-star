The Health ministry has traced more than 75,000 contacts since the pandemic began, acting Health Director General Patrick Amoth has said. During the daily briefing on the Covid-19 situation in the country on Wednesday, Amoth said community transmission has made contact tracing technically difficult. "We are developing different interventions depending on transmission pattern. We have discharged 5,666 people from home-based care," Amoth said. This comes following complaints from individuals who have tested positive that their contacts are yet to receive communication from the ministry. Last week, Foreign Affairs PS Macharia Kamau criticised the government's handling of the disease, saying a number of his contacts were yet to be contacted by the ministry. Meanwhile, Amoth said 723 health workers have been infected with Covid-19 since the onset. A total of 385 of them are males and 338 are females. "This is about three per cent of the total caseload. Ten healthcare workers have succumbed," he added. Kagwe officially opened the Infectious Disease Unit and Intensive Care Unit at the Kenyatta University Research and Referral Hospital. It has a 500-bed capacity. Board chairperson Olive Mugenda said the institution has planned for 60 ICU and HDU beds. "Currently, 30 of them are ready. The remaining 30 will be ready in two weeks. Out of the 24 ICU beds we have here, 15 are occupied. The other close to 440 isolation beds will be ready in a month," she said. "The increase in bed capacity, new HDU and ICU at KURRH comes in handy to tackle the virus infection especially in Nairobi being the epicenter of Covid-19 accounting for 60 percent of positive cases across the country," Health CS Mutahi Kagwe said. Kenya on Wednesday reported 671 new cases of Covid-19 bringing the total to 23,873. This is out of 6,200Â samples that were tested in the last 24 hours, bringing the cumulative number of tests done in the country to 329,123. Of the cases reported, 633 are Kenyans while 38 being foreigners. As of ages, the youngest is a three-year-old while the oldest is 94 years old. The country has also witnessed 603 recoveries bringing the total number of recoveries in the country to 9,930. However, the country has lost three more people, bringing the total number of deaths to 391.
