 More than 200,000 residents of Vihiga will be connected to clean water by the end of next year, Governor Wilber Ottichilo has said. He spoke on Friday during an inspection tour of the Sh.1.7 billion Maseno water project that is funded by the Belgium government. He was the project's manager  Samuel Delobbe . The project was halted in March due to the outbreak of coronavirus, leading to a delay in completion works. “Water is a vital commodity for both humans and crops. Among my pledges during the 2017 campaign was to ensure the menace of water shortage becomes a thing of the past,” Ottichillo said. The governor said the project was already 90 per cent complete and will serve residents of Luanda and Emuhaya subcounties. “The Maseno water project is going to produce 5000 cubic metres per day and will be supplied to Luanda market, Maseno University and other learning institutions within the county,” Ottichillo said. He said all learning institutions across the county will be connected to clean water for smooth learning. The governor said they will establish water kiosks at village levels where those who are not able to get connected due to various challenges will get their supply. County assembly Minority whip Calistus Ayodi said the assembly will allocate funds for the county government to connect all residents to water supply for free. Ottichillo said they will be using solar panels to generate power for pumping water from all the three water plants at Maseno, Lunyerere and Shamakhokh.  Edited by P.O
