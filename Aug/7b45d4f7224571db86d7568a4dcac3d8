Nairobi County Assembly Speaker Beatrice Elachi has resigned. Speaker Elachi on Tuesday morning said she was moving on to a new season in her her political career and journey and going back to Dagoretti North constituents. “This is the right time...Last time I left with my head down, this time I leave with my head high, without force," she said. She leaves the seat to Deputy Speaker and Ruai MCA John Kamangu. “I humbly tender my resignation to President Uhuru Kenyatta. For the last few days there have been life-threatening incidents. I appoint my deputy speaker, John Kamangu, as acting speaker,” Elachi said. Elachi thanked President Kenyatta for giving her the opportunity to serve Nairobi for the last three years and said she hoped to serve in his administration in any other capacity in the near future. She asked the assembly to stand firm and support Nairobi Metropolitan Services Director-General Mohammed Badi in transforming the capital. "That is the critical agenda...the legacy for our President and I believe he would be proud to see us support him. If I ever did wrong, within the duties I was given, I ask for forgiveness," she said. Elachi advised Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko with whom she has had a frosty relationship to focus on God and stop intimidation. "I think I was the biggest stumbling block for the governor but I want to pray for him. Governor, focus on God and stop threatening people's lives, it does not help," she said.
