Vihiga United Lawrence Luvanda has vowed to propel the National Super League outfit back to the Kenyan Premier League. Vihiga finished third at the close of the just ended season and Luvanda, on loan from AFC Leopards, said he has settled well under coach Sammy Okoth as opposed to when he was at Ingwe, where he could not get play time under the now departed Casa Mbungo. "When I completed Form Four at Chavakali High School, having captained the school team for two years, I had a lot of expectations. I found myself at AFC Leopards but it was hard to compete with experienced and talented players which relegated me into a bench warmer," said Luvanda. "This affected me badly.  However, some club officials and senior players encouraged me and asked me to remain patient and work hard but when the opportunity to joining Vihiga on loan came, I couldn’t hesitate." The young striker expressed his commitment to Vihiga United and vowed to sacrifice and work hard to assist them reclaim their slot in the top tier when they battle it out with Kisumu All-Stars in a two-legged promotion playoff. He revealed that under Okoth, he is learning a lot and gaining a lot of experience that will enable him shine at the top. Luvanda added that Vihiga has the quality and the right management team to enable the club return to the top tier. Vihiga United technical director Nick Yakhama lauded Luvandwa and urged him to remain patient and keep working hard for the team. “I believe Luvanda has what it takes to play at the top level if he maintains discipline and hard work. At his young age, he is on the right course.  Let him learn from others and gather enough experience,” said Yakhama. Luvanda, who scored three crucial goals for Vihiga is an important player for the side alongside other strikers like Dennis Wafula and Mike Isabwa.
