Senators will not hold their sessions outside Nairobi this year as has been the tradition since 2018 because of the Covid-19 pandemic. While moving the motion to cancel the Senate Mashinani sessions, Deputy Majority Leader Fatuma Dullo (Isiolo) said threats posed by the pandemic cannot allow the lawmakers to sit outside Nairobi. "Covid-19 has been persistent in the country, resulting in disruption of the Senate and Parliament as a whole.," Dullo said. She added, "The reason why we are not having this sitting outside Nairobi is because of the challenges we are facing." Minority Chief Whip Mutula Jr said the prevailing circumstances brought about by the virus cannot allow them to sit outside the capital. The inaugural Senate Mashinani was held in Uasin Gishu in 2018. Last year's sessions were held in Kitui. During the Mashinani sessions, senators conduct all their business, including plenary and Committee sittings outside Nairobi.
