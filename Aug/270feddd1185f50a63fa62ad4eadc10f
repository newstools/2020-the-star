Two suspects in the killing of a car dealer at a Kilimani apartment have been detained for 12 days pending investigations. Kibera Seniour Principal magistrate Derrick Kuto on Tuesday made the decision, setting the mention of the case for September 4. "The application has merit and I order the suspects be detained for 12 days for police to complete their investigations," he said. "The offence committed is murder and a precious life was lost." Robert Ouko Bodo and Chris Obure  were arrested over the killing of car dealer Kevin Omwenga on Friday night. The shooting happened at the seventh floor of Galana Suites on Galana Road. Bodo was arrested moments after the fatal shooting while Obure was apprehended by detectives at his house in Riverside and driven to Kilimani police station. Obure was, however, transferred to Kileleshwa police station where he spent Sunday night. On Sunday, Bodo â€” the key suspect, wrote a second statement at Kilimani police station. While earlier reports indicate that an argument led to the shooting of a 28-year-old man in Kilimani, Bodo claimed the incident was accidental. While the gun belongs to Obure, it was Bodo who accessed it from the safe and proceeded with it to the bedroom where Omwenga was. At the time of the shooting, the victim was in the company of his brother Wycliffe Omwenga, 28, Bodo and two other men and a woman, according to police reports. Wycliffe, who was first to respond to the sound of gunfire, found his brother lying on his back with blood oozing from his chest. He was rushed to Nairobi Women's Hospital Adams branch where he was pronounced dead on arrival, a police report filed at Kilimani police station indicates. CCTV footage seen by the Star shows Omwenga leaving the apartment at 9.39pm and returning an hour later with a woman, Bodo following him a few moments later.
