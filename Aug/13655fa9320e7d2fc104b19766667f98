Given the dire economic situation in the country , it would be prudent for the President to provide sound leadership and shelve the BBI and Referendum. As it was witnessed during the rallies , the BBI had a knack to be extremely divisive. The seeds of discord and disharmony will be planted ahead of the polls in 2022. It is important to note that the spirit of BBI is dead . Initially, Kenyans were told BBI was anchored on the spirit of reconciliation and peace following the acrimonious 2017 General Election. However, to our bewilderment, it was hijacked by selfish politicians who saw an opportunity to manipulate and dictate the 2022 succession matrix . It would be insensitive to introduce referendum when the fortunes of majority of Kenyans have tanked , thanks to Coronavirus pandemic. The responsible thing for a functioning and sound government to do during the hard times of pandemic is to implement robust economic recovery plan . Pushing referendum to Kenyans who do not know where their next meal will come from is immoral and height of insensitivity. The ruling class should discard their ivory tower mentality and climb down to listen to the voices of the poor and downtrodden. Selling BBI and referendum as a panacea to Kenya’s problems is disingenuous and smacks of arrogance. As the Kenyans of goodwill and civil society has pointed out , Kenya’s problems are not in the constitutional making but lack of leadership. It is instructive to note that the 2010 constitution prescribed numerous benefits which Kenyans are yet to enjoy as it has not been fully and correctly implemented. There are more urgent needs pressing Kenyans that need state attention than drumming BBI and referendum to Kenyans languishing in biting poverty and staring hopelessly at a bleak future .
