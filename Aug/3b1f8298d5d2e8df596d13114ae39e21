DPP Noordin Haji has directed the immediate arrest and prosecution of Migori Governor Okoth Obado and 11 others over embezzlement of county funds. Four of Obado's children said to be accessories of Obado's theft will also be arrested. According to a statement by Haji, Obado used proxies to unlawfully benefit a total of Sh73 million from companies trading with the county. Haji said investigations by the Ethics and Anti Corruption Commission (EACC), establishedÂ that the governor received multiple payments through his children's accounts between 2014 and 2017. "The audit trail of the money revealed that companies wired Sh39 million to the governor's children accounts which was used to pay school fees, upkeep and medical bills in Australia, Scotland and the UK, " he said. Further, Haji revealed that Sh34 million was used to purchase a house in Loresho Ridge currently owned by Obado's daughter Evelyne Adhiambo Zachary. Obado's sons Dan Okoth and Jerry Okoth and daughter Susan Okoth were also named in the scandal. Proprietors of the companies said to have made irregular payments to Obado are all proxies of the governor with some having close family ties. The companies involved in the saga include Misoft Company Limited, Tarchdog Printers, Deltrack ICT services, Seletrack Consultants, Mactebac Contractors, Joyush Business, Swyfcon Engineering, Atinus Services, Kajulu business, Victorious Investment, Dolphins Softwares, Dankey Press and Pesulus Services. In July Last year, Obado was acquitted in possession of illegal firearms charge by a Kibera court. This was after he was accused of possessing eight firearms without permits. A DCI detective in the Special Crimes Unit told the court that after completing investigations Obado was found innocent.
