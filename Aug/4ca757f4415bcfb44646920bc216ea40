ANC party leader Musalia Mudavadi has asked the EACC to do a thorough work when investigating the Kenya Medical Supplies Authority. Mudavadi warned the anti-graft agency not to "deliver a shoddy job" that will let the culprits get away scot-free. "Following the Presidential directive Kenyans expect the investigative agencies to deliver in 21 days comprehensive results with sufficient evidence to meet the test of prosecution," he said via Twitter on Thursday. Mudavadi was reacting to President Uhuru Kenyatta's directive on Wednesday when he ordered that investigations into the suspected loss of public funds to fight coronavirus be concluded in 21 days. In his first public reaction to the alleged Covid-19 scandal, Uhuru said heads would roll irrespective of those involved if culpability is established. The country is said to have been robbed of billions of shillings of state and donor funds through an intricate graft web staged by cartels at the Kenya Medical Supplies Authority. Kemsa is accused of having bought drugs and Covid-19 personal protective gear at inflated prices in a mega rip-off. The Covid-19 multi-billion scandal has turned into a hot political potato that now threatens to dent the President's anti-graft credentials. “In line with our stated public policy on zero tolerance to corruption, all persons found to be culpable as a result of those investigations should be brought to book, notwithstanding the public office they hold or their political or social status,” Uhuru said.
