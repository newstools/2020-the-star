Nzoia Sugar have what it takes to compete for titles, believes newly-contracted head coach Sylvester Mulukurwa. Mukukurwa,  who signed a three-year deal said his experience as a player and a member of the technical bench gives him an advantage since he fully understands the culture and structures of the team. Mulukurwa, who is succeeding Collins Omondi — who left the team in March, revealed that under the leadership of Evans Kadenge the team is being reconstructed and good structures being put in place to enable them to challenge Gor Mahia dominance. “Let me thank the board and management of Nzoia Sugar Fc under the leadership of Evans Kadenge, who have trusted me to lead and guide this team for the next three years," said Mulukurwa. “I know it's not an easy job but we are equal to the task. The players and technical bench understand the expectations of the demanding fans in western Kenya and we promise not let them down." “However, the fans should remain patient with the team as the restoration process will take some time." Mulukurwa, who is a Confederation of Africa Football (Caf ‘C’) licence holder, also assured that he will work with players who have the club’s passion, commitment and ready to sacrifice and meet the expectations. Kadenge congratulated Mulukurwa for the appointment and assured him of total support and a good working environment. “I have a lot of confidence in the new coach, who has committed his time with the team. He has served the team in various capacities as a player and goalkeeper trainer for the last 24 years,” said Kadenge.
