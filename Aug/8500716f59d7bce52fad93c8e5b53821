Kenya's situation is different from other jurisdictions. The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission structure has a chairman and chief executive officer. This is the international model, but it has failed in Kenya. The structure has largely been blamed for the challenges that have plagued the electoral commission. In our situation, we have a chairman who is appointed through a process but who does not have total control over the people on the ground. An election is stolen on the ground and not at the headquarters of the electoral commission. We have a chairman who, according to the law, is the returning officer at the national level, yet the people on the ground do not report to him. The problem with our system is there is no clear separation of power between the IEBC chairman and CEO, who is head of the secretariat. This was seen during James Oswago's tenure as well as Ezra Chiloba's. The CEO is in charge of all the officers on the ground. The proposal by the Building Bridges Initiative to make the IEBC chairman an executive chairman and in charge of the secretariat will address this problem. The only proposal by the BBI that I do not support is that political parties should propose commissioners. This means we will not have an independent process. Anybody who is appointed by a political party will be doing that entity's bidding. Commissioners should be appointed through a people-driven, public process. The current situation gives the president sweeping powers to appoint the chairman. This should be addressed by making it mandatory that once the selection panel has nominated, for instance the chairman, the president cannot bypass that decision.
