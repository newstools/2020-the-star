Panic has gripped Uasin Gishu District Hospital after four members of staff tested positive for coronavirus, prompting the management to shut down the pharmacy. About 140 medical staff abandoned their duties after it emerged that no action had been taken to take the Covid-19 patients to isolation centres. “It is unfortunate that the four who tested positive for Covid-19 are still walking free in the hospital compound instead of being taken for quarantine quickly as part of the measures to help stop the spread of the diseases,” said Isaac Tallam, a medical staff. Tallam said some of the affected staff were still attending to patients, exposing them to coronavirus infection. Some of the staff, he said, work in the maternity wing of the hospital, noting that their continued interaction with patients would compromise their safety and that of the unborn babies. Tallam said there was confusion among the staff since no action had been taken by the county government to ensure the victims were taken to isolation before embarking on contact tracing. Paramedical staff vowed to down their tools until the county addressed the matter for the safety of the healthcare providers and patients who seek treatment at the facility. Beatrice Wambui who works in the maternity ward said they attend to about 400 expectant women at the facility in a day, adding that four babies are delivered daily. She said despite offering an essential service they lack personal protective equipment and that their requests have fallen on deaf ears. Edited by Henry Makori
