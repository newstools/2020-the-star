Kenya sevens assistant coach Kevin Wambua has identified improvement in skill set as well as fitness and conditioning as the major areas they need to work on ahead of the new season. At the moment, players are training individually due to the coronavirus-occasioned restrictions. But as hopes of a return continue to grow following deliberations between the Ministry of Sports and stakeholders, Wambua is confident they will have enough time to fine tune on their deficiencies. “From the six tournaments we played this year, we saw we had some deficiencies in some of our skill set patterns and as players train on their own, we are guiding them on what to do," said Wambua. These include tackling, kickoffs and defensive formations. Wambua noted he is sending players videos of the training regimes they should follow. "We are monitoring players on what they are doing to keep fit. We don't want to start from scratch when action resumes," said Wambua. Shujaa finished 12th in the shortened World Sevens Series season with 35 points, reaching two main cup quarter final appearances  in Cape Town and Hamilton. Shujaa also bagged the Africa Cup Sevens in South Africa to book their ticket to the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. Wambua said it's fulfilling to see the Ministry of Sports taking the initiative in regard to return to training and competition. “It's good news to see the process on return to sports underway and I know very soon we will get the green light to resume training," said Wambua.
