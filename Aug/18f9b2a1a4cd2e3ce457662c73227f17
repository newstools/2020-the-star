The Judiciary in Homa Bay has suspended sittings for 14 days after three staff members tested positive for Covid-19. The premises were fumigated. Two staff members from the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions in Homa Bay town tested positive as did an  employee at the Dhiwa law court. All three are receiving home-based care. Only serious and urgent cases will be heard in-person in the open air. In other cases, pleas will be taken virtually during the suspension. Senior principal magistrate Thomas Obutu said they have scaled back operations operations to minimise spread of the virus among staff members and the public. The Judiciary, prosecutors, police, suspects and the public attend court. Speaking to journalists on Friday, Obutu said they have liaised with the Homa Bay Health department to fumigate the premises. Obutu said all judiciary staff are undergoing mandatory testing and those found positive will be told to self-isolate. “We would like to resume work after two weeks but it will depend on the advice from the Ministry of Health," the magistrate said. Homa Bay Health executive Richard Muga said testing of staff and fumigation will be done regularly. (Edited by V. Graham)
