 Kakamega Senator Cleophas Malala has accused the county government of a lack of transparency in the use of Sh367 million meant for the fight against Covid-19. Malala on Saturday accused the county administration of frustrating his efforts to establish how the money was spent. "My office has been unable to obtain any information on the usage of the money. They keep saying they are still in the procurement process but no one wants to give information on what is being procured," Malala said. The county received Sh262m from the national government while the county assembly approved another Sh105m in a supplementary budget towards the fight against the spread of coronavirus. In April, Governor Wycliffe Oparanya said Malala would oversight the use of the funds to ensure proper usage. Malala said it was unfair for the county government to say the money has not been spent yet health workers do not have protective gear. Health executive Collins Matemba said the Sh262 million was intact though some Sh180 million had been committed. "Out of the Sh205 million county emergency funds, we have already used Sh53 million for purchase of PPEs, some which have been delivered to health workers," Matemba said. A member of the Equity Group Foundation committee for Kakamega told the Star that the county government had directed the Kakamega Couty General Hospital liaison committee that received PPEs donated by Equity Bank a week ago not to use the equipment until they receive directions. Matemba said the directive was issued by the governor because the donation must be fully accounted for. "You know there were scandals in the use of some of those donations. Some of the donations never reached the intended beneficiaries and that's why the governor issued the directive," the executive said.  Edited by P.O
