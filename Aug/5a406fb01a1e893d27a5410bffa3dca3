Harambee Stars centre back Joseph Okumu has laughed off a transfer rumours suggesting he was on the verge of joining Tanzanian giants Simba SC. The towering defender, who plies his trade with Swedish side If Elfsborg, said the club, who struck a treble last season, had not made contact with his agency despite being reported that negotiations were at an advanced stage. According to a reputable Tanzanian paper, Mwanaspoti, Simba, the home to Stars creative midfielder Francis Kahata, were seeking the defender's services to beef up their rear ahead of their return to the Caf Champions League. Simba, who had an underwhelming campaign in the continental scene last season after an early exit, launched their transfers last weekend with the acquisition of Ghanaian midfielder Bernard Morrison from bitter rivals, Yanga. The club has also been reported to be pursuing Stars and Gor Mahia centre half Joash Onyango and midfielder Kenneth Muguna. However, the latter is likely not to cross the border owing to the arrival of Morrison. Additionally, it is understood that Congolese giants DC Motema Pembe and Angolan club Petro Atletico are in the race to sign Muguna. Okumu 23, in a telephone interview, said the links to Simba were non-existent and cast a doubt over Simba's ability to buy out his lengthy contract with Elfsborg. The former Free States defender has been a force to reckon with in the defence since his arrival from Real Monarchs last year. Despite his age, former Stars head coach SÃ©bastien Migne played him in all the three Africa Cup of Nations group stage matches against Algeria, Tanzania and Senegal. "Realistically, there is no chance they can buy a two-year contract so there is no way such a transfer can happen. Maybe they are planning to break the bank but as far as I am concerned, they haven't tabled a bid or launched negotiations," he said.
