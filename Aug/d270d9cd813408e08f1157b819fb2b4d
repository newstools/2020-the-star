Africa Under-18 1,500m silver medallist Maxon Kipng'etich wants to take his performance to the next level when he features in next years World U-20 Championships in Nairobi . Kipng’etich is hoping not only to win gold medal in his speciality but also to post a  personal best in the event scheduled for August 17-22 at Nairobi’s Moi Stadium, Kasarani. Only athletes aged 16, 17, 18 or 19 years on December 31, 2021, will be eligible to compete. Kipngetich, who trains in Kapsbet's Kapchemuiyo Camp under former world 800m champion Janeth Jepkosgei, said he will build on the experience he gain in Abidjan, Ivory Coast last year ago.  “It is always good to run for your nation and especially at this youthful stage,” he noted. The Form Four student at Kosirai Secondary School in Nandi county said he had big plans this year but the coronavirus pandemic has stalled everything. “Like everyone else, I was prepared for the World Under-20 and I wanted to improve on what I won in Ivory Coast,” he added. He said at the moment, he is only able to train in the morning but hopes to escalate things once things go back to normal. “This is a blow to us as athletes because we only train in the morning while observing the Covid-19 protocols. I train with my two other fellow  students,” added Kipngetich. He said he is keen to record his personal best before home fans come the World U-20 next year. “I am looking forward to running before home fans and winning the title. I can't Imagine the feeling but I will work hard towards that," he noted.
