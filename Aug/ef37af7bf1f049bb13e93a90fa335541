ODM leader Raila Odinga has claimed that some of his opponents wished him dead when he went to Dubai for a minor surgery last month. Speaking in Siaya on Saturday, Raila said that some people had claimed that he had lost his speech. “Some of them said I had lost my speech and that I was on my deathbed. They even said that I was being fed using a tube," Raila said. "They were praying that I should die." Raila who is also the AU envoy said it was foolhardy to wish him dead because of 2022 politics. "Shame on you. I am fit as a fiddle and ready to work for the people at all times," Raila said. Raila was speaking in Bondo during the funeral service of Elizabeth Olango where he assured residents of reaching Canaan with less struggle come 2022. During his address to the media in Nairobi on Thursday, Raila said he was well recovered. He even marched up and down to showcase that he was indeed doing okay. On July 1, Raila expressed gratitude to Kenyans for standing with him as he received treatment in the United Arab Emirates. In a one-minute video shared by his daughter Winnie Odinga, Raila, clad in a mustard polo t-shirt and blue shorts, said that the messages of goodwill from Kenyans made him recover quickly. “I want to thank all my friends, supporters and all our youth who have sent me so many messages of goodwill. It has just been amazing and wonderful. It makes me recover so fast,” Raila said.
