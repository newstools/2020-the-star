Former principal of Moi Girls High School in Eldoret Helen Cheramboss has died. She was 73. She was pronounced dead on Mondat at Kaptumo Subcounty Hospital in Nandi after collapsing in the wee hours at her home in Kesegon Village-Kobujoi in Aldai subcounty. Cheramboss retired in 2004. She had been at the helm of the prestigious school for more than 20 years. She was largely resposible for its prestige. After her retirement, she retreated to her rural home in Nandi county where she and her husband Samson Cheramboss concentrated in farming and managing a chain of businesses. The mother of five, Cheramboss was on the board of several state institutions, among them Maasai Mara University and Koitalel Samoei University College. Following her death, Nandi head of the ACK diocese Rev Paul Korir said the church had lost one of the pillars. “She wasa lay canon of ACK church together with her husband and we are deeply saddened by her death,” Bishop Korir said. Her husband is a former GSU commandant and once a Presidential Escort Unit commandant. During the 24 years of President Daniel Moi's rule, Cheramboss  was synonymous with state power, elevating her school to one of the leading institutions in the country. In the current Parliament, five of the women legislators are alumni of Moi Girls-Eldoret, the products of Cheramboss' moulding. When she left Moi Girls, the school had expanded in population and infrastructure,due to Cheramboss' influence. She also help build the school chapel. “When she retired, she left Sh40 million surplus in the school account, which was  unlike other heads, because she feared theft and wanted to see the school grow,” David Kibet said. Kibe,is an old-time parent of the school, recalled with nostalgia times when Cheramboss chose to summon parents whose children had fees arrears - instead of sending them home. Edited by R.Wamochie
