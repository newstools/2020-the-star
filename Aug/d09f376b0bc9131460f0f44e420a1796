Gengetone artiste Odi Wa Muranga is on the spot after an upcoming artiste, B Classic, accused him of defrauding him and Champions Studios. B Classic says he paid Odi Sh25,000 and the agreement was that he write a verse for the music project and show up for the music video. But he went behind the artiste’s back and re-recorded the same verse with another group of artistes, Wakuu. “We are demanding Odi to pull down the song or refund Champions Studios for the damages he has caused,” B Classic said. However, Odi Wa Muranga denied wrongdoing. "I own the verse and they did not like it. A few weeks later, I took the verse to another artiste, who loved it and we released it and it became a hit," he said.
