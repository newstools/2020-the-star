One person was burnt beyond recognition when the vehicle he was travelling in was involved in a road accident in Narok county on Wednesday. The morning incident occurred at Suswa trading centre about 50 kilometres from Narok town along the busy Narok-Mai Mahiu highway. Narok police commander Kizito Mutoro said the two vehicles collided head-on. However, he could not immediately confirm the number of injured persons as well-wishers rushed them to various hospitals. “The only occupant of Toyota Wingroad tried to overtake another vehicle without giving way to oncoming vehicles thus collided head-on with a Toyota Premio,” Mutoro said. He added that immediately after the crash, the Toyota Wingroad caught fire. The motorist in the Toyota Wingroad was heading towards Mai Mahiu while the other one was going to Narok, the police boss said. The body was taken to Narok Referral Hospital mortuary for preservation awaiting postmortem. Mutoro asked drivers to be vigilant and observe traffic rules. “Drivers should observe simple traffic rules like avoiding overtaking in slopes or around the corner. Let us be each other’s keeper on the roads,” he said. He warned reckless drivers that the law will take its course and they will be charged for their misdeeds. Edited by R.Wamochie
