A bhang farmer who was suspected of killing a police officer and injuring another in a panga attack in Lamu West has been killed. Bunu Sabaki Shee was shot on Sunday by police officers from Hindi police station near his Kwasasi village home where he was allegedly hiding with other suspected attackers. A police report at the station indicates Shee’s wife did not tell of her husband’s whereabouts when police inquired. But her child told the police the father was at home. "The wife hesitated to give information but the child narrated to the police officers that the father was with other men outside boasting of having attacked police officers with a panga,” reads the report OB NO 11/09/08/2020. The police followed the lead and found Shee, alias Rasta, and two other men weeding the bhang farm. “The two suspects dashed to a nearby bush but their host who was later identified as Bunu Sabaki Shee holder of ID No 31290974 Bajun male adult aged 30 years advanced towards no 252077 PC Harun Mwangi while shouting and holding a panga intending to cut him.” “This prompted the officer to raise an alarm alerting other officers that his life was in danger. The police officer fired two warning shots but he continued to advance towards the said officer,” the report reads. The officers shot and killed Shee and uprooted the bhang from his farm. Shee was a suspect in the attack on two police officers in Siyu on August 6. Reports indicate that the two policemen were returning from Siyu village where they had gone for supper at 8pm when they were attacked. One of the officers sustained deep cuts on the head and the wrist. The other officer shot at the attackers, killing one on the spot. The accomplice escaped with bullet wounds, police said. Police recovered two pangas, a blood-stained police raincoat and a spotlight. The body was moved to Faza Subcounty Hospital awaiting postmortem and identification. The injured policeman is receiving treatment at the same hospital.
