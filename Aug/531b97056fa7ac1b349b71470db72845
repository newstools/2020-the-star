A notorious drug trafficker has been arrested alongside his two associates in Utawala, Nairobi. Tom Ouma has been operating with impunity in Nairobi and was on Saturday arrested alongside Paul Otieno and Stephen Barasa. DCI director George Kinoti said his arrest was in connection with the seizure of 368.5 kilograms of cannabis sativa (marijuana)valued at over Sh11 million. The cannabis was sized from motor vehicle Registration Number KCQ 741V that was intercepted along Nakuru - Nairobi Highway on August 14, 2020. Kinoti said the suspect is also believed to sponsor gangs in Korogocho, Huruma and Dandora to protect his business of drug trafficking. The three suspects are in custody awaiting arraignment on Monday. In March, PSK urged the National Assembly to enhance access to medical marijuana by amending the Narcotics and Psychotropic Control Act (1994). Executive director Daniella Munene noted widespread use of marijuana in the country, but those requiring it the most unable to access it. Cannabis is listed as a narcotic drug,Â  which subsequently criminalises its possession, cultivation, production and use. Despite these stringent controls, it is one of the most used narcotics countrywide as per a 2015 study by the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse.
