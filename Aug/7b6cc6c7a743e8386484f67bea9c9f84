The Labour court has suspended the appointment of Pauline Njoroge and four others to the Tourism Regulatory Authority board. Justice Hellen Wasilwa suspended the appointments pending the hearing and determination of a case by the Law Society of Kenya. The LSK has challenged CS Najib Balala’s appointment of Kevin Muasya, Alais Lenana Moi, Isaac Njangu, Pauline Njoroge and Najma Ismael to the board on Friday last week. The LSK argues that the appointments were unlawful and the five persons unsuitable persons for the positions. “The said appointments are unconstitutional, unlawful, illegal as they were done in total disregard of procedural requirements applicable in the Public service appointments,” read court papers. They argue that unless stopped, the Board will end up with unsuitable members handpicked and selected through an opaque and uncompetitive process. “This appointment was not subjected to the mandatory processes of public participation, which includes advertising vacancies, publishing lists of all applicants and shortlisted candidates and holding interviews and announcing successful candidates in an open and transparent manner consistent with Public service appointments” they argued. The LSK further says that the appointments contravene the provisions of Section 8(1) of the Tourism Act No. 28 of 2011. The section requires that members of the board be nominated or selected through a competitive process that considers their expertise in tourism-related disciplines. Judge Wasilwa directed the LSK to serve the CS, the Board and Attorney General who have been sued. The case will be mentioned on August 27.
