Muslim faithful can now breathe a sigh of relief after the Jamia Mosque opens its doors after five months of closure following the outbreak of the Coronavirus pandemic. The reopening was announced on Tuesday by Jamaludin Osman who invited all faithful to attend. "Alhamdulillah, today Jamia Mosque will be opened to the public after five months. No reservations for anyone, first come first serve," he said. However, the mosque who which can accommodate at least 10,000 faithful will now be limited to only 1,350 people. This is to ensure social distancing rules as announced by the Ministry of Health are observed. The worshippers have also been advised to carry their praying mats and wuhu ( ablution) when done. “Make sure you always wear a mask and seated on your own praying mat. Strictly no sharing of mats,” Osman stated. Before the faithful make their entrance into the mosque, they should ensure their temperatures are checked. They will also be required to sanitise or wash their hands with water and soap before entry. The worshippers have also been advised to follow instructions from the mosque’s staff and volunteers who will be in reflector jackets. They are also required to keep a distance of 1.5 metres by praying on the designated areas or spots marked. Also as part of the new measures, the mosque’s toilets and ablution areas will remain closed. On March 18, Jamia Mosque suspended all congregational prayers to curb the spread of Covid-19. Last month, President Uhuru Kenyatta announced that places of worship could resume allowing worshipers to attend service following the protocols developed by the Inter-Faith Council. Despite the announcement, some mosques and also churches opted to remain closed.
