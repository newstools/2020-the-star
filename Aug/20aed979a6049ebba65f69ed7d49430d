Aman said surgical masks are not supposed to be worn more than a day. He called for proper disposal of the used masks as well as emptied hand sanitizer bottles. He said the ministry is concerned by the pile of discarded masks by the road sides, on side walks, in railway stations, parks, markets, construction sites and bus stations. "They are not normal waste. Viruses and germs may remain in such discarded masks for long period of masks. Such waste  must be collected, treated and disposed properly." he said.
