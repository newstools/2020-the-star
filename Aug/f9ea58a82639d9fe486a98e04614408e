Interior CS Fred Matiang'i has hinted at his ambitions for the top seat in the country. The CS on Monday spoke in metaphors about his ascension into the country's national leadership in three different places in Nyamira, adding that President Uhuru Kenyatta was showing good will in elevating him to a position he said God alone will hand to him. "I am like a little child who is being helped to cross a road. I only need your prayers as God holds my hand to help me cross over. Our President is full of promise to our community and at an opportune time, he is going to surprise people when he appreciates," the CS said. The CS said he will rise to the occasion when the 'right time' comes. "I have been tipped for greatness in the country and I need your full support," Matiang'i told members of the community. In an eventful day at the county which he said is his backyard, Matiang'i met Nyamira Governor John Nyagarama and County Commissioner Amos Maroba at their offices before addressing MCAs at the County Assembly. "This is a respected leader nationally whom we have vowed to support to the last minute until we see him where we want him," Momanyi said. Nyagarama called upon politicians from the entire Gusii Community to come together and speak in one voice in support of the CS. He also held a security meeting with provincial administrators where he also requested for moral support in his yet-to be declared political ambition. He thereafter addressed mourners at the burial of Principal Chief Jane Matara's brother at Tombe Village. Matiang'i warned leaders from the region against being swayed by politicians. Matiang'i likened some leaders whom he said had outrightly defied the Community's political unity and moved out to support rivals to the biblical story of Esau who sold his birthright for a pittance.
