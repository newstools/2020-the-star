Kenya Lionesses skipper Philadelphia Olando is confident the team will be in prime physical and mental condition when the Tokyo Olympics kicks off next year. Olando said head coach Felix Oloo has created a fitness plan for every member of the squad to ensure they are in shape when sports resume. “The coach and management have shared plans for each player,” she said, adding: “We are doing individual training as no training is allowed because of Covid-19 situation” noted Olando. While the postponement of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics was setback for Olando and her teammates, rescheduling it to 2021 has given them more time to prepare for the tournament. “Postponing the tournament gives room for every player to prove herself and this creates competition in the squad. We place emphasis on core skills and we will be playing attacking rugby,” added Oloo. The Lionesses will be looking up to rising stars like 22-year-old Grace Adhiambo to bring flair to the game during the Tokyo 2020. A try scorer and playmaker Adhiambo played a crucial role in helping the Lionesses secure qualification for Tokyo 2020. The Lionesses finished 11th in Rio 2016 Olympics, winning one of the five pool games 22-10 win over Colombia. Olando believes the team will be competitive considering their experience in Rio in 2016. “The experience in Rio was a great. We lare aware hard work, exposure and mental preparedness is needed to play at the top level,” she obserbed. The skipper emphasised that in order for Kenya to be competitive at Tokyo, they will need the support of all stakeholders in ensuring they are mentally and physically prepared. The Lionesses were due to play in the World Sevens Series qualifiers in Stellenbosch, South Africa in March and feature in Langford and Paris Sevens events. However, the events were shelved due to the Covid 19 pandemic.
