Wrangles between a workers' union and Embu Water and Sanitation Company over collective bargaining agreement are expected to end and service delivery assured now that a new boss is at the helm of firm. Kenya County Government Workers Union Embu branch secretary  Obed Mwathi said they have high hopes that the outstanding differences will be sorted out with the appointment of Felix Mutura as the company’s managing director. Mwathi spoke at the weekend when workers welcomed Mutura as the substantive MD with promises of improved service to their clients. He replaces Hamilton Karugendo whose contract was not renewed after being the EWASCO boss since 2004. The CBA expired last year and efforts to negotiate a new one with the previous management bore no fruits, hence the bad blood with union and poor service delivery to Embu residents. EWASCO is the main water and sanitation services provider in the county. Mwathi said workers appreciated Mutura as hardworking and a person with the workers' interest at heart. He urged the workers to remain united, work as a team and not allow external and internal forces to divide them. He said the union will sit down with the new management and negotiate a new  CBA. The unionist said water provision is crucial, more so now that the county, like the rest of the country, is threatened by Covid-19.  - mwaniki fm
