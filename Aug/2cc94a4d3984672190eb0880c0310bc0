Kenya Livestock Council chairman Dubat Amey has urged Garissa and Wajir governors to take their cue from Mandera and form peace committees. Speaking to the press in his Garissa office, Dubat said inter-clan conflicts in the three counties of  Mandera Wajir and Garissa have claimed hundreds of lives over the years and mainly revolve around boundary, water and pasture disputes. Mandera unveiled a peace committee at the weekend. A 21-member team comprising elders from the two communities, officials from the county and national governments and the National Cohesion and Integration Commission (NCIC) was formed following four days of peace talks. The Garre and Murule have been fighting. Attackers torched houses and destroyed houses in recent clashes over the boundary between Lafey and Mandera South. Amey said such committees should have a clear mandate of uniting clans and averting violence. This should be done with the support of the NCIC together with the county governments to help in peace building that is also recognised by the national government, he said. "In the past, we have seen such committees only formed when situation have got out of hand and in most instances there is loss of lives. We don’t want to firefight when we have an opportunity to stop such violence before they occur,” Amey said. “I want to thank governor Roba, elders of Mandera county and the national government for coming up with such a committee which in my view if well supported will be a solution to the long standing conflicts between the two communities,” he said. Amey, a respected elder, further challenged the NCIC to do more in terms of promoting peace building in the entire Northeastern region. "For once they need to be aggressive and reach out to Kenyans message of peace and the need for communities to co-exist peacefully. if you ask Kenyans, the majority of them will tell you that the commission is not doing enough in as far as executing their mandate is concerned,” he said.
