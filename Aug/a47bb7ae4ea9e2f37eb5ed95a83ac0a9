Bomet Senator Christopher Langat has been arrested. The senator was arrested a few minutes before 11.30 am on Monday morning at his house in Nyayo Estate, Embakasi. He left his home alongside lawyer Nelson Havi on their way to the to Central police station. He is among three senators whose houses were surrounded by police officers on the wee hours of Monday morning who demanded for their arrest. Apart from Langat, the other two were Senator Cleopas Malala (Kakamega) and Steve Lelegwe (Samburu). The trio are allegedly accused of incitement. However, in a video seen by the Star, Langat claimed that he is being intimidated over his stand on the revenue standoff. "There is no need of all this..I am being threatened from every corner and i have evidence.. I have talked to the speaker and everybody..," he said. Embakasi sub-county police commander Francis Ngugi who led the night operations at the senator's Nyayo estate home says he was being sought for an offense allegedly committed in Bomet "There is a team of DCI that came from Bomet, we were just offering re-enforcement," Ngugi told the Star on phone. Senators on Monday morning demanded the release of their colleagues before they continue with the debate on the divisive county revenue sharing formula. The senators demanded the special sitting adjourned until the three senators were present in the chamber. Nairobi Senator Johnson Sakaja said he raised concerns of his security a few weeks ago. "I saw the same vehicle outside senator Langat's house. This is serious.. I expect senator Poghishio and James Orengo, to defend the senate," he said. "I know that wherever the senators are, the intention of the arrest is clear to everyone.Â  We cannot lose our country. We cannot lose our country. There is nothing bad as a coward leader." Sakaja urged senators that no matter how they voted they must stand united.
