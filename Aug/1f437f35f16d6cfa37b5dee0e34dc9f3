Are some governors using the Covid-19 pandemic to evade accountability? Well, a second-term governor last week forced a Senate committee to adjourn its meeting with him. Reason? The governor claimed he was experiencing coronavirus-like symptoms — dizziness and chest pains — and asked the chairman to adjourn the session. The county boss went ahead to accuse the committee of insisting on his physical appearance despite Speaker Justin Muturi declaring Parliament a 'Covid-19 hotspot'. He even said he will blame the committee if he tests positive for the virus. Just what could be simmering at a crucial committee of the National Assembly that members have to canvass their issues at the plenary? Well, a move by a member of the said committee to push for resolution of some pertinent issues, which lawmakers were overheard saying could be addressed at the committee’s meetings, is raising eyebrows. What motivated the concerns is the level of frustration the member displayed, even as his chairman attempted to assure him that the matter will be dealt with in good time. Those in the know told Corridors it will only be a matter of time before the goings-on become public. It appears a first-term lawmaker from Western is stung by the negative publicity around him lately. Well, the MP has of late embarked on hourly updates about CDF projects under his leadership. Those close to him say the man has taken over the task from his social media handlers and is posting by himself to save face. However, hawk-eyed Kenyans on Twitter are not giving the man a chance to breathe and have kept reminding him, through replies to his post, of the accusations he is facing, some bordering on very serious crimes.
