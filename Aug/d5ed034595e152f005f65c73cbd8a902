 Evans Ogutu was relaxing at Uhuru Park after walking for hours in Nairobi's central business district looking for job when he was approached by a man who identified himself as a policeman. To man had full police uniform only that he had a pullover. After a brief chat, the man told Ogutu that he was in a position to help him get a job including supplying items to the army barrack and the airport. They agreed to meet at Imenti House along Tom Mboya street to finalise the deal. By then, Ogutu knew his life would never be the same again. The man who has since been identified as Samuel Murigi organised the Imenti House meeting. At the meeting, Ogutu was promised a pass card for his business and Murigi advised him to hand over his phone and ID card to him and hold brief. Police records show it was the last time Ogutu saw Murigi. The man disappeared as Ogutu waited in vain. Murigi had introduced himself as a police officer from Central police station. On Wednesday, Murigi was arraigned before Kibera chief magistrate Joyce Gandani where he denied charges of police impersonation and stealing a mobile phone. He was charged with stealing Ogutu's Huawei phone valued at Sh13,000 and also impersonating a police officer. The police report said the suspect disappeared with Ogutu's phone with the victim only learning later that he had been conned. He reported the matter to the police. Murigi was granted a Sh100,000 bond with an alternative Sh50,000 bail. The case will be mentioned on August 20.  Edited by P.O
