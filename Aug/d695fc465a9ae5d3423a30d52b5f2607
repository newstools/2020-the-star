Healthcare workers in Nyeri county lack enough protective gear to fight the Covid-19 pandemic, deputy governor Caroline Karugu has said. Karugu said on Wednesday there have been complaints that frontline healthcare workers and especially at the primary level lack enough protective gear. However, she said, the county government will ensure all health workers at the Nyeri County Referral Hospital have enough protective gear before focusing on the rest of the facilities. The hospital, she said, hosts patients from across the region and health workers are extremely exposed. She said the facility has had five nurses and one doctor who turned positive in the line of duty and had to go into isolation. “We at some point had even closed down one of our wards just out of the fear of further infection of Covid-19,” she said. Karugu spoke at the county referral hospital when she received donations from Safaricom Foundation which included PPE, overalls, gloves, protective goggles, face shields, masks and sanitiser all worth Sh1.5 million. “We thought it wise to reach out to Safaricom Foundation and they have been extremely generous today and we have been able to receive these donations,” she said. Safaricom HR business partner Athman Ahmed expressed hope that the items will help protect health workers at the county facility. The county assembly of Nyeri on Wednesday released a report stating that the county had no capacity to handle a single critically ill case of Covid-19. The report was prepared by the ad hoc committee on Covid-19 preparedness chaired by county assembly Speaker John Kaguchia. This, the committee said, had led to the rise of Covid-19 deaths in Nyeri. The committee cited lack of oxygen to help those with breathing complication as one of the challenges. Edited by Henry Makori
