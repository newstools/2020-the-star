Fifty schoolgirls from Sameta subcounty have been impregnated since the outbreak of Covid-19. Subcounty director of education Kenneth Wesonga said the trend was worrying. The girls are primary and secondary students. He told the Star on the phone that his department obtained the data in collaboration with the ministries of Interior and Health. The director said teachers play a great role in shaping the character of the children, adding that the prolonged closure of schools will have a greater impact on children. Wesonga urged parents to take their parental responsibilities seriously. “I want to assure the girls that they will be readmitted to school to continue with their education as directed by President Uhuru Kenyatta,” he said. Kisii Woman Representative Janet Ong’era has also urged parents to closely monitor their children. “Some men are taking advantage of prolonged closure of schools to sexually abuse young girls,” Ong’era told the Star.
