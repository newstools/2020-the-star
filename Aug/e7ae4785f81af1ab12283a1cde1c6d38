The government will issue 70,000 title deeds in Kilifi county by the end of this year, Lands and Physical Planning Chief Administrative Secretary Gideon Mung’aro has said. He said the government has already processed 5,000 title deeds and 21,000 others are being worked on. Mung’aro spoke during a courtesy call at Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi’s office to give a progressive report and evaluation of the status of land settlement. He said the ministry is working round the clock to ensure Kilifi residents have no land ownership problems. His announcement is meant to give an assurance to people who have had perennial land problems, with the majority living as squatters. The CAS said the government was buying four parcels of land from tycoons to resettle the landless. “We are happy to inform Kilifi residents that over 5,000 title deeds are ready for issuance while 21,000 others will soon be handed over to residents,” he said. He said the state has already acquired one parcel of land in Mikanjuni, Mtwapa, at a cost of Sh377 million. Mung’aro said the government is in the process of buying 4,168 acres in Kagaa, Kibarani, and the five parcels of Mazrui lands, which are spread across Kilifi county. The Mazrui family owns a huge chunk of land in Kilifi county and has had court battles with squatters for a long time. Governor Kingi said he was impressed by the progress made by the national government to ensure people in Kilifi are given title deeds. “My administration will work closely with the national government to ensure that all residents of Kilifi county legally own land,” he said. Kilifi and the Coast region at large has had land ownership problems for many years. Successive regimes and politicians have been using the squatter problem to garner support from locals and get into power and drive their political agenda. President Uhuru Kenyatta in 2017 promised to resolve the squatter problem in the region. Edited by J. Muchangi
