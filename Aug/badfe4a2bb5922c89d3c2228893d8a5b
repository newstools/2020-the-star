As the country continues to receive mixed reactions from politicians on whether to have a referendum to amend the Constitution or not, Amani National Congress party Musalia Mudavadi questions the need for it. In an interview with NTV on Thursday, Mudavadi said that historically, politicians have made changes to suit them. “When it comes to the clamour for the constitutional amendment, how come this clamour always comes when a regime is coming to its sunset days or when a new regime is about to come in,” Mudavadi said. The ANC leader said political parties have been weighing how the amendments will give them a safe exit once their term comes to an end or consolidated entry point for those planning to come in. “Why don’t we talk about amending the constitution the moment that you take the power?  It is always towards the end.” According to Mudavadi, the Building Bridges Initiative debate has hardly touched on how to implement the two-thirds gender rule. “All the publicity in the BBI debate has been about sharing positions, to the extent that people are not talking about anything else about the constitution,” Mudavadi said. He continued,“They start talking about the government of national unity, what does that mean?... they start talking about do we need to have one, two or three Prime Ministers...” Mudavadi asked politicians to help President Uhuru Kenyatta to help Kenyans before his term comes to an end in 2022. "Let us be sensitive to people's lives. Uhuru's term ends in 2022. Uhuru's term is not ending in 2020."
