Seven people died and 14 others sustained serious injuries after a lorry ploughed into them at Kaburengu along the Eldoret-Webuye highway. Witnesses said the lorry which was ferrying ballast towards Webuye rammed into women selling their wares after its driver lost control on Monday afternoon. The injured were rushed to the Webuye Subcounty Hospital in the neighbouring Bungoma County. Deputy Lugari sub county Police commander James Ngetich confirmed the incident. He cautioned drivers against speeding while going down hill. The truck first brushed a matatu headed towards Webuye before it veered off the road into the traders who display their wares on the road side. Silvia Wetosi, a resident of Kaburengu, said the driver of the truck jumped out of it and left it rolling down. "We are hoping the government opens the flyover so that this place is not connected. It's unfortunate that single mothers who left their houses to fend for their children are not going back home," she said. "I saw the lorry rolling down very fast and when I saw it brush the Nissan on the right side I realised it has lost control," said a mataatu operator at the scene of the accident. Area MP Ayub Savula sent his condolences to the bereaved families. "I'm so saddened by the death of the poor women who struggle on their own to put food on the table. May their innocent souls rest in eternal peace," he said.
