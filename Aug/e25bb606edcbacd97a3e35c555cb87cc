Former Miss Tanzania Wema Sepetu says she once thought of committing suicide. Speaking on the 'Trendy Show', the actress said fame has been a bittersweet experience for her. The very first time she made headlines for the wrong reasons, she locked herself in the house for days. Since getting into fame in 2006, she is yet to get used to making headlines as every scandal always breaks her. "I have even sometimes thought of taking my life," she said. "My mum has been my support system, my pillar. When I got to the point of thinking of committing suicide, I had to go to her place and stayed there for three months to just start afresh. "She was there the whole time and she didn't even sleep. When I woke up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom, she would sit up and wait for me."
