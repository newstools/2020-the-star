Migori Governor Okoth Obado, all his children except one, and other co-accusedÂ  raised a total of Sh45 million to secure their release on bail on Monday. Obado's daughter, Susan Scarlet Okoth, was not released despite depositing her Sh3 million bail after failing to surrender her passport, which she said she had misplaced. All the accused were to deposit their passports with the court. Obado had earlier been granted a Sh8.7 million cash bail or Sh20 million bond. Chief Magistrate Lawrence Mugambi ordered that Obado be barred from accessing Migori County offices until the case is concluded. Mugambi said the same conditions that applied to former Kiambu Governor Ferdinand Waititu will also apply to Obado on access to his office. The magistrate said the governor will be escorted to pick personal belongings. Obado's children were also released on various bail amounts. Dan Okoth was granted Sh2 million bail, Jerry Okoth Sh2 million and Evelyn Okoth Sh2 million. Obado's family friend Jared Odoyo was granted Sh8.25 million cash bail and his mother Peninah Auma Sh2 million or a Sh4 million bond. The Chief Magistrate also ordered police to give all the identification cards numbers of the accused in the case to the Immigration Department who will block their departure from Kenya. Obado and his four children spent the weekend in police custody ahead of their bail ruling. Obado was on Friday arraigned alongside his children and seven others to answer charges of graft over loss of Sh73.4 million. The accused persons denied all the counts of graft at the Migori county government. They all denied that between October 29, 2014 and October 18, 2016 within Migori county they jointly conspired to commit an economic crime which was the unlawful acquisition of public funds totalling Sh73.4 million.
