Socialite Huddah Monroe says she would never break up with a man she is dating simply because he cheated. Huddah shared on her Instastories that the only man she doesn’t entertain in her life is a broke and stingy man. “I will never break up with a man for cheating! Lol! Stingy, yes, I’m done. Day 1! Bye! Bye, was nice to meet you." She further explored her thoughts on cheating in another post, where she challenged the notion that men cheat on good women with girls who are way below their league. “To a man every woman is beautiful, in her own way! Rich, poor, young, old, calm your ti**ies!” she said. She went on to advise her followers to always focus on what makes them happy and ignore other people’s opinions.
