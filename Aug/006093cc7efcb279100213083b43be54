Among players, who have left include Fidel Origa, Edwin Omondi, Stephen Odhiambo, Kennedy Owino, Maurice Ojwang, Abdallah Wankuru and Samuel Njau The arrival of Hamisi comes a week after Rangers released the trio of Harambee Stars trialist Mracelous Ingotsi, Danson Kago and Brian Osumba. Meanwhile, national U-20,Rising Stars midfielder Chrsi Owino is open to offers after his contract with National Super League side FC Talanta expired in June. Owino says he is ready to play either in the second tier or the top flight. "My contract with Talanta ended two months ago and the club is yet to launch negotiations. I am currently looking for a new home either in the NSL or KPL," he said.
