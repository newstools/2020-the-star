The resumption of the sport have been categorised into three phases with training set to begin immediately once the sports ministry gives the green-light. Phase Two will feature local matches with the final phase featuring international competition and officiating. Among a raft of measures already undertaken include restricting matches to singles with players entering the court one at a time. The new protocols further recommends that there will be no spectators at the club and no sharing of towels, food or drinks will not be allowed. TK secretary, Wanjiku Mbugua Karani, said they have adopted some of the recommendations of the International Tennis Federation and have tried to localise them to fit in the Kenyan situation. “Each player shall clearly have two marked sets of tennis balls and should use a racket or foot to pick up balls. Following completion of matches, players shall leave the promises promptly and should sanitise on their way out alongside their coaches,” she said. Other measures include screening for temperature and Covid 19 symptoms and observing social distancing. The Ministry of Sports on Monday released guidelines in the resumption of sports and asked stakeholders and federations to give their input within seven days.
