National Super League side Vihiga Bullets' youngsters Kelvin Mwavali and Lonny Amudava are on the radar of top Kenya Premier League sides barely a season in second tier. The two displayed an impressive performance in their debut season for Vihiga Bullets. Midfielder Mwavali and hard-tackling defender Amudava joined the Mbale-based side from Kapsengere and Chandumba secondary schools respectively and maintained their positions in the first eleven under coach Edward Manoah. In an interview, Mwavali revealed that he has been approached by top clubs in the Kenya Premier League though he was not in a hurry to jump ship. “Several teams have come calling but I am not under any pressure to make a decision. I must consult my club and family members first before making any move," he said. He added: “I can’t reveal the names of the clubs that have approached me but I can assure you they are top KPL sides. I believe I have a lot to learn and get more experience that will make me succeed at the top-level." The 23-year-old scored one of the spectacular goals against Ushuru at Bukhungu stadium during their National Super League match that ended 2-2 draw. Coach Manoah also singled him out as one of the bright spots in the team. “He has the potential and ability to succeed considering his physique, skills and discipline. He is also a very committed player," said Manoah. Manoah said Amudava is also reliable player and has been solid throughout the season. " He can fit in any team—be it NSL or KPL ," he added. Manoah said he is impressed with  the quality of his young side and vowed to fight for the top tier league ticket come next season. Amudava and Mwavali attributed their abrupt rise to coach Manoah.
