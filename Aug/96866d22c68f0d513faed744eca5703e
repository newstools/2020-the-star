A Kibera court was left shocked on Monday when a charge sheet was read to a man who is demanding Sh35 million “sanitation fee” from his ex-girlfriend, failure to which he'll expose her nude pictures before she marries her new man. The controversial man was arraigned before senior principal magistrate Derrick Kuto. He allegedly asked for the cash through an SMS. “[Sh] 20 million na io ni juu I am fair. You want to become a wife who is clean? No add 15m more. I want Sh35M for you to become his wife, a clean wife,” the text read as per the charge sheet. Maybe in an attempt to save his client from being slapped with a contempt of court sentence or arrest warrant, a lawyer said his client is better at home “for the sake of everyone”. "Let him stay home for the sake of everyone’s health as he developed a running stomach and fever," the lawyer has told a Nairobi court. He said that his client had used a public means and it developed Covid-19 symptoms. The magistrate directed that he finishes his quarantine and appears after 21 days. They say all sins are equal before God but here in Nairobi, thinks are different. Big crime offenders are tracked down by everyone — the police, journalist and even lawyers looking for clients. This week, a police officer at a Nairobi court was forced to chase away some minor offenders from the dock so that some murder suspects could have a place to sit. "Tokeni hapo, Kwanza Nyinyi ni watoto, wacha hawa wakae hapo, Nyinyi mtarudi baadae (Get out of that place, you are actually kids. Let these ones it there)," the cop ordered. The “big suspects” got a place to sit to follow their “big crime” charges.
