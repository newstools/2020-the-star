Wazalendo are targeting to reach semifinals during the annual African Cup of Club Championships set for November 30 to December 5 in Blantyre, Malawi. Newly appointed captain Stanley Chege said they are banking on collective team effort to achieve their goals. This will be Wazalendo's maiden appearance in the competition. "It is time for the players to compete against the big boys in the continent and it will be an honour to represent Kenya. "Despite this being our first time on the continental stage, I believe we have a competitive squad with unique characteristics and individual brilliance, who are ready to deliver. "The boys are young, talented and with the drive to win trophies . We also function as a unit," the midfielder said. "Of course we want to be comfortable playing at that level and gain valuable experience which will go hand in hand with the team's long term ambitions," added the 27-year-old, who joined Wazalendo at the age of 13. Chege replaced Kennedy Munialo who decamped from the Fidelis Kimanzi coached side to defending champions Butali Warriors. He said he is up to the challenge and that Wazalendo will fight for the Premier League trophy in the coming season. Wazalendo finished second in the leagueÂ  last season. "It is an honour to be the new leader. With the support of the team and the management, nothing is impossible. "Last season was good but the coming one will be better as we are ready to dethrone Butali of the title. "Every chance counts. We have wasted many chances previously and we are working on being clinical." The players are currently training at Ligi Ndogo grounds, Ngong and Embakasi. Early last month, the team launched the M-changa platform to help raise the Sh7 million required to facilitate the team's trip to Malawi.
