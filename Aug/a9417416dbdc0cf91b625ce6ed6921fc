Dear Felly, I have been seeing a man for a few months now. I met him through a friend. I think he could be the one I end up settling down with. The problem is we never speak on the phone unless he calls. When I call he never picks. He sometimes ignores my whats app messages for days. When he eventually replies he says he has been very busy with work. He says we should keep our relationship private even from the friend that introduced us until it is solid. Despite all this, he sometimes sends very loving messages and a little money here and there for lunch. We have not been spending time together because of Corona. After reading your article I am not sure about our relationship. Confused,  Sheila.  https://www.the-star.co.ke/opinion/columnists/2020-08-20-thin-line-between-seduction-and-lies/  Oh Sheila! You are right to be confused, but now you must face the situation. That man is either married (most probably) or has you waiting just in case he does not find anything better to do or be with. Either way, he is playing games with you and you need to decide whether you want to continue being a clown in that circus. I can tell though that you have doubts but you are looking for hope. “Despite all this, he sometimes sends very loving messages and a little money here and there for lunch….” Friend, you are being treated like a chicken being prepared for slaughter. The chicken is usually drawn near with maize that makes it hang around the kitchen. You know what happens next. ‘Off with the head!’ Do not feel bad though, every woman, E.V.E.R.Y woman meets this kind of man at least all the time. You have not done anything wrong, just move on quickly.  All the best Sheila.
