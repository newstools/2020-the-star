Esbon Waweru’s mother sent him to buy a packet of milk and when he returned, he asked to be allowed to play outside while morning tea was being prepared. A stranger suddenly appeared and called out, offering to give him a bicycle to ride. Thrilled, Esbon ran to get aboard the bike and he pedalled away. That was the last time he was seen, on December 21, 2015, just a few days to Christmas, four years and eight months ago. Waweru was seven years old when he went missing. The only son in the family of three siblings would be 12 years old today. At the time of his disappearance, Waweru lived with his mother and two siblings in Juja, Kiambu county. They reported his disappearance to the Juja police station under OB number 153/21/12/2015. His grandmother Geraldin Wathegi who now lives with her mother and other siblings in Mlango Kubwa in Nairobi told the Star her family has searched for her grandson with no respite. So was Waweru stolen? Is he alive mewhere or did he die? Frustrated, dejected and uncertain about whether to move on, this family's patience is running out and they are almost resigned to what appears their boy's sad fate. It is a continuing ordeal without any promise of closure, until they get him back, live or dead, his grandmother said. The family has announced Esbon's disappearance on social media, mainstream media and they have also gotten in touch with groups that deal with missing persons.  No news. Nothing from the police. Wherever her grandson is, Wathegi said, she hopes he is fine and one day will return home, or they will meet again somewhere. At the time he went missing, his mother and father had separated. The search has led the family to contact his father, in case the boy was living with him. "We initially thought he was with him [his dad] upcountry in Kiambu. We have checked there frequently using different styles, including ambushing them. But nothing," Wathegi said. (Edited by V. Graham)
