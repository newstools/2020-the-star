Six farmers from two villages in Homa Bay West are counting losses after hyenas killed 13 of their livestock on Saturday night. The farmers who hail from Akele-A and Arombe in Kanyabala sub-location lost sheep and goats. The hyenas allegedly raided their homes and attacked the livestock on the nights of Friday and Saturday. Speaking on Sunday, Pauline Odero said she lost four sheep after a hyena broke into the enclosure where the animals were sleeping. “The hyenas have caused serious economic drawback in my family. It has cost me a lot of resources to rear the livestock,” Odero said. Helen Nyaguda lost a goat and a sheep. “This is a serious setback because the livestock were expected to multiply so that I could sell their offspring to invest in other economic activities,” Nyaguda said. The residents said they are living in fear of being attacked by the hyenas if they are allowed to continue roaming in the villages at night. They called on the Kenya Wildlife Service to intervene and salvage them from further damage. Kanyabala assistant chief Isaiah Okello said residents suspected the hyenas might have sneaked out of Ruma National Park. He urged the KWS to restrain the hyena so it doesn’t cause more damage. He said they are going to liaise with the KWS officials to ensure the wild animals are restrained from causing further damage to the locals. Edited by R.Wamochie
