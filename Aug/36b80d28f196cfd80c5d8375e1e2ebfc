Former Embu Senator Lenny Kivuti has faulted senators for failing to approve the formula for allocating funds to counties based on population. Kivuti said the formula which senators have disagreed on will improve development in counties. The former senator observed that the one-man-one-shilling formula will be effective and affect people positively. The politician said the formula, which was recommended by the Commission on Revenue Allocation as the basis for allocating funds to counties, will ensure equitable sharing of national resources, unlike the other formulae based allocation on masses of land. Kivuti observed that it was unfortunate senators have failed to agree with the formula and reached a stalemate. Some of the senators have opposed the formula, arguing that it will deny unpopulated counties money. Kivuti was speaking at the Africa Inland Church in Embu when he donated 71 handwashing containers to Bishop Albanas Suma to distribute them to all the 71 AIC churches in Embu County. He has donated more than 3,000 such containers to Embu churches. Meanwhile, senators will resume debate on the proposed amendment on the third basis formula for sharing revenue to counties on Tuesday after disagreeing on the issue several days. The Commission On Revenue Allocation says the new formula is meant to improve service delivery, promote balanced development, and give incentives to counties to optimize capacity to raise revenue as well as incentivize cautious use of public funds. Kivuti called on the residents to continue complying with the governmentâ€™s rules to curb the Covid-19 pandemic. Embu county has so far recorded three positive cases.
