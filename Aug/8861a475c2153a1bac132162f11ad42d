An earthquake was experienced in Kilindoni area of Tanzania on Wednesday night. The U.S. Geological Survey said the earthquake had a preliminary magnitude of 5.9. Residents in Nairobi and parts of Mombasa had a moment of anxiety after experiencing a tremor around 8.13pm. This comes days after residents living around Lake Baringo panicked following cases of tremors as water levels rise because of ongoing downpours. They said they have experienced tremors every night for the last two weeks. “Our lives are at risk, something needs to be done urgently to research the causes,” Loruk resident Alex Sarit said. The tremors of undefined magnitude were felt by people living as far as seven kilometres from the lake. UoN lecturer and seismic expert Gladys Kianji said, "The size is not very large so we don't expect a tsunami, but we expect some flooding along the coastline." "If it occurred close to highly populated areas, we would expect damage to buildings if they were not constructed properly." She spoke to Citizen TV's JKL on Wednesday night. Kenyans took to Twitter on Wednesday to say they felt a tremor. More follows..
