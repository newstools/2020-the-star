Jubilee vice-chairman David Murathe resigned in public. A few days later, he came back. A party is a people’s vehicle and it is not up to an individual to resign today and come back tomorrow as if there are no issues. Jubilee party was given five years after its formation to elect its officials yet it has not done so. We are in this party because the President has not denounced it. Had he denounced it, we would have left long ago because the interim party leaders are not for its future progress. The party leader is about to complete his term and should be thinking of its future  in his absence and of a successor. If the deputy has not wronged him, he should be the automatic heir and available to help him drive the people's vehicle to its destination. Unless he has other ideas. It will not augur well for the President to dismantle a party he has led for five years - a party that made him President. What would that say about his legacy? The late (former) President Daniel Moi believed that Kanu would lead for the next 100 years even after he stopped being its leader. That is what a credible leader should do - stand with his party come what may. We are in this party (Jubilee) because we want the President to leave a strong legacy. This party should live beyond his time. That is why we are proposing that the next person in the party leadership line-up should be the deputy unless there is a very good reason for that not to happen. Murathe and company are holding Jubilee leadership positions on an interim basis. In fact if the registrar of political parties is someone who follows the law to the letter, there should be no party called Jubilee. The party should have been dissolved long ago for not adhering to the requirements of the Political Parties Act on elections.
