Former Changamwe MP Ramadhan Kajembe has passed on at Pandya Hospital. This is barely two weeks after his wife died of Covid-19 complications. Kajembe, who was ailing during his wife's burial, was not able to attend the ceremony as he was on oxygen supply. Some of his close relatives had been admitted at the same facility over a week ago, after the wife succumbed. Sources have confirmed he will be buried at 7 pm at the Kajembe family cemetery in Changamwe. That is where his second wife was also buried two weeks ago. Following the death of Kajembe, leaders and Kenyans have sent their message of condolences to the family of the ex-legislator. In his message of condolence,  President Uhuru Kenyatta eulogised the former Assistant Minister as a forthright politician, wise elder and accomplished trade unionist who served the country in different roles over the years with distinction. The Head of State wished the family God's comfort and fortitude as they come to terms with his demise. Deputy president William Ruto described Kajembe as a  charismatic, progressive and diligent leader who served the people of Changamwe with courage and distinction. ODM party leader Raila Odinga on his part eulogised Kajembe as a fearless right activist and  a dedicated servant of the people he served. Mombasa governor Hassan Joho said the deceased will be remembered mainly for his generosity.
