Mama Dangote, Diamond Platnumz’s mother, has been sharing photos of her granddaughter Latiffah Dangote (Princess Tiffah), who is Zari's daughter, on social media. In one of her posts, Zari commented, "Umezidi, Subiri Urogwe." This has not been taken well by Hamisa Mobetto’s supporters, who say Zari is trolling Hamisa. Social media users have translated her message to mean Hamisa might bewitch Mama Dangote for loving the child too much. Diamond Platnumz once came out to say Hamisa wanted to bewitch him so he could marry her. This is after voice notes of Hamisa and the alleged witch went viral. Tanzanian comedian Idris Sultan recently tickled netizens with a screenshot of an unknown woman chatting with her baby daddy, insinuating that Zari had similar traits. Zari laughed it off, saying, “Sultan you know who to tag unless you are afraid of witchcraft,” she wrote.
