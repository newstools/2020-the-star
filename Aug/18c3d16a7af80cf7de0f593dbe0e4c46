A third Kitui county executive might be sent home after ward representatives  on Tuesday voted 33-21 in favour of an impeachment motion sponsored by Kyome-Thaana Nzau MCA Alex Wambua. But Jacob Kakundi, the targeted Lands and Infrastructure CEC, on Wednesday dismissed as "fictitious" the allegations against him and vowed to fight back. Wambua accused him of failure to promote public confidence, thus violating Chapter Six of the Constitution on integrity and leadership. He is also accused of failing to implement county assembly resolutions and unfair and discriminatory service delivery. Further, the MCA says Kakundi has failed to provide the assembly with full and regular reports of his department. The CEC told the Star that the allegations are not only malicious but politically motivated. "They voted  to kickstart the process to impeach me. I am ready to defend myself. I am  falsely accused," Kakundi said, adding that he has a watertight defence and promised to tear to pieces the allegations. A special assembly committee will study the allegations and establish their authenticity. The assembly recently unsuccessfully attempted to impeach Governor Charity Ngilu. The assembly failed to raise the requisite numbers to send her home. The first of Ngilu’s executives to be impeached was Mary Nguli, who was in charge of the county treasury. Nguli went to court and the MCAs' decision was nullified. She, however, threw in the towel and quit. Late last year, the MCAs impeached Trade and Cooperatives executive Philip Mumo,  who too challenged the decision in court. The court upheld the impeachment, but Ngilu declined to give him the marching orders.   - mwaniki fm
