Diamond's producer Lizer, popularly known as Eyo Lizer, says he took a break from work because he was unwell. Speaking to Wasafi media, he responded to fans who thought he had exited WCB. He also rubbished claims he was depressed. “No, I didn’t have stress. I remember when I was sick, another producer had to do my work. I was indoors for three weeks because it was malaria,” he said. “I’m still at WCB. I’m the official producer there. My contract is still intact." He says people have been claiming he is out of WCB because he didn’t post photos on social media showing his time with Diamond Platnumz. “I’m not photophobic. I don’t need to post, I don’t even have a photo with Diamond. Most times, I do work with him and I don’t take photos,” he said.
