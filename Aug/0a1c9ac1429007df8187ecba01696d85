Senate Speaker Kenneth Lusaka has defended his leadership style, dismissing claims he is a lame duck and saying Kenyans should stop comparing him to his predecessors. "People have been comparing me with Kaparo, Marende, circumstances have completely changed; this is my style of management," he said during an interview with NTV on Thursday night. "People tend to forget the good that you have done and only concentrate on one small wrong incident." Lusaka said the Executive has not interfered with his work, terming situations where senior officials have ignored Senate committee summonses as "misunderstandings" rather than disrespect. On the arrest of three senators, Lusaka said,Â "I condemned it, it shouldn't have happened that way... especially on the eve of a crucial vote and it raises suspicion," he said. The arrest of three senators on Monday triggered a political storm in the Senate on Monday. Contingents of DCI detectives arrested Cleophas Malala (Kakamega), Christopher Lang'at (Bomet) and Steve Lelegwe (Samburu). They were later released. Lusaka said when it comes to the revenue sharing formula, there will always be counties that lose. "Senators are looking at a formula that will see all counties carried on board. In all formulas, there are counties that will lose some money." Lusaka said devolution implementation still a work in progress, adding corruption still needs to be dealt with. Taken to task on his involvment in the Sh100,000 wheelbarrow scandal when he was Bungoma governor, he said, "The people involved in the tender committee were taken to court... I was not in the tender committee.." "Like what is happening at Kemsa, do you want to tell me the President knows what was happening." Lusaka went on to say the word wheelbarrow was the wrong word, and rather what should have been used to describe the item was food trolley.
