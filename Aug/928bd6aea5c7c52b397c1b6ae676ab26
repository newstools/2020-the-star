Former Kakamega Senator Boniface Khalwale has rubbished claims by some Western residents and leaders that the "system" will steal Deputy President William Ruto's presidential victory in 2022. Speaking in Bungoma, Khalwale told Ruto's supporters not to worry about possible rigging of the vote. "People want to lie here that there is a system that will rob Ruto of his victory in 2022. That can't happen by any means," he said. Khalwale said the system is the electorate who have the power to choose their leaders. "People should not lie to you that if you vote for Ruto his victory will be snatched away because that thing called system is only in the head of David Murathe, another sly fellow called Karanja Kibicho, CS Fred Matiang'i and Cotu boss Francis Atwoli who are living in dreamland," he said. Khalwale said if the system existed, in 2002 former President Moi would not have allowed Mwai Kibaki to defeat Uhuru Kenyatta in the presidential race. Khalwale said 2022 will be a unique year in the politics of this country that will see a shift from dynasties to hustler leadership. He said Western must join hands with their neighbours to ascend to State House. "If you go to Hamisi constituency in Vihiga, Kalenjins are living peacefully with Luhyas. If you go to Aldai, Chesumei, Kwanza, Sabaot, Endebes, Cherengany and Mt Elgon, it's the same thing," he said. He said Mt Kenya region has managed to rule the country for long because of working together as a community. Edited by Henry Makori
