TwoÂ  men who allegedly caused injuries to a black and white cow after which they had been given the mandate to take care of were on Tuesday charged with causing it injuries. Elphas Shiunga and Moses Mase are said to have harmed the cow willingfully and unlawful on July 29 at Ndwaru are within Nairobi county. Both the police report and the covering report does not show if the complainant was given a P3 form on behalf of the cow but the documents shows that he was issued with an OB number. The two suspects pleaded not guilty to the charges.  The police report in court says that the complainant-Edward Njoroge- had gone to his farm to transport the animals which he had sold the previous day. He then realized that the cow had been wounded on the right side slightly above the ears. Njoroge inquired from the suspects who denied harming the cow and decided to report the matter to Kabete police station and he was issued with an OB number. The two suspects who were arraigned before Kibera chief magistrate Joyce Gandani pleaded for leniency. The magistrate released them on Sh 100,000 or a cash bond and directed the case to proceed on August 20. The constitution states that ; any cruelty towards an animal is illegal. It says that committing violence on the animal, overworking it while unwell, starvation, and denial of water, abandonment, poisoning, careless surgery procedures, hunting and killing in a cruel manner and prolonging the life of an animal in great pain is unacceptable.
