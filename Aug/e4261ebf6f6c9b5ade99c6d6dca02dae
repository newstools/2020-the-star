Former Kelele Takatifu member Didi Man has introduced a new artiste, Nzisa, in a new track, 'Thank You'. Speaking about the song, Nzisa said it is about thanking God. "Many times we make requests to God but we forget to thank Him after He fulfills them. "This song was specifically to thank Him for everything and praise Him for His wonderful deeds." Nzisa and Didi Man met in studio. â€œWhen I went to the studio to record my first song 'Hafulfilsara', Didi was also there. I had a hard time putting my ideas together and he came through," she said. "Since then, we have been friends and he has helped me write and re-arrange a lot of my songs." Besides music, Nzisa is a student at the Jomo Kenyatta University, pursuing a degree in procurement.
