A sheep was on Thursday sold for Sh53 million in Scotland. The pedigree Texel ram lamb Double Diamond was sold at the Scottish National Texel sale in Lanark. According to an article by the Guardian, the lamb was sold by Charlie Boden and family from their Sportsmans flock in Stockport, Cheshire. "The price quickly escalated from an opening bid of Sh1.5 million and the animal was bought by a partnership of three farmers," the British Media website reported. This is believed to be the most expensive sheep sold in the world. Jeff Aiken, the flock manager at Procters Farm, one of the buyers, said: “He is the best lamb I have ever seen – so correct on his legs, bright, with a great top. He’s got it all.” Previous record was Sh33 million which was paid for a Texel, Deveronvale Perfection, in 2009. The society said Texel sheep originated from the island of Texel, one of the north-western islands off the Netherlands that now dominate the UK sheep industry.
