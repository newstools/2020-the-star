The wrangles in Ford Kenya appear to take a new twist every time the two warring factions hold meetings. Each group appears to strongly believe it is legally in charge of the party. Rumour has it that the two factions are now visiting the constituents of their rivals and asking them to prepare for by-elections. The Moses Wetang’ula (pictured)-led faction says there will be by-elections in Wafula Wamunyinyi’s Kanduyi constituency and Eseli Simiyu’s Tongaren. Wamunyinyi, however, believes that as a founding member of the party, he can never be expelled. He is of the view that Wetang’ula found him there and he should instead go back to where he was before joining the party. *** Nyeri Deputy Governor Caroline Karugu is of the view that it would be dangerous to compel candidates vying for governor to pick deputies of the opposite sex. She says this proposal should be adopted only if deputy governors are made busy by having a portfolio. She wonders what two people of the opposite sex would be doing every day when one of them is idle throughout the term. She believes governors would be giving their deputies assignments that would keep them together all the time if they like their second-in-command and before long, the two might end up being a thing. *** A party supremo has told off an over-ambitious woman politician Nyanza to stick to her lane and stop jumping all over seeking unwarranted political favours. "I don't like someone who is never satisfied with what she has. Go slow on political matters. Or else you will one day carry a whole elephant home and collapse under the weight," he told the woman politician who was at the airport to receive him. The woman, known for being overbearing and aggressive, has now enlisted support of one member of the community council of elders and her clan elders to help her pursue her political ambitions. A text message sent to one of the elders confirmed the desperate efforts of the woman for clearance.
