The InterContinental Hotel is considering winding up its local operations declaring its staff redundant in 45 days time. In a notice seen by the Star, the 389-bed hotel hotel sighted operational reasons for the plan which would end in the loss of all employment positions. “We hereby give you 45 days notice of the hotels intention to declare your position redundant," it read. "Please note that we have set up communication channels to address any issues arising." The 51-year-old hotel has previously been the subject of a looming auction in early 2019 over unpaid debt. Intercon is a five-star hotel strategically located overlooking the mausoleum of founding President Jomo Kenyatta and Parliament buildings. The impact on Kenya’s tourism industry has been crippling with over 15 million Kenyans directly and indirectly affected by the pandemic and loss of business. Last month, Tourism and Wildlife CS Najib Balala tasked the Kenya Tourism Board(KTB) to formulate new marketing strategies that can guarantee the tourism sectors future. The hospitality sector also received support from the government which formed the National Tourism and Hospitality Protocols Taskforce meant to develop tourism and hospitality protocols and guidelines in response to Covid-19 pandemic and to support tourism operations. Additionally, the tourism sector received the biggest boost from the government’s stimulus package plan with hotels and other hospitality facilities set to receive soft loans through the Tourism Finance Corporation (TFC), while a total of Sh2billion will be set aside to support the renovation of facilities and the restructuring of business operations in the industry. The CS has also tasked the newly formed Kenya National Convention Bureau (KNCB) to formulate strategies that will see the country tap into future Meetings, Incentives, Conferences and Exhibitions (MICE). Investors in the sector were also challenged to upgrade their facilities, mainly those with old hotels and lodges.
