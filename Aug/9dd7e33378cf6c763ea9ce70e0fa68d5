Female Genital Mutilation is on the rise as perpetrators take advantage of prolonged school closures and limited movement imposed to stem Covid-19 infection, a group has said. Speaking after training youths on usage of social media for advocacy on Thursday, Womankind Kenya program coordinator Maryan Abdirahman said circumcisers have ample time since many people are confined to their homes. She said more worrying is that girls as young as three years old are now undergoing the cut undetected. In partnership with Unicef, she said, the firm is involving other stakeholders including youths and Nyumba Kumi officials. Womankind Kenya has been in the forefront in advocating girls' education and fighting gender-based violence. Abdirahman said they also have a close working relationship with the Judiciary that has a Judicial Service Week to hear cases involving children. Speaking at a recent function, county commissioner Meru Mwangi put chiefs on notice saying anyone whose jurisdiction will be found to entertain the practice will face stern disciplinary action. “Chiefs are aware of what is expected of them and the consequences of not enforcing the law. FGM in Kenya is has been banned and anyone found doing it will face the music,” he said. Mwangi also warned parents and guardians who were secretly cutting their girls that they will not be spared if caught. “The children have been at home since March due to circumstances that are beyond our control. however does that not give room for their rights to be violated by anyone,” he said. FGM is deeply rooted in northeastern with efforts by government and NGOs to eradicate the vice bearing minimum success. The practice has been blamed for birth complications, fistula and child marriages among others. Edited by R.Wamochie
