Lack of proper parenting is to blame for the rise in sexual abuse of chidren, Nyeri child rights activist Ann Wambui has said. Wambui, who manages Neema Rescue Centre urged parents and guardians to be more alert to stop cases of sexual abuse of children. Neema rescues children from the streets and rehabilitates, resocialises and reintegrates them into the community. Wambui said on Wednesday that Nyeri county has recorded 37 cases of sexual abuse since the outbreak of the pandemic. Children have been out of school since March. Wambui urged parents whose children may have been abused to seek justice and counselling. “It is through counselling that victims are able to overcome the long-term effects of the abuse which can cause serious damage to cognitive, social and emotional development of a child,” she said. She spoke during a counselling session for victims and their parents at the Youth Empowerment Centre in Nyeri Town. Besides counselling, the foundation also assists victims get legal representation. “My overall vision is to put up a rescue centre where victims can be housed for some time to help them regain self-esteem and lost identity due to the effects of abuse, as well as teach them life skills and coping mechanisms,” she said.
