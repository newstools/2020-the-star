Zena Chemutai is ready to make amends at the World Under-20 athletics Championships next year in Nairobi after missing out on the podium in the last event in Tempere, Finland. The reigning Africa U-18 3,000m champion finished 4th in her specialty in Tempere and says she is determined to make the podium if not win gold this time round. She promised to work with the rest of the team to ensure they retain the overall title the country won in Tampere in 2018. “I have been training well for the World U-20 show and right now I am at my peak. Despite coronavirus pandemic, my training programme has been smooth,” said Chemutai, who trains under coach Erick Kimaiyo. Initially, she admitted that training alone at home was difficult until Kimaiyo invited them to the camp under strict Covid-19 protocols. “Staying at home was one of my worst experience. I couldn’t train at home since I am the only athlete and training alone is difficult,” explained Chemutai. The runner, who started her running career while in standard six at Kapchpso Primary school, first represented the country at the 2018 World Under-20 Championships, where she posted disappointing results. “A shift from her school to Keringet Boarding Primary helped her to sharpen her skills before going on to win Africa Youth Championships winning 3,000m title,” added Chemutai. She hopes Covid-19 will end soon to enable her focus on the programmes ahead. “I have been training in preparations for the World U-20 and to be honest, I and my team-mates have improved a lot. I train alongside Winnie Kimutai who made the team for Africa Cross Country Championships in Lome, Togo but failed to travel due to corona,” she said.
