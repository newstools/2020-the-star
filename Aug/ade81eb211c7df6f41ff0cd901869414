WCB singer Mbosso says he is not ready to settle with only one wife. As a Muslim, he is allowed to marry up to four wives, but he says he has the ability to shelter more than 20. He said this during the live transmission of Diamond Platnumzâ€™s sister Esma's wedding to Yahya Musizwa as his third wife. "When bachelors like us see an event like this, it gives us the inspiration to get married," he said. "I think I will also get a beautiful woman here. You never know, I might get a wife here." Mbosso then added that four wives are not enough. "If I get even 20 or 10 or 15, I will be good. But to me, four women are too few," he said. Mbosso is already a father of three children from different women.
