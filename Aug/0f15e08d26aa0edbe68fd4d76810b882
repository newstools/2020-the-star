Gukena FM comedian Wangari Nguri, better known as Auntie Jemimah, says cyberbullying cost her her relationship. Jemimah is known for her funny skits, which she does in Kikuyu. Like most celebrities, Jemimah says two years ago, she became the laughing stock on social media after she was compared to gospel singer Size 8. "They said my arms were masculine. I think it is because I hit the gym so much. I even stopped wearing open clothes as I was so insecure with myself,‚Äù she said in a YouTube interview. "I started hating myself and I had self-esteem issues, like I was so affected. Outside I was happy but inside, I was not. "It even affected my relationship. So tukikosana, I would think he was doing that because he thought I was ugly." Jemimah says after talking about it to some friends, they advised she seek help. "I went for therapy for two months and after talking to them (therapist), I realised that when people say bad things about you, they want to be like you but can't," she said. She has overcome that and she says she can now flaunt her arms anytime. Jemimah first came to the limelight after she recorded a video on her phone about how Kikuyu men ask for sex. To her surprise, the video went viral, with people wanting more. She has over 90K subscribers on YouTube.
