National Assembly Minority Leader John Mbadi has said MPs should not keep quiet when they see their colleagues in the senate being arrested. Mbadi said that if they do not condemn the arrests, the same thing might equally happen to them. “When we see senators being harassed and arbitrarily arrested, we should not keep quiet as it could also happen to us. We must condemn such acts regardless of our political persuasions,” Mbadi said. The MP was making his remarks on Tuesday during the Third Leadership Retreat of House Leadership held at Ole Sereni hotel. The MP was referring to last week's arrest of senators Cleophas Malala (Kakamega), Christopher Lang’at (Bomet) and Steve Leleg’we of Samburu. The three were arrested on August 17 and released later, a move which saw the Senate Special Sitting to debate on the Third Basis Revenue Formula adjourned. Mbadi also noted that there have been cases where MPs have been targets of harassment by other forces outside the legislature. “It is paramount for MPs to stand together and condemn such acts in the spirit of the Doctrine of Exclusive Cognisance.” He also lauded the government for the exemplary measures it has taken to contain the prevailing pandemic and that the scrutiny of is spending should not be derailed. “Scrutiny of the Executive actions and spending must never be derailed by the pandemic as such lapse or vacuum can open floodgates for rent-seekers and outright misappropriation of public resources.” The meeting was attended by the National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi Majority leader Amos Kimunya and the House Committee Chairs. The members met to review the extent of the implementation of the resolution of last year's retreat. The retreat is also expected to assess the success so far of transacting House business and consider avenues for continuity of House business, both in plenary and in Committees, under the new normal.
