After getting affiliated to the Kenya Rugby Union, Administration Police Warriors are targeting to play in the Kenya Cup in the next three years. “We wanted to play in the KRU Championship next season but we lost out in the play off.  We are now back to the drawing board and we hope to play in Kenya Cup in 2024,” said AP chairman Alfred Juma. “We are happy to be affiliated with KRU. We formed this club in 2013 and we are happy with the progress we have made so far." In the Nairobi region semifinals played early this year, the law enforcers lost 20-9 to Shamas Foundation, a loss Juma attributed to inexperience. “We have a young team of players aged between 21 and 24. They have gained invaluable experience in the 15’s and 7’s series,” he told the Star on phone. Juma said they have rehabilitated their home ground at Administration Police Training College in Utawala in Nairobi to required standards. AP Warriors becomes the 49th affiliate of the union after meeting Kenya Rugby Union’s eligibility criteria and the Ministry of Sport’s requirements for registration under the Sports Act 2013. The law enforcers’ affiliation was accepted last week during the union’s Annual General Meeting which was held online. Four other clubs  — Chuka Vikings, Vihiga Granites, Meru RFC  and CITAM Kisumu were unsuccessful in their bid for affiliation. Kenya Rugby Union Chairman Oduor Gangla said: “We’ve watched AP Warriors go from strength to strength over the last three years they’ve been playing, we are happy to welcome them into the rugby family.”
