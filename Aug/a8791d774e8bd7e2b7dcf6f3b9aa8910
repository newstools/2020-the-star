Saboti MP Caleb Amisi has warned his Kiminini counterpart Chris Wamalwa against visiting his constituency without his knowledge, only to insult him. "Chris visits my area without notifying me, hurls insults at me in public, but Chris must know that I'm the lion of Saboti and will bite him if he continues the trend," Amisi said in Kitale on Monday. Wamalwa has been touring Saboti weekly to popularise his candidature for the 2022 Trans Nzoia gubernatorial race. He also campaigns for Joseph Pepela for the Saboti seat in 2022 during the visits. Amisi alleged Wamalwa fuels hate among the peaceful Saboti residents. "I want to tell Chris that Saboti has an MP who is equal to the task. Instead of coming to my area, kindly deal with Kiminini poverty, which is rampant compared to Saboti," Amisi said. He told Wamalwa that Saboti will soon be a no-go zone for him. "Chris should not behave as if he is already the governor. He should not think that nobody else can be Trans Nzoia governor. I can be equal to the task but respect is what is important," Amisi said. The lawmaker said Wamalwa should brace himself for a tough political duel if he continues meddling in the affairs of Saboti. At the same time, Amisi urged senators to pass the county revenue sharing formula law with much weight placed on population and not geographical area. The bill has failed eight times in the Senate, disrupting services in the counties. Amisi also called for an amendment to the CDF Act so the money can also be shared based on population. "In Saboti, for instance, I receive almost 20,000 bursary applications, yet I only receive Sh35 million. A constituency in Lamu with a population of 5,000 people receives the same amount. It is unfair to other Kenyans," Amisi said. Areas with bigger populations need more hospitals, schools and markets, he said. (edited by o. owino)
