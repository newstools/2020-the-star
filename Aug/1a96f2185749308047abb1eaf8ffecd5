Anti-riot police Thursday tear-gassed in Nyabite and Kebirigo towns and arrested hundreds of youths protesting against alleged corruption by the Nyamira administrations. The protesters disrupted business in the towns as they called for accountability from Governor John Nyagarama. The youths — members of  Nyamira ni Yetu Sisi Mayouth organisation — carried twigs, placards and whistled through the towns to denounce Nyagarama’s 'rotten' leadership. At Kebirigo, more than 40 anti-riot police were deployed. They arrested the group's chair Vitalys Ongaro and secretary Alfred Onsare. Both were detained at Nyamira police station. Ongaro said the demonstrations will go on until Nyagarama  has fully accounted for the funds he has allegedly misappropriated. “Even if you arrest me, this crusade demanding for our rights will continue until justice is done to Nyamira youths,” Ongaro said as he was bundled to the police vehicle. The group petitioned the Ethics and Anti-corruption Commission  and the Directorate of Criminal Investigations to probe Nyamira affairs. The youths accused the governor of employing retirees in his government as they wallow in poverty despite their academic qualifications. They also claimed that Nyagarama had promoted nepotism in his government. Group spokesman Clinto Rira told journalists in Nyabite where they fled to escape police that they wanted those arrested released unconditionally. “We had notified the police about the demo on 7th this month but we were surprised when they came out in their big numbers to disrupt the demo,” Rira said. Nyamira police boss Lilils Wachira said that they could not allow the demo because of the coronavirus guidelines. Wachira said that police still considering whether to arraign those arrested.
