Detectives on Friday seized three people found disguising themselves as KRA corporate officers and demanding a Sh500,000 bribe from a businessman to forestall investigations into an alleged tax evasion case. The officers from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) nabbed the suspects in a sting operation. "The afternoon operation also saw the confiscation of assorted documents used by the three imposters — John Ajode Odhiambo, Joel Amino and Erick Otieno — to dupe the victim, who works with a distiller company within Nairobi," the DCI said. They have been placed in custody pending further processing by the DCI, the Crime Research & Intelligence Bureau and the Nairobi operations team. The DCI also announced that it arrested one Paul Mwangi Warutere, whom it described as a notorious fraudster, for allegedly defrauding unsuspecting victims of more than Sh16.9 million by duping them to fund a nonexistent WHO container supply contract. "He was arrested yesterday (Friday) by DCI detectives in his Ngong hideout," the directorate said.
