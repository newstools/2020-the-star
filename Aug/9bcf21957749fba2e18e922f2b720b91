Kenya Rugby League Federation will incorporate a two-tier league for the 2021 season. Chairman Richard Nyakwaka said the first tier will have six clubs and will be the Premier League and will be ran on a semi-professional basis while the second tier will have eight clubs. Nyakwaka said they have received positive responses from clubs across the country. "We have goodwill from several parts of the country and we expect it to grow in leaps and bounds,” said Nyakwaka. He said the two tier league will help identify and select players for the national team as they seek to qualify for the 2025 Rugby League World Cup. "We missed out on the cycle for qualification to the World Cup but we stand a good chance of qualification in five years time as we put up the relevant structures in place,” he said. The former Kenyan international said they will invest in age group structures;  from under 12 onwards for both boys and girls . The federation has signed a 10-year commercial and strategic partnership agreement with Homeboyz Entertainment Limited. This will enable the events and entertainment outfit handle the federation's commercial and business components relating to its Premier League competitions.
