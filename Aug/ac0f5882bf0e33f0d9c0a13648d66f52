Cartels said to be against the ongoing human resource audit in Vihiga county to weed out ghost workers have threatened newly appointed county secretary Ezekiel Ayiego. Ayiego replaced Philip Gavuna, who was acting after Francis Ominde was removed for gross misconduct in September 2018. Ayiego told the Star that unknown individuals brought some chicken bones in his compound with a notice on them at the weekend. “To the county secretary and head of public service Mr Ezekiel Ayiego, wachana na wafanyikazi wa county government ya Vihiga wafanye kazi yao, if not, there will be repercussions" the note said. An adamant Ayiego, however, said that no amount of intimidation will stop him from serving the people of Vihiga and ensuring justice. He vowed that the audit will continue until the payroll is totally cleaned. “It sounds so weird that the governor can’t tell the number of staff he has in the county, despite being at the helm of the county for the past three years. That’s what we are working on and we must have answers to that,” Ayiego said on the phone. He said the county will no longer lose cash to ghost workers. “If we manage to clean the payroll, we are going to have enough funds for development in this county. Cleaning that payroll is non-negotiable,” he said. "We are already done with the head count and we are now in the verification process." Verification, he said, will include the directors in relevant departments where each staffer will be linked to her or his file. They will check when an employee was hired, leave procedures and other key information attached on the individual. "Once we are done with verification, we will be in a position to tell the exact number of staffers we have in this county." Edited by EKibii
