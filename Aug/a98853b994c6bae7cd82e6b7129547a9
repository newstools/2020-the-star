Deputy President William Ruto has thrown his weight behind Ruto the amendments by Senators Johnson Sakaja and Mithika Linturi to end the counties' sharing revenue stalemate. Ruto on Friday said a united and patriotic senate will deliver the solution to revenue formula. Via a tweet on Friday, Ruto said the emerging consensus on the revenue formula by Sakaja and Linturi is a good path towards a win-win outcome. "Where populous counties receive reasonable increase while the others make major savings from otherwise huge loses is a big stride in pursuit of a win-win outcome," he said. Earlier, a section of senators backed a blend of Sakaja's proposal and Linturi amendments as the only solution to the revenue sharing formula stalemate. Linturi had proposed further amendments to the Sakaja's proposal which is currently before the Senate. The Meru senator's amendments retains most of parameters in the Sakaja's formula but only seek to to reduce base from the proposed Sh316 billion to the new base of between Sh250 billion and Sh270 billion. The team said any amount above the agreed base will be subjected to the Sakaja formula. "We are supporting an amendment sponsored by Linturi which is a further amendment to the one sponsored by Sakaja," Elgeyo Marakwet senator Kipchumba Murkomen said in a statement on Friday. Murkomen admitted that there has been protracted engagement in the Senate concerning the basis for allocating among counties. Senators Ledama Olekina (Narok) and Agnes Zani (nominated) were among senators who attended the Friday briefing at a Nairobi hotel.
