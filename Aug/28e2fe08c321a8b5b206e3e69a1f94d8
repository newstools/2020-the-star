Coffee theft has reduced drastically in Nyeri county, with only one case reported this year. County commissioner Loyford Kibaara on Friday said only Giakanja has reported coffee theft. Coffee theft has been widespread in the previous years. In January, robbers raided the factory and made away with 60 bags of parchment coffee worth Sh3 million stored in its warehouse. Kibaara, as a result, called on chairmen of cooperative societies and their managers to follow instructions by the county security committee to avert theft. “The security committee is also working towards avoiding coffee hawking,” he said, adding that they will not allow people to steal or hawk coffee. The county security committee will protect the coffee from the time of delivery to factories to the time it is delivered to millers, the administrator added. Kibaara, however, told managers and chairmen who will defy the instruction that they will be held liable for any theft. “I just want to impress on you to work with us and continue taking good care of our farmers’ coffee. We will help you in every way possible so we can succeed in preventing the theft,” he said. Kibaara spoke at Nyeri National Polytechnic in Nyeri town during a Coffee Cherry Advance Revolving Fund sensitisation meeting chaired by New Kenya Planters Cooperative Union chairman Henry Kinyua. The meeting brought together coffee factory management officials from the county.
