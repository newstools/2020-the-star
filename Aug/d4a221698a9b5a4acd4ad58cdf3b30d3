The Court of Appeal has dismissed a case by graduates of Masinde Muliro University challenging the constitutionality of the Engineers Act. The graduates sought to have the decision by High Court judge Mumbi Ngugi who found the Act constitutional set aside. They claimed the judge erred by failing to find that the requirements for the qualifications to be an engineer as provided for under the Institute of Engineers of Kenya’s (IEK) by-laws are discriminatory on the basis of age. It was contended that by reason of Section 16 of the Act, for a person to be eligible for registration as a professional or consulting engineer, one has to be a corporate member of the IEK. But appellate judges Wanjiru Karanja, Hannah Okwengu and Fatuma Sichale said the Act cannot be discriminatory against the graduates on the basis of age as age requirements are expressly set out in the IEK by-laws and not under the provision of Section 16 of the Act as alleged. “If they were aggrieved by the by-laws then they should have challenged them and not the impugned Act,” the judges ruled. The graduates also challenged the Act on account of public participation. But the appeal court observed there is evidence on record that there was some level of public participation before the law was eventually enacted in 2012. They said the fact that all stakeholders were provided with a forum to give their opinions meant the impugned law passed the constitutional test of public participation. “It is common ground that an invitation for public participation was made to all stakeholders,” they said. The graduates faulted the judge's decision on grounds that despite such public participation, the views of the stakeholders were not taken into consideration. But the Court of Appeal said there is no requirement in law that all stakeholders' views collected in the course of public participation must be incorporated in a proposed bill. Edited by Henry Makori
