Teso North MP Oku Kaunya has asked President Uhuru Kenyatta to deal decisively with people said to have misappropriated Covid-19 funds. They should be arrested and prosecuted and if found guilty be jailed, the MP said on Monday. He said property acquired by the billionaire looters should be confiscated and sold. The money, he said, should be spent on development to benefit Kenyans. The Kenya Medical Supplies Authority has been in the spotlight after it emerged that officials dished out tenders to mysterious entities under the cover of combating the Covid-19 pandemic. Counties are equally under pressure to explain how they spent hundreds of millions of shillings allocated to the fight against coronavirus. “Issues of corruption at Kemsa must be addressed squarely and I thank the President because on August 21, he issued a circular which I have seen through the head of public service instructing the Directorate of Criminal Investigations to take action,” the MP said. The Amani National Congress MP spoke when he toured Chamasiri Technical Training Institute on Monday. Kemsa has been under the spotlight following an audit that exposed procurement and other financial irregularities that put at risk more than Sh100 billion of donor funds and taxpayers' money. Chief executive officer Jonah Mwangi has since been suspended. MPs have demanded that the Health Ministry and the National Treasury explain how they spent money meant to mitigate the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic.  Edited by Henry Makori
