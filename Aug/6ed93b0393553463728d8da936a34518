Con artists have been swindling Nyeri residents out of their money by promising to allocate them stalls at the Sh600 million Nyeri town's main bus terminus, Governor Mutahi Kahiga has said. The terminus is still under construction. Phase one of the project is 80 per cent done. It will have about 600 stalls. Kahiga on Monday cautioned residents against falling victim, saying the government has not started registering, charging or allocating the stalls. “We have not started the allocation of the stalls and when it will start, we will make it public for transparency,” the governor said. The county chief added that all roads to the area have been completed and the county is working on a matatu waiting bay. “We are going to have 600 new shops and hotels that we will give to our people at a very reasonable price so that they are able to run their businesses,” he said. The governor said the plan is to have in excess of 1,000 shops once the entire bus park is complete. The area was initially used as a dumpsite before being rehabilitated. He spoke when he inspected the construction of Nyewasco-Library Road and the ongoing works at the terminus.  Edited by A.N
