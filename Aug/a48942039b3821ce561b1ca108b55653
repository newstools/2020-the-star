A water drilling rig acquired at Sh40 million will serve half the population of Busia county, Governor Sospeter Ojaamong has said. Addressing the press at the Water department after commissioning the drilling rig on Monday, Ojaamong said it will solve the water shortage that residents face in most parts of the county. The governor thanked the 12 MCAs for pooling resources through the ward development project funds to raise Sh35 million, prompting the county government to top up with Sh5 million to realise the objective. The wards that contributed towards the project were Angurai North, Angurai South, Angurai East, Malaba South, Marachi Central, Angorom, Chakol North, Chakol South, Nambale Township, Bukhayo Central, Bukhayo East and Amukuera East. "This is a milestone to Busia, which joins a few other counties that have purchased the water drilling machine instead of outsourcing it at exorbitant prices," Ojaamong said. He urged the Water department to make full use of the drilling rig to ensure the entire county benefits. Deputy Governor Moses Mulomi said the drilling rig is a milestone in the county's effort to improve the water coverage, especially at this time when the country is grappling with Covid-19 challenges. Water executive Isaac Alukwe said the county has procured a camera to be used for mounting, drilling and borehole maintenance. Deputy speaker Lawrence Okaale, who is also Angurai North MCA, said the drilling rig will help address the water shortages in Teso North, Teso South, Nambale and Butula subcounties. Edited by EKibii
