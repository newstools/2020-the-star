Nyanza regional commissioner James Kianda has put on notice owners of clinics offering abortion services. The warning follows concerns that some clinics were offering abortion services, especially in the informal settlements in Kisumu. Kianda said abortion will encourage young girls to engage in unprotected sex because they know there are clinics where they can get rid of the pregnancy. On Monday, he warned that those carrying out abortions will not be tolerated. He said that the Director of Criminal Investigations has been fully briefed to investigate those practising abortion within the clinics. Kianda said anybody found will be dealt with individually and accordingly as a practitioner and their clinics closed. “We cannot allow some unscrupulous people to ruin the lives of young girls. Any wayward medical practitioners conducting abortion will be arrested and charged,” he said. The official said cases of teenage pregnancies, domestic violence and drug abuse were on the rise since the outbreak of Covid-19. “Teen pregnancy is a major concern. We are going to be ruthless to those who are misleading and impregnating our girls,” he said. Kianda directed chiefs and assistant chiefs to fight early pregnancies in their areas. Kisumu East MP Shakeel Shabbir called for a collective responsibility against teen pregnancy. He said through his Sasa Foundation, he was setting up a unit to handle the rising cases. “As leaders, it is our responsibility to ensure the safety of our young generations. These early pregnancies must end,” Shakeel said. While touring the newly built Sh35 million Dago Primary School, he supported the programmes aimed at empowering youths to make them more productive. The fully-funded CDF school has 12 modern classrooms with additional ECD classrooms built by the county government. Edited by R.Wamochie
