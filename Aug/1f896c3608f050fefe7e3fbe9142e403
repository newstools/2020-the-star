Private schools have promised to properly use Sh7 billion concessionary loans from the government meant to cushion them from the Covid-19 crisis. Education CS George Magoha was quoted in the media as having said last Sunday in Kisumu that the ministry will bail out struggling private schools. This followed concerns that many private institutions could close permanently, a situation that could disrupt learning when schools reopen. Kithinji Kiragu, an Embu entrepreneur who has heavily invested in the education sector, has commended the government for the planned bailout. He said the money will come in handy as most private schools have been unable to pay their staff and perform some critical operations. Kiragu, a public sector and governance management consultant, owns a primary school in Nairobi, a secondary school in Embu and a college of professional studies in Embu. He said the private schools and colleges have borne the brunt of a cash crisis occasioned by the virus. He said they usually depend on fees paid by the parents and by the time the schools were closed, most parents had not paid fees, and the situation will remain so until the contagion is controlled. Kiragu said with the concessionary loans, the institutions will now be able to sustain their operations which had ground to a halt and thus be able to resume learning in January alongside public institutions. The educationist said the initiative will also be beneficial to the government as some of the cash will directly return to it in the form of taxes. He argued that with the return of the more than 150,000 staff who had lostÂ  their jobs and bank transactions, the socioeconomic benefit will be big. Kiragu said they are aware of the financial constraints the government is facing and thus appreciate why it will bail them out through loans, promising that they will use tthe amount properly and repay so the government can come to their rescue in future.
