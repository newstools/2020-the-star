Have you lost money through advertisements appearing on sections of the media? Well, DCI is looking for Kenyans who have become victims of fraudsters. The fraudsters woo unsuspecting Kenyans to purchase furnished containers for occupation or business among others. The fraudsters use different online platforms such as Jiji Pay, WhatsApp & emails to appeal to would be buyers. "...but ends up defrauding them once they have been paid," DCI director George Kinoti said on Saturday. Kinoti noted that as a result of a sting operation carried out on Saturday, they were able to arrest one fraudster. James Chege Kinuthia was arrested in Mihang’o, Utawala. "We are appealing to any person/s who may have fallen prey to his machinations to come forward and report to the Serious Crimes Investigations Unit at DCI HQs for further investigations," Kinoti added. Last week, DCI arrested the man behind a con syndicate who has been defrauding unsuspecting Kenyans. This was after an alert for John Ng'ethe Mwaura  was released to the public. Kinoti said Kenyans had lost thousands of shillings at the hands of fraudsters led by Mwaura.
