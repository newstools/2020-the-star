Former Likoni MP Masoud Mwahima is dead. The former MP and also a one time mayor of Mombasa has been battling health complications. He passed away early on Tuesday morning aged 78 years. The family says he died of asthma complications but had other ailments. Mwahima lost his seat during the 2017 elections to the incumbent, ODM's Mishi Mboko after a disputed poll. In March 2018, the High Court in Mombasa upheld the election Mboko. Mwahima had filed a petition challenging her win arguing that the election was not free and credible. Judge Erick Ogola validated the election, saying Mwahima failed to prove Mboko won because of irregularities. Mwahima's death comes days after the demise of yet another senior Coast politician Ramadhan Kajembe.
