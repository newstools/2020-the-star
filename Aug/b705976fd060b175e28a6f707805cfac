Upcoming Afro-pop singer Zeshari Jean has released 'Hewa', an encouragement song for musicians during the corona pandemic. She asks artistes to take the opportunity of having minimal performances to write more music. "Quarantine is a golden chance to write new material. Test your limits, even change a few things here and there if you need to," she said. She adds the song is a reminder for all of us to just take a minute, step back and breathe. "It's crazy how many times we take it for granted in the hustles and bustles of our day to day life," Zeshari said. She draws her inspiration from artistes such as Muthoni Drummer Queen, Valerie Kimani and Sauti Sol.
