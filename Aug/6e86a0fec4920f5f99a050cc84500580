A Mombasa lobby group has asked the county government to allocate funds for sanitary towels for vulnerable women and support them in getting reproductive services. Betty Sharon,  executive director for Collaboration of Women in Development said the issue has always been raised with the county officials during the validation of budget but no action has been taken. “We are among the people who always get the opportunity to validate the county budget. We have been submitting our views on this issue but nothing has ever been done,” she said. County director of Youth, Gender and Sport Esther Ingolo said the county government does not have any project for sanitary towels to vulnerable families. “The only programme for sanitary distribution that we have and was allocated some money is for schoolgirls and not the street families,” she said. Health committee chairperson Swaleh Kibwana said it was a big concern which needed to be addressed but so far nothing had been done by the county government. “Nominated MCA Milka Moraa took the motion to the assembly but it has not been discussed.  In our budget, the allocation for the commodities was for schools," Kibwana said. Moraa said when the government took up the sanitary towels project, the county did not have much to do and that is why vulnerable women were left out. She said she has been approaching different organisations to get support but street families have not been among the beneficiaries. “Distribution of sanitary towels is a big concern. So far, 400 girls from Kiembeni have benefited from my initiatives,” Moraa said. Moraa said with Covid-19, the situation has worsened for streets families. “Personally, I am so passionate in dealing with matters that concern girls and women. I raised the issue and I will keep on fighting to ensure that money is allocated to this forgotten group of people when we resume,"she said. Edited by Henry Makori
