AU special envoy Raila Odinga hosted the Kabaka of the Buganda Kingdom, Ronald Muwenda Mutebi II, at his Capitol Hill office on Saturday. Raila said the two exchanged views on historical, cultural, educational and trade ties that bind East Africans. "We also discussed the need for faster regional integration," he said on Twitter. Mutebi met President Uhuru Kenyatta on Friday at State House. "The Head of State and the visiting cultural leader discussed subjects of mutual interest among them the central role of culture in regional integration and peaceful communal co-existence," State House said. Kabaka is the title of the king of the Kingdom of Buganda. According to the traditions of the Baganda, they are ruled by two kings, one spiritual and the other secular. The spiritual, or supernatural, king is represented by the Royal Drums, regalia called Mujaguzo and, as they always exist, the Buganda at any time will always have a king, according to Wikipedia. Mujaguzo, like any other king, has his own palace, officials, servants and palace guards.
