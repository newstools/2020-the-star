The government's plan to engage public school teachers to offer communal classes in their localities during the Covid-19 pandemic has received the support of an education investor. Kithinji Kiragu who runs a private primary school, a secondary school and a college in Nairobi and Embu said the need to offer such classes is long overdue as there is no end in sight for the coronavirus pandemic. Kiragu hailed the government's decision to keep schools closed until the pandemic is fully dealt with. He said the community-based model of learning which the government has scheduled to begin next month is better than home-based learning through radio, TV, phone and online, which thousands of children in rural villages and urban slums cannot access. He called on people who are able to support the government by buying laptops for teachers in their localities and other items to enable them offer communal lessons. The educator asked the government to hasten the programme to prevent learners from idling and engaging in harmful activities. Kiragu, a public sector management and governance consultant, warned that if schools are opened before the pandemic is stemmedÂ  there could be a catastrophe of mass infections and deaths. Although private schools have greatly been hit by the pandemic containment measures, the government is right in deferring reopening as the lives of learners are more important than education, he said. Kiragu was reacting to media reports that Education Cabinet Secretary George Magoha said on July 30 the government will roll out community-based learning next month.  Edited by Henry Makori
