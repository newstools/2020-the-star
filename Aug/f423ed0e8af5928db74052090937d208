Slain businessman Kelvin Omwenga was laid to rest on Saturday in Soko village, Kisii county. Kevin, 28, was shot dead a week ago in his house in Kilimani, Nairobi. The businessman is said to have been shot over a business deal gone sour. Wycliffe Omwenga, Kevin's brother, said they want to know why he was killed. “Let justice be done for my brother. I raised Kevin after the death of our parents,” Wycliffe said.   Flamboyant politicians and businessmen Steve Mbogo, Zaheer Jhanda and Don Bosco also attended the burial. They eulogised Kevin as hardworking and urged the police to expedite investigations so that the family can get justice. "He died a cruel death. The family has the right to know who killed their son," MCA Charles Nyagoto said. Detectives have arrested two suspects in connection with the murder. The two - Robert Bodo Ouko and Chris Obure - appeared in a Kibera court. They were detained for 14 days to allow conclusion of the probe.
