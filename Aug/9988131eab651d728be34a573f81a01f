The national government is assessing the fish stocks within Kenya’s 200 nautical miles of the Exclusive Economic Zone in the Indian Ocean, Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Peter Munya said Tuesday. Munya said the Indian Ocean has not been fully exploited. He spoke when he toured construction works at the Shimoni Fishing Port and Kenya Marine and Fisheries Research Institute Shimoni laboratories. He said the country has embarked on fish stock assessment and resource surveys to establish the marine species within Kenya's territorial waters. “The ongoing assessment will help us know the hidden treasures of the marine and eco-systems; therefore, we would be able to boost our economic prospects,” he said. Munya said the Ministry of Agriculture is working with other stakeholders in the blue economy to ensure marine species are protected. He said the government is committed to the sustainable use of marine resources for poverty alleviation and economic growth. At the same time, the CS engaged beach management units (BMUs) and seaweed farmers at the fishing villages of Shimoni, Gazi and Kibuyuni in Kwale county. Munya told the BMUs and the seaweed farmers the government is dedicated to strengthening the maritime sector, which has the potential to make the country self-sufficient and an exporter of seafood. Munya stressed the need to strike a balance on conservation efforts and exploitation of marine resources, especially at a time the government is turning its focus on fisheries development “The Agriculture ministry will help in capacity building of the BMUs to enhance resource management in the fisheries sector,” he said. He added that his ministry is in the process of recovering and developing all grabbed public fish landing sites and other maritime assets.
