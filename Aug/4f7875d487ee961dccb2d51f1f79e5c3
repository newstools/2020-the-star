Cabinet Secretaries do not enjoy 'leave' in the traditional sense, Head of Public Service Joseph Kinyua has said. This was after media reports that the CS's were given a 14 day leave . In a statement on Sunday, Kinyua said during the 10-day working recess, the members will not have scheduled engagements. "Unless otherwise directed by the president for urgent business, cases of national emergency, or any other exceptional circumstances," he said. "President Uhuru Kenyatta is convinced that short Cabinet Working Recesses will enable Cabinet to deliver on its mandate with renewed energy." Kinyua said they will be accorded an opportunity to connect with their families and Kenya's shared heritage. "During the recess, the delivery of government services will continue uninterrupted," Kinyua said. The inaugural Cabinet Working Recess, will commence on August, 17,2020 and end on August, 28, 2020. Kinyua said the recess will also give them time to conduct working tours, site visits and field engagements with members of the public regarding ongoing State Programmes and Projects. However, the directive has triggered some anxiety in the government of a looming Cabinet reshuffle. There has been speculation of impending Cabinet changes with some allies of ODM leader Raila Odinga quietly questioning what they have benefitted from the handshake. "There is a looming Cabinet reshuffle that might come as soon as next week,‚Äù a source said. In 2018, Uhuru in a similar move allowed all the CSs, Attorney General and Principal Secretaries to proceed on a Christmas leave. At the time, Head of Public Service Joseph Kinyua said the break would allow them time to celebrate Christmas and New Year with their families and friends. In their absence, Kinyua asked the top officials to designate an officer on duty to be in the office throughout the period.
