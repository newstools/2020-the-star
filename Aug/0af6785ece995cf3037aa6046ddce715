Athletics Kenya youth development chairman, Barnaba Korir has clarified that both junior and seniors athletes had benefited from the Covid-19 cushioning programme. He said while their initial plan was to cushion the under-20 athletes, they ended up covering even their senior counterparts. Korir said they have cushioned over 1500 athletes, both juniors and seniors since they started their programme. He said in their initial plan, they had budgeted to feed 1,400 athletes who were in camp for the World Under 20 Championships. “Every time we went to a camp, we were forced to cushion senior athletes who heavily depended on road races across the world and have had no any other income since the advent of Covid-19,” said Korir. He cited Kapcherop in Elgeyo Marakwet as one of the camp where they had the highest number of 36 senior athletes benefitting from the juniors’ kitty. “We could not deny them food. The little we had, they had to share which was humane enough and a show of solidarity,” he said. He admitted that majority of some senior runners are living deplorable lives with no jobs. “They have been good athletes but right now, they have nothing to show,” said Korir. Korir was responding to concerns from retired runner Abraham Chelang’a on why senior athletes had been left out of the food programme. “There are many senior athletes suffering in silence but no one is looking at them. This pandemic has hit us all,”  said Chelang’a.
