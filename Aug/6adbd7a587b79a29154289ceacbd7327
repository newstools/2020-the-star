Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe has asked counties to ensure prudent use of Covid-19 funds. Speaking in Kisii on Friday, Kagwe said his Ministry has received reports that some individuals have been misusing money allocated to help in the war against Covid-19. “I am urging all county governments to ensure that money set aside for Covid-19 is used in the purpose it is intended,” Kagwe said during his tour. However, even as Kagwe warns counties, the Ministry of Health is facing criticism on its use of Covid-19 funds in procurement. He praised Governor James Ongwae for the measures his administration has taken, including setting aside 300 isolation beds as directed by President Uhuru Kenyatta. He said county governments should take charge in combating the disease, noting that with increasing cases, the national government has no capacity to receive transferred cases. Those present were Interior CS Fred Matiang’i, Ongwae, Council of Governors chairman and kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya, Senator Sam Ongeri, MPs Jimmy Angweyi (Kitutu  Chache North),  Richard Onyonka (Kitutu Chache South) Richard Tong’i (Nyaribariu Chache), Raphael Wanjala (Budalang'i) and Woman reps  Janet Ong’era (Kisii)  and Florence Mutua  (Busia). He announced 727 new positive Covid-19 cases out of 6, 814 cases tested. Nairobi had the highest cases at 393, while 674 recoveries were recorded, out which 125 were from home-based care. Unfortunately, 14 patients have succumbed to the disease. The CS noted that men continue to lead in the cases. “There is need for men to ask themselves what is going on. Their behaviours might be contributing to the numbers. Women are more careful that is why their cases are few,” the CS said. Matiang’i warned bar owners that their businesses will total be closed if found operating against the directive by the Ministry of Health. He urged church leaders to following Covid-19 directives and told the police to stop harassing them and the faithful. Edited by EKibii
