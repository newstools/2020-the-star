Ministry of Health officials should visit churches in remote areas to ensure they comply with Covid-19 regulations, Bishop Charles Sande of Upendo Pentecostal Fellowship Church has said. Sande said the ministry should provide face masks and water cans to remote churches and guide them on Covid-19 prevention. “Those churches and mosques with large congregations that have been allowed to conduct services must comply with state directives,” clergyman told the Star on Tuesday. On development in Vihiga county, the bishop said Governor Wilber Ottichillo's advisors should be blamed for the dismal development that has been witnessed in the county during his tenure. The clergyman said Ottichillo excelled as an MP and that was why he was elected governor to develop Vihiga. "Ottichillo was MP number one countrywide. He was the best in implementing projects at the constituency level," Sande said. He said the poor development record of the county raises questions about his team of advisers. He proposed that new governors should be given time to select their technical staff rather than inherit their predecessor’s team.  Edited by Henry Makori
