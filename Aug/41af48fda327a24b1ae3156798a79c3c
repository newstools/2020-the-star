The Kazi Mtaani initiative — which is engaging 3,600 youths from informal settlements in Naivasha — has been praised for an 80 per cent decline in crime in the town. The programme employs the youth to clear clogged drains, slash bushes, sweep streets and public places and rehabilitate infrastructure. Naivasha subcounty commissioner Mathioya Mbogo said the region was among the towns hardest hit by Covid-19. Hundreds of workers in flower farms, hotels and tourism sector lost their jobs leading to a rise in crime in the informal settlements. Mbogo said the first phase of the programme targeted more than 1,600 youths on Kihoto, Karagita, KCC and Kamere estates. “We are now reaping the benefits of this programme as cases of petty crime have dropped by over 80 per cent in the last two months,” he said. Mbogo said in his office on Wednesday that an extra 2,000 youths enrolled in the second phase of the programme. “There is a major change in our drainage systems, bushes on estates have been cleared and many families are no longer sleeping hungry,” he said. The administrator said the government had embarked on assisting families affected by HIV. “In the first phase we had forgotten those persons living with HIV and we have already identified 320 families that will receive support from the national government,” he said. Jubilee Party chairman in Naivasha James Karimi praised the Kazi Mtaani initiative, terming its implementation timely. “Many of these youths were engaged in petty crime as they sought a daily meal but with the government programme we have seen a change in their behaviour,” he said. Karimi, however, expressed his concern over rising cases of teenage pregnancies, mainly in rural areas. “As we address the challenges facing youths in urban centres, we should not forget those in rural areas as they are also undergoing various challenges,” he said.
