Former KPA MD Daniel Manduku has been released on a Sh12 million cash bail. Manduku had earlier on Friday been charged alongside Juma Fadhili a works officer before Chief Magistrate Lawrence Mugambi. It is alleged that Manduku made an over payment of Sh244,837,908 to contractors for works that were never completed. Manduku and Fadhili were each been charged with one count of abuse of office and jointly charged with one count of conspiracy to commit an offence of corruption. Mugambi ordered them not to contact any witnesses in the case and also deposit their passports in court. The prosecution had not opposed to their release on bail but has asked the court to grant them bail that is commensurate with the money that was lost. They also asked the court to order them not to contact any witnesses and also deposit their passports in court. Lawyer Nelson Havi representing Manduku told the court that the former MD is not a flight risk and he should be admitted to reasonable bail terms. Havi says the Manduku is no longer in employment and he will not be able to raise a high bail term adding that he can only raise Sh500,000 that the high court had ordered him to pay. Manduku says he has other obligations to his family and even now everyoneâ€™s cash flow has been affected by the pandemic because there no avenues of generating income. It is alleged that between March 29 and August 22, 2019 being persons employed at KPA as MD and Works Officer they conspired to approve procurement of concrete barriers with a concrete sum of Sh1.4 billion for works that did not have an approved budget. On abuse of office police the state claims that Manduku occasioned a misappropriation of Sh678 million on the KPA annual budget for 2018-2019 financial year while Fadhili made an over payment of Sh244 million.
