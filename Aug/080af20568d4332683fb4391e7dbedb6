CAS Mercy Mwangangi has urged Kenyans to take their children for immunisation. "Ensure that your children go for the schedule by ensuring that they receive two doses of the measles vaccine," she said. Mwangangi said the number of children who visit clinics for immunisation has decreased. She said the number decreased from 640,000 in August last year to 600,025 in August this year. “We continue to remind and inform all Kenyans that immunization services are ongoing and are available across all our healthcare facilities,” she said. Mwangangi said Kenya has recorded 426 people from samples tested in the last 24 hours. This brings to cumulative cases to 31, 441. More to follow
