Hart The Band are among the stars set to perform at Kenyan Ni Yetu Live, a virtual concert to celebrate the spirit of Kenya on August 29 sponsored by Stanbic Bank. Band member Wachira Gatama said he the opportunity is "challenging but beautiful". "The beauty about live music is that it can live for long. It is alive. There is a lot that goes into it before people see the live music," he told Word Is. "There is always that readiness to be your best self because people will always notice any mistakes." H_art The Band will share the stage with Samidoh, Suzanna Owiyo, Sauti Sol and Eric Wainaina. "The experience was good, working with different artistes to make one product is always very interesting. You get to know how different people work," he said. The concert will be on all TV and radio stations, including Kiss TV and Citizen TV, as well as on yetulive.com.
