Tanzania’s opposition Chadema party's office in the north-eastern town of Arusha has been “firebombed”, according to its leader Tundu Lissu. In a Twitter post on Friday, Tundu said the offices were destroyed on the eve of his arrival in Arusha. "Our Northern Zone party HQ in Arusha has been firebombed and destroyed on the eve of my arrival in Arusha. Today's timetable remains unchanged. No amount of terror and intimidation will stop this Tsunami for change in Tanzania. Arusha here we come," he said. This comes barely two weeks after the prominent politician returned to the country after surviving an attempt on his life. Tundu Lissu had been living in Belgium since he was shot three years ago and has undergone more than 20 medical operations. Nobody was convicted for the attempt on his life. While out of the country, Mr Lissu was stripped of his parliamentary seat. He was met by hundreds of cheering supporters as he left the international airport in the country's main city, Dar es Salaam.     Tundu announced the party's  scheduled meeting will still be held at the Chadema offices which have been burnt down.
