Senators on Tuesday voted 25-20 to adoptÂ Meru Senator Mithika Linturi's amendment to the revenue sharing formula. The senators are now expected to proceed to vote on the motion. In the amendments to Nairobi's Johnson Sakaja's proposal, Linturi proposed a reduction to the baseline (equal share) from Sh316.5 billion as proposed by Sakaja to Sh270 billion. Linturi suggests that other parameters of sharing revenue should apply to the difference of Sh46.5 billion. Sakaja had suggested that the entire Sh316.5 billion allocated to the 47 counties in the current financial year be shared equally. In the Linturi proposal, 19 counties will lose Sh1.8 billion down from Sh17 billion contained in the disputed formula proposed by the House Finance committee. Losers in the Linturi proposal are Mandera (Sh245.2 million), Kwale (177.9 million), Wajir (Sh175.6 million), Marsabit (Sh156.9 million), Kilifi (Sh153.4) and Mombasa (Sh135.1million). Some of the top gainers are Kiambu (Sh160.2 million), Nandi (Sh149.2 million), Nakuru (Sh149.0 million), Uasin Gishu (Sh142.5 million) and Nairobi (Sh120.5 million). More to follow...
