Doctors in Nyamira will on Monday start their strike over delayed promotions and salaries. Nyanza Kenya Medical Pharmacists and Dentists Union officials told journalists in Kisii that no doctor has been promoted since 2017. "I think we have given Governor John Nyagarama ample time to put his house in order in regard to the affairs of medics. We have no other option but to walk out of our jobs," Nyanza KMPDU secretary Lameck Omweri. The doctors said the county government has failed to implement the 2017 collective bargaining agreement and has not responded to a letter dated July 7, 2020, asking that the promotions be effected. The union further lamented that there is a shortage of doctors in the county's health facilities. "It's one thing to talk about improved healthcare and another to say you have adequate staff," Omweri said. Nyamira has 60 doctors against the 110 the union has been rooting for. Omweri said calls for the recruitment of additional medics have always been ignored. Contacted, county secretary James Ntabo said they have received the strike notice. “We are doing everything possible to ensure services are not affected in our hospitals,” he noted.
