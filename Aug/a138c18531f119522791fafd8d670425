Three men accused of impersonating KRA officials and demanding Sh500,000 from a company have been detained for five days pending investigations. Erick Otieno, Joel Owino and John Odhiambo are said to have demanded the money from Francis Kieleko, the director of Patiala Distillers, purporting to be government tax officials. Kibera senior principal magistrate Philip Mutua on Monday allowed theirÂ  detention after a petition by detective Samuel Macharia in a sworn affidavit. Macharia told the court that the suspects were arrested on August 28 after Kieleko complained that unknown people were demanding money from him. "The said group had sent a letter to him through WhatsApp threatening to leak his business secrets and policies if he did not give Sh500,000," the officer said. The three gave him an August 29 deadline to pay, he said. Preliminary investigations showed the complainant gave the police Sh500,000 for purposes of treating and documenting the money to be used as a bribe. Macharia said he wanted more time to countercheck with KRA whether documents recovered from the suspects originated from the taxman. He said he needed to submit the phones recovered from the respondents to cybercrime offices for analysis. The trio is also yet to appear in an identification parade. The suspects will be detained at Kileleshwa police station. Edited by Henry Makori
