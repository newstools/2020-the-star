@robertomollo3 A Form 2 student on Tuesday drowned in Lake Victoria during a fishing expedition near Lwasi beach in Karachuonyo constituency. Seventeen-year-old Fredrick Ouma of St Bernard Otaro Mixed Secondary School died as he traced his bag that had dropped in the lake as he was fishing. He was in the company of another fisherman. Eyewitnesses said Ouma jumped to catch the bag which was sinking. “He jumped out of the boat and drowned as he was trying to save his bag,” one eyewitness said. Area beach management unit chairman Opiyo Otiende said the bag dropped as the fishermen cast their net. He said Ouma’s colleague tried in vain to rescue him. “His colleague’s effort to rescue him after being overpowered by water ended in futility,” Otiende said. The student’s body was later retrieved with the help of some divers and fishermen. Koredo assistant chief David Opere said they reported the matter to Kendu Bay police station before taking the body to Homa Bay County Teaching and Referral Hospital mortuary. The administrator urged beach leaders to stop teenagers from engaging in fishing activities. He said they will take action against any official whose beach will have children. “Allowing the underage to fish is endangering their lives. We want all beach officials to comply with the regulations to avoid lawsuits,” Opere said.
