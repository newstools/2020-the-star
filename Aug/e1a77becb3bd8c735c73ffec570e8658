Deputy President William Ruto has said he has no problem with President Uhuru Kenyatta's decision to build new alliances which have seen him take a 'back seat'. "In the second term, the President decided to do things in a different way, which I respect.. which you see, I take a slight back seat because we want to build the legacy of President Uhuru because for a long time we had UhuRuto.. and some people got concerned and said maybe it should be Uhuru because he is the President," he said. "So for Uhuru to stand out, maybe we should scale down the UhuRuto so that Ruto can take a back seat, do less, so that we can project President Uhuru as the leader of government which is the case... I am the deputy president and I know my place." The DP spoke during an interview with Citizen TV aired on Thursday night. Ruto said he was willing to take a 'backseat' for the sake of Uhuru's legacy. On whether he was confident about Uhuru's legacy, Ruto hesitated, saying what was built during his first term was solid in the area of infrastructure and other areas which could have been built on during the second term. He however said the Handshake brought in different dynamics. Ruto said Jubilee party is not functioning well because of 'busy bodies' who have no idea about the party's philosophy. "The party has been hijacked by busy bodies and con men and brokers like Murathe and company," he said.
