Former Machakos Senator Johnston Muthama has disagreed with friend turned foe and Wiper party leader Kalonzo Musyoka on the revenue sharing formula. While Kalonzo has said the third basis formula, which is largely based on population, should be adopted, whereas Muthama said it poses a threat to the country's unity. Muthama exited Wiper last month. The former senator has said the casual manner in which the government is handling the important national issue will either make or break Kenya. Speaking at his Gigiri office on Monday, the former lawmaker appealed to President Uhuru Kenyatta to intervene and unlock the stalemate and save the country from breaking apart. He accused senators of failing the country at a time of need by not agreeing on how the 47 counties should share revenue. Muthama, however, cautioned against any attempt to reduce money meant for marginalised regions and giving the same to already developed counties in the name of rewarding population. “I appeal to the President of the republic of Kenya not to touch the normal allocations meant for marginalised counties. Since Independence, it is now that some counties are seeing tarmac road for the first time and such counties are going to lose Sh1.9 billion in the proposed formula,” Muthama said. “For the sake of a united country where each and every citizen feels part of the country, the sharing of funds should be that which was being given to those counties is not touched.” Muthama termed such a move provocative and may lead to affected counties being further marginalised. “They should forget taking that direction because the country will be divided if the government tries to take away money from the marginalised,” he said. “The Senate seems unable to unlock the stalemate. Kenyans are just watching name calling while others are being branded as Kieleweke and Tangatanga. The name calling will not solve Kenya’s problems. ”
