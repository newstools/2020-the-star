Rafiki. If a fair lady turns up at any health facility casualty section with a coarse unlubricated football inside her vagina or a sea urchin, I will heap all the blame on you for the misadventure. Ok? Kuria.  https://www.the-star.co.ke/opinion/columnists/2020-07-09-leave-me-and-my-vagina-alone/  Hello Kuria, Thank you for writing to me. I really hope your email is an attempt at a joke. Sadly, you are not the only one who thinks this way. There are even some women who believe that ‘given’ the right to their own vaginas, things would not be so good, that they would probably misuse it. Words fail me really. I do not know what to tell you and those who think like you. I will try though. I would like to know though, the only thing that could come out from leaving women to do what they want with their vaginas is that they would stick strange objects up there? So you want to tell me men have been stopping us from doing this all along? Nani, please get serious. You do understand that we are adults yes? You do not have to ‘women proof’ the world like you would baby-proof a house when you have a baby. Just imagine that! It is very ungodly the way some men behave when it comes to issues surrounding a vagina. We want power over our own bodies, many men say we will become promiscuous because I am sure they think we can do that all by ourselves. We say stop raping women and girls, they say women should close their legs (Funga miguu). I think only God and the ancestors can deal with some of you really. We need men to look at women as human beings. We have brains as you do. Let us reason on a higher level, please.
