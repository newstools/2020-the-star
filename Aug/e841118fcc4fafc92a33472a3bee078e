Parliamentary independence is under a bigger threat than it was initially. When the independence of Parliament – National Assembly and Senate – is threatened, then the very critical roles of this arm of government are also compromised. We are talking about legislation, representation and oversight. This means the House has been scoffed at and parliamentarians reduced to mere voting machines at the behest of the Executive. This means that political parties and their leadership, especially the majority party, have a sway in the august House and the occupants fail to live up to the people's expectations. Additionally, it also demonstrates that the Executive is a bull in a China shop. If parliamentary discretion is stepped on by way of intimidation, pressing false charges and use of state machinery, it means that those who are not targets at the moment could suffer the same consequences if they do not live up to the interests of the Executive in future. This is a sublime message to members who are not the current targets. When we look at it through this prism, it means that certain elements within the Executive are not in favour of checks and balances since they are trying to puncture the boldness, the assertiveness of MPs and Parliament itself as a critical arm of government. Note that I am not castigating government because Parliament is part of government; the Judiciary too. When an arm of government is ostracised, in this case Parliament, when there is intimidation – covert and overt – and we don’t hear the voices of civil society and independent commissions, then we have a Constitution that is not worth the paper it is printed on. If the Constitution is a document that just serves the interests of the Executive, then we see the people pushing the BBI for what they really are—a monster in the house. People who want to create or amend the law to serve their own purpose. The governance expert spoke to the Star
