Coronavirus is spreading fast and if not checked, many more people will be infected this August. Recently, one of the local television stations showed one of the streets in Nairobi county where some young women were "inviting" men into a certain building in broad daylight. This business is the oldest profession in the world, and it is going on, despite the pandemic. Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe has repeatedly said that people should stay at home, wear masks and sanitise. But the women in the video had no masks and were contravening the health guidelines on Covid-19 by pulling and inviting men inside this building. All those contravening the health directives should be rounded up and tested to find out if they have been spreading the virus. These women could be responsible for the rising number of men contracting the virus. Better be safe than sorry. Those doing targeted mass testing should take samples of these prostitutes to curb the spread of the virus. To the rest, let us follow the laid down rules set by the government so that the disease does not spread quickly and further. Veronica Onjoro is from Mombasa
