Outgoing Aberdare's branch secretary, James Kamau, has questioned the sincerity of some Football Kenya Federation (FKF) presidential contenders over their protest about the Electoral Code in the fourth-coming national elections. “On the surface, some of the protests by certain candidates look justified. However, looked at deeply, it smacks of mischief and a certain fear of the polls,” he said. “Among the most contentious requirements is that candidates who want to contest must have served in any capacity for two of the last five years. Surprisingly, those who have raised protests about the requirement qualify —raising questions over their motive,” Kamau quipped. “Do they really want elections in the first place or are they scared of losing?” he asked. Kamau name-checked most of the aspirants who have shown interest in replacing incumbent Nick Mwendwa. He cited Herbert Mwachiro, a former FKF deputy secretary general and one of the presidential contenders in this year’s elections. “Surprisingly, Mwachiro has dismissed the requirement even though he is not barred considering that it is less than three years since he left FKF and therefore qualifies to contest.” He said former FKF chairman Sam Nyamweya has been in the fore-front in dismissing the newly released Electoral Code even though the last elections which he presided over had the same requirements.
