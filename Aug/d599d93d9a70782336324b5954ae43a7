Two people are feared dead after a boat capsized in Lake Naivasha on Monday evening. Twelve others were rescued after they clung onto the vessel for over an hour. A search for the two has been launched. Water hyacinth and strong winds have slowed the exercise. The group was being ferried to Karagita landing beach from Ngorongo area when their boat capsized. Naivasha subcounty fisheries officer Nicholas Kagundu said strong winds coupled with high tides could have led to the accident. He said the fisheries department has mobilised four patrol boats to assist in the search. Lake Naivasha Boat Operators representative David Kilo attributed the incident to overloading and lack of safety gear. He said many boats involved in illegal fishing do not have safety gear. “We have joined the youth in the search mission but the water hyacinth and strong winds are affecting this exercise,” Kilo said. Naivasha subcounty commissioner Mathioya Mbogo said illegal fishing is one of the problems in the area. He said a special security team comprising officers from the Kenya Wildlife Service, fisheries, county government and police has been formed to patrol the lake.
