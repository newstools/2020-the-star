Two bodies have been retrieved from the Namechula River in Tulwet area of Kiminini constituency. Divers were retrieving the body of Edward Wekesa, 26, who drowned on Saturday when they came across a woman's corpse. The woman had yet to be identified. The two bodies were transported to Kitale hospital mortuary awaiting a postmortem. Local politician Peter Kusimba blamed the lack of a bridge on the section of the river for the deaths. A contractor brought down a bridge at the section eight months ago to put up a new one. Kusimba blamed the government for the delayed reconstruction of the bridge, saying the Tulwet area is now 'landlocked'. "The bridge is very important as it serves the bypass road between Kiungani on Kitale Webuye road and Maili Saba on Kitale-Eldoret Highway," Kusimba said. He wondered why the Kenya Rural Roads Authority has failed to award the tender to a different contractor if the current one can't complete the job. Kusimba said the delays in construction of the bridge is causing loss of lives and suffering among the residents of Tulwet. The residents use an alternative footbridge which is a threat to their lives. Businesses have also suffered as most farmers want to transport their produce to the market while motorists are also unable to conduct their daily activities, he said.
