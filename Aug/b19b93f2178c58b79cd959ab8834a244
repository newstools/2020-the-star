England women’s soccer coach Phil Neville is on Football Federation Australia’s (FFA) three-person shortlist for the vacant ‘Matildas’ job, Britain’s Daily Mail has reported. Neville, who guided England to the Women’s World Cup semi-finals in France last year, is set to leave his role with the team at the end of his contract in July 2021. The FFA have been on the lookout for a new coach for the women’s national side after Ante Milicic stepped down last month. Jill Ellis, who coached the United States to back-to-back World Cup triumphs in 2015 and 2019, was also on the FFA’s shortlist alongside Arsenal women’s manager Joe Montemurro, the report said. The FFA did not immediately respond to a request for confirmation of the report.
