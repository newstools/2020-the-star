The government should regulate soft loan apps they are derailing youths on Kazi Mtaani and crippling them economically, Vihiga Deputy Governor Patrick Saisi has said. He said nobody wants to be broke, hence why youths are struggling to put something in their pockets through the Kazi Mtaani initiative. "The project was initiated by the state to put some cash in the pockets of the youths after the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic that left majority jobless," Saisi said. Saisi was speaking in Hamisi subcounty of Muhudu ward where he joined Governor Wilbur Ottichillo who was inspecting the water project funded by Belgian government. Saisi urged the state should come up with another mode of payment so that youths can get access to their cash it is slashed off by soft loan ups. Saisi said Kazi Mtaani was a good idea to help youths generate income. Kazi mtaani has created job opportunities to about 5,000 youths across the county. Edited by R.Wamochie
