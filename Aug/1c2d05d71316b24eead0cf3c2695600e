Transport CS James Macharia has said the government of Kenya has not banned flights from any county from landing at its ground. Speaking on Saturday at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport after the county opened its airspace for international flights, the CS said that Tanzanian's flights have not been banned. "We have not banned any country from coming into Kenya. We have not closed the airspace, what we have done is have quarantine measures imposed on some countries based on assessment risk," Macharia said. Macharia said that he communicated with his Tanzanian counterpart regarding the relationship between the two countries. The CS said that there is no misunderstandings between the two countries and that "Kenya has never banned any flights from Tanzania. Kenya has never banned travelers from Tanzania. What we have done is to indicate certain health protocols of people arriving from various countries," Macharia said. Macharia added that KQ's flights will be allowed into Tanzanian airspace following the agreement with Tanzania. Tanzania had issued a notice disallowing Kenyan flights from using its airspace. Tanzania was not among the initial list of 11 countries that Kenyan government had allowed to fly into Kenya. China,  South Korea, Japan, Canada, Uganda, France, Namibia,  Zimbabwe, Ethiopia, Rwanda, Switzerland  and  Morocco are the countries that are allowed  in the country following low transmission in their countries. The CS said the list will be reviewed on a regular basis depending on the circumstances on the ground and after a comprehensive global mapping of the intensity of the disease.
