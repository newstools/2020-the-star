Busia Deputy Governor Moses Mulomi has asked residents to change their attitudes towards production to fully exploit available resources. Mulomi on Thursday said poverty in Busia can only be alleviated if residents adopt farming and entrepreneurship instead of waiting to land white-collar jobs. While addressing youth leaders and ward and subcounty administrators in Busia town, the deputy governor said only a change in people's attitude will change their fortunes for the better. He was speaking during the closure of a three-day workshop for administrators at Farmview Hotel. "Busia leads most counties in factors of production including land, labour, capital and entrepreneurship, but lack of initiatives to exploit available resources has been the county's undoing. Some people benefit from little resources, but with abundant resources that abound in the county, little efforts are made to tap them, thus resulting in prevailing notions that Busia is poor, a total irony considering the county's great potential," Mulomi said. Public administration chief officer Ezekiel Okwach thanked Siasa Place for funding the training saying it will help in empowering the administrators and youth to improve their services. Okwach said people should use social media more because it was the best way to reach out to the youth.  Edited by P.O
