The Supreme Court will on Friday be closed for a second round of fumigation after a case of Covid-19 was reported. Deputy Chief Registrar of the Judiciary Paul Maina said in an internal memo dated August 4 to all court staff said  that an ICT officer had tested positive for coronavirus. "This is therefore to inform you that Supreme Court Building will remain closed on Friday August 7 for the exercise to be carried out smoothly," he said. He urged all registrars, and heads of departments to ensure all offices, chambers and common areas are left open to allow the activity to proceed effectively. This comes two weeks after the first fumigation was carried out at the premises. Maina said the exercise is mandatory as frequent fumigation has become a must due to the growing numbers of coronavirus cases in the country. As of Wednesday, the country's total confirmed cases stood at 23,873 with 391 reported fatalities. Meanwhile, Milimani law courts remain closed for 14 days from July 30, after an officer tested positive for coronavirus. In a statement, Chief Justice David Maraga said that during this period,  urgent matters shall be dealt with on the online platforms. "Respective Heads of Divisions and Courts will issue directions on the handling of matters that will be affected by the closure," Maraga said.
