Kakamega Senator Cleophas Malala’s lawyer John Khaminwa has faulted the police for taking the senator to Kakamega without legal redress. Khaminwa on Monday said that by Malala being taken to where he was born, yet he was arrested in Nairobi, reminds him of the era of Sabasaba. “This reminds me of Sabasaba when people would be arrested and be taken back to where they were born” he said. Khaminwa said he received a phone call from senator Malala around lunch hour about his arrest. “Immediately I received a call from the senator, I rushed to Nairobi Area where I have been for a while, only to be told that he is being taken to Kakamega,” he told the Star on the phone. "The senator has been denied the opportunity to seek legal assistance in Nairobi and I have just learnt that he is being taken to Kakamega." "If he is suspected of any crime, he is supposed to be given time to be represented by his lawyers and charges should be pressed against him in Nairobi." The lawyer said he was cut off on the line when he tried to call the senator. Malala is among three senators arrested on Monday. The others are Steve Lelegwe (Samburu) and Christopher Langat (Bomet). Makueni Senator Mutula Kilonzo Jnr claimed police told him the reason for arrest was distribution of government sanitisers.
