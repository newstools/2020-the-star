The plight of a family in Migori county whose 48 members have contracted Covid-19 has brought the harsh reality of the virus in communities. Even though some clans and households do not think the coronavirus exists, it has already been felt hard in some villages. A Nakuru-based advocate Gordon Ogola has narrated of how the virus found its way into their family and clan in Godngoche, Migori County. "The last one or so week has been harrowing to the Ogola family and clan. In a span of seven days we have 48 infections in the family including my 80 year old mum," he said. Ogola said the mother has been struggling in the Intensive Care Unit for the last five days. "My 61 year old brother Moses Osoro Ogola succumbed within 24 hrs of admission," he said. He noted that every one who surrounded her mother including his step mother, her son's daughter in laws, grandchildren, cousins and workers have all tested positive. "As Kagwe repeatedly says lets not treat this thing normally because it will treat us abnormally....My worry now is... Is the whole family and village being wiped out?" he said. "Put us in your prayers. I want to plead with all of us to spread the gospel of the reality of this pandemic." Health CAS Rashid Aman on Tuesday described the reckless behaviour of Kenyans to disregard the government’s containment measures as a recipe for disaster. Last month, president Uhuru Kenyatta cautioned Kenyans against adopting a careless attitude amid efforts to contain the coronavirus. "It is evident that those who have displayed such a careless attitude have suffered greatly and in this case, we are not special. Let us not follow those examples that will hurt us in the end," Uhuru said. The pandemic has claimed nearly 400 lives in the country since its outbreak on March 13, 2020.
