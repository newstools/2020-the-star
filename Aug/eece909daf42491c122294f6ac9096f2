And you can too! " he said. "Thank you for all your prayers, kind words and good wishes! Together can win this war against Covid-19 God Bless! Twende Kazi."

I’m doing Good..NO symptoms…and my Family is fine,” he tweeted, “All my close contacts have been informed. Right now I’m in self-isolation. Many thanks to Royal Media Services Management for its support. Stay safe and God Bless!” he said on July 20.

Letoo had been at the forefront in covering the Covid-19 pandemic before he contracted the virus. Letoo had said the news was devastating as he did not have any symptoms when he decided to go to Nairobi Hospital.
