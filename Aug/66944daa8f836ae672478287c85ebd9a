Plans to build a railway link from ICD Naivasha to Longonot for seamless transportation of goods from Mombasa to Kisumu are in top gear, according to Kenya Railways. The disclosure came on Tuesday from KR managing director Philip Mainga during an inspection tour of the rail corridor between ICD Naivasha and Longonot. “This is part of various engagements lined up in readiness for the construction of a new Metre Gauge Railway line that will link the Naivasha Inland Container Depot and to the existing Longonot Railway Station,” Mainga, who was accompanied by a team of engineers said in a statement. On completion, the 24.3-kilometre line will provide a seamless connection between the SGR line and MGR line to enable the efficient transportation of goods on railway line from Mombasa to Malaba and Kisumu. The project is part of the larger rehabilitation of the Longonot to Malaba line and the Nakuru-Kisumu line. People who have encroached on the railway reserves have been told to vacate. “The corporation will work closely with the regional security systems and all other service providers such as KURA, and Kenya Power to safeguard the projects during the implementation phase,” the KR statement said. Already the Kenya Railways has held stakeholder meetings in Nakuru, Kisumu and Kakamega. In June, Transport CS James Macharia said the project will be ready in 12 months.  - mwaniki fm
