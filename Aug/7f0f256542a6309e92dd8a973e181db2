Circumcision ceremonies must follow all health protocols, Health CS Mutahi Kagwe has said. During a press briefing in Kakamega on Saturday, Kagwe said Kakamega county was culturally alive with events such as 'khuminya'. "We want to ensure that no circumcision ceremonies are held without the protocols that are required to save everyone," Kagwe said. He said he enjoyed the clean air and  warmth of the people in Kakamega. "Kakamega is both literally and metaphorically the land of gold," he said. Kakamega has three ambulances for Covid-19 and has set aside Sh105 million to battle the pandemic. Kenya on Saturday recorded 699 new cases of Covid-19, raising the country's total to 25,837, Kagwe confirmed. The new cases were drawn from the 7,175 people whose samples were tested within 24 hours. This brings the country's cumulative total tests close to the 350,000 mark. From the new cases, 675 were Kenyan while 24 were foreigners. Kagwe said in terms of gender, 427 were male and 272 female. The youngest was a one-year-old child while oldest was 85 years old. Some 781 patients have recovered from the disease, bringing  the total number of recoveries in the country so far to 11,899.
