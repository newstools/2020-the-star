The construction of the Sh684 million Ol Kalou sewerage project starts next month. The project - the first such undertaking in Nyandarua county - is scheduled to be completed in October next year. On completion, Ol Kalou's daily water supply will be 3,700 cubic metres, more than double the current 1,700 cubic metres, according to Central Rift Valley Water Works Development Agency chief executive Hosea Wendot. Ten boreholes will also be drilled as per President Uhuru Kenyatta’s directive during a recent tour of the county. The boreholes will cost Sh200 million. The sewerage project is funded by the African Development Bank and the National Government. However, the boreholes drilling is an undertaking of the National Government. The two jobs are being developed by the Central Rift Valley Water Works Development Agency. The contractor is Sino Hydro Corporation Limited. “The President visited Nyandarua sometimes back and after witnessing the water challenges of the residents, he directed we  do 10 boreholes,” Wendot said on Thursday. He said Water Cabinet Secretary Sicily Kariuki and Principal Secretary Joseph Irungu have given CRVWWDA strict timelines to complete the projects. “I want to commit that as a ministry we are going to look for funding, and for the projects already funded, we shall ensure they are completed in time,” the CEO said. Nyandarua Deputy Governor Cecilia Mbuthia said the project will bring many benefits to Nyandarua. She said the devolved unit intends to build affordable houses in anticipation of many investors in the county. “There would be a problem without a well-functioning sewerage system,” Mbuthia said. She said they are in talks with the water works agency to develop similar projects in other fast-growing towns like Njabini, Engineer and Mairo-Inya.  - mwaniki fm
