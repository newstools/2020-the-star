Manchester City midfielder Kevin de Bruyne has been named the Premier League player of the season. The 29-year-old scored 13 goals as City finished second in the top flight behind champions Liverpool. De Bruyne also matched a competition record of 20 assists, equalling former Arsenal forward Thierry Henry’s record for a single season set in 2002-03. He is the third Belgian in the past nine seasons to win the award after Vincent Kompany and Eden Hazard. The winner was decided after votes from the public on the EA Sports website were combined with those of the 20 Premier League club captains and a panel of football experts. The shortlist also included Liverpool trio Trent Alexander-Arnold, Jordan Henderson and Sadio Mane, Southampton forward Danny Ings, Leicester striker Jamie Vardy and Burnley goalkeeper Nick Pope. On Saturday, Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp was named the Premier League manager of the season. Meanwhile, Manchester United's Dutch winger Tahith Chong is training with Werder Bremen before completing a 10-month loan move to the German side. The 20-year-old signed a new contract in March, running until June 2022. The Netherlands Under-21 player joined United's academy in 2016 from Feyenoord and made his senior debut in July 2018. "Although the final terms of his move are yet to be agreed, Chong has been given permission to train with the club," the Bundesliga club said. Chong has seen his first-team appearances limited at United and last played when he came off the bench in the victory over LASK in the Europa League last-16 tie in July. The Bremen squad are currently in a pre-season training for the new Bundesliga campaign, which is set to start on 18 September. Florian Kohfeldt's side finished 16th last season but avoided going down after winning the relegation play-off against Bundesliga 2 side Heidenheim on the away goals rule.
