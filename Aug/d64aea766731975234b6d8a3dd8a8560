Embu Deputy Governor David Kariuki who was interested in succeeding Governor Martin Wambora now says he will seek the Senate seat in the next election. Governor Wambora picked Kariuki from the local Teachers’ Winas Sacco, where he was the chief executive officer prior to the last general election, and made him his running mate, promising to support him to succeed him in 2022. But Kariuki has changed his mind. Kariuki said the governor contest is already crowded and has attracted intense competition, hence his decision to opt out. “There is a lot of competition for the governor’s seat and I have thus decided to seek the Senate seat," he said. Speaking in Kiriari, he said he is still young and will go for the governorship when the right time comes. He said 10 years will be enough for him to serve as senator before running for the county chief post. He, therefore, backed Manyatta MP John Muchiri for governor. He is also from the constituency. He said it will be a great achievement for Manyatta people to provide a governor and a senator. Kariuki said the Senate seat is not a personal office and anybody can seek it. It is currently held by Njeru Ndwiga.
