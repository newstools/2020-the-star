A group of innovative youths have won themselves training and mentorship for their active participation in the fight against Covid-19 in the country. The youths are winners of the Fursa versus Virus competition which aimed to empower youth to develop solutions to the coronavirus pandemic. Through a collaboration between public and private sectors, the competition enables youth to utilise the internet to submit their solutions and to receive training, mentoring, financial support and other in-kind support. The competition was divided into six categories including food security, education, business and economy, environment and energy, government support, and social welfare out of which reasonable solutions were assessed. It was initiated by the National Youth Council in partnership with Kenya Pipeline, Royal Media Services, Huawei Technologies Kenya Limited and KCB. The winning group invented a free offline interactive, smartphone app called  Plant Signal, to give farmers real time diagnosis of the pest or disease that affect their crop. Other top three solutions include Expan USSD, Ntaka Charcoal and Njiraini Food. All the top four innovators will be rewarded with a training and mentorship programme by UNFPA Kenya. Speaking at the Youth Day celebrations, President Kenyatta said the Fursa versus Virus Challenge is an initiative meant to facilitate and promote innovative responses to the Covid-19 pandemic. He said youth are critical to addressing Covid-19 and technology can play a critical role in reaching them and supporting them develop their solutions. Huawei Technologies Kenya participated in the initiative by covering internet costs for the entire challenge period as well as for providing 47 tablets and three  laptops for the winners. CEO of Huawei Kenya, Will Meng, said, “We believe these devices we are providing today will go a long way to fulfilling young people’s dreams”.
