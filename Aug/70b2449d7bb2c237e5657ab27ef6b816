Kenya has had 768 children who have tested positive for the coronavirus, CAS Rashid Aman has said. Speaking during the daily brief on Monday, Aman said the children are aged 10 years and below. "Four have succumbed due to the virus," he said, adding that emerging evidence suggests children may not be super spreaders. Aman noted that another 430 cases are children under five years. "Two have died in this category. Early reports from the experience in China, indicated that the proportion of children infected by the virus was small, and that they generally experience mild disease," he said. "We are scaling up the Kangaroo mother care in all counties. The Kangaroo mother care is so far in 31 counties." He further noted that newborn deaths account for 42 per cent of all under five deaths and 56 per cent of all infants. Main causes of neonatal mortality include intrapartum complications, birth asphyxia (31.6%), prematurity (26%), and infections which account for 15.8% of the deaths. "The Ministry is also advocating for establishment of newborn units, in all level four and level three facilities, to decongest County referral hospitals and level five facilities," he said. Kenya on Monday recorded 193 new cases of Covid-19, raising the country's total to 32,557, Aman confirmed. This was after a sample of 3,318 was tested in the last 24 hours. All the new cases were Kenyans except three out of which 137 were male while 56 were female. Aman said age wise, the youngest was a two-month-old infant while the oldest was 87 years old. Another 225 patients have recovered from the disease, bringing  the total number of recoveries in the country so far to 18,895. A total of 188 of those discharged were from the home-based programme, while 37 were discharged from various health facilities. However, six more patients succumbed to the virus, raising fatalities to 554.
