Kitui acting Environment executive Patrick Musau wants police to help enforce the four-year ban on sand harvesting in the county. Musau said illegal sand harvesting was taking place unabated in rivers across the county, threatening the residents' sources of water. The official spoke to the media on Wednesday after visiting police commander Johan Tonui whom he pleaded with to deploy officers to patrol areas that were notorious for the activities. He was accompanied by Changwithya West MCA Boniface Katumo. Musau said that in 2016, the county assembly outlawed sand harvesting which had not been reviewed. He said it was disturbing that although the ban was meant to safeguard water sources, sand harvesting had resumed with gusto. “Anyone who will be found harvesting sand either for commercial or domestic purposes without authority will be arrested and charged in court,” Musau said. He cited rivers Tiva, Mwitasyano and Mutendea in Katumo’s ward. “Those big lorries seen in those rivers carrying sand are doing it illegally." The executive said that the only area where people were allowed to harvest sand was in Kiroboko in Mwingi West. “Even then only persons who have been licensed by my office should carry out the activity." Katumo said some people have been misled that Governor Charity Ngilu had lifted the ban, worsening the situation. Edited by R.Wamochie
