Nandi County Assembly has been thrown into a state of panic after an MCA tested positive for coronavirus. Assembly Speaker Joshua Kiptoo said the county representative tested positive in routine tests and has been isolated. Consequently, the assembly has been closed as public health officers asked to fumigate the area. Also, county healthcare workers have been asked to carry out mass testing for all members of staff. “Upon the conclusion of this exercise on Tuesday 25th, that we shall decide the way forward,” the speaker in a statement said. MCA’s have been on recess and were expected to start their sittings on August 16 but was delayed following the anxiety among the members. The speaker has said that the guidelines issued by the Ministry of Health to prevent further spread of the virus will be fully adhered to once the assembly resumes. The patient is the secretary-general of the County Assemblies Forum(CAF) and had attended meetings in Nairobi before deciding to test himself for the virus. County health  CEC Ruth Koech said they had set up a 300-bed isolation facility six sub-county hospitals across the county as a preparation in case there will be an upsurge. "We already have a 10 bed ICU at the Kapsabet County Referral hospital now operational," Koech said.
