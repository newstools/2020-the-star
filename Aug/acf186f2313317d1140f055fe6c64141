Newly signed Wazito right-back Kevin Okumu said he made the right decision to join the moneybags from newly promoted Nairobi City Stars. Chums,  as he is popularly known, said: “Today,  I am certain that it was the best decision. At city, there were so many happy times, some sad and it was always very intense. I learnt a lot about myself. I developed a great deal, becoming a better player and a better person. With each training session, game and every minute spent in dressing room, I was always learning.” Okumu, who was also linked to KPL giants Gor Mahia and AFC Leopards, told City Stars’ official website that he had four wonderful years at the club. Commenting on his departure, club CEO Patrick Korir said: “He served us diligently and we at Nairobi City Stars wish him the very best in his future endeavours. Simba wa Nairobi's blessings are with him.” Okumu became a free agent in July 2020 at the expiry of his contract. Despite having an offer from the club for an extension, the on-demand Chumsy opted to scan the horizon for a fresh challenge. Wazito head coach Ambani lauded Chumsy’s arrival. “He is a young, talented and hardworking player. A very good addition to the team. In as much as we are working for immediate success, we have to build for the future and with players like him on board, we will have a good foundation,” he noted. Ambani added: “I have watched him play and I know that he will perfectly fit into our system. I am looking forward to working with him.” On his part Okumu said: “Finally I am here and I am really happy. Wazito has been my dream team for some time now and I am glad that the move has materialised. To the management and the fans, I want to tell them that I have come here to work hard and challenge for a position in the team. We have to finish in a better position than last season.”
