A man was charged on Friday with fraudulently obtaining Sh6.24 million from a woman whom he promised to provide a Canadian visa and work permit. David Lunalo Shitsimi denied the charges before Kibera senior resident magistrate Charles Mwaniki. The charge sheet said he committed the offence between January and April 30 this year at the Ekigai Building in Lavington, Nairobi, with others not before the court. It said he obtained the amount from Linnet Nyaboke Moranga by falsely pretending he could process and deliver a visa and work permit from the Canadian High Commission in Nairobi. His lawyer Jack Bigambo told the court his client was innocent until proven guilty. â€œYour Honour, we are ready to prove to this honourable court that the charges are malicious," Bigambo said, adding his client is not a flight risk. Shitsimi sought lenient bond terms, however, the magistrate ordered he be released on Sh3 millon bond with a surety of the same amount. The trial will proceed on September 3. (Edited by V. Graham)
