The strident public debate on claims of irregularities in the purchase of Covid-19 equipment by the Kenya Medical Supplies Agency is taking the wrong direction. Kemsa chief officer Jonah Manjari, Procurement director Charles Juma and Commercial director Eliud Muriithi have been suspended on the EACC's request. But even before the EACC could start its work, politicians and activists have launched a public lynching of the three and Health CS Mutahi Kagwe. A serious matter that means life and death to many is being politicised It is wrong at this point to condemn those allegedly involved. It is also premature to defend anyone or dismiss reports of impropriety. The EACC and other arms of government must be given a chance to carry out thorough investigations. This is the only way the country will get to know what exactly happened and who is culpable. The EACC, alongside the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, would then be required to expeditiously, and without favour, prosecute the prime suspects. Engaging in a public spat and mob lynching while investigations are ongoing will do more harm than good to the nation.
