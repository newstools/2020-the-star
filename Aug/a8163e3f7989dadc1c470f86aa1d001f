The One Acre Fund has started enrolling farmers for the 2021 season in Western, Nyanza, Central and Rift Valley regions. The social enterprise aims to register more than 800,000 farmers for a complete bundle of inputs and services on credit, including the delivery of hybrid seeds and fertiliser, training on how to maximise crop yields and minimise post-harvest losses. "We are excited to open enrolment. One Acre Fund is dedicated to making sure every family in Kenya is food sufficient even during difficult situations like the Covid-19 pandemic," deputy country director John Clark said during the launch. New farmers are able to sign up for a maximum of up to Sh17,000 and existing farmers up to Sh27,500. The credit bundle comes in handy as farmers grapple with the negative effects of the pandemic. The loan packages vary depending on farmers’ preferences. Farmers may enrol for a minimum of a quarter of an acre or a maximum of three acres. Alternatively, they may choose to purchase a non-agricultural product entirely. In Kenya, One Acre Fund can only provide one loan package per household. Farmers may enrol for agricultural products like seed for maize, beans, green grams, sorghum and vegetables, fertilisers, agricultural lime, harvest drying tarps, wheelbarrows, knapsack sprayers among other none agricultural products like solar lights, phones, iron sheets and more. “It has been a crazy season for us as farmers with the Covid-19 pandemic but we are happy now that we have been able to harvest well,” One Acre farmer Victorine Luchiri said. She is from Koyonzo in Busia county. “I’m happy to enrol for the next season so I can harvest enough and pay school fees for my children and achieve food security for my family,” she added.
