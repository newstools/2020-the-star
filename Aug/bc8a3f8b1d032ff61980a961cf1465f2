ODM leader Raila Odinga has termed 'unfair' criticism and claims that his party has abdicated its role as the opposition and not acting on allegations of theft at Kemsa. "Very unfair criticism... if that were true, we would not be calling for an audit... we would have dismissed it.... what we are trying to do is to depoliticise the corruption war...," he said during an interview with Citizen TV aired on Tuesday night. Raila said it was ODM which called for an audit by PwC to probe the maize scandal, which led to his decision to sack William Ruto who was by then the Agriculture minister. He also said ODM called for an audit on the NYS scandal. He said ODM's detractors are using diversionary tactics. "ODM is becoming a scapegoat so that some politicians come out as Mr Clean... there are people who want to tarnish ODM's name... They see ODM as a serious political challenger," Raila said. "Let the facts come out first... right now, the facts aren't there. Let us not try to anticipate... it's easy to say an audit has been carried out, let them now face the music... " Taken to task on whether he has toned down his oversight and criticism of graft for fear of jeopardising his handshake with President Uhuru Kenyatta, Raila said, "The handshake is based on basic principles... the issues we said needed to be addressed in order to unite this country.. one of those is the war on corruption."
