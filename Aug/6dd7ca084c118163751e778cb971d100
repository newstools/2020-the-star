ANC party leader Musalia Mudavadi has urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to set up a judicial inquest to probe the alleged theft of Covid-19 funds, adding that loss of money at MoH is a threat to his legacy. He on Sunday said Kenya may lose the support of the donor community if proper measures are not put it place to act against graft. He said the Office of Auditor General may take too long before it embarks on investigations into the alleged loss of funds. "There is a backlog of cases and by the time they will have cleared with pending cases, it might be five years, " he added. Mudavadi said he supports such a commission because commissioners enjoy immunity and an inquiry is conducted in public. He said  ODM's proposal to have the Auditor General do an audit is "cheeky and mischievous". Last week, ODM secretary general Edwin Sifuna said ODM had restrained itself from responding to the theft allegations because of the desire to comment from an informed position. “We gather that the DCI has been called into Kemsa to investigate these matters. We, however, wonder how this can be so before a credible audit by the Auditor General is carried out to ascertain the veracity of these claims,” he stated. He said ODM would keep raising any concerns with government operations, specifically on Covid-19 related issues, “through the proper channels, without unnecessary drama and hubris”.
