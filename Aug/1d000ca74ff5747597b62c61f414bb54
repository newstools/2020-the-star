The construction of the Sh24 billion Kariminu II Dam in Gatundu North has suffered a two-month delay due to Covid-19, Water CS Sicily Kariuki has said. The CS said the measures put in place by the government to prevent the spread of the coronavirus disrupted activities at the dam site, slowing work. Kariuki said the government has instructed the contractor to work on a 24-hour cycle to fast-track the project's completion and recover lost time. “No more delays will be allowed. The contractor has been directed to engage additional labour to ensure that the project is completed by May 2022,” she said on Wednesday. The project is being funded by the Kenyan government and China Exim Bank. It is being implemented through a joint venture between International Holding Corporation (AVIC) and Shanghai Municipal Engineering Design Institute (SMEDI). The CS said once complete, the dam will serve 850,000 residents of Nairobi and Kiambu counties. It is currently 15 per cent complete. Residents of Kiambu will be the major beneficiaries since 80 per cent of the water will go to Thika, Juja and Ruiru constituencies. The remaining 20 per cent is for Nairobi. “The country is grappling with water scarcity and that’s why the government is keen on timely completion of this project,” Kariuki said. The CS was accompanied by Athi Water Services Board CEO Michael Thuita and other officials. Edited by A.N
