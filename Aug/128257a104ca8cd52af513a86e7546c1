Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong has said they will manage the raging local succession politics to ensure a "friendly' county  boss succeeds him. Ojaamong said despite the recent round-the-clock  fight, they will not surrender the county's top leadership on a silver platter. He said those fighting him will know their place in the 'next few years'. "In the next few months, we shall be on the ground and we are not going to allow those attacking us to get the power on a silver platter," he said. With less than two years to the General Election, some politicians have expressed their interest in the governor seat. Ojamaa is serving his second and final term. Those who have declared interest in the seat include Busia Woman representative Florence Mutua, Teso MP Geoffrey Omuse, Eng Vincent Sidai and Nambale MP John Bunyala. More are expected to join the race as 2022 draws near. Edited by EKibii
