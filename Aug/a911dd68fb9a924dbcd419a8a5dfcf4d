Sauti Sol released its fifth album, Midnight Train, in June. The Bet Award-nominated musicians are gearing up to celebrate through an African YouTube extravaganza experience on August 22. From Nairobi to New York, London to Lagos, Melbourne to Mumbai and Jakarta to Johannesburg, now everyone can take a trip through Sauti Sol’s latest musical offering. Speaking to Homeboyz, Savara Mudigi said for you to get to the stage where you release music, you go through a lot of anxiety. "You try to look for perceptions. By the time an artiste gives out a piece of their heart in the art, it is always a massive thing," he said. Savara said Midnight Train album has been recorded for years and so some songs have been pre-recorded. "We have gone through ups and downs with this album, and the best thing is that now we are signed to a label, Universal Music Africa," he said. Savara said the release of Midnight Train is a big leap for Sauti Sol in taking over the global stage. "This is a way of saying Sauti Sol is here now. We are going global, we are no longer only representing East Africa or Kenyans only or Nairobians, we are representing Africa on a global scale," he said. "Recording the album was an amazing journey and we are happy with the product." At the Midnight Train experience, fans will journey through songs like 'My Everything', 'Feel My Love' and 'Disco Matanga (Yambakhana)'. Sauti Sol hopes to remind everyone that they are also hit by the pandemic. "We are in this together and there will be 'Brighter Days'." Bien said he hopes everyone will come out strong. "Royalties given to Sauti Sol are also going a long way. My savings, too, have gone a long way because as an artiste, you have to save. Hopefully, our savings will push us as far as it can until this nightmare is over,” he said.
