Homeboyz RFC hope to sign five players as they seek to bolster their squad ahead of next season. Club’s chairman Mike Rabar said following an impressive group phase where they finished third on the log and were due to meet Menengai Oilers in the playoffs, they are not going to rest on their laurels. He said they intend to go flat out to win the elusive Kenya Cup title next season. “We had a very good campaign but we are not satisfied. We are aiming higher and with a couple of more signings once the transfer window is opened, we can make adjustments and be competitive.” added Rabar. The Deejays finished third on the log with 66 points and secured a memorable 20-17 victory over league leaders Kabras and a hard-fought 24-24 draw against holders KCB. Rabar was optimistic that the season will start come November if given the green-light by the government. “We will only resume sport once the ministry of health gives us the go ahead. However, until then, we have to wait and see,” he added.
