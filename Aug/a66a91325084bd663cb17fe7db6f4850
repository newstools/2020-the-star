Residents of Ngomeni subcounty of Kitui have resolved to raise funds for back-up power supply and ambulance services at the area's health centre which serves 30,000 people. A local pastor, James Kitonga, said due to erratic power supply and constant outages, patients were being referred to far-off hospitals for laboratory tests. He said those referred to Mwingi Level 4 have to pay Sh6,000 for an ambulance or a taxi. “It strains residents who have to look around for ambulance or taxi money when the sick relative has been referred to Mwingi. It is stressful and that is why we need constant power supply here,” Kitonga said. At a meeting on Friday, the residents said they want to partner with the Kitui administration to mobilise funds to solve the problems. The meeting organised by USAID-Afya Halisi at Ngomeni Health Centre was attended by  Mwingi North Subcounty medical officer Dr Reuben Ombura. He welcomed the residents’ decision to help improve services at the facility. The community members said they would reach out to local elite and other well-wishers to install a stand by solar power system for use at night or during power outages. Residents will also contribute to a kitty to fuel an ambulance or hire a taxi whenever a patient from poor families was referred to other hospitals. Wendy Adamba, the Kitui USAID Afya Halisi social and behaviour change technical officer, told residents to be proactive in ensuring services are up to standard. Elderly Mutete Munyoki said that she brought her injured relative to the health centre at night, and for lack of electricity, she had to buy a torch that was used for lighting as the patient's wound was stitched. She added that the facility constantly faced shortages of drugs.
