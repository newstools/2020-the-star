The stalemate at the Senate over cash allocation to counties will rattle their development plans if no solution is found, Vihiga Governor Wilber Ottichilo has said. Ottichilo said the tough stances in the Senate won't help the marginalised counties that have been disadvantaged for many years. “Let's not reduce what the counties have been receiving because they have already budgeted for 2020-21 financial year,” Ottichilo said. The governor was addressing the press at the county headquarters' boardroom on Wednesday. "Slashing Sh361 million means Vihiga won't factor any development projects," he said. "The Treasury should work with the previous formula for counties to receive funds as the Senate still resolves the best way of revenue allocation," he said. Furthermore, the county will be forced to reduce their staff, the governor said. "Sh316.5 billion was used as a base for the future revenue allocation to counties and from that base we expect the cash to be increased," Ottichilo said. "Governors are supporting a 45 per cent increase to counties but BBI is giving us 35 per cent." He said the state should stop marginalising semi-arid counties because they contribute to the economy largely as well. The Commission on Revenue Allocation had proposed the Equalisation Fund to disadvantaged counties but it was, however, never implemented. Edited by R.Wamochie
