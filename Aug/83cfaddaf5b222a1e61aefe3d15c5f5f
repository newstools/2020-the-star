Former Miss Tanzania Wema Sepetu says she lost weight trying to conceive. Speaking to Clouds FM, she said, "I’ve never had a tummy tuck like most people are saying. The reason I went to India was so I could consult and get treatment for my fertility. "On coming back, I was advised to cut on weight to increase my chances of conceiving since I have a lot of fat around my uterus that was making the process difficult." Wema said some pills she was taking were the culprit in making her add weight. The pills affected her hormones, making it hard for her to have children. "People know how I have struggled to get a baby. My happiness will be complete when I get a baby," she said. Wema said she is not used to her new body as she feels it’s too light compared to her previous body.
