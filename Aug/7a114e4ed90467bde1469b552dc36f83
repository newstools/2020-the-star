Sports CS Amina Mohammed has released draft guidelines for the resumption of sporting activities. This opens a ray of hope for sports men and women who have been training in their homes since the pandemic struck the country in March. Stakeholders will now have a window of seven days to give their views on the report by the CAS Hassan Noor Hassan-led committee, before the Ministry puts together the final protocols. In the proposal, sports will be rolled out in bits and phases. This will include testing for players and officials in the first phase, return to individual training and eventually group training resumption. Through a virtual meeting on Monday morning, Amina said the sports calendar would be rolled out as soon as the measures are reviewed. Sports organisations and federations will have to appoint committees to champion the implementation of the proposals, with stakeholders calling for special attention to the return of national teams to training depending on specific disciplinesâ€™ international calendars. Stakeholders in the meeting raised the issue of testing of players, asking the Ministry if it would be possible to waive or lower testing charges due to the costly nature. Amina tasked the committee in June to report to her on the formula to open sports activities, put to a halt since mid-March following the first case of Covid-19 in Kenya.
