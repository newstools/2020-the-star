Kenya Re has reported a 45.8 per cent rise in profit for the half year ended June 30, compare to same period last year, amid a growth on both gross written and net earned premiums. Profit for the period closed at Sh1.56 billion compared to Sh1.07 billion in half 2019. During the period under review, gross written premiums grew 2.5 per cent to Sh9.07 billion, compared to Sh8.85 billion same period last year. Net earned premiums as of June totaled Sh8.06 billion, an 8.6 pr cent growth compared to last year's Sh7.42bilion. Net claims and benefits paid however increased to Sh5.15 billion, a 3.2 per cent jump compared to Sh4.99 billion. The re-insurer's liabilities were up this year closing the six months at Sh20.24 billion compared to Sh18.41 billion. This includes short-term and long term re-insurance contracts and payables. Last year, claims were predominantly from the DusitD2 attack and the Ethiopian Airline crash. The jump in profit however reflects a positive run for the re-insurer which has been reporting subdued results in the past three years. In half year 2018, the firm had a net profit of Sh1.23 billion before dropping to the Sh1.07 billion. Kenya Re managing director Jadiah Mwarania attributed the drop to an upsurge in claims that rose by 49 per cent during the period. ''Our preference is a reflection of what is happening in the global economy. We have seen World Bank downgrading global growth for the year to 2.6 per cent from 2.9 per cent,” Mwarania had said. Last month, GCR Ratings affirmed Kenya Re's financial strength rating of AA+(KE), with a stable outlook. According to the rating agency's, the national scale financial strength rating of Kenya Re reflects consistently very strong risk adjusted capitalisation and healthy liquidity and business profile. “Accordingly, the entity demonstrated a strong financial profile, while business profile remained at intermediate levels, with small and risky presences in foreign markets diluting entrenched strong domestic market position”, it said in a statement. Capitalisation was assessed within the very strong range, albeit with unrealised property revaluation gains supporting a strong capital growth of 13 per cent to $315 million in financial year 2019 from $275million in 2018.
