Never underestimate the power of a good hair day. That might have been what Evelyn Zachary - one of embattled Migori Governor Okoth Obado's daughters - was banking on when she showed up for her day in court with a new braided wig hairstyle as she hoped to be granted bail. Zachary and her three siblings are facing graft charges alongside Obado. Zachary sported a short haircut during her arrest last Wednesday. Videos of the arrest captured her appearing to flash the middle finger at camera crew. Obado's daughters were remanded at Kileleshwa police station away from their father and two brothers who were at the EACC police station. Zachary is a doctor by profession and the court was told that she graduated and is currently doing her internship. Obado has been released on a Sh8.7 million cash bail or Sh20 million bond. Chief Magistrate Lawrence Mugambi on Monday in his bail ruling ordered that Obado be barred from accessing Migori County offices until the case is concluded. Obado's children were also released on various bail amounts. Dan Okoth was granted Sh2 million bail, Scarlet Okoth Sh3 million, Jerry Okoth Sh2 million and Zachary Sh2 million. Ann Ngirita, of the NYSII scandal, was also known to switch up her hair during court dates - from wearing black wigs to some with highlights in colours that stood out including blonde and white. The family suffered a blow last week after the court ruled that they should forfeit some of the property they acquired through proceeds of the scandal.
