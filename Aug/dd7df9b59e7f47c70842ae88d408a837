BBC journalist Ciru Muriuki is in mourning following the death of her father, which she announced on social media on Saturday. She described him as a loving father who was also her anchor. "What life can never prepare you for is to lose a beloved parent. My most honoured, most cherished father has rested," she wrote. "I have grappled with the unimaginable pain of losing my anchor, my best friend, the best man I have ever known." In another post she said, "Words are not enough to express the immensity of this loss. But in all things, we praise the name of the Lord. Dad, I will love you forever. The rest of my life will be spent longing to see you again."
