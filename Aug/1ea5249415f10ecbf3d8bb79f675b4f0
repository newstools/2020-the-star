The Kenya Wildlife Service has rubbished claims that park rates for Kenyans have been increased by up to 60 per cent. Reports in a section of the media had indicated that KWS had increased park rates for Kenyan citizens. Business Daily had indicated that KWS had reduced charges paid by foreign nationals amid reduced travel in the wake of the virus. But via Twitter on Monday, KWS said the new changes ensure that citizens and residents of Kenya enjoy the same rates. “The public is advised to ignore reports that KWS has increased its rates and continue to discover KWS parks,” it said. In its effort to encourage visitations into National Parks, KWS reduced its Park Entry fees down effective July 1, 2020, for one year to all its national parks, reserves, and sanctuaries. The rates applied to all categories of tourists (local, residents, and international). This is together with a 50 per cent reduction fee for film makers who are normally charged by KWS when they film documentaries in the parks. All the measures apply from July 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021. In the revised entry fee, local tourists will pay Sh400 as they visit Nairobi Park from the current Sh430 while those visiting Nakuru, Amboseli parks will pay Sh800 from the initial Sh860. Tsavo West and Tsavo East parks will be charging Sh500 from Sh515 while Meru, Aberdares and Mt.Kenya parks will charge Sh250 from Sh300.
