Makini Schools on Thursday announced the introduction of the Cambridge Curriculum to its current offering. According to the school's Education Director, Angelica Ouya  this will ensure that the needs of all the learners and parents, who require an international curriculum based on and adapted to the unique Kenyan environment are met. However, the school will continue to offer the National curriculum. Ouya said the new offering will target those seeking to pursue an international curriculum for High School (in particular class 8 learners), an international curriculum that delivers high quality education but sustained at a mid-fee range. The Cambridge Curriculum which will pioneer from Year 4 to Year 9 starting September 7, 2020 will also be enriched with Kenyan content and applicable to the requirements of learners. “Makini Schools has always kept with the times and endeavours to continue being a leader in education and innovation. We ensure to meet the needs of our learners and live up to our education philosophy, which is to prepare our children for a happy and successful future in a forever changing world," Ouya said "The Cambridge framework will provide for the key subjects of English, Mathematics and Science. Other subjects include History, ICT (Computers), Physical Education, Geography and Global Perspectives. Swahili and French will be taught as additional languages." Makini's Headteacher, Hezron Onyango, who is also spearheading the implementation  said the new curriculum will kick off virtually in September and will be based on the same Makini ethos and values.
