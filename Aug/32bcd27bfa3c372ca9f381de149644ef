Narc Kenya party leader Martha Karua has lashed out at ODM party leader Raila Odinga over his remarks on the role of the opposition. Raila had claimed that ODM is both in the opposition and in the government. During his press briefing on Thursday, Raila said ODM was part of the government despite the fact that it is part of the minority brigade that forms the opposition. But Karua took to social media to register her displeasure. "Deliberate confusion! The constitution provides for majority party (party in government )and minority party (opposition ), at national level and in each county. Pretending to be both whether at the National or county level is not only untenable but unconstitutional!," she said. Karua said the opposition have become the mouthpiece of the executive. "... we are talking of the total lack of oversight and the fact that the minority party leadership and members have become the mouth piece of the executive," she said. ButÂ Raila in his remarks dismissed claims that the handshake had weakened the opposition. Raila said there is a wrong perception that ODM is the one that is supposed to be in the opposition to check on the government. "Our media is ill-informed about ODM's mandate. Before the new constitution, we had a high breed of a parliamentary and presidential system where opposition was to check on the government. In the current presidential system where we have the Executive, Legislature and Judiciary things are different," Raila said. Raila argued that it is upon Parliament to oversight the government alongside the minority party and not vice versa. "It is therefore not about ODM but upon all the MPs to play their role," he added.
