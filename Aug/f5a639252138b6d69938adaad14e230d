Senators have been locked a standoff over the sharing of devolved funds among the 47 counties in the last few weeks. The delay in agreeing on the third generation formula has caused a crisis in all the counties, with services being affected. Counties have not paid workers for two months and operations have been reduced to a bare minimum. The Commission on Revenue Allocation, which created the new formula, tabled its proposal to the Senate early last year. The senators should have prioritised the issue and found a solution early enough. Our politicians have put their selfish interests before Kenya and have refused to use data to argue their case for and against the proposed formula. Some are being dishonest and unprincipled when it comes to the debate. As senators meet again today for the eighth time over the issue, they must remember that the principle of any revenue sharing formula is that no county should be affected negatively by changes to such methods. We urge the senators to come up with a method that will ensure the 17 counties set to lose millions receive what they did the year before. This formula will ensure that services are not disrupted by sudden reduction in resources.
