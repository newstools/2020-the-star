A man was on Wednesday charged with failing to pay Sh885,000 he accumulated after spending 63 days in a hotel. Moses Adagala was charged before Kibera senior principal magistrate Derrick Kuto where he denied the charges. The charge sheet read that between June 19 and August 25 at Sanjo Suites in Langata subcounty, Nairobi, Adagala incurred a bill of Sh885,000 by booking and checking into the hotel but did not pay. Adagala was also charged with the second count of issuing a bad cheque. The police report says Adagala entered the hotel with his wife and three children after agreeing with the hotel management that he would be paying Sh15,000 per day. The police report says he paid Sh50, 000 for four days and stopped. He later issued a cheque which was dishonoured by the bank. Through his lawyer, Adagala said he was a family man and was not in a position to pay tough bond terms. Kuto released him on Sh500,000 bond or a cash bail of Sh300,000 with a surety of the same amount. Kuto directed the case to be mentioned on September 22 and heard on October 27. Edited by Henry Makori
