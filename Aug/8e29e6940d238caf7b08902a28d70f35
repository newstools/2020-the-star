A prison warden was Monday charged with breaking into a building and stealing men and women's boots valued at Sh6,454,342. Naftali Wahome denied the charge before Kibera chief magistrateÂ Abdulqadir Lorot. He also denied a second count of handling stolen goods. The charge sheet says Wahome committed the offence with others not before the court on the night of August 8 and 9 in Industrial Area in Nairobi. The court papers say they broke into the Service Central Stores of the Kenya Police Service and stole 1,826 pairs of ankle shoes, high leather boots for men and 398 pairs of leather ankle boots for women. He was arrested after the officer in charge of the clothing section reported that the items were missing and an investigation launched. The magistrate released him on Sh1 million bond. The case will be mentioned on August 28.
