 Two infant siblings drowned on Monday morning in a septic tank in Kendu Bay town. Five-year-old Mercy Topin and her one-year-old brother Peter Chris were playing near the tank when the tragedy happened. The girl was the first to fall in the tank. The brother crawled to his death moments later. Some residents spotted the children from a distance and raised the alarm but it was too late to rescue them. Homa Bay County Red Cross co-ordinator Samuel Omondi said his officers found the children already dead. They retrieved the bodies. Rachuonyo North subcounty police commander Sarah Chumo urged parents not to leave their children idle and on their own. “Let every parent monitor the movement of their children at home to prevent this kind of incident,” Chumo said. She also told them to keep children busy at home. “Giving children responsibilities will prevent them from loitering to risky places,” Chumo said. The bodies were taken to Kendu Bay Adventist hospital mortuary.  - mwaniki fm
