Tanzanians songstress Lady Jaydee is single but not ruling out any chance of marrying again after two failed relationships. In an interview with CloudsFM, Jaydee hinted she could be in a secret relationship. "I can’t answer if I will get married again or if I won’t ever get married again. I am going with the flow," she said. "Whatever makes me happy I am fine with, even if it doesn’t lead to marriage." Lady Jaydee was married to Gardner Habash for nearly a decade and in the interview, she said she is no longer bitter about their divorce. "We were married for nine years and were both at fault because we are all human and make mistakes," she said. "I can’t speak for him, but on my part, I have closed that chapter and will never go back to him. We are just friends although at first, we feuded, something that happens with divorcing couples. Now we drink wine together. I even know his new lover and we get along." They separated in 2015, and their divorce was finalised in 2016. In a past interview with Word Is, she said her marriage didn’t work out. "I was not happy at all and that’s why I decided not to carry on," she said. "My husband was cheating on me and had become a drunkard, while I was working so hard and giving the relationship all I could. I am just happy and thank God that I don’t have children with him." She introduced another man, named Spicy, in 2016 after they met in South Africa. However, after about a year of dating, reports emerged that the two were no longer together.
