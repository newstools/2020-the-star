On Saturday night, Sauti Sol set the Internet ablaze with the virtual performance of their fifth studio album, 'Midnight Train'. Over 40,000 people watched the YouTube Live event and it was beyond everyone's expectations. Before the event, the group shared a video of the legendary Eric Wainaina, saying they always wanted to be like him. "Where do we even start? All we ever wanted was to be like you. From watching you way back in Club Afrique. You showed and continue to show us what musicianship and authenticity is all about. There is definitely no us without you and your art. Thank you for always having our backs. You are a King." After the show, fans congratulated the band for an amazing performance. Richard Njau, the brains behind CTA YouTube channel and digital media enthusiast, explained how epic Sauti Sol's performance was. "In short, Sauti Sol's live show just filled an international stadium. And I ain't talking Kasarani," he shared. "In fact, they filled Kasarani and Nyayo Stadium! At their peak, they had 32,440 devices, and if we multiply that by a screen factor of 1.5, that's over 45K people watching the live show simultaneously." He concluded saying the band did an epic job. "They have raised the Kenyan and African banner to a place where no other musician has done! " Radio Africa Group was among the sponsors of the super successful virtual event. Edited by T Jalio
