Award-winning HockeyKE Women Premier League Player of the Year,  Leah Omwandho wants to add field goals from open play to her game. The Sailors attacking midfielder scored four goals— all from short corners— last season and she is keen to take her performance to the next level. The 27-year-old  Kenyan international opened her account with a goal in the 3-0 win over newbies Orange Leonas before the season was interrupted by the  Covid-19 pandemic in mid March. She, however, remains optimistic of doubling her last season's tally. Sailors finished fifth in the 2019 season and the energetic midfielder said the team is targeting a podium finish this time round. Omwandho is one of the pioneers of the team having joined the Thomas Mucheni-tutored side in 2016 when the team made their debut in the top tier. "My stronghold is defending and attacking short corners and that's why I scored  four goals. I need to create pockets of space for myself so that my teammates can find a killer pass for me to score. We've been working on team moves and we want to bring it out in matches. We have the squad to to claim  second spot in the league," said the former Kenyatta University player who was part of the Kenyan team to the Olympic qualifiers in South Africa last year. Sailors boasts the likes of Pauline Naise, who juggles between hockey and football,  refined midfielder Ivyet Kanyandong and tough-tackling defender Bridie Naliaka among others. Omwandho is open to playing at left back for the club having served in that position while donning the national colours. "It was one of the toughest examinations I faced but I was never disappointed. The modern day game demands flexibility andI am ready to play anywhere when called upon. I want to synchronise Sailors' midfield in order to become an all-action player." Omwandho said Sailors need the mental toughness to grind out results, which has been the team's main undoing in the past.
