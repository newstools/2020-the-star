Three people died in Kitui when the driver of a matatu they were travelling in lost control of the vehicle in Kativo and veered off the road before rolling and spewing out all its occupants. Matinyani subcounty police commander John Sawe said two men and a four-year-old girl died on the spot. Speaking on phone, Sawe said five other passengers of the Thika-bound vehicle sustained serious injuries and were rushed to the Kitui County Referral Hospital. Unconfirmed reports, however, indicated the death toll may have risen to five. Sawe said the driver of the matatu lost control when he abruptly came upon a diversion at the Kativo patch of the Kitui-Thika road that is being tarmacked. He said the vehicle veered off the road and rolled a number of times before resting on it's back. In a separate accident, Kitui's Kwa Vonza MCA John Kisangau escaped death after his car was hit by a passenger vehicle. Kisangau, aka Mbaki Mbaki, escaped with hand and leg bruises after crashing into a Toyota saloon car at Kathungi along the Kitui -Kavisuni road. Chief Kalimu Katiwa, who was among the first people to arrive at the scene of the accident, said although the MCA and other occupants of his car escaped with slight injuries, a passenger in the other car was seriously injured and rushed to the county referral hospital. Katiwa said the driver of the Toyota appeared confused and fled into the bushes soon after the accident. Kisangau, who was driving his car, told newsmen that he swerved and landed into the bush to avoid the accident but the oncoming car rammed into his. Edited by R.Wamochie
