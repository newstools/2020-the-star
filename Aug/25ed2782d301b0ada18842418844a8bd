 Unknown men on Thursday night broke into a widow's rental house in Sindo market and hacked her head and shoulders. Mildred Achieng’, 38, a trader at the market in Suba South died in hospital from her injuries and massive loss of blood. Area chief Daniel Magadi said the attackers locked Achieng’s neighbours' doors from outside before breaking into her house through a window. “The woman died on arrival to a hospital where she was rushed for medication. She sustained serious injuries on the head and shoulders,” Magadi said. The administrator said preliminary investigations revealed Achieng had recently quarrelled with a man suspected to be her lover. He said the man had accused her of cheating. Suba deputy county commissioner Joseph Maina said police officers have been sent on the ground to look for suspects. Maina urged residents with information on the suspects' whereabouts to inform security officers for their arrest. “The suspects must have been known by residents and we appeal they divulge information to enable us arrest them,” Maina said. The body of the woman was taken to Sindo Subcounty Hospital morgue.
