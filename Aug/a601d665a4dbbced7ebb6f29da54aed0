Kiambu Governor James Nyoro has urged senators to conclude the revenue allocation formula debate. He said county governments are suffering financially, even as they try to improve health facilities to handle the Covid-19 pandemic. Nyoro on Wednesday urged senators to pass the one man, one vote, one shilling formula, since the money is not meant for governors, but for Kenyans. He said Kiambu hosts people from all corners, while its hospitals accommodate patients from Nairobi and other parts of the country. “About 50 per cent of patients at Kiambu, Thika and Tigoni hospitals are from outside our county, and we do not complain,” he said. “We are facing a financial challenge because we need to improve other health facilities. We need drugs and other equipment and that is why we are asking the Senate to be sensitive.” The debate on the cash-sharing formula has flopped seven times, owing to political disagreements. Nyoro was accompnaied by Deputy Governor Joyce Ngugi, Health executive Joseph Murega, Lari Kirenga MCA Joseph Karichu and Lari administrator Dominic Kariuki. Edited by A.N
