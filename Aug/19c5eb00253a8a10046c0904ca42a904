A cleric has decried a worrying trend of land disputes during funeral ceremonies across Kenya. “I have presided over burials across the length and breadth of Kenya and noted with concern the increasing number of petty land disputes that have caused disruptions of such referred events,” Bishop Philip Karanja said on Wednesday. Karanja, who heads the Victory Centre Church in Nairobi, spoke in Kwa Ngindu village on the outskirts of Kitui town during the burial of Alice Kesiwa. Kesiwa was the mother of Bishop Richard Kimwele of Rhema international Church and mother-in-law of Rev Euticauls Wambua of Baptist Convention of Kenya. On the eve of the ceremony, a relative attempted to stop the burial of Kesiwa. The relative, through a lawyer, wrote to the immediate family, seeking to stop the burial at the family grave yard. The burial committee and immediate family members were thrown into confusion upon receiving the letter, but another lawyer saved that day when he clarified that the letter did not have the power to stop the ceremony as it did not amount to a court order. Bishop Karanja urged the government and grassroots elected leaders to discourage residents from involving themselves in petty fights over small pieces of land. The cleric urged residents to work hard and acquire their own land instead of wrangling over land inherited from parents. “I forfeited the about two acres I was to inherit from my late father. I later acquired my own 65 acres,” the Bishop said. Edited by A.N
