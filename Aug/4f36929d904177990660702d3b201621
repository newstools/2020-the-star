Two suspects are being sought after escaping from police radar along Chemoligot - Marigat Rd in Baringo county on Friday night. DCI director George Kinoti said intelligence officers from DCI and Nginyang Police Station went on patrol duties where they encountered a suspected motorcycle Reg No KMDX 467X with two occupants. When the two were asked to stop, they escaped, leaving the motorcycle with a sack behind. On searching the contents of the sack, the DCI detectives found three G3 rifles and three AK47 rifles, all with six magazines. Kinoti said they also recovered 169 rounds of ammunition adding that search for the escaped individuals is still on. Boda bodas or motorcycles have become the popular form of transport in most parts of Kenya. But gangs have infiltrated the sector over years. In many cases, armed robbers prefer motorcycles since they are a quick means to escape after committing crime. The attacks happen quickly leaving victims confused as the assailants vanish into thin air.
