@ppcheti Police in Lamu have released all minor offenders on police bond or bail to decongest cells and curb the spread of the coronavirus. Suspects with minor offences such as stealing and fights were freed and asked to appear in court on stipulated dates. Coronavirus infection has yet to be reported in prisons and police cells in the county, according to police boss Moses Muriithi. Convicts at the Hindi GK Prison and suspects held in Lamu town, Mpeketoni, Witu and Faza police stations mask at all times and are encouraged to social-distance. Relatives and suspects entering prisons and police stations in the county also have to undergo mandatory screening to avert the spread of the virus. Speaking in Lamu on Friday, Muriithi said the move has prevented the virus from the cells. He said overcrowding in the cells and prisons provide the perfect ground for the spread of the coronavirus. Stations and prisons have been furnished with adequate sanitiser and face masks. “We have enough face masks within our prison and the police cells. Before suspects join others in cells, we always ensure their body temperatures are taken. We’ve enough thermoguns in our police stations and prisons. We’ve also been encouraging people to wash hands when entering or leaving the stations and prison,” Muriithi said. Officers working at the Occurrence Book desk and other busy sections in stations and prisons have to wear full protective gear to avoid contracting Covid-19.
