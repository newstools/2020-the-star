Tourism Cabinet Secretary Najib Balala has revoked the appointment of Pauline Njoroge as member of the Tourism Regulatory Authority board. The CS cited the nominee’s earlier comments regarding the Nairobi National Park. “I am revoking Pauline Njoroge’s appointment as a board member because we have just seen what she had tweeted in the past that Nairobi National Park was useless,” Balala is quoted in a press release by the ministry. “We don’t want to be associated with such people and such thinking,” the CS said citing the integrity of the Nairobi National Park and the government’s commitment to conserve it. "The integrity of Nairobi National Park is very important and the government is committed to save Nairobi National Park and any other protected area which is the habitat for our national heritage," he added. The CS appointed Standard Group journalist Najma Ismail to the board shortly after revoking Njoroge’s appointment. “We regret we did not know what she had said in the past. We want to take this opportunity to thank Kenyans on social media for highlighting what we had missed during our background check on her,” the statement reads. Njoroge had been nominated to the board alongside Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka’s son Kevin Muasya, Alais Lenana, and Isaac Njangu.
