Some members of Olalui group ranch in Narok county have accused a judge of frustrating their efforts to appeal against a decision he issued regarding ownership of 7, 000 acres of disputed land. Through lawyer Leonard Lerionka they claim that Narok Environment and Land Court judge Mohammed Kullow is obstructing justice by failing to sign a copy of his judgement to allow them appeal. “The judge is deliberately out of the court station so as not to sign the judgment he issued for it to have a certified effect for purposes of appeal, thereby obstructing justice,” they say. On July 30, Kullow said there was no dispute that the suit land was registered in the name of Kilgoris MP Gideon Konchellah and two others since the evidence that was tendered by both parties is in tandem. However, the members contend that despite Konchellah and others being owners of the suit land, there is no proper adjudication and demarcation of the parcel. The members of the disputed ranch filed the case seeking a declaration that the subdivision and transfer of parcels in Olalui to Konchellah and others were fraudulent, null and void and that the land be transferred in the name of the group ranch. The ranch is situated in Transmara West in Narok and hosts 4,000 households. But Kullow in his judgement said the members of the ranch failed to establish the elements of fraud as alleged. “The issue of fraud is a serious one in which the person alleging must be prepared to provide full proof of the same and in the instant case I find the plaintiff has not been able to discharge that particular burden,” he ruled. But the ranch members through their Lawyer say all they wanted was everyone to get equal acreage. “There is a threat to make us squatters in our own ancestral land. We appeal to His Excellency Uhuru Muigai Kenyatta to intervene as this is becoming a historical injustice of evicting indigenous people from their own ancestral land,” they say. Edited by Henry Makori
