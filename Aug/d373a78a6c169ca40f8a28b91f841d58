The Commission on Revenue Allocation has offered technical input to resolve the impasse over county cash at the Senate. In a statement on Monday, the commission's basis for recommending the third basis formula was premised on the idea that counties whose allocations were to decline by more than five per cent would be compensated by an increase in their equitable share allocation. However, this year's allocation by Treasury has not changed, thus making it impractical to cushion losing counties, the CRA said. "The equitable share allocation for Financial Year 2020/21 remained at the same level as Financial Year 2019/20 making cushioning of the losing counties impractical," the commission said. The losing counties are from the less populous regions of the Coast, Northeastern, lower Eastern and parts of Rift Valley. Further, the commission noted that application of the new data arising from the Census 2019 has amplified the magnitude of the difference in allocations among counties. Nominated Senator Naomi Waqo during an interview at Citizen TV on Monday night, said the Census should not be a guide since the figures might not be accurate. She said the 2019 drought made people from arid areas, including her Mandera county, migrate during the Census period. "Our people were not even at their homes. There are people in Wajir and Mandera who are there today who moved with their animals during those days of Census," she said. She said counties have already made budgets for projects needed to be implemented hence the reduction will have a negative impact on people. The Senate is set to meet on Tuesday as lobbying for and against the disputed revenue sharing formula intensified at the weekend, with each of the warring factions raiding each other in the battle for numbers.
