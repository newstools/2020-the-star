President Uhuru Kenyatta has directed the Ministry of Health to come up with a working plan on how to deal with the increasing cases of mental health problems. The president said the ministry should start working on an active plan that will help in reducing such cases. "I do hereby direct the Ministry of Health to begin working on an active plan that they can present to us when we have our national conference on how we are going to deal with the issue of mental health," Uhuru said. He said that the ministry should be ready with its strategic plan at the next national conference. “We need to focus on the mental health care of the people. It is becoming an increasing problem, especially among young people. We have to double on our efforts to work on the mental health of the entire population,” Uhuru said. Uhuru said that the youth in the country have not been spared by the impact of the lockdown which was meant to reduce the spread of the virus. “There has been a huge impact as a result of the lockdown that we’d had on our young people who have felt restrained and constrained from the liberties that they know. He added that mental health has hugely affected young people in the country, hence immediate response needed. The recent surveys from several research institutions have indicated a massive loss of jobs after companies were affected by the pandemic. The Association of Mental Health Advocates had earlier acknowledged that mental health patients are currently under more distress during the coronavirus crisis. They recommended that all mental hospitals and methadone clinics remain open to ensure continuity of care during the pandemic. According to the association, cases of anxiety rates may go up due to isolation, toxic home environments, economic challenges affecting resources for health care among others.
