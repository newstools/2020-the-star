Tanzania has banned Fly540, Air Kenya Express and Safarilink Aviation from its territory, according to reports by the Citizen Tanzania. This comes weeks after the country banned Kenya Airways from its space. He said that Tanzania had noted its exclusion in the list of countries whose people will be allowed to travel into Kenya effective Saturday when international flights resume in Kenya. "The Authority regrets to inform you that, on a reciprocal basis, the Tanzanian Government has decided to nullify its approval for Kenya Airways flights between Nairobi and Dar/Kilimanjaro/Zanzibar effective August 1, 2020 until further notice," the letter said. Johari added that the letter rescinds all previous arrangements that permit KQ flights into Tanzania including a letter dated July 30, 2020. KQ was locked out of Tanzania a day after Kenya excluded her southern neighbor from the initial list of 11 countries allowed to fly into Kenya. In a communiqué announced by Transport CS James Macharia, China,  South Korea, Japan, Canada, Uganda, France, Namibia,  Zimbabwe, Ethiopia, Rwanda, Switzerland  and  Morocco who have mild and limited community transmission were given a green light. The list is reviewed on a regular basis depending on the circumstances on the ground and after a comprehensive global mapping of the intensity of the disease. Currently, passengers from at least 130 countries are exempted from mandatory  quarantine on arrival in Kenya. Some of the countries include; Uganda, US (except California, Florida and Texas), Russia, Turkey, Poland, Rwanda, Cuba and Australia. All passengers arriving in the country are required to produce a PCR based Covid-19 certificate whose test should have been done 96 hours before travel.
