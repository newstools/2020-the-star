President Uhuru Kenyatta on Friday evening opened the rehabilitated Michuki Park in Nairobi county. The park, which was initially known as the Mazingira Park, was renamed to Michuki Park by the Ministry of Environment in 2012, in honour of the late John Michuki. In attendance were President Uhuru Kenyatta, Environment CS Keriako Tobiko and Chief Conservator of Forests Julias Kamau. Uhuru said the park has been restored to its initial look. “We have moved it from a safe haven for criminals to a place of serene beauty and peace and from a lifeless habitat to a life-supporting ecosystem, leading to the re-emergence of birds,” he said.
