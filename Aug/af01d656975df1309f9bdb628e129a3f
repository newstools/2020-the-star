Brookhouse schools is celebrating after all its 94 Cambridge A-levels class of 2020 students secured admission to universities. The institution revealed in a statement on Thursday that at A-level, 80 per cent of students achieved grades A to C, and a 100 per cent pass rate overall in the examinations. All the candidates have qualified for admissions into leading universities across the world, including those in the Ivy League. Commenting on the results, Brookhouse Schools Headteacher Eric Mulindi said that the performance reflects the extreme hard work by the students and teachers, and consistent support from parents “We are proud of our students as they set off on the next step of their journeys. These results would not have been possible without the dedication of our teaching staff, who consistently go above and beyond for our students,” Mulindi said. Unlike previous years, this year’s examinations which took place between May and June, saw candidates, like their global cohorts, undergo virtual assessment sessions from the Cambridge Examination Board that graded the students. The international school has announced resumption of its education programme for the 2020-2021 academic year  on August 18 through virtual learning for all its students. "With government restrictions on schools still in place, the school seeks to deliver the highest quality in virtual learning even as it continues to refine and develop its virtual provision in line with the best practice of Inspired Schools around the world," the Headteacher said.
