The convoy of Kakamega governor Wycliffe Oparanya and Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe was on Saturday morning stoned in Kakamega town. The chaos disrupted activities in the Western Kenya town for 30 minutes forcing the leaders to call reinforcement so that they can be able to access the town. Kagwe and Oparanya convoy was just arriving in Kakamega town when youths barricaded the entry to town accusing Oparanya of demolishing their structures around the general hospital on Friday. They also accused Oparanya for bad policies, which are destroying the livelihoods of the locals. The angry youth stoned the convoy forcing the police and the county enforcement officers to engage them to clear the way. The youths accused Oparanya of destroying their livelihoods for personal aggrandizement. The locals blocked the main highway saying that the government has failed to provide them with sanitisers and face masks. They also protested the move by the Kakamega county government to demolish tradersâ€™ stalls in the town. Kagwe was touring the county health facilities to inspect preparation plans by the county to combat Covid-19. The attack caught Oparanya off-guard, who has lately been positioning himself as the new kingpin of the Western region. Oparanya has been holding closed door meetings with opinion leaders and professional groups in the region since he, together with Wamalwa, were installed at Cotu boss Francis Atwoli's Kajiado home on May 31 as Luhya spokesmen. The two have since been accused by leaders leaning towards ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi and his Ford Kenya counterpart Moses Wetang'ula as traitors being used by "outsiders" to frustrate Luhya unity ahead of the 2022 succession race. Last weekend they met Kanu chairman Gideon Moi at his Kabarak home.
