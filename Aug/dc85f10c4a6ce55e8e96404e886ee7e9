The government has formed a multi-agency team to save the Mau Forest and end recurrent ethnic clashes and evictions in the area. The team seeks to resolve the Eastern Mau land problem that has resulted in evictions, deaths, destruction of property, ethnic clashes and displacement of thousands of families in Eastern Mau. The latest wave of conflict took place two weeks ago in Molo and Njoro sub-counties. The incident left six people dead, 83 injured, 39 hospitalised with arrows lodged in their bodies, 198 houses burnt in 10 villages and more than 3,000 families displaced. The team started its work on Friday after touring the affected areas of Marioshioni and Nessuit. It is expected to create clear boundaries between settlement schemes and the forestland. Environment Principal Secretary Chris Kiptoo said besides restoring peace and security, the team, which has one month to complete its work, will focus on restoring degraded forestlands by 2022. His Lands counterpart PS Nicholas Muraguri said the team will mark forest cut lines based on the 1994 maps to avoid conflicts between the Kenya Forest Service and communities. He said it is important to save the Mau Forest because it is an important water tower in the country. “The team has visited the affected areas and met with community leaders and agreed to amicably resolve the issues that cause conflicts,” Muraguri said. He was accompanied by Rift Valley regional commissioner George Natembeya. The formation of the multi-agency team comes days after several NGOs in Nakuru asked the government to avert further violence in settlement schemes within and neighbouring Eastern Mau along the Nakuru-Narok border. They observed that historical land injustices and negative ethnicity are part of the problem fanning violence in Mau and other parts of the country.
