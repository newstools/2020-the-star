Detectives based on Saturday morning arrested a man suspected to have been involved in the fatal shooting of a 28-year-old man at Galana Suites in Kilimani. Robert Bodo was arrested and a mini Ceska firearm with 13 rounds of ammunition suspected to have been used in the shooting was recovered, DCI said in a tweet. The firearm, which has been kept as an exhibit, will be subjected to ballistic analysis as further investigations ensue to unravel the motive of the shooting. Galana Suites consists of fully furnished and serviced apartments. The killing comes barely a month after a woman was found dead outside a Kilimani flat - Santonio flat. Sheila Njeri’s body was lying near a flower bed and had injuries on the back and bruises on the waist. Blood oozed from the nose and her clothes were torn. Preliminary investigations showed that the woman and some people, the suspects included, had been drinking and having fun in a house - No B03. The suspects, Shem Ng’eno, Christine Awour and Claire Chepkoech were all released on Sh100,000 bond or Sh50,000 cash bail each. Investigating officer Joseph Nderitu had told the court that police had obtained samples from Ng'eno’s DNA and that they were under examination at the Government Chemist. The suspects gave contradictory statements when questioned on Njeri’s whereabouts. The case will be mentioned on August 28.
