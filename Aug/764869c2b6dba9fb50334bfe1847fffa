Four top Kenya Tea Development Authority officials are expected to appear at the Directorate of Criminal Investigation headquarters Monday to be questioned over allegations of fraud. The DCI on Friday summoned KTDA boss Lerionka Tiampati, finance officer Simeon Rugut, legal officer John Omanga and Brown Kanampiu, a procurement officer to its headquarters. In letters seen by the Star, investigating officer Obadiah Kuriah said the four will help officers unravel a conspiracy to defraud case being handled by the DCI. “Under the powers conferred upon me under section 52(1) of the National Police Service Act  No. 11A of 2011, I hereby compel you, Lerionka Tiampati to appear before me at the Directorate of Criminal Investigation situated along Kiambu Road at Mazingira House on the 24/08,2020 at 0900 hours without fail. Failure to comply with the requisition constitutes to an offence liable to prosecution," he wrote to Tiampati. A similar letter was written to the other officials. All the summonses signed as received by KTDA’s Bridget Makena were served by Stephen Manyala. The summonses come barely a fortnight after the DCI boss George Kinoti said he was going to look into claims of alleged funds misappropriation at KTDA. Kinoti had earlier received a petition from farmers allied to seven factories seeking his help in establishing the amount of money the authority had been using in court cases.
