“I was arrested while in the line of duty.” Those are the words of former Garsen MP Danson Mungatana as he faces allegations involving a fake Sh70 million tender. In a statement, Mungatana said he was only connecting two parties - one with a contract but no capacity and the other with capacity but no contract. “I never thought that there was any shady dealing. Both parties promised to pay commission after supply. Surely where's the obtaining by false pretense there? Documents and monies moving between them is something I can tell any court that I was a stranger to,” he said. Mungatana was arrested alongside Collins Paul Waweru on Tuesday night in Nairobi over what police said was obtaining money by false pretences. Mungatana was released after paying Sh20,000 bail. Police say Waweru approached a businesswoman, Everlyne Njoki, claiming he could help her secure a Sh70 million tender to supply cereals. Njoki allegedly paid Sh1 million upfront on July 14 but the deal never went through. This forced her to file a report. But Mungatana said he was only contracted to render legal services. Mungatana said his client does brokerage for contracts among other businesses. “He contacted Waweru who is a broker for companies. They held meetings and I was paid for my services as a lawyer. I was called to a meeting by Waweru together with owners of the company,” Mungatana said in his statement. “I am willing to cooperate with the detectives to unearth any shady business if at all there could be any.” He said he was picked by police as he tried to offer his services to the two parties. “As we were having tea, police came saying that the documents used were fake. I went with my client to check what was happening. I explained to the officers what I know about the transaction and that I was available anytime to them.” Edited by A.N
