A convict serving three years for burglary has been added an extra year in jail for escaping from prison. Samuel Githinji admitted that he escaped from the custody of Corporal Nelson Kamau at Kamiti on June 28. Prosecutor Nancy Kerubo told Kibera chief magistrate Joyce Gandani on Wednesday that Githinji had been jailed for three years by a Kikuyu court for burglary. Kerubo said the convict and other prisoners were transporting trees on wheelbarrows when he ran into a bush and disappeared. “The accused had been convicted by a Kikuyu court and run away after he was instructed to transfer trees from one place to another using a wheelbarrow,” she said. His escape was reported to Kahawa West Police Station. He was arrested in Kikuyu. In mitigation, Githinji said he was a Kikuyu, prompting the magistrate to ask if he was normal. Gandani jailed him for a year even before he responded.  - mwaniki fm
