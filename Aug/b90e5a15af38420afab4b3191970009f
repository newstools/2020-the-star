Lari police station was on Saturday fumigated after three suspects in the cells tested positive last week. Deputy subcounty commander Charles Opondo said no officer has tested positive so far. The officers, he said, will be tested regularly and fumigation will be done every week. “We are in agreement with the Ministry of Health to be fumigating our stations three times in a week,” he said. The suspects, who tested positive, were taken to Tigoni Hospital. “We aim to protect each other and those who seek our assistance every day,” Opondo said. The police boss also urged residents to follow government directives to protect themselves against the virus. Opondo was accompanied by public health officer Peter Mbugua, Lari OCS Festus Okoth and other senior officers. Edited by A.N
