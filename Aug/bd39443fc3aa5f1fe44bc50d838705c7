Drama unfolded in Limuru town on Wednesday when matatus blocked the bus park to protest against entry of a new Sacco operator accused of unfair competition. Owners of matatus plying the Nairobi-Limuru route accused Molo Classic Sacco of reducing fare and robbing them of customers. They further accused the county government of Kiambu of placing the Molo Classic Sacco strategically at the entrance to the bus park. "These matatus are at the entrance of the bus park. When you arrive at the stage, everyone notices them and their charges are making travelers to board them since they have reduced the fare," said Kevin Njoroge, a resident. Likana Sacco and Lina Sacco have vowed to push for relocation of the new Sacco from the entrance to the bus park. Likana Sacco chairman Peter Muiruri said their matatus took hours to get customers. "The new Sacco is drawing the attention of all our customers. We do not fear competition, all we want is fair competition," he said. They accuse the new sacco of charging Sh80 to Nairobi from Limuru while they charge Sh100. Limuru town bus park chairman John Kamau asked the government to assist the matatu operators resolve the dispute. On Tuesday, Kiambu county chief administrative officer Patrick Kiongo met the saccos and heard their complains and promised to resolve the matter. Edited by Henry Makori
