Former President Daniel arap Moi did great things for this country. He was a champion of education, for instance. Having been a great hero and leader, Mzee Moi bequeathed to Kenyans his little giant, Gideon, who is also the Kanu chairman. Gideon has shown great potential to be a leader. He has shown he is ready to take over the leadership mantle. Like his late father, Gideon is a gentleman who has been nurtured to understand where to take this country in the next generation. The Baringo senator is now ready to take over the leadership of this country and will stop at nothing in appealing to all Kenyans to make him the country's next chief executive. I want to state categorically that Gideon is walking in his father's footsteps and has huge potential to become President. Leadership is a calling from God to serve humanity with honour and dignity. A leader must be just, fair and have integrity. They should not be greedy and a sycophant. Gideon's personality is unmatched; he is humble and noble.Â Gideon is simple and approachable. He means well for this country. Once he becomes president we can rest assured that the future of the next generation will be in safe hands. Those who have announced that they want to lead this country don't have the virtues to lead like Gideon's. This is the time to give Gideon an opportunity to serve Kenyans with dignity and servant leadership. Gideon will be ready to talk to leaders from across the political divide and build an unbeatable force for 2022. In the next election, Kenyans will have an opportunity to choose a leader who is ready to serve them fairly. That leader will be none other than Gideon. The Ainabkoi MP spoke to the Star.
