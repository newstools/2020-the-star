One of the trucks was a petrol tanker and the other three trucks were carrying goods to Uganda and other Great Lakes Region. Eyewitnesses said the accident that occurred shorty after 11.30 pm happened when the diesel tanker and one of the trucks tried to overlap to avoid a traffic snarl up that currently stretches over 15 kilometres. Teso North police chief Wilson Muraya said the fuel tanker lost control before overturning in the middle of the road and exploded on impact. The fire spread to the other trucks carrying goods. Police pulled out the body from the wreckage of the fuel tanker. The injured truck drivers and their turn boys are currently receiving treatment at the Kocholya Level Four Hospital. The incident came on the same day that another fuel tank lost control and rolled at Ikapolok area along the Malaba-Bungoma Highway.
