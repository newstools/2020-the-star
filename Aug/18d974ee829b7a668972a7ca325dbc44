St. Anthony’s Kitale alumnus Marselius Ingotsi is among the four players off-loaded by Kenyan Premier League side Posta Rangers in a clean-up exercise aimed at bolstering the squad ahead of the new season. Ingotsi said he was released alongside Brian Osumba, Peter Oyier and Danson Kago last week. He said he received a call from team manager John Terry summoning him to appear at the club’s office. “I was there on Monday last week as instructed and when I got there he communicated the decision while assuring me I would continue earning my salary up to December this year,” says Ingotsi. Born 26 years ago in Kitale, the forward joined the mailmen in 2017 after an impressive season with traditional KPL giants AFC Leopards. He had been promoted to the senior squad at the Den after a successful stint in the youth team, where he had sharpened his claws under the watchful eye of former Kenyan international and AFC Leopards striker Boniface Ambani. Ingotsi’s successful journey in football began in 2007 when he was selected to be part of the squad that represented Kitale during the primary school ball games in Kericho, where they were bundled out in the semifinals. Later in 2012, he won the national trophy with St. Anthony’s during the Kenya Secondary School Games held at the coast after defeating Nairobi representatives Upper Hill School 2-0. He was part of the Leopards’ squad that demolished Wazito FC 7-0 at the Nyayo Stadium on August 17, 2017 during the GOtv Shield semis in a game he bagged a brace. Ingotsi who says he would one day wish to feature for Zesco United in the Zambian Super League says he hopes to find a new home soon and he is now open to talks. Ingotsi said he has always drawn a lot of inspiration from Kakamega Homeboyz striker Allan Wanga.
