Nairobi’s Mlango Kubwa MCA Patriciah Mutheu has recorded a statement and acquired a P3 form in a bid to have the officers who clobbered her arrested. The Jubilee MCA was assaulted last week on Tuesday by four police officers. The chaos was witnessed when a heavy contingent of police arrived at the County Assembly and barred MCAs who wanted to serve Speaker Beatrice Elachi with a notice of impeachment. The MCAs had also gone to serve Elachi with a court order suspending the appointment Edward Gichana as the clerk of the assembly. They were dispersed by police officers who lobbed teargas canisters at them. Photos and videos of police beating and dragging Mutheu on the floor went viral with Kenyans condemning the brutality. Speaking at Central Police Station on Monday, Mutheu’s lawyer Cliff Ombeta said the P3 form was vital for the investigation process. “We managed to get the medical documents and now we came to record the statement and fill the P3 form. In the absence of a filled P3 form, they will not have the basis to proceed with the matter,” he said. “ But since we have acquired them today, then other things can follow,” Ombeta added. The lawyer also said the DCI was handling his client’s case and she was hopeful that justice will prevail. Mutheu was admitted at the Nairobi Women’s Hospital, Hurlingham for a day. Following the incident last week, the Independent Policing Oversight Authority and the Directorate of Criminal Investigations said they are pursuing the matter. IPOA Chairperson Anne Makori had said the authority has contacted some of the people who were present during the chaos that unfolded at the County Assembly of Nairobi.
