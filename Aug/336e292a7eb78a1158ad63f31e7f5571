Busia government has started a housing inventory ahead of the planned rehabilitation of dilapidated units in a bid to attract more tenants and increase revenue. The month-long exercise which will be undertaken across the seven subcounties aims at establishing the number of houses and the extent of renovations required for the county houses. Lands and Housing chief officer Teresia Mbingi on Thursday said the houses were handed to the county by the national government but were yet to be improved for occupancy. “If we can rehabilitate these houses and have individuals stay in them, then we can boost our revenue through rent. There are some that are being occupied illegally by residents who are not employees of the county government,” Mbingi said. She said her department has also noticed availability of county buildings at subcounty level that are not in use, yet officials are congested at the headquarters in Busia, with some lacking working space. “Officials who are not required at the county headquarters will be housed at the subcounty level to reduce congestion. We have already visited Amagoro in Teso North subcounty and I am pleased to announce that we have some space at the now-defunct local authority offices now under Malaba Municipality,” she said. Some of the officers targeted to occupy the space include county revenue officers. She added that her department will also identify all county parcel for fencing to prevent encroachment and grabbing. “We need to secure our parcels of land by fencing or leasing to people for revenue generation. We are considering fencing off the trailer park land in Matayos and Teso North subcounties respectively, the Busia County stadium and the land donated for the construction of courts in Teso North,” Mbingi said.
