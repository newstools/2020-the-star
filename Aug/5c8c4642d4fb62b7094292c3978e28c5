A scuffle ensued at the site of the the Likoni suspension bridge on Wednesday after a Chinese contractor blocked Transport CAS Wavinya Ndeti from leaving the construction site. The Chinese contractor demanded to know who Ndeti was and why he was not informed prior to the visit. At first, journalists were blocked at the gate from accessing the site. It took the intervention of Mvita Deputy County Commissioner Charles Monari to allow journalists at the site. After the brief tour, the Chinese national stood guard at the gate, blocking the delegation from leaving. "I'm the Chief Engineer of the project. Why was I not informed of this visit," he demanded. Monari tried to explain, but the Chinese engineer could not buy the explanation. The Mvita DCC then shoved him away. Ndeti said she is a Kenyan government official and has a right to tour any project. "I'm Kenyan. A minister in this government. I can walk into any project. What are they hiding?," she said. While leaving the site, some suppliers had camped outside, demanding for pay. One of the suppliers said he had supplied boulders, but he has not been paid. Another supplier, who brought bulldozer at the site three weeks ago, has not been paid also. The project, which was to be launched in December, is said to have stalled. Photos by Charles Mghenyi
