A case in which a woman is accused of stealing over Sh 200,000 from a former Miss world India will proceed on November 3. Chief magistrate Abdulkadir Lorot gave the direction after the case failed to proceed to hearing as scheduled. But the Magistrate advised that the defense be supplied with the witness statements before the said date. The Indian miss world Hyden Diana appeared alongside her lawyer Cecil Miller on Thursday afternoon. The accused, Ashpal Ghir was charged for stealing a debit card and Sh 209,828. According to the police report, Diana looked for her debit card on April 24, 2020 and found it missing. She became suspicious and requested for bank statements, which indicated there were six ATM transactions made on her account without her consent. Ghir, however, denied the charges and was released on Sh200,000 bond with a surety of Sh70,000 bail. The Magistrate directed the case to be heard on November 24.
