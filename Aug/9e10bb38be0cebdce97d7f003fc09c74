Alex Magelo has withdrawn from the race to succeed Beatrice Elachi as the speaker and has instead thrown his support behind Jubilee Party's candidate - former Makadara MP Benson Mutura. Magelo, a former assembly speaker, told the Star on Thursday he decided to withdraw for the sake of unity. “ I have withdrawn myself from the election. I also have a new job that was assigned by His Excellency the President,” he said. “I’m in support of the Jubilee’s candidate and have confidence in him and his ability to lead the assembly." Magelo was last week appointed as a member of the Board of the Kenya Leather Development Council. Earlier, Jubilee secretary general Raphael Tuju announced it had endorsed Mutura as its preferred candidate. Magelo was among seven candidates shortlisted for the position of Nairobi Speaker. The post fell vacant after Elachi resigned on Tuesday citing life threatening incidences among other issues. The others were Abdi Ali Abdi,  Odingo Odhiambo Washington, Mike Obonyo Guoro, Allan Chacha Mang’era, Kennedy Okeyo Ng’ondi. MCAs will on Friday elect the new speaker . Elachi ended her term as first woman speaker of the capital's assembly, closing a chaotic chapter marred by supremacy battles with suspended clerk Jacob Ngwele and Governor Mike Sonko. Acting clerk Pauline Akuku announced the vacancy in the office of speaker and asked eligible persons to submit applications to her office. As Per Standing Order 7, the election of the speaker shall be by secret ballot. Deputy Speaker and Ruai MCA John Kamangu is holding the seat on a temporary basis until the election of a new speaker. He is also the chair of the Liaison Committee. On March 22, 2013, Magelo, a former long-serving councillor was elected as the first Nairobi County Assembly Speaker, garnering 43 votes against Paul Mutungi’s 42. The assembly speaker earns a gross salary of Sh600,000 and Sh2.2 million medical cover (Sh2 million for inpatient and Sh200,000 outpatient).
