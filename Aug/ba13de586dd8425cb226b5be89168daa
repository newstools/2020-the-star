Former Churchill Show comedian George Njoroge, alias Njoro, will be going for therapy for three months after his battle with depression. “It’s about time. Depression is real, guys. It kills you inside and without knowing it, you lose yourself, the people you love, friends and so many other things," he said. "It makes you become very useless and life lacks meaning. I am there but I thank God, He’s taking me out of it." Njoro let his fans know that every Saturday for the next 12 weeks, he will update them on how his therapy is going. "No matter how good a car is, without an engine hakuna gari. I believe I’m gonna beat this and you’ll see me very very soon after I’m done with the treatment," he said. "Thank you Samchi group of companies CEO Esther Muchemi, God bless you. Churchill, I want to thank you for the greatest opportunity that you gave me and to everyone who believed in me, I’m so grateful." He asked his fans to support him in prayers. "I’ll take any prayer you’ll send my way and financial support to 0746 426336. It will go a long way! I have faith that this mountain shall move out of my way by God’s grace and your support.”
