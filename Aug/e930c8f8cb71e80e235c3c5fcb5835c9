 Cane farmers allied to Sony Sugar Company have backed the leasing of the state miller instead of having it privatised. Through the Kenya Federation of Sugarcane Farmers, they declared their support for the government's plan to lease the miller. The federation's secretary for Awendo branch Argwengs Adongo said on Thursday that they will only support leasing and not privatisation. “We support leasing because we fear through privatization one family may take over sugar cane business in the region and affect prices,” Adongo said after a meeting in Awendo town. He said once the leasing takes effect, farmers will demand public participation and transparency in the processes to create better laws to streamline the industry. “We want the leasing period to be at least ten years but not more than 15 years. At the same time, all the debts the company owes to farmers must be paid before the leasing happens,” Adongo said. Farmer Andrew Odhiambo said they would prefer a foreign investor for the leasing. “As farmers, we highly prefer international investors against the local ones. With the collapse of Sony Sugar, we have been frustrated by two regional millers which we fear will get worse when they are involved in the lease,” Odhiambo said. He added, “Farmers and employees have been facing challenges that include underpayment, sugarcane poaching which are unfair trading practices of some of the companies and major sugar importers who are repackaging and rebranding sugar produced locally.”  Edited by P.O
