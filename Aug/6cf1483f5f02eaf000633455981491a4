The Education ministry has elevated the Moiben Teachers Training College to a technical college opening next year. The college has traditionally been training secondary school teachers in the sciences. Revamping it to a technical college aims to address the skills gap among the youth and the transition gap from secondary school to institutions of higher learning. Education Chief Administrative Secretary Zack Kinuthia said on Friday top officials in the ministry have agreed to promote the institution to a technical training institute beginning next year. It has been a science teachers' training college for secondary schools but after much negotiation, it was agreed with the Department for Basic Education to hand it over to the Department for Vocational and Technical Training. "We can use it to train our trainers and be a model of a Technical Training College,” Kinuthia said. While inspecting the institution, the CAS said renovations were underway and the college would serve Western, Rift and North Eastern regions. “We think with a few refurbishments and uplifting, the institute should be able to take off as a trainer’s college," he said. At the same time, Kinuthia announced Eldoret National Polytechnic and the Rift Valley Technical Training Institute were ready to reopen after meeting the Health ministry's Covid-19 prevention protocols. “The two can resume under the circumstances they have set and this is what we want other institutions to do ahead of the January reopening," the CAS said. Kinuthia said the government is working with all learning institutions across the country to ensure they are set to reopen by expanding infrastructure and putting necessary health requirements in place. The government in March shut down all learning institutions to curb the spread of the coronavirus. (Edited by V. Graham)
