Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has welcomed the move taken by Jubilee Party to endorse former Makadara MP Benson Mutura to fill the vacant speaker’s seat in the assembly. Sonko’s remarks come after JP secretary general Rafael Tuju announced that the party’s MCAs will support Mutura as the next speaker. The seat was left vacant following the resignation of Beatrice Elachi on Tuesday after serving for almost three years. Through his Twitter page, Sonko said on Thursday that Makadara Constituency is again about to fill one of the key offices in the city. The governor comes from the same constituency, where two mayors came from in the former administration before the 2010 Constitution was adopted. Mutura is among the six candidates shortlisted for the seat by the acting clerk Pauline Akuku. Other candidates are Abdi Ali Abdi, Odingo Odhiambo Washington, Mike Obonyo Guoro, Allan Chacha Mang’era and Kennedy Okeyo Ng’ondi. Former Nairobi Assembly County Speaker Alex Magelo who had shown interest in the seat withdrew in support of Mutura. Tuju confirmed that after consultations it was agreed that Mutura was the party's candidate. “We have had serious confrontations among the members of the county assembly and the leadership of Nairobi. I’m aware there are five or six people who have shown interest in the contest for the seat which became vacant,” he said.
