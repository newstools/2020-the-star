Kenyans have been warned against self-medicating and stockpiling dexamethasone or any other medicine suggested to be a cure for Covid-19. The Pharmacy and Poisons Board has warned that the use of dexamethasone in the management of Covid-19 is strictly for patients who are hospitalised with acute respiratory distress and on respiratory support. “Though some evidence has shown that dexamethasone can reduce the amount of time patients are on ventilators and as well as mortality rates associated with the pandemic, this is yet to be peer reviewed,” CEO Fred Siyoi said in a statement. “Therefore, the board prohibits all pharmacies and chemists from dispensing the drug without a valid prescription.” The drug is used in the treatment of asthma, a number of skin diseases, arthritis, immune system disorders, chronic obstructive lung disease, bowel disorders and certain cancers. It is taken orally. The dosage and length of treatment are based on an individual's medical condition and response to therapy. Initial clinical trials in the United Kingdom show that the drug can be lifesaving for patients who are critically ill with Covid-19. For patients on ventilators, the treatment was shown to reduce mortality by about one third, and for patients requiring only oxygen, mortality was cut by about one fifth, according to preliminary findings shared by the World Health Organization. However, the benefit was only seen in patients critically ill with the virus, and was not observed in patients with a mild disease. Edited by Josephine M. Mayuya
