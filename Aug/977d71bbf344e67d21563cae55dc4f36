Kimilili MP Didmus Barasa was on Tuesday arraigned before a Kajiado court and charged with selling a matatu with an outstanding loan to a businessman. It is alleged that on March 17, 2017 at Kitengela, Barasa, being the owner of Toyota Hiace KBX 734E took out a loan on the vehicle with intent to defraud without the consent of Uwezo Microfinance Bank, which provided the funds. Through his lawyer John Khaminwa, Barasa asked the court to release him on reasonable bail terms, arguing that he is an MP and will adhere to all conditions given by the court. He was released on a Sh50,000 cash bail and the case will be heard on November 27. Last month, Barasa had moved to court in a bid to stop his arrest and Judge Luka Kimaru barred the police from arresting him, but directed him to appear in Kajiado to take plea. The MP had claimed that he was being harassed by the police over a civil matter that had now turned criminal, claiming that his woes were because he supported Deputy President William Ruto.
