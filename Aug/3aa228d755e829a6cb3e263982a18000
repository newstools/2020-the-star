Kenya Ni Yetu Initiative will have a virtual music concert to celebrate the spirit of Kenya on August 29. The initiative will bring to stage the best the Kenyan music industry has to offer. Among them is Mugithi maestro Samido. Speaking about his experience on The Kenya Ni Yetu set and what he hopes the audience will experience from the concert, Samido told Word Is it was an amazing experience. "I hope the audience will get to experience a blend of what is and what the future holds," he said. Samido says the corona pandemic has affected the industry in many ways. "Previously our fans supported us by attending our shows, which thrived on crowds, but now our music is only available on online platforms, which a big number of our audience hasnâ€™t embraced much," he said. Samido has since started doing live performances on his social media platforms and producing more music to keep his audience entertained on his YouTube channel. The highlight for Samido during this pandemic is that he has gotten to meet music legends and perform in major platforms like Trace music. "My lesson is that you can never invest enough for a rainy day," he said. The virtual concert aims to uplift the spirits of Kenyans and unify communities across the country at this time of social separation and anxiety. "Live music has come to be accepted a big deal in this country and is the way to go for any serious artiste since it is accepted by all audiences," he said. The inaugural and official launch of these productions will be aired on a digital platform to reach the huge masses that have access to a phone with Internet connectivity.
