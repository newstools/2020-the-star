ODM leader Raila Odinga has asked politicians and leaders to protect the youth against violence and discrimination. Raila who was commemorating the international youth day said this via Twitter on Wednesday. "On this Youth Day, I appeal to fellow parents, guardians and leaders to do everything to protect young people from violence and discrimination," he said. "Let’s give them reason to believe in Kenya and offer our shoulders to the ambitious and restless who hold dreams and are raring to go." Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka encouraged Kenya's youth to continue lending their voices and boldly participate towards renewed local and global action that will progress humanity to a much better and sustainable world. The International Youth Day gives an opportunity to celebrate and mainstream young peoples’ voices, actions and initiatives, as well as their meaningful, universal and equitable engagement. The commemoration will take the form of a podcast-style discussion that is hosted by youth for youth, together with independently organised commemorations around the world that recognise the importance of youth participation in political, economic and social life and processes. The theme of International Youth Day 2020 is “Youth Engagement for Global Action”. This seeks to highlight the ways in which the engagement of young people at the local, national and global levels is enriching national and multilateral institutions and processes. "...as well as draw lessons on how their representation and engagement in formal institutional politics can be significantly enhanced," UN said.
