Kenyans will on Saturday be treated to the biggest virtual concert, 'Kenya Ni Yetu Live', headlined by the hottest music stars the country has to offer. Speaking about his involvement in the project, country music singer Sir Elvis said he is stunned because the concert is uniting Kenyans. "I have met the biggest artistes Kenya has produced. The fact that we are coming together to make sure the country stays united is an exciting thing for me," he said. "I am very happy to be part of this group that headlined the Kenya Ni Yetu Live concert." Asked how music is being consumed and how he is interacting with his fans during the pandemic, Sir Elvis said they have had to adjust because of social distancing and isolation. "We are doing a lot of stuff online. The online platform has come in handy as it ensures people still get entertained without having to hold big concerts," he said. "So I have been doing short videos online. My typical day right now is staying at home unless something really warrants my attention." The event is sponsored by Stanbic Bank and powered by Media Owners Association of Kenya. Kenya Ni Yetu is billed to the biggest live show since the coronavirus pandemic hit the country. Some 30 artistes will be performing. The show will be broadcast in all major TV stations, including Kiss TV, Citizen TV, NTV, KTN, K24, Switch TV, Kass TV, Family TV and Three Stones Media. It will also be aired on all the top radio stations in Kenya, including Kiss FM, Classic FM, Radio Jambo, East FM, HomeBoyz, SMooth FM, Capital FM and Hot 96. The concert will also be streamed live on www.yetulive.com.
