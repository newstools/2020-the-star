Residents of Embu town have accused police of failure to take action on a group of youths conning people by selling them fake phones and other items. The residents said about 20 men and women move around in a seven-seater white van claiming they are selling items including smartphones at half price and that they are of the highest quality. When buyers use the phones they are shocked to find them lacking most features, including malfunctioning batteries and lower storage capacity than indicated. The town dwellers said the team of alleged tricksters sold an old man a tablet at Sh9,000 whose normal price they claimed was Sh30,000, but on trying to use it the buyer found many shortcomings. The team allegedly does not issue receipts to the customers, thus one is not able to pursue them in case an item malfunctions. Residents expressed anger that they had reported the alleged conmen to the Embu police station several times but no action had been taken. They said those who are apprehended are released without being charged. The residents threatened to take the law into their hands and deal with the sellers if police failed to arrest them. Embu West subcounty police commander Charles Kinyua said he would pursue the issue and ensure the alleged conmen are arrested. He asked those who had been conned to report to him personally. Kinyua said the alleged conmen could only be dealt with under the law if the complainants had evidence. He asked the Embu county government to screen the people it issues with licenses to carry out any type of business, saying some of the traders could be of questionable character.
