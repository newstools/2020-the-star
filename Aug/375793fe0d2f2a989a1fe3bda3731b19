Chelsea have signed England left-back Ben Chilwell from Leicester on a five-year deal for £45m. Chilwell is Chelsea's third addition of the summer after the arrivals of winger Hakim Ziyech, 27, from Ajax and striker Timo Werner, 24, from RB Leipzig. The defender, 23, is a Leicester academy product who made his debut for the club in 2015, and had a contract with the Foxes until 2024. He missed the final five matches of the 2019-20 season with a foot injury. Chelsea took fourth place and a Champions League place at the expense of Leicester on the final day of the Premier League season in July. "I'm looking forward to being a part of this young, dynamic squad led by Frank Lampard as we challenge for honours next season," said Chilwell, who has 11 England caps. "He [Lampard] does play the younger players if they are good enough and just from speaking to him, I'm really excited to be here. I think the way the gaffer sets his teams up suits my game perfectly." Chilwell made a total of 123 appearances for Leicester and scored four goals, three of them coming in the Premier League last season. Chelsea director Marina Granovskaia added: "We are confident Ben will adapt very quickly to being a Chelsea player and with the fixture programme for 2020-21 especially busy, he is a fantastic addition to the squad needed to challenge for honours."
