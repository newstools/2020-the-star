A man charged with using a panga to rob of a businessman and a woman of their money and mobile phones has denied the charges. Jared Angachi Omusinde was released on bond  by Kibera chief magistrate Joyce Gandani after he pleaded not guilty and said his twin brother fixed him up. “My brother fixed me, I never committed the offence,” he said. The charge sheet says he committed the offence on August 4 in Kabete market in Westlands within Nairobi. Omusinde is accused that he robbed Dennis Ochieng of a mobile phone worth Sh3,500 and Sh4,500 in cash. He was also charged with robbing Evelyn Mokeira of a Sh12,000 mobile phone at the same place and date. He faced another count of handling stolen goods, which he denied saying he bought them. He was freed on a Sh 500, 000 bond. The magistrate directed the case to  be mentioned on August 20.
