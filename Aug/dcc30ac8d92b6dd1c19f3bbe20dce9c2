A woman has denied scalding her eight-year-old niece for spending Sh50 on chips without her consent. “It was just bad luck,” Rebecca Kwamboka told Kibera chief magistrate Joyce Gandani on Monday. The charge sheet showed that Kwamboka committed the offence on July 23 at Fuata Nyayo slums in Industrial Area. The police report said the child had been left in the house without food and she decided to take the money and buy chips from a kiosk a few metres away. Kwamboka returned home in the afternoon and found the money missing. She hurled insults at the child before boiling water and allegedly splashing it on her. The girl was scalded on the face, shoulders, chest and hands. The police report said Kwamboka locked the child in the house the following day and went to work. A neighbour, who had heard the commotion and cries reported the incident to a Nyumba Kumi official who broke into the house and found the child writhing in pain. He took her to hospital. Kwamboka was freed on Sh100,000 bond with a surety in similar amount or Sh50,000 bail. The case will be mentioned on August 18.  - mwaniki fm
