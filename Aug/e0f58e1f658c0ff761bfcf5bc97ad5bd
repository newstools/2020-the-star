Kemsa has turned into a political football with allegations and counter-allegations of corruption and cover-up. The Kenya Medical Supplies Agency procures medical commodities for 371 hospitals and 4,415 rural health facilities. In July the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission raided Kemsa over the acquisition of a Sh3.2 billion warehouse. But the present crisis has erupted over the emergency acquisition of PPE at the start of the Covid crisis. Although this only represents Sh2.3 billion of the Sh23 billion allocated to Covid, it led to the suspension of the CEO in mid-August. Raila Odinga has come under fire from his own ODM party for saying that it is important not to jump to conclusions and to determine the extent of any fraud. In today's highly charged political atmosphere, people have stopped trying to find compromise solutions to contentious issues, such as the revenue allocation formula. Similarly, Kemsa provides medical supplies to all Kenyans so it important that this matter is resolved objectively without political grandstanding. If there has been corruption, heads must roll. But firstly, the Auditor-General should provide us with a definitive report with what has actually gone wrong at Kemsa. Quote of the day: "A wise man proportions his belief to the evidence."
