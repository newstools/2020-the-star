The Inspector-General of police Hillary Mutyambai has warned members of the public against engaging in the demonstration during this time of the pandemic. Mutyambai said on Monday while engaging with Kenyans on Twitter that MoH's guidelines to prevent further spread of the virus must be adhered to. The IG said that whereas the right to demonstrate is legal, the current circumstances do not allow it. During the session, members of the public demanded to know why the police arrested some activists demonstrating over the missing Covid-19 donations. Three human rights activists were arrested on Friday as they tried to pressure the government to take action against people involved in the plunder of billions of shillings meant for Covid-19 pandemic. On Saturday, police fired tear gas and arrested at least 12 people among hundreds demonstrating in Nairobi. Nairobi Central OCPD Mark Wanjala said the activists were arrested because they didnâ€™t have a permit to demonstrate, thus, it was an illegal assembly. They also didn't observe social distancing to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. The demonstration continued on Monday in Nakuru and Kisumu where human rights activists demanded for arrest and prosecution of those involved in the alleged theft and loss of billions of Covid-19 funds. The demos dubbed #ArrestCovid19Thieves saw the human rights defenders sing and dance along the major streets of Kisumu as they demanded for justice.
