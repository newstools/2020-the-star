It is now evident that the County Assembly of Nairobi is under the heavy guard of police officers after the chaos was witnessed last week on Tuesday. With Speaker Beatrice Elachi having adjourned the assembly until September, the building has since been secured by the National Police Service. Elachi had said the current environment at the assembly cannot allow for operation of virtual sittings citing attempts by some MCAs and goons to disrupt the sittings. Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i and Inspector General of Police Hillary Mutyambai later  visited the County assembly following the chaos. In an attempt restore order and stability, the CS resolved a new police post will be set up at the County Assembly. The chaos saw Mlango Kubwa MCA and chairperson of the Ward Development Fund chairperson Patricia Mutheu clobbered by police who went to City Hall to quell tension. Videos and photos of the female went viral showing four uniformed police officers beating her with rungus while dragging her on the floor. The matter is currently being investigation by the Directorate of Criminal Investigations.
