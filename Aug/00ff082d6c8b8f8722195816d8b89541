Former Nairobi County Assembly Speaker Beatrice Elachi has now alleged that her life was in danger at City Hall before taking a step to resign as Speaker. Narrating her ordeal moment on Wednesday in an interview with Jeff Koinange on JKL, Elachi said that some individuals had brought acid to the assembly. “The last before I end the chapter and the book of the chronicles of City Hall, I should say there was sulfuric acid. If I was not saved on that day, today I won’t be speaking to you Jeff,” Elachi said. Elachi resigned on Tuesday morning, saying that she was moving on to a new season in her political career and journey and going back to Dagoretti North constituents. She said that the city has unresolved issues including the management of county toilets where some people within the assembly have interest in. The former speaker said Nairobi Metropolitan Service Director-General Mohamed Badi will face similar challenges in his move to remove the capital. “Thank God to the President that he realized that Nairobi is going and the best he could just do to us is bring in NMS and we must nurture it to get the transformation that we need,” Elachi said. She further said that while sitting in her office with one of the MCAs, she heard a group of people outside planning how to attack certain members. “But since we were just hearing the voices, we thank God that we could hear and just leave it to what happened. It was not an easy thing that people were just seeing,” she said. Elachi added that “Its something that we need to interrogate. I don’t think we need to go beyond in politics and have that aggressiveness of really feeling so bad that you would wish to kill.” She said that there was no any enmity between her and Governor Mike Sonko.
