We appreciate that the third generation revenue sharing formula took into consideration fundamental principles governing society. However, it is also worth noting that over-politicisation of this matter has polarised the country. This is unwarranted, especially as we are faced with a global pandemic that requires concerted effort by all and sundry. Some of the recommendations considered in the proposed formula sought to address issues related to service delivery, balanced development, giving incentives to counties, raising capacity for counties to raise own revenue and to incentivise prudent use of public resources. It is no doubt that these objectives are key to realising meaningful development. The outcry by the 18 counties that are set to lose approximately Sh17 billion with the passing of the third basis for sharing revenue is justified, taking into consideration the fact that what units receive presently is not enough. Besides, many counties have been marginalised for decades since Independence but devolution has made their residents feel part and parcel of Kenya. For the sake of unity and progress, the third generation formula should await the passage of the Building Bridges Initiative report. The report is ready and awaiting submission to President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga. No doubt counties will receive at least 35-40 per cent of total national revenue. In effect, this will address the many concerns raised by various stakeholders. As it is now, continued discussion on this matter only leaves the country more divided. Finally, the Senate must be applauded for having exhibited an unprecedented non-partisan position during this debate. This is a clear testimony that the Senate is independent and has performed well as the Upper House, to the expectations of millions of Kenyans. A good basis for revenue sharing should purpose to promote equity. The nominated senator and member of the Speaker's panel spoke to the Star
