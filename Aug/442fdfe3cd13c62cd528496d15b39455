Healthcare workers looking after Covid-19 patients at Mama Lucy Kibaki hospital Nairobi on Friday received locally manufactured PPEs worth Sh260 million. This was courtesy of the Kenya Covid-19 Fund Board in partnership with Equity Group Foundation. The PPEs donated include disposable gowns, surgical masks, respirator masks, coveralls, nitrile gloves, head/hair covers, shoe covers and gumboots. The board's health committee chair James Mwangi said, "We believe the system gives the Covid-19 Board a transparent mechanism of ensuring proper end-to-end management of PPE provisions to our healthcare workers."
