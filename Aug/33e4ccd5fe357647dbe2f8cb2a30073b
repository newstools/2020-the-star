The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission has hinted at arresting more governors implicated in graft. CEO Twalib Mbarak said this will ensure sanity is restored at the county governments. Mbarak was speaking on Thursday during the commemoration of the Constitution's 10 years since its promulgation. He said so far three serving governors are on their radar for their involvement in the proceeds of crime. They include Nairobi's Mike Sonko, Migori's Okoth Obado and Isiolo's Mohamed Kuti. "We also have on our radar three former governors and in the coming days, we are going to arrest more. We must bring to an end a culture where these governors are running state offices with impunity," he said. Mbarak said the three former governors are Evans Kidero (Nairobi), Ferdinand Waititu (Kiambu) and Daniel Waithaka (Nyandarua). According to the CEO, the commission has been able to recover assets worth Sh20 billion. "The only disadvantage we have is the slow judicial process which takes longer. And this does not mean that EACC is the weak link to graft fight as reported in the media," he said. Mbarak said people always want to see people in court immediately and sent to prisons forgetting it is a process that takes some time. He said the commission has about 800 cases involving serving and former state officers. Mbarak said the commission however lacks course mechanisms to enforce compliance on chapter 6.
