 Kakamega traders have moved to court seeking an order to stop further demolitions of their stalls by the county government. Through lawyer Ken Echesa, the small-scale traders on Friday filed a petition in the High Court under a certificate of urgency. The 69 traders want the court to declare that demolishing their kiosks is a contravention of the Constitution and order the county government to stop the ongoing demolitions in the town. They also want the court to order the county to allow them to continue conducting their businesses in Kakamega town or in the alternative be offered a place where they can put up stalls for business. The county government has been demolishing structures along streets in the town for what it says is a beautification programme. But the traders want the court to restrain the county government from demolishing their stalls, whether in the town or in the alternative place or places that the county will provide for the traders to reconstruct their kiosks. They say the county government started demolishing kiosks within the town from January without issuing giving them notices. They argue that the county has not provided an alternative place for business. JusticeÂ  William Musyoka will give directions on the petition today. On August 8, protesting traders stoned Governor Wycliffe Oparanya's convoy in the town following night demolitions of their stalls their previous day. In a sworn affidavit, Christopher Barasa said that the county government demolished their kiosks without offering them alternative places. "We are praying that the court intervenes urgently and order the county government of Kakamega to allow us to continue trading in Kakamega town so that we are able to meet our basic needs and provide for our families," Barasa said.
