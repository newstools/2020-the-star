President Uhuru Kenyatta has extended the closure of bars and night clubs by another 30 days. In his address to the nation on Wednesday, the President said that the prohibition against the sale of alcohol by licensed hotels with residence is vacated. He also extended the 9pm to 4am curfew by another 30 days. The President has also directed the Ministry of Health to coordinate with the Bar Owners Association to develop self-regulating mechanisms for clients before resumption. Uhuru also extended the operation time for restaurants and eateries by one hour, allowing them to offer services until 8pm. The extension of closure of bars comes for the second time after giving the same directive in his last address. His remarks come as a section of bar owners were expecting to resume their businesses as cases of coronavirus reduce. The ministry of health had earlier said that some of the people going to bars to the joining points were flaunting the measures put in place to contain the virus. The president also directed the establishment of a national reference group on Covid-19. “This group should establish the Kenya Covid-19 Consortium that will allow research institutions to come together and partner with international bodies towards development and testing of the vaccine here in Kenya,” he said.
