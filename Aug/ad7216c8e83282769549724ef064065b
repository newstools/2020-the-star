National Assembly Minority Whip Junet Mohamed has told Deputy President William Ruto to stop tweeting endlessly on the alleged Covid-19 funds heist. Instead, the Suna East legislator asked Ruto to report the culprits to the investigation bodies in the country if he has evidence. “I urge you to report to DCI, EACC, and AoG, or the nearest police station. For the FIRST TIME since you were BORN you will have helped Kenya unearth one corruption scam if any,” Junet said. He was replying to a series of tweets by the DP, accusing ODM leader Raila Odinga of covering up for those behind the alleged theft at Kemsa. Ruto had said the "heist at Kemsa is a deplorable manifestation of the worst public vice that has seen the hypocritical “former” Opposition characteristically change the tune". Ruto said the current "stammering, staggering, and flip-flopping by Raila is a confirmation of thieves caught red-handed stealing from the sick, endangering the lives of the front-line workers and robbing the dying". “It is clear that you, the owners and operators of the Corruption Laundromat are working overtime in your effort to “sanitise” the Covid Billionaires,” he said. The attack on Raila comes following the statement issued by ODM on Monday, that the party will not cover anyone who will be linked to the scandal once investigations are done. Junet engaged in an exchange with Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen on Monday over the same matter. Murkomen had asked Junet to resign as he waits for his arrest once the investigations are over.
