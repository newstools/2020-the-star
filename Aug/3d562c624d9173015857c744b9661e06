Deputy President William Ruto has been told to shelve his 2022 presidential ambition and instead link up with Amani National Congress leader Musalia Mudavadi as his running mate. “A Musalia and Ruto combination as president and running mate respectively can go places in 2022 general election,” South Rift ANC organising secretary Paul Biegon said on Sunday. Biegon asked Kikuyus and Kalenjins not to field presidential candidates in 2022 and instead back Musalia. This, he told the Star in Kericho town, will end the political animosity occasioned by the dominance of the two communities. The ANC official said Ruto stood a better chance to lead the country after 10 years of Mudavadi presidency. Ruto would become Kenya's sixth president from 2032  to 2042, he said. According to Biegon, ODM leader Raila Odinga stands no chance of becoming president after fighting political wars with former presidents Daniel Moi, Mwai Kibaki and now Uhuru Kenyatta. He is also fighting Ruto and others, the ANC official said. He described Mudavadi as a symbol of peace and unity as he has "no known political enemies" like other presidential candidates who "cannot freely move from one corner of Kenya to another without being ridiculed for their past". Biegon said with 44 tribes, Kenya needs a change in leadership by having a presidential candidate who does not come from the Kikuyu or the Kalenjin communities. “Although it's one's democratic right and as per the Constitution that no one should be barred from running for the presidency his or her ethnic background notwithstanding, the Kikuyu-Kalenjin dominance of the country's top seat has to be put on hold,”  he said. Their dominance of the top job, he added, sends the wrong signals to other tribes that have produced a president in the past.  - mwaniki fm
