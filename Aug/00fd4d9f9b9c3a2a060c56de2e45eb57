Police in Naivasha are investigating an incident where a man who had been drinking in a local bar died moments after arriving home. It is suspected the man, a fisherman in Lake Naivasha, was poisoned in a drinking den in Karagita estate. Local leader Alfred Mwaniki said that minutes after arriving home on Sunday evening, the man started vomiting and was taken in an adjoining room to rest. “He, however, died. He had vomited a lot, leading to fears that he could have been poisoned in the bar where he was drinking,” he said. Naivasha police boss Samuel Waweru confirmed the incident, adding that the body had been collected and taken to the mortuary. “We are not taking anything to chance and we are waiting for a postmortem report before taking the next course of action,” he said. Meanwhile, a tilling job in Kinangop, Nyandarua county, ended tragically after a driver fell from the tractor which then ran over him. The man was pronounced dead on arrival at a health centre in Magumu area. The body was transferred to Naivasha Subcounty Hospital mortuary. The victim was allegedly drunk when the tractor hit a boulder in the farm throwing him off as a group of children who were playing around watched in horror. Following the incident, the ploughing was called off as friends moved in to console the relatives of the driver who is well known in the area. Witness Samson Wambugu said the driver had been hired by the farm owner to plough the farm for three days. He said they were attracted to the scene by screams from some youths who saw the man fell before he was crushed to death.
