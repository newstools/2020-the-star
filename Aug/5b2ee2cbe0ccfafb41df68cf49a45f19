The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission registered another big win on Monday in a tussle over illegal alienation of 53.4 acres of land in Nairobi which belongs to The Kenya Meteorological department. The commission had launched investigations following allegations that the land belonging to the meteorological department in Industrial Area, Nairobi, had been illegally issued to five companies. The land had been illegally given out by public officials who colluded with private individuals to alienate it to Beacon Towers Limited, Varun Industrial Credit Limited, Hillbrow Properties Limited, Pamba Properties Limited and Brentwood Traders Limited. But in a consolidated judgement delivered on Monday by Justice Elijah Obaga, it was clear that the land had been awarded illegally. The judge agreed with the evidence tabled by EACC and cancelled the five titles. Obaga also found that the land which had been grabbed is located in Industrial Area, off- Mombasa Road and behind Panari Hotel. The commission was represented by lawyer Ben Murei while Walter Amoko represented the five companies. In June, EACC registered another win after its intervention to stop the execution of an ‘illegal’ multimillion-shilling contract for the supply of school equipment which saved the taxpayer Sh150 million. The commission won an appeal challenging the award of the cash by a lower court to Vulcan Lab Equipment Limited. Vulcan had moved to the High Court challenging an order obtained by the commission, freezing the payments by School Equipment Production Unit (SEPU).
