Kwale county has recorded 11 new cases of Covid-19 infection two weeks after 139 coronavirus patients were treated and released. Governor Salim Mvurya said the rise of the latest infection might have been caused by reluctance to follow public health directives.  “It is a great sadness that some people have completely ignored precautions and prevention measures against the disease,” he said. The governor said even though the majority of the new cases involve non-citizens, the disease is already circulating among the locals at community levels. He said over 30 cases are infections involving locals in Kwale. "Most positive patients come from outside our borders but if we had some linking directly to the society, it is evident the virus is already here and living with us," he said. By Tuesday, the nation had recorded 23,202 cases, 9,327 recoveries and lost 388 lives as a result of the virus. Mvurya warned of more cases if the residents take the matter lightly. He advised them to observe every rule imposed by the government to combat the virus. He said most victims are asymptomatic but not guaranteed to be immune. Mvurya also said the nine patients who were under home-based care had successfully recovered. In total, Kwale has recorded over 150 coronavirus cases since the pandemic started, he said. Health CAS Mercy Mwangangi last month cautioned Kwale residents against congregating and chewing khat in public places. She warned of severe community infection if the residents don't take the responsibility of protecting themselves. "We must jealously safeguard ourselves against the virus and avoid unnecessary barazas," Mwangangi said. Edited by R.Wamochie
