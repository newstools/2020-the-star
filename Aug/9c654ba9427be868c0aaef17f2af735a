Trade CAS Lawrence Karanja has decried grabbing of most public jua kali land countrywide. Karanja said many parcels all over the country have been grabbed by dishonest private developers leaving many youths who use such land for their benefit to suffer. He called on jua kali artisans to defend such land. Speaking in Embu on Thursday, he told Jua Kali artisans in Embu to be wary of individuals who may be after their working spaces noting that so far, the land in the county is intact. The CAS further said the government has set aside Sh650 million to facilitate entrepreneurs in the informal sector. The funds will be given out in the form of loans to entrepreneurs in the sector at low interests for startups and other businesses. During an inspection tour of the industry in Embu, Karanja said the loans will have no collateral to allow many to borrow to boost their businesses. He urged the artisans to direct the money to the business indicated in their proposals. The CAS said the national government will continue supporting small and medium enterprises, which are crucial to the economy of the nation. He further promised that the ministry is ready to train artisans from Embu citing that already, three have been trained at Kariobangi Centre of Excellence. The ministry will supply vehicle spraying, wreath and welding machines for Embu town Jua Kali. However, he advised the artisans to organise themselves into formal groups through which they will plan how the machines will be used for the benefit of all. Trade executive Joan Mwende hailed the state for its support of the sector, adding that the county government will continue working closely with the central government to ensure the local artisans benefit from their talent.
