Transport and Infrastructure PS Paul Maringa has been order to pay businessman Mike Kamau more than Sh859 million awarded for illegal demolition of his house. Justice John Mativo has cited Maringa in contempt for failing to pay Kamau the money even after he issued orders for payment early this year. He ordered Maringa pay Kamau within 90 days or risk civil jail for not more than six months. The Environment Court awarded Kamau Sh711 million for illegal demolition of his house on  L.R. No. 15045/4.  It was demolished in 2010 in Spring Valley. The circumstances were not stated in the contempt ruling. In April this year, judge Mativo ruled Kamau should be paid Sh847,277,351 and another Sh12,259,342.73, totalling Sh859,536,694.63 but nothing was paid. Kamau filed another application for contempt against the AG. The judge ruled the AG was not in contempt, rather, the PS was in contempt as the accounting officer in the ministry. “That the Principal Secretary, Ministry of Transport, Infrastructure, Housing and  Urban Development, Prof Arch Paul M. Maringa, is in contempt of this court’s orders issued on April 8, 2020,” the court ruled. “Court orders must be obeyed at all times in order to maintain the Rule of Law and good order. This of course means that the authority and dignity of our courts must be upheld at all times and this differentiates civilised societies from those applying the law of the jungle,” the court ruled. The judge ruled, however, that an appeal is not a stay of execution, unless the court orders so. Kamau said the ministry had budgeted the money and allocated it for payment of his award. He said it has remained unpaid for almost two years without sufficient cause and without any order for stay. (Edited by V. Graham)
