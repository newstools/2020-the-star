Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko and Nairobi Metropolitan Service Director General Mohammed Badi have ended their feud and vowed to work together for the development of Nairobi. Sonko on Wednesday apologised to Badi and said the two had initiated a new working relationship after meeting President Uhuru Kenyatta. The two spoke after a function at KICC officiated by Uhuru who was handing over title deeds to Nairobi residents. Sonko said he was been misled by politicians who had fuelled 'negative perceptions' about the NMS boss. "Maneno yote mabaya nimeongea kwa ndugu yangi Badi namwambia pole . Wanasiasa waliingilia katikati, siasa  mbaya," Sonko said. "Haja yetu sisi ni maendeleo and going forward we will work together to serve Nairobi people." Badi said he had put behind the differences that had transpired between him and the governor and assured Sonko of a good working relationship. "There is no hate between us and as you have heard our interest is to deliver services to the people of Nairobi  and bring development," Badi said. The NMS boss affirmed that he will be seen more often with Sonko and the two will together launch the Michuki Park on Friday . "Moving forward  we will be on the ground together and that is what is expected of us to bring development in Nairobi," he said. The end of the fued between the two leaders in charge of the capital comes just a day after Beatrice Elachi resigned from her position as Nairobi County Assembly Speaker Elachi on Tuesday said she was moving on to a new season in her her political career and journey and going back to Dagoretti North constituents.
