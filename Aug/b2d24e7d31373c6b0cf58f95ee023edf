The Old School Car Owners' Association team hosted a fun drive for vintage cars on Sunday from Kiambu town to Limuru town using the Nazareth route. The purpose was for members to meet, interact and network. In attendance were members of the organisation and Bonfire Adventures CEO Simon Kabu, who came with his son to the event. "I am happy to be part of this drive. I personally took it as a fun drive for my son and I. During the drive I have been able to have a boys' talk with my son," Kabu said.
