Kakamega Senator Cleophas Malala has said he feared for his life following his arrest on Monday. "I was ambushed by almost 20 policemen... The manner in which they handled me was not humane. They disconnected power and water..." he said during an interview with Citizen TV on Tuesday night. He said the speed with which the car ferrying him to the police station was driven was scary. "They went round the city, taking me to Ngong Hills, Thika Road, Banana... they didn't talk to me, didn't tell me why they were arresting me... it was a scary moment, but I thank God he gave me the strength." Malala dismissed allegations he received money to vote for the revenue sharing formula. "The Senate is a House of dignity...I don't know of any senator who has ever received money... Receive money from who?" he said. Malala was on Tuesday morning released from police custody unconditionally after spending the night at the Mumias Police Station. He had been taken in on Monday in Nairobi and driven to Mumias by the DCI officers against the wishes of his lawyer John Khaminwa. Malala spent the night at the Mumias police station after he declined to enter the holding cells claiming he wasn't sure they had been fumigated or not. He was not booked in the Occurrence Book at the station by the officers who drive him in.
