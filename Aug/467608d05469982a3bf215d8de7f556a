Vihiga is counted among high potential counties in Western on the basis of agricultural production and rainfall patterns, although 40 per cent of the land is unproductive, Governor Ottichillo has said. He said counties with well-established agricultural activities will have more allocation from Treasury compared to others. The county should be on the Equalization Fund for marginalised counties, Ottichillo said. “The Equalization Fund is the only line that will help these counties to be on the same level as it was proposed by the Commission for Revenue Allocation,” he said. “The 40 per cent of this area is hilly and sandy which cannot support any agricultural activities." The governor said under the proposed revenue sharing formula for counties, Vihiga  will lose Sh361 million. The governor said funds should be increased to counties as proposed by the BBI and the Council of Governors and not reduced. Reduction funds to the devolved units would harm number of activities and it is unfair to do so on already budgeted funds, he said. Ottichillo said the Senate should come up with a reasonable formula that will solve the stalemate over revenue allocation. The senate is currently deliberating on the formula to ensure all counties are allocated a fair share of funds. Edited Henry Makori
