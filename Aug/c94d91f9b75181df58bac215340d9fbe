Consistency will be key if Mwamba are to scale the heights of the Kenya Cup in the years to come, head coach Kevin Wambua said yesterday. Wambua said he believes the side is on the right trajectory after qualifying for the playoffs for the past two seasons although they are yet to satisfy him. “We need to aim higher. Yes we played in the playoffs but we need to look beyond the semis and start winning trophies on a regular basis in the 15’s front,” he noted. Mwamba’s last trophy in the 15’s game was the Enteprise Cup in 2013 and Wambua said the club has had to rebuild in the last six years to be competitive. “It’s been a journey and I believe there is light at the end of the tunnel in terms of performances,” he noted. The Railway-based club have been successful in the Sevens’ version of the game but have struggled in the longer version. However, Wambua believes the tide has changed in the past two seasons, adding: “We have a good blend of young and old players and with the desire and ginger shown by them, I believe we will go far in the years to come.” Before the season was suspended, Mwamba were due to play Impala in the playoff after finishing fifth in the group phase with the winner expected to face Kabras in the semis. Wambua said he expects the core of the side that did duty last season to be intact for next season and they include Kenya Seven stars Collins Injera, Billy Odhiambo, Daniel Taabu and regulars Michael Okello, Joel Inzuga and Ronnie Omondi among others.  “It’s an exciting group of players and I am confident they will be us.” He said he is sharing videos with the team during this Covid-19 pandemic period and players have been given individual programmes which they are following.
