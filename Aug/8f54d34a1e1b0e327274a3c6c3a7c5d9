Well known football administrator Moses Adagala who is a fierce critic of the current Football Kenya Federation (FKF) administration has expressed his interest for the Kisumu County chairmanship in the forthcoming polls set for September 17, 2020. The controversial Adagala, who currently chairs KPL side Chemelil Sugar, will square it out with the outgoing FKF Nyanza North secretary Dickson Oruko. As Adagala clenches his fists for a bruising fight against Oruko who is his sole opponent, the latter who is a former National Super League side, Nairobi Stima player starts as a front runner having won elections in both the twice cancelled polls by the Sports Disputes Tribunal. Kisumu AllStars CEO Nicholas Ochieng, who lost to Oruko, will this time be contesting as Adagala’s running mate. The outgoing Nyanza North chairman and former Gor Mahia chairman George Ong’udi will not be defending the seat and has thrown his weight behind his secretary Oruko. Queerly, both Adagala and his running-mate presented their nomination papers through representatives and not in person.
