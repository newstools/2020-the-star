ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi has dismissed the 'hustler' and 'dynasty' debate, saying that someone'sÂ state should not be used as a tool for political competition. Deputy President William Ruto has in the past referred to politicians from 'dynasties' trying to block his bid to ascend to State House, saying it is not a crime for a 'hustler' like himself to rise. President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga have often been referred to as coming from 'dynasties' by virtue of their being the sons of the country's first President and Vice President respectively. However, Mudavadi said of the debate: "It's very cheap and divisive... It's like comparing between pagans and non-pagans. Poverty is not something to be proud of." "Let us debate on whether my policies are conducive to job creation or not... will they stamp out corruption or not; provide health services or not..." Speaking during an interview aired on NTV on Thursday evening, Mudavadi said poverty should never be looked at as a permanent situation. He dismissed the theory that he belongs to the dynasty group. "My father was born in Western; his father died in a loose gold mine digging... for a livelihood he was buried there. He was a peasant," Mudavadi said. "I will not fall into the trap of calling people hustlers and dynasties. I totally refuse to fall into that category..."
