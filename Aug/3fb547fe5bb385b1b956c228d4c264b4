Police will hold a suspect in the murder of an officer in Lamu for 30 more days to conclude investigations. Arafat Abdalla, 30, surrendered to police after two months of hiding as he was sought for the murder of Constable Rodgers Odhiambo in Tchundwa, Lamu East, on June 8. A Lamu court on Monday granted police their request to detain Abdalla for a month to give them time to complete their investigations. Following reports that police were looking for him, Abdalla fled into the forest where he hid for more than two months fearing for his life. On Monday, police told the Lamu magistrate Martin Wachira Abdalla had once run away from justice and is still a flight risk. The court granted their wishes to detain him but ordered that they uphold all his individual rights, including access to his lawyer, food and proper healthcare. Muslims for Human Rights on Wednesday last week presented Abdalla to Lamu East police boss Emmanuel Okanda, who assured him of his safety. Abdalla said he went into hiding because he believed the police wanted him dead over the death of their colleague. However, Okanda told residents that they have no problem with them so long as they maintain law and order. “Our main duty is to prepare evidence and take them to court,” he said. He urged the others in hiding to come out and follow Abdalla’s example. “The others who we are pursuing should not fear. We are here as law enforcers and nothing else,” Okanda said. Muhuri rapid response officer Francis Auma said fear makes many suspects go into hiding because they do not trust police officers. Odhiambo, who was attached to Tchundwa police post, was lured to his death by a phone call from a civilian friend who requested to meet him. In civilian clothes and unarmed because he was not on duty, Odhiambo ventured to the supposed meeting place just outside a house in Tchundwa village. He was then accosted by machete-wielding thugs who hacked him to death and fled. (edited by o. owino)
