ODM has clearly stipulated structures. The function of the national chair are very clear in Article 53 (71) of the party constitution. The functions of the branch chairman are very clear and so is the appointment of a disciplinary committee. If (Makadara MP George) Aladwa, the Nairobi branch chairman, wrote a letter to defy the national chairman, the question is: On what basis? Aladwa is not mandated to discipline a member or an elected leader. The branch chair is in charge of the branch committee. Issues of discipline to do with members are taken to the national chair. But this is not the first time he is writing those contradictory letters to the party. He should also be called to order. The functions of the whip in our party constitution and standing orders are also clearly outlined. I don’t need any opinion on it and I don’t want to jeopardise any arm of the party on the work it does. As a whip, I will do my part, the party chairman will do his and so will the disciplinary committee. We don’t interfere with any party organ. We must, therefore, allow the party organs do their job. My job is to pass communications of the party to the members, which I have done. It is not my job now to whip somebody to obey a party summons.  It is upon an individual member to choose to obey party summonses and be ready to face the consequences that come with a snub. That is why we are saying our party is well structured, there are no sideshows. If there are issues that go against the party, as a whip I go through the party structures at the head office under the leadership of the national chairman. This is meant to ensure discipline, sanity and cohesiveness so the party runs according to its ideals.  Nairobi Assembly Minority Whip spoke to the Star
