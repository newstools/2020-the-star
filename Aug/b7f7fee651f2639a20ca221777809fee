The national government has allocated Sh65million to instal piped water in Kieni constituency, Nyeri county. The area has been reeling from undersupply due to rationing. Water PS Joseph Irungu said Sh10 million has been disbursed to instal piped water in Naromoru town, Kieni East. The amount has been used to buy pipes and other accessories. A further Sh20 million has been given to Mwiyogo to construct a water plant in Kieni West, while Sh35 million will be used to reticulate irrigation water from Njogu-ini Gitero dam. The PS spoke in Naromoru during the launch of the laying of a pipeline that will run from a water treatment plant to the town. Kieni MP Kanini Kega said the projects will provide clean water for domestic use to Naromoru town people and irrigation in the neighbouring areas. The MP said the town has been under rationing, drawing hue and cry from residents. “By the end of the month, the issues (of water) that the Naromoru residents have been having will be addressed, and of course, we are really grateful,” he said. Kega said a proposal will be done for the sewerage system so money for its construction can be provided in the next financial year. Irungu said Naromoru town’s sewerage line is also at the design stage and the sewer line will be the next priority after the expansion of those of Nyeri and Othaya towns are completed. All three major towns in Kieni constituency (Naromoru, Chaka and Mweiga) have had no sewerage system. “But for now, our focus is going to be on Naromoru. We will be looking for funding to do the sewer line,” he said. The government has also been sinking boreholes, with the latest one being done at Naromoru Hospital to boost water supply at the facility. “The portfolio for Nyeri stands at Sh1.6 billion. We have Sh1.2 billion being used in Mathira to tap water, which will benefit the people of Mathira and Kieni constituencies,” Irungu said.
