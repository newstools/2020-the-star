The annual Rhino Charge event has been postponed to May 30, 2021. The Rhino Charge Committee in charge of the event thanked those who have already submitted funds to Rhino Ark, noting that the contributions are vital in ensuring the continuation of the valuable projects carried out by Rhino Ark. The committee said they are working behind the scenes to put precautionary measures in place and ensure the safety of participants is guaranteed when they finally roll out the event. “Over the past few months, we have been working hard to see if and how the October Rhino Charge can be run. “We have been preparing two venues for two very different and exciting Charges and we have put together various options to adapt to Covid-19 restrictions. “The health and safety of the Rhino Charge supporters has always and will always be a critical aspect of this event. “However, the impact of the pandemic continue to grow locally and globally and we feel that a cautious approach is required in order to minimise risk.” The committee said they are overwhelmed by the enthusiasm and encouragement from Rhino Charge supporters in trying to make this event happen. Rhino Ark has to date built 650 km of electric fences, protecting 80,000 families from the dangers of human-wildlife conflicts. These fences also protect critical mountain forests that are the water towers of Kenya. The organisers said they were also working to ensure they have adequate funding for the 2021 event. “We are currently working on how the 2021 event will operate with regards to entries, pledges and funds raised to date and once finalised, we will share the 2021 Rules & Regulations with the Chargers directly and on our website. Over the coming weeks, we will also be in touch with all our sponsors and partners directly to discuss opportunities for 2021.”
