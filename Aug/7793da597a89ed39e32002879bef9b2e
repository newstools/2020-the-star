The Senate on Monday night adjourned for the tenth time to allow the Special Committee formed by opposing sides to reach consensus on the Third Basis for formula allocation among counties. The 12-member committee consists of Johnson Sakaja, Kipchumba Murkomen (Elgeyo Marakwet), Mutula Kilonzo Jnr (Makueni), Susan Kihika (Nakuru), Samson Cherargei (Nandi), Moses Kajwang (Homa Bay), Ledama Ole Kina (Narok), Moses Wetang'ula (Bungoma), Anwar Loitiptip (Lamu), Stewart Madazyo (Kilifi) and Nderitu Kinyua (Laikipia). Siaya Senator James Orengo moved the motion to adjourn and it was seconded by Samuel Poghisio. Orengo had said it was possible to have a special sitting on Tuesday next week at 2.30pm. Earlier, the motion by Tharaka Nithi Senator Kithure Kindiki to adjourn the sitting until arrested senators were freed was defeated. Kindiki had moved the motion pursuant to the House Standing Orders 105, 60(h) and 1, seeking adjournment of the Senate without Notice, until the release of three senators to allow them to discharge their duties. After voting, the two parties tied on 29-29 votes, hence the adjournment motion was lost. Kakamega Senator Cleophas Malala, Bomet senator Christopher Langat and Samburu senator Steve Lelegwe were arrested on Monday. Langat was released in the evening after recording a statement in Bomet. The three are among the team opposing the Third Basis revenue sharing formula. The arrests triggered a political storm in the Senate that saw angry lawmakers rail at the state for trying to circumvent the will of the people exercising their mandate through their elected representatives. Emotions ran high during the debate with senators pointing an accusing finger at state functionaries for targeting colleagues holding divergent views. The three senators are aligned to a group christened Team Kenya which brings together marginalised and less populated counties and those standing in solidarity with them.
