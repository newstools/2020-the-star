Senate Speaker Kenneth Lusaka is upbeat that the Senate  will solve the impasse on revenue allocation in the next special sitting on Monday. Lusaka said he was optimistic the special sitting will be the final one as he was sure it will come up with the agreed formula. Speaking in Nangwe village, Bungoma, during the burial of John Mukenya, the father of Nairobi county chief officer Peter Mukenya, the speaker said the issue had dragged for so long and that it was high time they resolved it. "We will convene a special sitting, which I am sure  will be the final one on this issue as it will end the current stalemate on revenue allocation," Lusaka said. He admitted there was a problem with revenue allocation but assured that it will soon end as it must be solved before the end of next week. Lusaka said he was forced to adjourn the Tuesday sitting because the senators were not agreeing and had started engaging in harsh words. "As a referee, my work is to control but not to take sides. So when I see things are not going well I blow the whistle to end the game," he said. Lusaka, who was accompanied by Trans Nzoia Woman Representative Janet Nangabo, assured counties that they will receive their allocations once the senators agree on the formula. The speaker asked governors to utilise the money well when it will be disbursed after the stalemate. He said any governor who will engage in corruption would not be spared by the Senate if the matter is brought before it. "The senate is now exercising its powers by ensuring that there is prudent use of funds meant for devolution and its now upon the governors to take care," Lusaka said. He asked MCAs to exercise their role of oversight, warning them against going to bed with the county executive. Nangabo said the Senate should agree on a formula which favours population, not landmass. "All leaders are elected by the people, so let's consider them first because land never votes," she said.
