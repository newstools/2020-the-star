Chairman Philip Jalango wished him well on his future and thanked him for his services to the club.  “We wish him well. He is a very good player and I trust he will make an impact in Poland,” noted Jalango He said the club will bolster their roster once the transfer window is opened.  “Mwale is the only player leaving. The rest of the team will remain intact and we will look at bringing in six or seven players once the transfer window is opened by the union,” added Jalango. The core of the side that has played for the last five seasons will remain intact and will include George Nyambua, Dan Sikuta, Asman Mugerwa, Hillary Odhiambo, Brian Tanga, Felix Ayange and Nick Barasa. Kabras have strengthened their technical bench, bringing in Zimbabwean Mzingaye  Nyathi as head coach to be assisted by South African Felix Reyon and former Kenya Simbas head coach Jerome Paarwater as director of rugby at the club. Nyathi takes over from South African Henley Du Plessis who guided the team to their maiden Enterprise Cup title last season as well as the Kenya Cup final. Former international Edwin Achayo will continue with his role as coach of the youth and developmental side. Kabras topped the group phase with 74 points and were due to face the winner of the Mwamba vs Impala clash in the semis before the league was suspended due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
