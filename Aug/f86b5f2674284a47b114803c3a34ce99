The family of a police officer who collapsed and died on duty at Equity bank, Makutano, Meru, said he did not succumb to Covid-19 but a heart attack. Corporal Harrison Nkuja Gedion, 47, died while on duty on July 21 and was buried at his family farm in Athiru Gaiti in Igembe South, Meru county. Nkuja was a police officer in Meru and his sudden death caused panic and fear on among Equity Bank staff and the public. Josphat Murungi, Nkuja’s elder brother, dismissed allegations that his brother succumbed to Covid-19, adding they had endured enough stigma. “When Nkuja collapsed there were rumours in the public that he died of coronavirus disease, which is no true,” Murungi said. Murungi said his brother died of a heart attack. “We received test results showing that Nkuja did not die of coronavirus disease but a heart disease,” he said. Murungi, however, noted that the family was not aware of the heart disease until the demise of the officer. He called on residents to refrain from panicking over unsubstantiated coronavirus claims. “If Nkuja had died of coronavirus disease we could be in isolation. I am asking Meru residents and our fellows villagers to stop panicking,” he said. Nkuja collapsed in a washroom inside the bank on Tuesday, July 21, 2020. He was buried without the usual gun salute for a fallen officer. His burial was hurriedly done with only family members and uniformed police officers allowed at the grave. “Due to Covid-19 we can’t use our traditional gun salute, instead he will be led to the grave by the guard of honour,” an officer said.
