A lobby group in Kwale has warned of an increasing number of conmen in government offices. Haki Centre programmes officer Amos Mwatata said on Friday the conmen take advantage of desperate individuals trying to access government services, especially in Lands and Births registration offices. “A majority of people, especially parents who never went to school, are tricked daily while applying for birth certificates and national identity cards,” he said. He spoke in Ukunda within Msambweni subcounty. Mwatata said many people from the communities that are not fully recognised as citizens of Kenya have also fallen prey to the impostors. In getting citizenship, Mwatata advised individuals to use the correct channels. “No one should be duped to give out money outside the trusted system to get services.” He urged residents to avoid shortcuts while seeking services and to read the Constitution so they can understand their rights. A few months ago, county commissioner Karuku Ngumo put Kwale Births registration office on notice over corruption claims. Ngumo promised to take stern actions against the culprits.
