Longisa Hospital has not been closed though eight medical personnel have tested positive for Covid-19. There's no cause for alarm, the management said on Sunday. The staff members have been isolated in centres around the county and those who contacted them have been quarantined. Medical superintendent Dr Isaac Birech on Sunday dismissed as “fake” the closure reports, saying everything was under control and everyone was free to visit. In a press statement, he also denied reports of a strike among medics, saying the reports were intended to create fear among members of the public. Birech said though some staff members had contracted the virus, there was no cause for alarm. He said the premises had been fumigated and all precautions put in place to prevent spread of the virus. “Operations are going on as usual and staff are at work,” he said, emphasizing there were no plans to close the hospital. He said the misleading photos circulated on social media were taken while the hospital was being fumigated and patients had been shifted to other rooms. Tests for other staff members who contacted those who tested positive were to be conducted on Monday. “We shall continue enforcing the guidelines to ensure the situation does not escalate,” the superintendent said. The Bomet county government, meanwhile, has defended its closure of all eating establishments, including hotels, to protect the public from Covid-19. Health CEC Joseph Sitonik said only hotels that comply with all protocols and obtain Covid-free-certificates will be allowed to operate. That includes testing their staff. “If a hotel has a large number of staff we are ready to support it [financially, in testing] as a county because we want to ensure the virus does not spread further,” he said. He said some owners were yet to put in place the necessary measures ordered by the government. (Edited by V. Graham)
