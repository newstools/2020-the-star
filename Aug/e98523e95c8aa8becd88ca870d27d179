 Mathioya MP Peter Kimari has asked the government to sensitise the public about kitties and funds that are meant to empower people with disabilities so many can benefit. Kimari on Friday said most of the disabled were living in misery because they do not benefit from government incentives. He said the people no information about the National Council for Persons with Disabilities or the National Fund for The Disabled of Kenya that provide assistance including devices and services like grants to members for economic empowerment. He said he will partner with the local administrator to establish the number of people with disabilities in his constituency and ensure all are registered. He reiterated the need for the government to review the structures used to disburse funds to disabled persons to ensure no one is left out. “We need to ensure the funds set aside for disabled persons get to them to empower them and better their lives,” Kimari said. The MP spoke on Friday while issuing 65 wheelchairs and clutches in partnership with Goal Setters Foundation and Hope Africa NGO at the CDF offices in Kiria-ini. The devices, he said, will help them engage in day to day activities with ease. Kimari appealed to families to stop hiding children with disabilities, saying such actions deny them a chance to integrate into society. Many families tie up their disabled children in the house whenever they leave for work. The lawmaker urged families to care for their children, saying they needed affection just like other children without disabilities.
