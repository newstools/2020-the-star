An Embu widow whose two children drowned early this year and has a disabled child has been helped by residents to build a house. Priscilla Nduku, 55, who lives in Muthilu village in Makima ward,  Mbeere South subcounty, was delighted after residents and leaders raised funds to construct a three-bedroom house for her. On Saturday she thanked the well-wishers, saying she had been living in an old house with her children since her husband died 12 years ago. Nduku lost her two children early this year after they drowned in River Kakawa as they went home. The residents led by Mbeere South parliamentary aspirant in the last election Kamau Nyutu and MCA Philip Nzangi raised funds for construction of the house, which is nearing completion. “I was moved seeing the widow struggling to raise her children and found it necessary to help her build a better house for her children,” Nyutu said. Nyutu, who lost to Geoffrey King'ang'i, donated 32 iron sheets for roofing of the house. Nzangi lauded the community for supporting the widow during this trying time when many people are struggling with the difficulties brought about by measures put in place by the government to contain Covid-19. The ward representative appealed to members of the public to support each other. Nduku said once the house is completed she will live comfortably with her remaining children. Edited by Henry Makori
