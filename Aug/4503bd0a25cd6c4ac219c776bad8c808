A former political adviser to the Embu governor has faulted recruitment to the Kazi Mtaani programme, saying it is based on political connections. Speaking on Monday, Joshua Kanake said most of the recruits are connected toÂ politicians or national and county government officers. But Embu county commissioner Abdullahi Galgalo denied the allegations. He said due diligence was exercised to ensure every deserving youth got hired. The Sh10 billion Kazi Mtaani programme was launched in May to help jobless youth ride out the Covid-19 pandemic. It is currently in its second phase. Recruits earn Sh455 a day. Galgalo cautioned against politicising initiatives meant to raise living standards. Kanake, a former senate aspirant, said most of the hired youth are not serious with their work. They just while away the time waiting to get paid at the end of the day, he said. Kanake also said the programme might be a conduit for spreading Covid-19 as the youth crowd at one place, are not provided with sanitiser and protective equipment, while some do not wear their masks properly.
