"Those with no symptoms at all should count themselves lucky", these are the words of the Acting Secretary General of the Kenya Medical Practitoners Pharmacists and Dentists Union Chibanzi Mwachonda  after testing positive for coronavirus. Mwachonda confirmed in a statement on Friday that he was infected while dispensing his  official duties and is currently in stable condition and under self-isolation. "My family is safe, contact tracing and testing of all close contacts is ongoing," he said. As he continue to recuperate, Mwachonda shared the experience that he has gone through since he tested positive. Through his Twitter handle, Mwachonda took his time on Sunday to explain to Kenyans the reality of the virus. The waxing and waning nature of the symptoms can put one in a state of apprehension. One hour you are fine, next hour your body is acting up. But overally I am quite stable with mild symptoms. Mild symptoms. Fatigue - despite eight hours of sleep you wake up feeling heavy like you have been doing heavy work the entire night. Sore throat. The irritation makes you feel a constant tingling and burning sensation on your throat. I’m glad that is gone for now. ‪ Muscle aches. The scale is twice the pain experienced after working out. ‬In its severest form, you will be forced to lie down and do nothing till the pain medicines take effect. Cough: Infrequent,occasional and dry. Abdominal discomfort: Sudden bouts of mild abdominal pain and subsequently loose stool. The symptoms vary based on your body’s response to the disease. Supportive treatment: Paracetamol tabs,Zinc tablets, Vitamin C tablets, Azithromycin tabs. Lots of hydration.
