Water supply in parts of Nairobi will be cut off for 36 hours starting from Wednesday morning. The Nairobi City Water and Sewerage Company said the disruption follows an emergency shutdown of Ngâ€™ethu Water Treatment Plant, which is the city's main plant. "This will facilitate major repair works at Mwagu water intake damaged by the long rains, along Chania river from where we abstract raw water to Ngethu water treatment Works," NCWSC managing Director Nahason Muguna said in a statement on Tuesday. Some areas to be affected are the whole of city centre and Industrial area, University of Nairobi main campus, Coco Cola Factory, Jomo Kenyatta International Airport and Athi River EPZ. The others are areas along Mombasa road, Juja, Jogoo, Outer-ring, Kangundo, Thika and Limuru roads. Normal supply is expect by 6 pm on Thursday. "Whilst every effort will be made to restore the supply of water as soon as possible, we urge all customers in affected areas to use the available water sparingly," Muguna said. This comes barely two months after water supply was reinstated in some areas in the city following weeks of prolonged water shortages. Shortage was due to the shut down of the Sasumua Dam treatment plant for repair.
