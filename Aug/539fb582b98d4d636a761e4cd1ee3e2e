The Commission on Revenue Allocation has said it should lead discussions on proposed amendments to the third basis revenue sharing formula as a 'non-partisan' party. "The Commission acknowledges the fact that revenue allocation is a highly political process. However, the Commission is also convinced that, such a process should not be divisive," it said in a statement on Tuesday. The commission said it should be allowed to conduct public participation among stakeholders on the various amendments being proposed on the third revenue sharing basis and "develop an alternative that is acceptable to all parties and therefore unifies the country". “The current debate on how to equitably share revenues amongst the 47 counties has divided the Senate and the country along regional and party lines.” It said that there should be no vacuum in law if the senate does not reach an agreement determining the third basis for allocating revenues among counties. CRA added that the Senate has a window to use the second revenue-sharing basis to allocate money to counties for the financial year 2020/21. Senators are expected to discuss the way forward for the appropriate formula on Tuesday afternoon for the eighth time.
