 A case in which a man is charged with assaulting his seven-month pregnant wife has been adjourned to October because the defence had not be supplied with witness statement. Abdul Rezak Rehan is accused of kicking his wife Uzma Igbal on the stomach and thighs after she questioned him over text messages sent to his phone. The offence was committed on January 31 at Akila III estate within South C in Nairobi. The accused was charged before a Kibera court. On Friday, Rehan's lawyer Isaac Okinyo told court that they had not been supplied with statements and asked that the case be adjourned. "We are not ready, we ask for another date,"Okinyo told Kibera chief magistrate Abdul Lorot who initially declined the request before changing his mind. The case will be heard on October 22. According to a police report that is before Kibera senior principal magistrate Boaz Ombewa, Rehan was questioned by his wife about text messages she suspected were from another woman. He allegedly responded by assaulting her. She shouted for help and was rescued by her family and taken to hospital. Rehan denied the charge and asked to be freed on lenient bond terms. Okinyo argued that his client was a family man and a law-abiding citizen. The accused was granted a Sh50,000 bond with an alternative bail of Sh20,000.  Edited by P.O
