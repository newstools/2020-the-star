A family in Ugenya, Siaya county, is demanding justice after a man who was murdered by known people for allegedly stealing Sh52,000. Musa Otieno, 21, was beaten to death after the owner of a shop at Luhano centre accused him of theft. But his uncle Stephen Otieno said Musa was a straightforward young man who believed in hard work and had never been involved in crime. The uncle said Musa was picked up at Luhano centre by his attackers and beaten the entire day and night before he was left for dead. The following day after Otieno reported the matter, police came to their home but Musa was in a bad state and died on the way to hospital. The family said Musa's killing was orchestrated by the shop owner as the main suspect in the theft was found with Sh28,000 but was not reported to the police. They said police had taken no action to arrest Musa's killers yet they were  well known. Village elder Aduda Bob condemned the murder of the young man he said had no criminal history. “I have been a village elder in the area for long but I have never received any complaint about the deceased,” Aduda said. Benson Oduol, the business chairman of Luhano centre, condemned the killing. Human rights activists in Ugenya led by Fredrick Ojiro gave police one week to act on the matter or they will hold protests to demand justice. Ojiro said the Constitution does not allow anyone to promote lawlessness to the extent of taking away the life of someone. “Why have police not taken action or even investigated those behind the killing despite the family reporting the matter?” Ojiro said.
