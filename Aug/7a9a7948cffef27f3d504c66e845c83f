Citizen TV anchor Willis Raburu lied to his parents he was studying IT in university, yet he had taken a journalism course. The media personality joined Citizen TV seven years ago. Speaking to Jalang'o on YouTube, Willis said the first time his father congratulated him was two years after he had first done news. "He did it in a traditional way, ati, ‘Ooh, nimekuona, kumbe you know what you do? Í’m proud of you’," Willis said. After the phone call, the anchor say he cried a bit. "It meant the world to me to hear those statements from my dad. It was quite something," he said. In a past interview, Willis said his father taught him work ethics and the word of God. "He was a strict dad and still is even today. Even when I am about to do something wrong, I ask myself what he is going to say about it," he said. "I fear him so much. "He has an amazing work ethic and even to date, I meet leaders he worked with and they all say two things: 'He was strict and loved God.' And that is what I call a legacy," he said.
