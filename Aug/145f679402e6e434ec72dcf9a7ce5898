Reggae artiste Gramps Morgan of Morgan Heritage will be among artistes who will perform on during the live concert ‘Kenya Ni Yetu Live’ going down this Saturday live on all your favourite TV stations. Having been in Kenya several times, Gramps considers this his second home, and he couldn’t be happier treating Kenyans to some reggae jams. Taking to social media, Gramp said, "Kenya has been a second home to me and @morganheritage … So when I heard about the #KenyaNiYetu live concert on 29 Aug, 8pm, on www.yetulive.com by @yetulive, I knew it would be perfect." Other artistes who will be performing include Suzanna Owiyo, Sauti Sol, Country musician Sir Elvis, Sammidoh and H-art the band. The event is sponsored by Stanbic Bank and powered by Media Owners Association of Kenya. Kenya Ni Yetu Live will be aired on all major TV stations and online. The concert will also be aired on all the top radio stations in Kenya, including Kiss FM, Classic FM, Radio Jambo, East FM, HomeBoyz, Smooth FM, Capital FM and Hot 96.
