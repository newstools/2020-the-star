South African construction and building materials retailer, Builders, is set to open its first store in Nairobi this month as it expands into the East African region. The store, to be opened at the Waterfront Karen at the end of August, will bring the total number of Builders stores beyond South Africa to nine. Kenya, East Africa’s commercial hub, will join Botswana, Mozambique, and Zambia as regions with the firm’s outlets outside the retailer’s stronghold, with management affirming intentions to entrench its presence on the continent. “As with each venture into a new territory, Builders’ investment of Sh500 million represents a commitment to bolster the local economy,” the firm said in a statement yesterday. Covering almost 10 000 square metres of trading, dispatch space and garden centre, the Nairobi store will bring a wide range of high-quality home improvement and building materials products and services, its said. The retail chain has so far created employment opportunities for around 400 individuals during the construction phase and around 145 local staff once the store is trading. Whether you’re a DIY(do-it-yourself) enthusiast, a homeowner, a small business or large contractor, Kenyans will soon experience the power to get it done,” management said. The product range will cover among others, building materials and home improvement requirements for flooring, paint, sanware, kitchens, lighting, electrical and appliances. A host of services such as paint tinting and mixing, glass cutting, kitchen design, gardening products, pool water analysis and others will be available trade credit. It is South Africa's largest home improvement and building materials specialist with 96 stores within the country.
