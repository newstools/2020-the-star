The national government has constructed a Sh300 million technical institute in Maragua constituency in Murang’a county. The Murang’a Technical Training Institute in Nyakahuno will open its doors in January 2021. The institution, built on 12 acres, has the capacity to enrol 6,000 students. It is expected to revolutionise the economy of the area. Maragua MP Mary Waithera said on Wednesday it is the largest technical institute in the county and it has received equipment worth Sh100 million and more is expected from the national government. “Other technical colleges have been funded to the tune of Sh50 million, but this one will be larger than Michuki Technical Training Institute that has been operational for a long time,” Waithera said. Waithera said Education CS George Magoha last month pledged to upgrade the institute to a national status. The MP urged landowners near the college to construct hostels to accommodate students. “They will buy from local shops and patronise local hotels which will benefit residents,” she said. She spoke when she commissioned a Sh3.5 million borehole being sunk to complement the water supply to the institution and serve the community. “A watering point will be established in one corner of the institution’s compound, where residents will be able to access the water from the borehole,” she noted. College principal Robin Wachira appealed to Form 4 leavers from the area to enrol in the institute. Resident Esther Wambui said she is happy that they now have a technical institute in the area. “I have lived here for 40 years and never had I thought that such development would happen,” she said.
