The Kiambu government has opened a theatre at Lari Level 4 Hospital to cater for expectant mothers requiring caesarean section services. Governor James Nyoro said on Wednesday that the hospital, which was opened in 1958 by colonialists, was upgraded from a dispensary. He spoke when he opened the theatre in Rukuma village, Lari Kirenga ward. Nyoro further said that a Sh190 million hospital with a 270 bed capacity is being set up in the area. It is 50 per cent complete. The new hospital, he said, will offer X-ray services, have a modern laboratory and dental unit. “We have held a meeting with the contractor and agreed that the facility should be completed early next year so that we can equip it and open it in late February or early March,” Nyoro said. He was accompanied by Deputy Governor Joyce Ngugi, Health executive Joseph Murega and Lari Kirenga MCA Joseph Karichu. Karichu praised the county government for improving health facilities in the region. Edited by A.N
