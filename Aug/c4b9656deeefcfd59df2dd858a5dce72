The government of Rwanda has extended the curfew in the country. "Movements are prohibited from 7pm to 5am," Rwanda's Prime Minister Edouard Ngirente said in a statement on Thursday. The curfew previously started at 9pm. Ngirente said the directive follows unprecedented increase in number of Covid-19 related deaths as well as community transmissions and will be reviewed after 15 days. The order comes after a cabinet meeting chaired by President Paul Kagame where the status of Covid-19 in the country was discussed. All public transport between the capital, Kigali and other districts has been prohibited. Public transport has been identified as a big factor of infection as it is the main means of transportation. Rwanda now has 3,625 virus cases with 15 confirmed fatalities. The government has ordered that all private businesses allow only 50 per cent of their staff to work on rotational basis as public establishments maintain 30 per cent. Schools, restaurants, barsÂ  will remain closed as religious ceremonies including burials resume with a restriction of 30 persons. Tourism activities are to resume, however land borders remain closed except for goods and cargo and for returning Rwandan citizens.
