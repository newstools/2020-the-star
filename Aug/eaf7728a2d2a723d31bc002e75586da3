Tanzanian singer Juma Jux has told his ex-girlfriend not to ruin her music career or take her life because of love. Jux was responding to Vanessa's recent decision to quit the industry. Vanessa said she was leaving the industry because she needed to choose her life and the music industry is demonic. She is dating Nigerian-American actor Olurotimi Akinosho, alias Rotimi. Responding to that in a recent interview with Tanzanian media, Jux said, "Nobody should risk their lives for things we can do without. "Don't ruin your career or your life because of love. Remember some parents gave birth to you and they are all looking at you. "Don't only think about a person you meet while you are already a grown-up. Think about people who struggled for you to be in that career before quitting because of love."
