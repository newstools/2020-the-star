Alcohol can still be sold in hotels but only if they are served in private rooms and not in the public domain, Tourism CS Najib Balala has clarified. President Uhuru Kenyatta during his last state of the nation address declared that alcohol should not be sold to the public in hotels and restaurants to mitigate the spread of Covid-19. "After consultation with the Cabinet Secretary, Ministry of Health, serving of alcohol can only be served in private and in their rooms and not in the public domain," CS Balala said in a letter to the CEO, Kenya Association of Hotel Keepers and Caterers Mike Macharia. The letter was copied to Health CS Mutahi Kagwe. The government is considering controlling the sale and consumption of alcohol in a bid to curb the spread of Covid-19. In a draft document seen by the Star in July, the government is considering banning the sale of alcohol in eateries. The document states alcoholic drinks should not be sold to sit-in customers at restaurants, eateries, bars, food courts, entertainment joints, supermarkets, wines and spirits shops or any outlet. Establishments that sell alcohol would operate between 9 am and 7.30 pm. In the regulations, a person would not be permitted to consume alcohol in public spaces. These include public parks, restaurants, parking lots, eateries, bars, entertainment joints, supermarkets or wines and spirits shops.
