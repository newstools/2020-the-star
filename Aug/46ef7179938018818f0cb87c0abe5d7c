Akothee's sister Cebbie says she is okay with her sister. This is after rumours went round that the two do not see eye to eye. Screenshots showing Cebbie had backstabbed Akothee were shared online. This broke Akothee so much as she posted on betrayal all week long. Speaking to media personality CJ Atemo, Cebbie said there is no bad blood between them and they fight just like any normal siblings. "Family is family and I like the way people kept on attacking me, ‘Ooh, you can’t fight Akothee.' She’s my sister. Even if I killed today, she’ll open her arms and accept me because she is more of my mother, something people don’t know,” she said. Cebbie added that as siblings, they fight. "What people don’t know is that when Akothee and I are fighting in that family, nobody talks because no one can bring us together," she said. "We find a way to talk and on that day (when she was exposed) and we don’t understand why, people keep asking me if I’m talking to her. We don’t have to show you that we’re talking or we’re good. It didn’t dent us as much…" She says she was attacked because of her ‘celebrity’ status. "If it wasn’t Cebbie, no one would talk. I’m targeted because I’m in the public domain like my sister, and also because they think I have everything on a silver platter, which isn’t true," she said.
