The governments of Kenya and Kuwait are set to roll out a Sh2 billion project in four constituencies within Nyamira county. Deputy President William Ruto announced on Tuesday that the project will be upgrading primary and secondary schools. Ruto said West Mugirango, North Mugirango, Kitutu Masaba and Borabu will reap from the project. “The management team has been set up, and soon, the four constituencies in Nyamira: West Mugirango, North Mugirango, Kitutu Masaba and Borabu will reap from the project,” Ruto said. The DP met MPs, MCAs and other local leaders from Nyamira at his office in Karen, Nairobi. During the meeting, they discussed development issues that focused on the completion of roads, electricity connectivity and technical training institutes. In 2019, Nyamira residents said the county had nothing in terms of development that required a visit from the DP. “We are ashamed as a county because we do not understand the importance of Ruto’s visit to our county. All we have are stalled projects and nothing to show that we have made a single stride since devolution,” trader Mercy Ochoki said. Another trader Eric Onsase said Ruto is well-known for launching development projects in counties "but there is no single project to be inspected or launched by the second in command". “Our county is always on record over stalled projects. We don't have any project that we can say we are proud of it is a big shame to our county,” Onsase said.
