Keroche heiress Anerlisa Muigai and her Tanzanian fiancé Ben Pol seem to have parted ways. The two are reported to have tied the knot in Tanzania a few months ago, with pictures and videos of the secret ceremony emerging on social media. Ben Pol and Anerlisa got engaged in 2019 after dating for a while. That same year, she shared pictures of what looked like an introduction ceremony at her parents’ house. Word Is has now established that Anerlisa has unfollowed the singer. The two also deleted each other’s pictures from their respective pages. Well, Anerlisa has shared a snippet video believed to be from a popular Nigerian movie, leaving fans speculating she posted the video to get at Ben Pol, a father of one. "May all women be this blessed," she captioned the video. In the video, a man who claims to be rich approaches a woman and tells her he wants to marry to help them benefit from each other. He brags that he’s wealthy and asks her for a bank account. He give her 300,000 Naira (Sh85,000). "What am I supposed to do with that? Should I use it to buy petrol for my car or give my driver or maybe change tyres? You’re funny," she posed. When it’s her turn, she transfers 10 million Naira (Sh2.8 million) to his account, leaving him shocked. "Upgrade your car, take care of your wife at home and stop harassing young ladies," she tells him before walking away to a Rolls Royce waiting for her. Ben Pol in an Instagram post said he is taking care of himself. “I think it is time to take care of myself and put myself first! If you are trying to reach me at this time, I’m so sorry, I will contact you. I needed some cleansing to do. God bless.” Edited by T Jalio
