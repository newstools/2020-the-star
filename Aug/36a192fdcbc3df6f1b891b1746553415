St Peter's Mumias Boys' High School principal Cosmas Nabungolo plans to succeed Kiminini MP Chris Wamalwa in 2022. Wamalwa will not defend his seat and has instead announced he will "use all means" to be the next Trans Nzoia governor. The county chief seat is held by Patrick Khaemba, who is serving his second and final term. Nabungolo appealed to Kiminini residents to fulfill  "my heart's desire to represent you" in Parliament. He spoke during the burial of Mama Florence Khaemba, the wife of university don Battany Khaemba. “You've been asking yourself why I express  interest but don’t vie. This is the time. I need your support in 2022,” Nabungolo said in his Bukusu dialect. He urged the community to empower children through education, saying that will be one of the items on his agenda. His entry into the fray now brings the number of aspirants to nine. Others are Wamalwa’s 2017 main challenger Julius Mbagaya, educationist Masibo Lumala, Godwin Masibo, Martin Walubuka, Robert Wamalwa, Martin Nang’ole, Trans Nzoia county secretary Sifuna Wakofula and Martin Walubuka Nabungolo has both local and international networks developed mainly through some of his former students, and he plans to exploit the connections to win the seat. He previously served as principal of St Anthony's High School, Kitale.
