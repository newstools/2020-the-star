France midfielder Paul Pogba has been left out of their squad for next month's Nations League matches after testing positive for COVID-19, manager Didier Deschamps said on Thursday. Rennes midfielder Eduardo Camavinga was called up as a late replacement for Manchester United's Pogba. "I had to make a last-minute change to this list because Paul Pogba was planned to be in this list," Deschamps told reporters. "But unfortunately for him, he took a test (for COVID-19) yesterday which turned out to be positive today, so at the last minute he was replaced by Eduardo Camavinga." France are set to visit Sweden on September 5 and host Croatia three days later.
