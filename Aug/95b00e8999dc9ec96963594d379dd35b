There are those who may want to travel but are cash –strapped," Jambojet head of sales Titus Oboogi said in a statement on Thursday. "We want to provide options to the customers and tell them that they can still travel by redeeming Bonga Points." Bonga is a loyalty scheme launched by Safaricom in 2007 to allow its customers accumulate and redeem points based on usage of services on its network. “We seek to provide our customers more options in how they utilize the value of their Bonga points,” Safaricom CEO Peter Ndegwa said.
