The high number of unsolved cases, particularly murder, is an indication of a huge problem in our justice system. The laws are very clear on what happens when a murder is committed. Actually, compared to other countries in Africa, Kenya has one of the best legal frameworks to address murder. It is unfortunate that crime, mostly murder, continues to remain unsolved. My take is that there's a reluctance to solve crimes committed by individuals in high positions, particularly in the justice system. This is informed by the number of unsolved high-profile murders. Many murder cases drag in Kenyan courts for years and the number keeps growing. We appreciate that there are a few people in the justice system doing their best to see that justice prevails. Unfortunately, the system in general is not supportive of some of the initiatives put forward by these people. At Haki Africa, as a human rights organisation, we maintain that respect for the rule of law, even by those in high positions, is critical in ensuring justice prevails. If we want to move forward as a country, all those in high positions should do what is expected of them. We are calling on the authorities to immediately address the numerous unresolved murder cases. To be specific, we are calling on the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Judiciary to up their game. Some cases are already before the courts but they remain without hearing dates or even a clear way forward. Family and friends of a murdered victim and Kenyans in general usually hope the murderers get arrested and face justice in the shortest time possible. However, this is usually a farfetched dream as detectives sometimes take too long to arraign suspects and when they do, there are usually no convictions. We agree that solving a murder is a daunting task but, like I said before, we have a good legal framework. The executive director of Haki Africa spoke to the Star
