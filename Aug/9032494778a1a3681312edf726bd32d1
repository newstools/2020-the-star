A police officer is nursing injuries after he was seriously beaten up by other cops enforcing the curfew in Bomet town on Sunday night. The General Service Unit officer based in Nakuru says he was going home when he was confronted by more than five officers moments after alighting from a car. They beat him up on claims he had broken curfew rules. The paramilitary officer who is now nursing injuries at home narrated to the Star that despite identifying himself and even producing his job card, the officers heard none of that and instead pounced on him with kicks and blows. “Immediately I alighted from a car I was traveling in at around 9:20pm in Bomet town, I proceeded home. On reaching the junction next to Equity bank, I found the officers who stopped me,” he explained. “I obeyed the orders and went straight to where they were and identified myself but one of them grabbed my shirt and ordered that I should go down on my knees and apologise for breaking the rules or face the consequences.” When he refused to kneel, the officer knocked him down and the other officers roughed him up before handcuffing him and taking him to the police station. He sustained injuries on his head and back. At the station, he said, one of the officers sympathised with him and ordered his release. The matter was not booked in the Occurrence Book. Reached for a comment, county police commander Naomi Ichami said she was not aware of the incident but promised to follow up on it. Edited by Henry Makori
