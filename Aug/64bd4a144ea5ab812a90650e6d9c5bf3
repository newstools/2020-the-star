Health amenities across the country are being digitised to ensure successful and efficient service delivery. ICT Principal Secretary Jerome Ochieng said the government will interconnect the 369 level 4 to 6 hospitals over the internet by the end of 2022. The Ministry of ICT, Innovations, and Youth Affairs is spearheading the plan. Ochieng said as part of the programme, the ministry has already installed Local Area Network in 50 public hospitals across the country. He spoke in Siaya town on Wednesday when he inspected ICT installations in the county and met county commissioner Michael ole Tialal. The PS said the government plans to mainstream ICT at the grassroots and is investing in infrastructure development to enable the public access government services online. “Our strategy is to make Kenya a leader in the digital economy,” Ochieng said. He challenged the youth to take advantage of the ICT infrastructure to improve their digital skills. The government has opened more opportunities through various digital platforms, he said. Ochieng also commented on the delay in payment to youths in the Kazi Mtaani programme. He said many youths fail to get payments on time because of their inconsistent registration details. The PS said that the government has realised that many of the 283,000 youths are in debt to Safaricom's Fuliza scheme. “We must indulge with the company to give our youths a 48-hour waiver from the time payment is made to the participants,” Ochieng said. Siaya Governor Cornel Rasanga praised the close cooperation between the county and national governments on youth and ICT matters. Rasanga advised youths to take advantage of the digitisation to access government procurement opportunities.
