The office of the Director of Public Prosecution is setting up an isolation centre for its staff confirmed to have coronavirus. The facility, situated at the Prosecutor Training Institute, will be for those who may choose to self-isolate away from their homes, DPP Noordin Haji said. This comes after some staff tested positive for the virus during an organised wide testing at the offices. In a statement on Thursday evening, Haji said most of the positive cases were asymptomatic hence the office embarked on contact tracing in liaison with the Ministry of Health. "The affected officers have been advised to self isolate by competent medical officers and those who are unable to self isolate for whatever reasons have been given the option of being quarantined at centres of their choice," he said. He noted that all offices countrywide have been regularly sanitized and staff put on working shifts throughout the period in order to create adequate social distancing. "Analysis of the preliminary organasational hazard assessments have revealed that the majority of the asymptomatic cases which have been detected are mainly amongst officers serving in divisons that have been participating in open court proceedings," he said. "This is a clear indicator that those who participate in open court proceedings during this time of the pandemic are highlyÂ  exposed to the disease because of human interaction that we have no control over within the courts." Haji said his office shall engage the National Council on Administration of Justice to ensure adequate measures are taken to safeguard the welfare of prosecutors, magistrates judges and lawyers.
