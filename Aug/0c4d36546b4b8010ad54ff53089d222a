A total of 28,000 households from poor families in Tana River and Wajir counties on Saturday received meat to celebrate Eid-ul-Adha from a non-governmental organisation. Arid Land Development Focus, a Wajir-based organisation, with the support of Secour Islamic France slaughtered 250 goats and shared out the meat The majority of the beneficiaries  were displaced by the April floods and are from poor family backgrounds. According to the ALDEF chief executive officer Ahmed Ibrahim Abdi, the Eid cerebration forms part of sharing with the less fortunate in society. The exercise will cost ALDEF Sh6.1 million for three days. “The Tana River community has been affected by three levels of disasters. They were affected by floods twice, around November/December last year and the April/May/June," Abdi said. "Most of families here lost their crops, which were ready for harvesting. Then came the locust devastation. The majority of them don't have food and we found it wise to support,” he added.
