The Law Society of Kenya has asked for a five-judge appeal bench to review a ruling dismissing their application to suspend a section of the Computer and Cyber Crimes Act. They argue that justices Wanjiru Karanja, Daniel Musinga, and Sankale Ole Kantai erred in failing to grant conservatory orders suspending the section of the Act criminalising publication of fake Covid-19 news. If the judgement given on August 7 is allowed to stand, it  will be a miscarriage of justice, LSK says. The LSK petitioned the Court of Appeal president through Lawyer Ochiel Dudley. Ochiel argued that the threat of arrest, conviction, and imprisonment under the Computer and Cybercrimes Act, 2018 is imminent even though there is pending appeal. “At any rate, this matter concerns the freedom of expression and access to information during the Covid-19 global health pandemic: a question of life and death,” he argued. LSK said it was erroneous for the bench to rule that Court of Appeal cannot grant conservatory orders. “For one, I am aware that the holding that the court cannot issue conservatory orders contradicts the court’s own prior decision in Civil Application 201 of 2018 between Katiba Institute v Attorney General which affirmed the court’s power to issue a conservatory order under Rule 5(2)(b),” the application reads. The petitioner argues that the court ignored the three charge sheets annexed to their application and wrongly ruled that the arrests and prosecution sought to be stayed were imaginary.
