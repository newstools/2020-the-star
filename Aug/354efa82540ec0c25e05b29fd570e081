The Kenya Inter-Counties Sports and Cultural Association are mulling on cutting down their disciplines as they prepare to host this year's event. Kicosca secretary general, Muraya Kabiri, said there is a proposal for them to hold a mini-Kicosca which will feature football, volleyball, tug of war, netball, athletics, basketball, chess, darts, scrabble and cultural dances. “We are exploring the possibility of holding a mini event to feature disciplines  that are played at regional level if other member countries confirm participation,” said Kabiri. He was, however,  non-committal on the county which will host the event, saying the counties which presented their bid for this year’s event had not been evaluated. Kericho County hosted last year’s event. He said Kenya is also scheduled to host this year’s East Africa Local Authorities Cultural Association (EALASCA) games. Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Burundi and Rwanda have already confirmed participation in extravaganza. “Eldoret will host the regional event in December. Last year, Uasin Gishu Governor came to Kampala and told us that he is ready to host the annual event,” said the official. Kenya last hosted the games in Kisumu in 2016. Kenya emerged overall winners during last year’s event staged in Kampala, Uganda. Rwanda, Burundi and South Sudan did not participate in last year’s showpiece. Meanwhile Kicosca officials will meet this week to decide the fate of this year’s event and give the way forward. Kabiri said they are also waiting for the Sports Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohammed to release the task force report on resumption of sports activities before announcing their way forward.
