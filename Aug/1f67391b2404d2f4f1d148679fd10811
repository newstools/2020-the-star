Lamu Governor Fahim Twaha has slammed other county leaders for criticising his leadership style. Addressing mourners during the burial of Bishop Zabedi Maina of Full Gospel Church on Sunday, Twaha told off Woman Representative Ruweida Obbo, Lamu West MP Stanley Muthama and Senator Anwar Loitiptip for attacking his administration. He said the trio have less experience in politics and as such cannot teach him anything, adding that they have done nothing to develop the region. Twaha said that being the longest serving leader from the county, he has "more political muscle" than anyone else. "I want the woman rep here, the MPs and the senator to respect me. You must understand and accept that I have been here longer than any of you. I have 23 years of active political service, while all of you have just done about three years," he said. Speaking earlier at the funeral, Obbo suggested the health sector be reverted to the national government because of the crisis it faces, especially since the outbreak of Covid-19. He cited the takeover of some Nairobi government functions. But Twaha asked his critics to be fair by equally recognising other sectors that have been doing well under his leadership. “You cannot just be seeing what is wrong; surely, there must be something good I have done which you should equally notice and speak about,” he said. He said despite the "obvious challenges" facing his administration, the county had made major developmental strides under his leadership, among them the recruitment of more than 20,000 families into the free NHIF programme, employing adequate medical personnel and resettling more than 6,000 squatters. The governor cautioned politicians against gossiping and instead urged them to support his development agenda. “Think before you attack me. You want the health docket back to the government but what you don’t realise is that health is not just about Covid-19. We have had other worse challenges and we overcame,” Twaha said.
