Health CS Mutahi Kagwe has made it clear that he is not resigning. Speaking during a press briefing in Kisumu on Sunday, Kagwe pointed out that the issue of people asking him to resign is a dream, despite calls from a section of Kenyans. "The issue of people asking me to resign is a pipe dream. They can continue to dream on," he said. He went ahead to make it clear that he has no son who is under 18 years in his house. This is after a video went viral of his son at a party despite the directives given to exercise social distancing and avoid crowded areas. "On the issue of a video footage showing my son at a party, I do not have a son under 18 in my house, meaning they are adults. You can follow them and ask them," the CS said.
