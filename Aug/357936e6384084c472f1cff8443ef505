Jamii Bora Bank is now Kingdom Bank after the Co-operative Bank Group successfully acquired 90 per cent. ''Pursuant to Central Bank of Kenya approvals, the former Jamii Bora Bank has changed its name and will now operate as “Kingdom Bank Limited,’’ Co-operative Bank MD Gideon Muriuki said in a statement. The re-branding follows the unanimous acceptance of an offer by Co-operative Bank to Jamii Bora’s board in early June. The re-branded third-tier bank’s existing issued 24.9 million ordinary shares of Sh66 each will now be re-designated and re-classified as Class B ordinary shares, giving owners room to share in future profits as opposed to cashing out at once Co-op Bank has since named Antony Mburu as the new chief executive of Kingdom Bank, replacing Timothy Mwaniki Kabiru who has been serving in the acting capacity after Samuel exited early last year. He joins from Co-op Bank Group where he was the director – Credit Management. He is a career banker over 25 years’ experience in the region notably in risk and credit management. The lender has also appointed the board to be chaired by Margaret Karangatha after getting a nod from regulators. Others on the board include Macloud Malonza, Julius Sitienei, and Group MD Gideon Muriuki. The acquisition now brings the number of Co-op Bank Group’s subsidiaries to six. Others are Co-operative Bank of Kenya, Co-optrust Investment Services Limited, Co-op Consultancy & Insurance Agency Limited, Kingdom Securities Limited 60 per cent and Co-operative Bank of South Sudan Limited 51 per cent.
