"It has been one month of pain and tears, but I know that one day the light will shine." But why did she choose to air her issues on Instagram?

Amina says it was hard for her and Ben as well, but she acknowledged her wrong and humbled herself to Ben and apologised. "It was hard for me and the moment I knew I had messes, I humbled myself not only for people but for him. I waited for people to react before going back to apologise," she said. "We talked and sorted out the issue and went back and apologised because as a human being, we own up to our mistakes." Amina says she is now more careful about what she posts on social media.
