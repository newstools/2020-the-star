A Sh3 million new police station facility at Ng’ombeni within Matuga subcounty is expected to improve security and business activities in Kwale county. Speaking on Monday during the launch of the station, county police commander Joseph Nthenge said the station will enhance the visibility and accessibility of the local police to effectively serve the people living around. “The station will heighten security in this place and enable quick response to the needs and calls of the community,” he said. Ng’ombeni is infamous for high crime rates and al Shabaab attacks. County commissioner Karuku Ngumo had once reported that the gangs are made up of youths aged between 12-17 who terrorise the locals using pangas from both sides of Mombasa and Kwale. The construction of the post had earlier met resistance from the residents, forcing Matuga MP Kasim Tandaza and other agencies to organise barazas and peace talks until its foundation was laid down some years ago. Nthenge said police will work day and night in combating the insecurity in the area. He urged residents to provide crucial information that might lead to the arrest of the criminals. “Cooperate with law enforcement officers. Don’t treat them like enemies, they are here to offer protection and give concrete links that will help in flushing out the terrorists,” he said. CDF chairman Omar Mwaganga said soon the post will be expanded to create more rooms for women's cells. The residents have also lauded the opening of the new police post, saying businesses and more visitors will soon flood the area. They hope the installation of the security centre will promote peace and stop further gunning down of youth. “We lost our sons and we anticipate that this post will bring nothing but tranquillity and prosperity within this vicinity,” a resident said.
