Kenya Secondary Schools Sports Association (KSSSA) football powerhouse Kakamega High School is set to diversify after entering into a three-year service partnership with Iowa Weslayan University from the USA. The deal will start on September 1 and will focus more on cultural exchange. Confirming the pact, Kakamega Green Commandos chairman, Isaac Kwoba expressed his excitement over the partnership which will see both institutions develop as an exchange program not only in soccer but also in other disciplines including athletics, basketball, hockey, volleyball and netball among others. “We want to establish a platform that will give the youth a platform to display their talent and help them realise their dream in  sports industry. “We will provide equipment for training while our personnel will impart skills into the young stars during our annual camps and clinics that do not only feature Kakamega High but also to other institutions within the country,” said Kwoba. Iowa Weslayan University women’s team’s head coach Chris Gaskan lauded the partnership, terming Commandos as a well-organised institution that has a great history in school championships. Commandos have in the past won national and regional championships. “I am pleased to work with the Green Commandos which is the most successful outfit as far as school games are concerned and we believe this cooperation will benefit both sides,” he said. “With this diversity in all disciplines, we want to learn more from Kenya as far athletics is concerned and also get more knowledge on the cultural perspective that remains an umbrella for the sports,” Gaskin pointed out. Kwoba, a former Green Commandos and the defunct Motcom FC star revealed that other affiliates like Vihiga Queens will also benefit from the partnership that has come at the right time in Western region. He said sports hospitality in the region should be embraced and given first priority since it’s the only way to transform lives.
