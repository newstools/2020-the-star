Parents in Garissa have been urged to closely monitor their children’s daily routines following increased incidents of drugs abuse among youths in the area. Northeastern regional youth coordinator Abdinoor Adan said that with schools closed due to Covid-19, parents must take care of their children. “As a department, our greatest fear is for the youth to fall into the trap of drug peddlers and even extremist groupings luring them to join terror cells. I want to urge the parents to closely monitor the movements of their children,” Adan said in Garissa. The coordinator said that although the government has played its role of introducing programmes and projects, among them Kazi Mtaani to cushion the youth against the effects of Covid-19, the parents have a bigger role of guiding their children in absence of their teachers. “The schools have been shut due to Covid-19 and all our children are at home. As a parent, you must know whom your children are interacting with and their background,” he said. Adan called on the youth engaged under the Kazi Mtaani programme to use their wages wisely by making saving for the future. On the Covid-19 situation, Adan pleaded with the residents of the Northeastern region to stop dismissing the coronavirus as a myth. “This disease is real and is claiming lives. People have lost their lives to this disease. Let us take care of our lives and those of our loved ones,” Adan said. He added, “Let us observe the ministry of health protocols by washing our hands regularly with soap and running water, keep social distancing and wear our masks. There is no shortcut.”
