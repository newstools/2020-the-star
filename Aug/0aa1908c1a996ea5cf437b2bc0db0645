Businessman Jimi Wanjigi has been accused of colluding with the Registrar of Companies and a DCI officer to defraud a woman of her prime property in Westlands. Cissy Kalunde Musembi says that Aureum Limited, a company owned by businessman Wanjigi and his wife Irene Nzisa, holds multiple original title deeds of the suit property located at the junction of General Mathenge and Peponi roads. This, Kalunde claims through Echesa and Bwire Advocates, is an indication of fraud and impropriety. “A property should not have more than one title deed, because it is prepared from a single Deed Plan,” she says. Both parties are claiming the land and assert they have documents to prove ownership. According to Kalunde, Aureum has never owned the suit property and is attempting to defraud her through forged title and transfer documents. She accuses the Registrar of Companies and a DCI officer of interfering with the records of Horizon Hills Limited C-110776. She asserts that Horizon was renamed Aureum after the Registrar of Companies disclosed there was another company by that name. Wanjigi says registration number C-110776 does not belong to Horizons Hills Limited but to Bosorana Limited whose directors are David Njenga, Samson Kuria, Henry Njoroge Njenga and Samuel Chege. Those are the people Kalunde dealt with to acquire the subject property, he says. The businesswoman insists she conducted searches in respect of Horizon Hills Limited C-110776 at the Companies Registry and confirmed the existence and directorship of the company. She claims Bosorana was unknown to her and that the Registrar of Companies and the DCI officer colluded with Aureum to interfere with Horizon Hills Ltd C-110776 records to assist Aureum to fraudulently claim the suit property. Kalunde says she will prove that the grant and transfer documents produced by Aureum to lay claim the suit property are fraudulent and forged documents.  - mwaniki fm
