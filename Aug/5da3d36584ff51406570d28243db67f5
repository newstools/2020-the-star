Three people have been arrested in connection with the stoning to death of two men in a gambling den in Kayole, Nairobi. The three men – John Wanjiru, Samuel Ngatia and Dennis Nyakundi – allegedly attacked the deceased on the night of July 19 after a disagreement.  The deceased are yet to be identified. The suspects will be remanded at Kayole police station for 10 days after investigating officer Leonard Ochola asked for more time to hold the suspects. “Your honour I need more time to enable me to record the statements from potential prosecution witnesses, take fingerprints of the unknown deceased and  forward them to the Registrar of Persons for identification,” Ochola told Makadara chief magistrate Heston Nyagah. The case will be mentioned on August 17. Ochola said it was necessary for the three to remain in police custody to ensure they were safe. Nyakundi told the court he was framed and had nothing to do with the killings. Wanjiru and Ngatia also said they were not involved in the murder. Edited by A.N
