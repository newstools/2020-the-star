A DCI detective based at Kisauni has been arrested after defrauding a woman in a job scam. Edward Mwaniki Kabachia was arrested on Wednesday following an incident where he obtained a substantial amount of money from a lady by falsely pretending that he was capable of securing her two relatives jobs. Kabachia promised to give her relatives jobs at the Kenya Prisons recruitment exercise held in 2017. His arrest follows the conclusion of an inquiry by DCI Likoni. It was recommended that the officer be charged with the offence of obtaining money by false pretences contrary to Sec 313 of the Penal Code. He will be arraigned in court today. Two weeks ago, three sleuths from the DCI were arrested for involvement inÂ the robbery with violence incident that occurred at Baraka Gas Company in Matuu-Machakos county. The three officers from the Special Service Unit were arrested for an incident that happened on July 31. Having been tipped of the said company illegally and unprocedurally refilling cylinders from various gas companies behind locked doors after curfew hours, the team of three constables; William Mutua, Henry Maitai and Jonathan Sankale organized and executed a raid on the facility.
