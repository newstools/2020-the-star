Kiss 100 radio presenter Chito Ndhlovu was once traumatised after an ex-girlfriend held a knife over him. It’s something he never expected as the woman was very beautiful. Narrating his experience with Jalango on the morning Kiss, Chito said he had dated the woman for almost two years. "So, one night she called and said she wanted to come over, nikasema sawa. Upon arriving, she found me chopping onions as I was getting ready to cook," he said. "She asked to help even when I insisted I would cook, so finally I let her." Chito's kitchen was on the left side and as he was watching the TV, he felt a presence on his left side."When I looked, I saw her with a knife pointing at me. "She stood there looking at me for 20 seconds, while pointing the knife at me. Then she snapped out of her state and was like, ‘Ooh, nilikua nakata nyanya,’ and went back to the kitchen and prepared a meal." Chito said they sat down to eat but he was scared all through. "The moment we finished eating I created an excuse of how I had a busy day awaiting and offered to take her home," he said. "I was brought up well and I could not beat her but at that moment the way I was brought up and the situation conflicted." The two ended up parting ways and Chito is now happily married.
