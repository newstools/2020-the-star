The counties revenue sharing formula stalemate at the Senate is being fueled by 2022  presidential aspirants fearing to lose votes, a senator has said. Embu Senator Njeru Ndwiga said presidential hopefuls have been held to ransom by counties which will lose greatly if the 'one man one vote one shilling' formula is applied. He said the presidential aspirants who are party leaders do not know which way to turn because they are told by people from either side of the debate that if they don’t support them, they will lose in the next election. “That is why you find even spokespersons of party leaders, never mind whether their counties are winning in the formula, are not supporting it and are on the other side,” Ndwiga said. Speaking on Sunday on phone, the senator said the next election is at the heart of the Senate deadlock. The Jubilee senator said he supports the proposed basis for revenue sharing formula, arguing that counties with big populations were denied their rightful in the first and second formulas. Ndwiga, however, said to protect sparsely populated counties from losing what they are getting currently, the government should increase their share of the Equalization Fund. “If this issue is handled this way by increasing the funding it will be a win-win situation for every county,” Ndwiga said. Senators have sharply disagreed on the third basis for revenue sharing for the counties, with those from sparsely populated counties opposing it, complaining that they will lose much cash while the populated ones will gain a lot.
