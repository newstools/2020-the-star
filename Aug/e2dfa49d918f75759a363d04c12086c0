Did you know you can face charges for physically assaulting an animal? Well, two men were charged with injuring a dairy cow at a Kibera court. They were accused of causing it some injuries in the head. "You caused injury to the cow, true or not true?" asked a court clerk. The court attendants broke into laughter as the suspects responded to the charge. They denied the charge. A suspect tried to play mad to the magistrate for a lenient sentence. The convict who pleaded guilty to escaping from prison pretended that he is not okay in the head by acting. "Mimi ni Mkikuyu, mnashika wakikuyu, mnanishtaki Mkikuyu ama (I am a Kikuyu. Are you arresting and charging Kikuyu??" he posed to the magistrate. In a rejoinder, the magistrate asked if he was mad. "Is he insane?" he asked. Even before he answered, the magistrate slapped him with a one-year jail term. A suspect shamelessly confronted a journalist in an open court. â€œStop taking my picture, stop it!" she shouted. Interestingly, she had been arraigned at a Nairobi court and charged with threatening to kill. However, she refused any attempt if the journalist to take her some pictures. She did not take plea after the police ordered that she be taken to to a mental hospital for check up.
