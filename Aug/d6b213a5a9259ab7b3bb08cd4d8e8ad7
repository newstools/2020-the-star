Six out of 10 Kenyans want the Constitution implemented as it is without being amended, a new opinion poll by Infotrak has shown. The latest poll, which interviewed 1,500 people over the phone, was commissioned by civil society organisations including Amnesty International, Transparency International Katiba Institute and ICJ Kenya among others. The poll show that only 23 per cent of Kenyans are satisfied with how the laws have been implemented. "34 per cent are dissatisfied and 43 per cent staggeringly are disinterested or have no view either way," the poll report released on Wednesday reads. In terms of regions, North Eastern is leading with satisfaction in implementation of the Constitution at 43 per cent while dissatisfaction is highest in Western Kenya at 46 per cent. Majority of those opposing amending the supreme law are aged below 49. Opposition to amendments are highest in Eastern (68%), Western (67%), Central (64%), and Nyanza (64%). Support for amendments is highest in Coast (54%) and North Eastern (51%). The respondents calling for amendments are concerned with the challenges relating to leadership and integrity as well as devolution. The poll was done to mark the 10-year anniversary of the Constitution since it's promulgation in 2010.
