People living with hearing impairment in Kakamega County have raised concerns about the inability to access information about Covid -19. Kenya Deaf Association for Kakamega branch Habel Ouma said the deaf community has not accessed the required information and fear that many of their members may be infected unknowingly. “...we have no access to the information and at the same time we don’t have the special face masks for the deaf which are transparent to enable us to read the lips of those we are communicating with,” Ouma said. The chairman spoke when the deaf in Kakamega received a donation of 1000 improved Kienyeji chicks from Hadija Nganyi one of the Women leaders in Kakamega to help the community to start a poultry project in order to sustain their lives. Ouma asked the county to involve the deaf in the Covid-19 trainings for the health community workers . “The deaf community must also be trained on how they can protect themselves. The health community workers will only help the normal people," he said. Ouma also appealed for food and other basic needs for the deaf community. Nganyi who donated chicks called on the County government to consider the over 500 deaf in the county for the Covid 19 relief food. “I want to appeal to the government to consider the plight of the disabled persons especially the deaf during these difficult times, " Nganyi appealed.
