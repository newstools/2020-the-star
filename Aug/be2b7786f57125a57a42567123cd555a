Police officers on Wednesday destroyed placards of Samson Waithaka, a man living with disability who has been spreading awareness about prevention of Covid-19 to Kenyans while riding his bicyle across Nairobi. Security guards with the help of police officers brought down all the placards on his bicycle claiming that he has been causing a disturbance. Waithaka's bicycle was filled with placards which had messages including, 'keep distance', 'stay at home' and 'wash your hands'/ Last week, Waithaka went to the Ministry of Health to complain about harassment and mistreatment by security guards. In April, Waithaka, a father of five, told the Star he wakes up every morning, rides his bicycle to various city estates with one aim, to sensitize Kenyans on the importance of hygiene and washing of hands amid the Covid-19 pandemic. He said he was moved when he visited the Muthurwa Market and witnessed how ignorant members of the public were of the coronavirus. He said though various preventive measures had been published and broadcast all over, some Kenyans had just chosen to bypass all that. Waithaka used to transport children to and from various schools on his bicycle before the disease struck, forcing the government to close learning institutions. The closure, he said, left him hopeless not knowing how to cope with the situation. "As you can see I am disabled with a spinal cord complication. But I put that aside knowing that with what I am doing, I ring hope to one or two people,‚Äù he said.
