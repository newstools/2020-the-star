Two bloggers were Tuesday night detained for more than 10 hours before being taken to Capitol Hill police station where they were not booked. Jack Okinyi and Milton Were were arrested at 5pm on Tuesday at Upper Hill (Nairobi county) and Syokimau (Machakos county) respectively. The two who write for online publications Business Illustrated and Kenya Today were taken to Kamukunji, Muthaiga, Kasarani and Mlolongo police stations where officers-in-charge refused to book them. On Wednesday morning, they were taken to Capitol Hill police station but their presence was not recorded in the Occurrence Book. “I stay with my brother Milton Were in Syokimau. We were in the house when they came for my brother at 5pm on Tuesday,” Newrich Oyuga said. “They actually jumped over the gate and the first thing they rushed to take was his phone, laptop and any other gadget that looks like can store information. Two officers entered while another two remained at the gate.” Police sources said that the bloggers were detained following a story they published on the two blogs alleging corruption at the Kenya Urban Roads Authority. “We learned today that Okinyi was the first to be arrested and taken to Mlolongo. His friend was picked at Syokimau,” a close relative who wanted not to be mentioned said. The bloggers were later taken to the Directorate of Criminal Investigations headquarters and asked to record statements. They were not accompanied by family members or lawyers. A senior official in the Special Crimes Unit told the Star that the officers wanted to establish the contacts of the bloggers at Kura.
