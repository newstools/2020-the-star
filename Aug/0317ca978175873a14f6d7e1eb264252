The Ministry of Health has been accused of talking to Kenyans as if they are retarded, Health CS Mutahi Kagwe has said. During the daily press briefing on the status of Covid-19 in the country on Saturday, Kagwe urged Kenyans to accept that Covid-19 is a reality. "Tumetukanwa! [We have been insulted] MoH has been accused of talking to Kenyans as if they are retarded. My brothers and sisters, I can only implore you to accept that Covid-19 is a reality. Kenyans don't have to die. This is a condition we can control. We can manage ourselves," the CS said. He also raised concern after he received news that a man was tested and turned positive for coronavirus but refused to acknowledge the results. "His refusal to self-isolate had his sister and parents infected. He has now lost the head of the family, two weeks after they lost and buried the mother," Kagwe said. The country today recorded five more deaths to the virus, raising fatalities in the country to 418. On a happy note, 781 patients recovered from the disease, bringing  the total number of recoveries in the country so far to 11,899. Another 699 new cases of Covid-19 have been recorded in the country, raising the  total to 25,837, Health CS Mutahi Kagwe confirmed. The new cases were drawn from the 7,175 people whose samples were tested within 24 hours. This brings the country's total tests close to the 350,000 mark. From the new cases, 675 were Kenyan while 24 were foreigners. Edited by Henry Makori
