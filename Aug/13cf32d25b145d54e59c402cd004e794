Two security guards were charged with stealing building materials worth Sh1.4 million from a construction site. Peter Shilemunya and Evans Wapakala appeared before Kibera senior principal magistrate Esther Boke on Friday and denied the charges. They were charged alongside another man identified in the charge sheet as Boniface Okwemba, a frequent visitor to the site. The three allegedly committed the offence on Friday in Kileleshwa in Nairobi. The charge sheet says the three stole scaffolding pipes and connectors of different sizes and valued at Sh1,405,000 at Sava Builders Construction Company. Shilemunya and Wapakala were charged with another count of failure to use reasonable means to prevent the theft. The police report says that the two were guarding the site when the items were stolen. Shilemunya was on duty during the day when the items were discovered missing. The police report says Okwemba was arrested because he was Shilemunya's friend who visited him regularly. "I left the premises when the stolen items were there," Wapakala told the court. Boke released then on Sh100,000 bond each. The case will be mentioned on August 11. Edited by Henry Makori
