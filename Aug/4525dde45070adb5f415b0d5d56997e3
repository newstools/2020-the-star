A 13-year-old boy in Embu is recovering in hospital after he was mauled by about eight stray dogs on his way home. Antony Murimi was admitted to Embu Level 5 Teaching and Referral Hospital on Thursday after he was attacked and injured at Kiriari market in Embu North subcounty as he returned home from an errand he was sent on by parents. John Ireri, the director of Upper Hill Njota School where the Standard 8 boy learns, said he was informed about the ordeal by the boy’s parents and visited him at hospital where he found him with multiple injuries all over his head, hands and feet. He said he was informed the boy was returning home from Kianjokoma market in the evening when he was ambushed by the canines. On trying to scare them away, they surrounded him and started attacking him before he fell to the ground. Murimi screamed for help and fortunately some passersby arrived and rescued him. By then he had already been seriously injured by the vicious dogs before he was taken to hospital. Ireri called on the county government to round up all stray dogs in the area and kill them. He at the same time called upon parents to keep an eye on their children who are now at home following the closure of schools in March due to the Covid-19 outbreak.
