Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong has promised to extend water coverage of the Osieko-Nambo water project to reach Mau Mau, which is 27km away. Speaking when he made a tour of the project on Saturday, the governor said his government is committed to increase water coverage across the county from the current 56 per cent to 60. Project chairman Musa Amoto said the county government has the capacity to expand the  coverage to reach Mau Mau. He said the current coverage stands at 12km. "Currently, we are serving residents of Osieko and Usenge in Siaya county. With the county's planned  intervention we shall connect water to over 1,500 households, " he said. Omoto thanked the governor for prioritising the water project. He added: "We are developing a proposal to extend water from Nyapala village in Osieko to Mau Mau to cover swampy villages like Maduwa, Bulwani, Runyu,  Lukala and Mau Mau market." He said the Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in people not paying for water, leading to outstanding balances amounting to Sh560,000.  He said Kenya Power had disconnected electricity tothe project due to the arrears. Bunyala South MCA Casper Ajuma said  he will push for funds in the supplementary budget to commence the pipeline extension for the project to reach most parts of his ward which are currently facing acute water shortage.
