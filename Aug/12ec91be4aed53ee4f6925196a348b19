Medical interns in Kisii have threatened to go on strike over the county's alleged failure to provide them with risk allowances and personal protective gear. They said their lives were in danger in the face of the surging Covid-19 infection. Delayed payment is compounding their situation, they said. "We don't even have enough masks, the old stock has already run out and we have been left to the mercy of God," leader John Okoth said. The county has registered more than 854 Covid-19 cases, 14 from samples tested on Monday alone. Seven patients have succumbed to the virus. Public health officials say many people don't care about the danger of the virus anymore, leading to the surge in infections. Governor James Ongwae says they have established a 330-bed Covid-19 isolation facility. He said his administration has spent a fortune in the procurement of protective gear for the health personnel at all hospitals in the county. But speaking Tuesday outside the Kisii Teaching and Referral Hospital, the interns said they had been bypassed. "Already, a number of medical staff have tested positive and as interns, the challenge is acute with no risk allowances set aside for us," Okoth said. He said they had not been provided even with hand sanitiser even as the infections limped past the 50 mark on Monday. For effective service delivery, they said, the county should give them risk allowances too. "We are also in the frontline and sorely need protection like any other health personnel," the leader said. He added that many of the interns were also been deployed at night against their contracts. "The contract we signed says we should finish work by five in the evening," Okoth said. The group further wants the government to release funds to the counties so they can be paid.  Hospital executive Enock Ondari said he was not in a position to comment on the matter. Health CEC Sara Omache was said to be away from office when the Star sought comment. Edited by R.Wamochie
