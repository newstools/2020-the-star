 Kisumu Senator Fred Outa has urged the administration to offer support to the 90,000 vulnerable families surveyed in April from part of the Sh200 million Covid-19 fund. Outa noted the funds were meant to partly be used as cash transfers and to buy food to be donated to the vulnerable families. “It is over four months down the line and you promised to have this money help our people who are vulnerable. Please have mercy on the vulnerable families,” he told Governor Anyang' Nyong'o. The senator told journalists in Kisumu that the situation on the ground is worrying, with many families languishing in poverty. “The pandemic which has had a toll on the economy has forced many families out of work, making them paupers. As we speak now, most people are not working, are sick and not even able to afford a meal a day,” he said. In April, Nyong’o mobilised funds by leading his government in taking pay cuts to support vulnerable families in the county. The fund was to be managed by the Kisumu County Social and Economic Council. The executive gave Sh3.7 million in monies collected from the pay cuts. Nyong'o and his deputy Mathews Owili donated 30 per cent of their salaries for three months. The executive committee also took 20 per cent cuts while chief officers had 15 per cent of their salaries deducted. The funds were added to the Sh200 million that was passed by the county assembly for mitigation measures towards the coronavirus.  (edited by o. owino)
