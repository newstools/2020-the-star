Several Chelsea players have not returned for pre-season training after testing positive for Covid-19, according to reports in British media. The reports did not name the players and Chelsea did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Players who test positive have to self isolate for 10 days and return a negative coronavirus test before they can take part in training. Sheffield United, Brighton & Hove Albion and West Ham United were among the other Premier League clubs to report positive Covid-19 cases in recent weeks, the Times said. Frank Lampard’s side, who finished fourth last season, kick off their campaign against Brighton on September 14. Meanwhile, Chelsea have signed England left-back Ben Chilwell from Leicester on a five-year deal for £45m. Chilwell is Chelsea’s third addition of the summer after the arrivals of winger Hakim Ziyech, 27, from Ajax and striker Timo Werner, 24, from RB Leipzig. The defender, 23, is a Leicester academy product who made his debut for the club in 2015, and had a contract with the Foxes until 2024. He missed the final five matches of the 2019-20 season with a foot injury. Chelsea took fourth place and a Champions League place at the expense of Leicester on the final day of the Premier League season in July. “I’m looking forward to being a part of this young, dynamic squad led by Frank Lampard as we challenge for honours next season,” said Chilwell, who has 11 England caps.
