Recruitment services provider  BrighterMonday Kenya has launched a new Employer Handbook to help human resources (HR) specialists and business leaders on best practices during and post-crisis working environments. This comes in the wake of the current Covid-19 pandemic, which has significantly affected business operations especially at the workplace. Due to the global pandemic,  businesses have had  to change their internal structures and adapt to new realities of working such as social distancing while striving to keep operations going. “As the changing nature and typology of work continues to unfold, organisations must reconsider how they design jobs, organise work, and plan for the future," said Emmanuel Mutuma, Chief Executive Officer, Brighter Monday. The Employer Handbook is a first of kind employer solution in the market and is expected to serve as a valuable tool for companies looking to foster resilience, enhance competitiveness, and prepare for future disruptions. Some of the pertinent issues tackled in the handbook include curated expert advice and research insights into HR best practices during crises such as Covid-19 including hiring decisions, hiring processes, remote working policies and tools. Speaking during the launch, Nick Kasidi, head of talent management, East African Breweries Limited, noted that the Employer Handbook came at an opportune time as the business sector adapts to the new normal of working remotely. He urged business leaders and recruiters to take advantage of the insights provided in the handbook to navigate through this Covidd-19 period and beyond. The handbook borrows from research and new knowledge corroborated by Gallup, Inc., University of Stellenbosch Business School, Harvard Business Review, MIT Sloan Management Review, Society of Human Resource Management among others.
