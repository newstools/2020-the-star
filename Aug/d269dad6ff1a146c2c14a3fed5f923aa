Former Garsen MP Danson Mungatana was on Tuesday arrested over suspected involvement in fraud. Mungatana was arrested alongside a man he said was his client at a city hotel for what police are calling obtaining money by false pretences. Police reports indicate that the former legislator had been implicated in a scheme to defraud a woman under the guise of facilitating her being awarded a tender. Nairobi police boss Rashid Yakub told journalists the woman reported to the Military Police at the Department of Defence with tender documents that turned out to be fake. The woman claimed a person who had identified himself as a senior military officer at DoD had given her the documents and said he was in a position to help her win a Sh70-million cereals supply and building tender. "The said person requested he be given a down payment of Sh1 million which was handed to him in July 14, 2020," Yakub said. According to him, the woman was instructed to meet her client who was pushing for the tender at a city hotel. In the company of two other women, she went to the hotel and found a man identified as Collins Waweru together with Danson Mungatana who was introduced as the senior person pushing for the tenders at DOD," the police boss said. Mungatana and his co-accused are said to have requested for another Sh1 million to facilitate the deal. Yakub said it is at that point the women got suspicious and informed the police. The former legislator and Waweru were questioned by DCI officers in Kilimani.
