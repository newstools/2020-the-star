A British legislator has asked the government to include in its national history curriculum the massacre of 1,800 Sotik men, women and children in 1905. The community had refused forcible removal from the ancestral home by British colonialist forces to Gwassi in Homa Bay. Revolting the landgrab, the 1,800 of over 20,000 people were killed. Opposition Labour MP Claudia Naomi Webbe has written to UK Education minister Gavin Williamson to include the massacre in the history curriculum to "teach the true brutal history of the British empire and the legacy of imperialism, colonialism and racism." Webbe, who represents Leicester East, in particular, wants the British government to respond to a 2018 petition by Kericho county government to the UN Special Rapporteur regarding 90,000 acres of land allegedly grabbed by the British empire and given to white settlers. As part of the alleged grabbing, she said, approximately 115,000 people were forcibly removed. Thousands also died due to harsh environment, disease, malnutrition and lack of accommodation or means to sustain their population. "The UN Special Rapporteur wrote to Her Majesty's government requesting a response. None has been received," she wrote. The lawmaker cited the National Lands Commission's 2019 determination that "the Kipsigis and the Talai not only unjustly lost their property but were also subjected to various forms of human rights violations in the process." Webbe said the massacre has been brushed off the British history and "there has never been any form of apology and no reparation ever offered for this act of historic genocide." "This demonstrates how the brutal history of the British Empire continues to cast a long and enduring on the present-day global dynamics." As part of the Black Lives Matter reckoning in the West, the MP said, it was time for the UK government to confront the racist brutality of colonisation and include it in their curriculum.
