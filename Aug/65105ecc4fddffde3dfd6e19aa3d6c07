Covid-19 restrictions on bars and the curfew have closed avenues for sex work and caused the rise in defilement cases, a psychologist has said. Former Mathari Mental Hospital director Njagi Kumantha said some of the culprits are unable to get satisfaction from sex workers or mistresses. Kumantha lamented that children are being defiled by relatives, neighbours and even religious leaders as schools remain closed since March. Kumantha, who consults on mental disorders in Nairobi and Embu, urged men to solve marital problems through counselling. The psychiatrist further said people should make themselves busy, avoid alcohol at home and illicit drugs and seek alternative ways of earning a living during the pandemic. Edited by R.Wamochie
