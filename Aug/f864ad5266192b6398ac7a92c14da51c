Deputy President William Ruto now says Jubilee party is not functioning well because of 'busy bodies' who have no idea about the party's philosophy. "The party has been hijacked by busy bodies and con men and brokers like Murathe and company," he said during an interview on Citizen TV on Thursday. Earlier during an interview with the Star on Thursday, Ruto said he was working to solve the issues facing Jubilee but he was ready to consider other options. The Deputy President said he went out of his way to help President Uhuru Kenyatta form a national political party as a way to get rid of "ethnicity, marginalization and [to] entrench gender balance". "The party has been hijacked by brokers who are running it through fear. Their word is the party position. The same virus that infected KANU and killed it after the 2002 elections has come to Jubilee," Ruto said. This is the first time Ruto has boldly spoken about the troubles in Jubilee after his political union with Uhuru fell apart. Ruto has been sidelined in Jubilee with some of his key allies, including former Majority leaders Aden Duale and Kipchumba Murkomen, being kicked out of parliamentary leadership positions. Ruto says he is 'not bothered by junior people calling him names' and he is only concerned on delivering what the 40 million Kenyans expect from their Government. "There is something wrong with the juniors who insult their seniors, but i'm not bothered about them, it's their loss," he said.
