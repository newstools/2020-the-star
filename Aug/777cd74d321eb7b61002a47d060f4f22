Wasafi's Rayvanny says he is in a good place now that he and his baby mama Fahyma have separated. The two are blessed with a son. The couple separated last year after Rayvanny was accused of being unfaithful. Over the weekend, the ‘Kwetu’ hitmaker said he is enjoying his single life. "Sana, naenjoy sana, it's life, yeah," he told Dizzim online. Rayvanny was rumoured to be dating a video vixen, claims he has since denied. Previously, Fahyma was rumoured to have been sent away from Esma’s wedding reception. She posted a video wearing a red-carpet gown. It was later reported she was denied access to the event, according to Tanzanian media pundits.
