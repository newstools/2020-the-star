The Head of State wished the family God's comfort and fortitude as they come to terms with his demise. Deputy president William Ruto described Kajembe as a  charismatic, progressive and diligent leader who served the people of Changamwe with courage and distinction. "Ramadhan Seif Kajembe was a focused and committed public servant who will be remembered for his wise counsel and leadership above party politics,"Ruto said in a tweet. "Our thoughts and prayers are with the Kajembe family, friends and the people of Changamwe during this tough time." ODM party leader Raila Odinga on his part eulogised Kajembe as a fearless right activist and  a dedicated servant of the people he served. "My sincere condolences to the family of Ramadhan Seif Kajembe,  He was a dedicated servant of the people of Changamwe whose rights he defended without fear. May his soul Rest In Eternal Peace," Raila said. Mombasa governor Hassan Joho said the deceased will be remembered mainly for his generosity. "He served the people of Mombasa with diligence, utmost sincerity and stood out as a dependable shield in defending the rights of our people.," he said. Sources have confirmed he will be buried at 7 pm at the Kajembe family cemetery in Changamwe. That is where his second wife was also buried two weeks ago.
