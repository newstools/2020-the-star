The Kilifi county assembly on Tuesday rejected a report by the executive on the expenditure of Sh220 million emergency funds for Covid-19. The oversight committee led by speaker Jimmy Kahindi and consisting of all MCAs termed the two-page interim report as shallow and demanded a comprehensive one. They summoned Gabriel Katana of Devolution, his Health counterpart Charles Dadu and Finance's Samuel Nzai over the expenditure. During the meeting convened in the county assembly chambers, it emerged that Sh10 million was paid for the supply of bar soaps. The committee heard that the county paid Sh46.1 million for supply and delivery of seven ventilators with their accessories. Assorted non-pharmaceutical items were bought at Sh23.7 million. The report stated that they bought seven ICU beds at Sh4 million, 100 normal hospital beds, bedside cabinets and mattresses at Sh12.6 million. Other payments included supply and delivery of three cardiac monitors at Sh4.8 million, five washing machines worth Sh4.6 million and certified maize and green grams seeds at Sh19.6 million. The committee also heard that the executive paid Sh20.7 million for supply and delivery of 108,000kg of dry beans and another Sh43.7 million for 18,900 bales of maize flour. The executive spent Sh8.9 million on transport, Sh8.1 million on staff allowances for the Covid-19 response team and paid a tax of Sh2.2 million, all of which amounted to Sh208,361,559 . Kahindi wanted to know how the funds, which were approved in a supplementary budget as an emergency fund due to the pandemic, were spent. The question was raised by Kakuyuni MCA Nixon Mramba seeking to know how the funds were used since there was a lot of donor support from organisations and well wishers. Edited by Henry Makori
