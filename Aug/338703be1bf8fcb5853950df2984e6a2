Seven Turkana residents tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total cases in the county to 62. Turkana executive for Health and Sanitation Jane Ajele confirmed the new infection. She said out 62 confirmed cases, 32 patients had recovered while 30 were undergoing treatment. Twenty are in Kakuma and 10 are in Kanamkemer Subcounty Hospital in Lodwar. Most cases of Covid-19 reported in Turkana are of truck drivers who travelled from Mombasa and Nairobi to South Sudan via Malaba, Uganda. Ajele said since the resumption of flights there was an influx of people from Nairobi and most of them don’t know their status. “We are conducting community mass testing  and we have found out there is local transmission of the virus as seven people have tested positive for Covid-19,” she said. Ajele said the porous border of Kenya and South Sudan allowed people to sneak into the country to Kakuma refugee camp. “We are sensitising our people to continue adhering to government directives and health measures in order to flatten the curve of Covid-19,” she said. Turkana police commander Samuel Ndanyi said Kakuma refugee camp is still on lockdown to restrict movement of refuges into and outside the camp. Turkana has 154 isolation beds against 300 in each county as directed by President Uhuru Kenyatta. Turkana Governor Josphat Nanok in July launched a three-bed intensive care unit and a four-bed high dependency unit at Lodwar County Referral Hospital. Edited by Henry Makori
