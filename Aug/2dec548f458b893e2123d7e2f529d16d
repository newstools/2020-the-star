The Kenya Bureau of Standards has announced plans to destroy seized pipes and construction materials worth Sh10 million. The materials seized are said to be from five construction companies that have been dealing in substandard products bearing illegal standardisation marks. The five companies include Kikuyu Pipes and Fitting Center (KPFC), Yuangyang Plastic Company Limited (YY), Doer Industrial Company Ltd (DOER), Vintz Industries (VEER) and Kansun Pipe Ltd (KANSUN). The five companies have been directed to discontinue manufacturing or offering to sell the affected pipes and to correct their production. The substandard products will be destroyed at the expense of the owners. At the same time, Kebs has suspended Standardisation Mark permits of the affected products with immediate effect. Kebs Managing Director Bernard Njiraini has asked all companies to ensure that their products are in line with the set standards. “It is the responsibility of the manufacturing company to ensure continued product compliance to set standardization. Processing, manufacturing, stoking and/ or offering for sale of substandard goods or products that do not comply with set standards is prohibited by the laws of Kenya,” Njiraini said.
