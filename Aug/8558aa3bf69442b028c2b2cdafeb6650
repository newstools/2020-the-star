Singer Wyre says his craft was inspired by Michael Jackson, and as an eight-year-old, he knew he wanted to be a performer. Speaking to Kiss 100's Jinx, Wyre said his mum came from the UK with a VHS tape of the Motown 25 celebrations. "There is a point Michael Jackson stepped out and did his first solo performance for Billie Jean. Right there is where I knew, 'Yo! This is where I need to be,'" he said. "He was an amazing performer and I always strive to engage the crowd and nothing beats a live band performance." Wyre is among the few Kenyan artistes shining through his reggae and dancehall songs. The 'Nakupenda pia' hitmaker says the ability to fuse English and Swahili enabled him to navigate to the other side.
