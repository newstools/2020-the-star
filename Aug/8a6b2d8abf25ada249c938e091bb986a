President Uhuru Kenyatta has sent a message of condolence to the family of former Likoni MP Masoud Mwahima who passed away on Tuesday morning. The President said Mwahima was an elder statesman, witty leader and astute grassroots mobiliser who leaves behind a huge legacy of development. “Mzee Mwahima was an approachable, witty and, visionary elder and leader who offered wise counsel and outstanding service to the people of Mombasa especially his Likoni Constituency for decades,” Uhuru said. He added that. "As a politician, Mzee Mwahima was a strong champion for community development projects, a trait that enabled him to rise through Mombasa politics having served as a councillor, Mayor of Mombasa and MP for Likoni Constituency for two terms.” Deputy President William Ruto eulogised Mwahima as a smart and formidable politician who was always a firm defender of his people’s and national interest. Ruto said Mwahima served the people of Mombasa, and in particular, Likoni, with sustained commitment, passion and integrity. “A leader of great humility, Mheshimiwa Mwahima was tireless, fearless and a tenacious debater whose domination in our country’s political scene will be fondly remembered,” Ruto said. Mombasa Governor Ali Hassan Joho said Mwahima was a pillar of strength. Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko described Mwahima as a committed champion of people's rights. The former MP and also a one-time mayor of Mombasa has been battling health complications. The family says he died of asthma complications but had other ailments.  He was 78 years old.
