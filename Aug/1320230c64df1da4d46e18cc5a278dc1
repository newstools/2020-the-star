Officers working at the Devolution ministry were on Monday ordered to self isolate for two weeks after 18 officers tested positive for the coronavirus. PS Charles Sunkuli, in a memo, said tests were done on 128 samples on July 23. Workers will self isolate until Augst 16 and will be expected back in the office on August 17 for another round of mass testing. The cases come as the country on Monday registered  544 new cases of Covid-19 bringing the country's total to 22,597. This was out of 2,653 samples that were tested in the last 24 hours, bringing the cumulative number of tests done in the country to 318,376. Meanwhile, the number of Kenyans possibly infected with Covid-19 has been scaled down to at least 1.6 million after further analysis of antibody tests. Exposure in the entire population could be higher because the 1.6 million are only those aged 15 to 64 years as at June 16. The analysis, done by scientists from the Kenya Medical Research Institute-Wellcome Trust in Kilifi, has been endorsed by the Ministry of Health and submitted for publication to a medical journal.
