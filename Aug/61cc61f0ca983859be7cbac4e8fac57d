Services at the Makueni county commissioner’s office in Wote town on Tuesday were disrupted after the premises were closed for fumigation. Residents who were seeking services were turned away. Health executive Andrew Mulwa said a staff member tested positive for Covid-19 on Sunday hence the need to fumigate the premises to protect other officers and members of the public. He urged staff members to work from home, if possible, to curb the spread of the virus. Mulwa also asked residents to limit their visits to the offices. “We have fumigated all the offices, corridors and the entire compound as a precautionary measure,” he said. Mulwa noted that the coronavirus was quickly spreading across the county and called for adherence to the measures put in place by the government to contain it. "The disease has now spread to all the subcounties, including Mbooni and Kaiti." Mulwa disclosed that the county has in the past one week recorded five deaths and 20 active cases. "We currently have about 30 Covid-19 patients receiving treatment in our health facilities. However, we have challenges in testing and we urge the national government to intervene and ensure we get results on time," he said. Edited by A.N
