The Kenya National Union of Nurses has criticised ODM's statement calling for an audit of the Kenya Medical Supplies Authority over corruption claims. ODM also warned against a quick condemnation of the agency days after a TV exposé alleged massive irregularities. But KNUN secretary-general Seth Panyako said it was disheartening for ODM to start supporting corruption. “Corruption in the Ministry of Health is now on a higher notch at the expense of frontline health workers of whom 16 have lost their lives and another 900 fighting for their lives because we are not getting PPE. No one cares for them but ODM thinks it’s their right to defend graft,” Panyako said in Kakamega on Sunday. He cautioned ODM over claims that the media had blown the saga at Kemsa out of proportion, saying were it not for the media, the scandal would not have been known. ODM secretary-general Edwin Sifuna on Saturday said the media often goes on a "sensationalist extravaganza" and reports on "half-baked information" without showing exactly what happened. “Sifuna is not DCI, EACC or Transparency International and therefore cannot convert himself into an investigating agency. He must stick to his lane,” Panyako said. He told Sifuna to get out the affairs of the health sector and stop protecting corrupt leaders. “Let it be the last warning to ODM. It is the responsibility of every Kenyan, including leaders, to ensure the fight against corruption is taken to a different notch. “We will not allow people using national platforms like the ODM party to perpetuate impunity and corruption. “We will not allow ODM to defend graft when Kenyans are dying because of poor health services,” Panyako said. He said if the trend continues, then the gains ODM party leader Raila Odinga has made in the past in the fight for first and second liberation will go into the drain.
