Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen has reiterated that he will not be part of the team in the Senate drumming for the much-contested third basis revenue sharing formula. In a statement on Monday, Murkomen said that his stand to oppose the proposed formula has attracted questions, yet his county is among those listed to benefit if the formula goes through. "I would like to state unequivocally that my position and that of my colleagues, Senators Cleophas Malala (Kakamega), Mithika Linturi (Meru), Johnson Sakaja (Nairobi), Boniface Kabaka (Machakos) among others is predicated on our personal conviction and belief that the sharing of national revenue should not and must not be a zero-sum game where for some counties to gain, others must lose,” Murkomen said. As Kenyans wait to see how senators will handle the issue during its eighth debate over the same on Tuesday, Murkomen says that supporting injustice against other counties will haunt the beneficiaries in the future. “I will not, in good conscience, support a formula that seeks to rob and starve small and marginalised counties…just to ensure my county - Elgeyo Marakwet gains because today, it is these marginalised counties that are on the chopping board, but tomorrow it will be Elgeyo Marakwet,” he added. He said senators should focus on fighting to have national government release billions of money to counties. “That’s our role and not to bankrupt sister counties. That’s akin to robbing Peter to pay Paul.” The senator has further said that the nation’s unity is at stake. “The very tendons that hold us together as a country are being cut off, and the spirit of fairness and equality which has for decades been our saving grace is being sacrificed at the altar of selfishness and greed.”
