Eliud Owalo has resigned as a member of the Musalia Mudavadi's ANC party. In a statement on Friday, Owalo said he felt it was "imperative to create ample space within the Party". "... to enable the ANC strategically position itself effectively in the operational environment and craft a suitable road map moving forward without feeling suffocated by my views and suggestions," he said. "I also want to create a reasonable leg-room between myself and Mudavadi to safeguard and sustain our personal friendship, respect and positive professional engagements that has been in existence over a span of 25 years." His exit comes just a day after Barrack Muluka resigned as secretary general of the party citing similar reasons of giving the party 'space' to strategise. In a letter addressed to Mudavadi on Wednesday, Muluka said ANC needs a fresh start ahead of 2022 polls. "I doubt that i could add more value to what i have done so far. Moreover, it is now fitting that the space around you should be decongested. this will allow you to make critical decisions on the population and leadership of the party under the new constitution," he said. Muluka said his resignation will ease  Mudavadi's making of personal political choices in the lead up to the 2022 elections.
