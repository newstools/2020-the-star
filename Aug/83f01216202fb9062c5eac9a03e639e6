South Korean electronics giant LG has established a program to enlighten Kenyans on the latest artificial intelligence products under its banner. The LG ThinQ Experience Zone will allow customers to test out various LG electronic products that are ingrained with its ThinQ technology. These include OLED Tvs, Nanocell Tvs, InstaView refrigerators, DualCool Floor Standing Air Conditioners and the AI DD Washing Machine. “LG continues to pursue innovation to improve home living and we are now excited to be bringing that same passion and technology leadership in Kenya as we continue to enhance the shopping experience and comfort of Kenyan consumers.” Haewoong Kim, LG’s Marketing Manager, said. The ThinQ Zone, located at Hotpoint Shop on the ground floor of Sarit Centre, will also be a nerve centre for LG's trading partners in the country to reach out to their customers with their AI-powered products. “AI is the next frontier in technological evolution and as leaders in home appliances and consumer electronics, we have a responsibility to make AI more approachable in order to improve their quality of life for homeowners,” Kim said. LG is one of the electronics giants that have integrated AI and deep learning algorithm in their products to enable users tailor these products to their needs and save on energy. LG ThinQ-integrated products can be monitored using a smartphone app as well as voice-control as is the case for its OLED and Nanocell TVs.
