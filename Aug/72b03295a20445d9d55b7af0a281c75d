Four applicants have made the final shortlist as Kenya Rugby Union (KRU) seek to fill the vacant head coach slot for the Kenya Sevens team. The final list includes three Kenyans and a foreigner. Director of rugby, Thomas Odundo, said interviews were done two weeks ago and decision on the successful candidate will be announced either by end of the week or the first week of September . Sources hinted that considering the current tough economic situation, the board is likely to settle for a local coach to cushion the the federation from paying high salaries to a foreign coach. The seat fell vacant after New Zealander, Paul Feeney, left on mutual agreement on June 12 after the coronavirus pandemic threw the training programme into disarray. World Rugby then cancelled the the final four legs of the circuit thus—Paris, London, Hong Kong and Singapore— earlier planned for September and October. World Ruby further cancelled the entire season including the opening legs in Dubai and Cape Town in December, owing to the pandemic with the season now likely to start in New Zealand and Australia in 2021. The successful applicant will be Shujaa’s 10th coach in the last nine years, who atmost have served for a year. The list of coaches at Shujaa in the past decade includes former international Mitch Ocholla, current USA 7s coach Mike Friday, former South African 7s tactician Paul Treu, Benjamin Ayimba, Innocent Simiyu and Paul Murunga. Feeney led Shujaa to the Africa Cup Sevens crown which served as a Olympic qualifier to the Tokyo Olympic Games as well as winning the 2019 Safari Sevens at the RFUEA ground. He, however, had a mixed performance in the World Sevens Series with Shujaa finishing 12th out of 15.
