Football Kenya Federation (FKF) Coast National Executive member aspirant Gabriel Mghendi has welcomed the roadmap and election guidelines recently released by the Electoral Board. Mghendi, who doubles up as the vice chairman of the FKF National legal committee appealed to all the interested participants to take advantage of the relaxed election requirements and seek elective positions in the forthcoming polls. “I am happy with the newly released road map and guideline provided by the FKF Electoral Board. It is my sincere hope that more participants will join the race and this will offer a healthy challenge in the spirit of democracy.” Mgendi further called for a ceasefire in the bickering that has been witnessed in the past now that acceptable solution has been found. FKF elections have twice been nullified by the Sports Dispute Tribunal—the first elections due to the perceived lack of public participation on the electoral code and the second due to the contentious candidate eligibility criteria. The FKF Electoral Board on August 11, 2020 released the road map and guidelines to the elections as per the statues of the world governing body, Fifa.
