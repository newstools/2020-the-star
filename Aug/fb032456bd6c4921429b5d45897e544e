The Karen Hospital last week appreciated the selfless service by police officers in safeguarding Kenyans during these tough times of the pandemic. Led by the CEO and executive director of the Heart to Heart Foundation, Juliet Nyaga, the hospital donated 1,000 washable masks and surgical spirit to the police. The package also included thermo guns and hand wash cream. The event took place at Police Headquarters at Vigilance House, Nairobi.
