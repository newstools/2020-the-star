The stalemate at the Senate over the new revenue sharing formula will delay development in counties countrywide, Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry has warned. The row has thrown counties into crisis as they await the tussle to end to receive their allocation from Treasury. KNCCI Vihiga branch chairman Billy Nyonje wants the Senate to come up with a  formula that is in line with governors’ strategic development plans. He said strategic planning had already taken place and slashing their budgets would ruin the plans for the 2020-2021 financial year. The proposed formula, he said, will sabotage devolution. “That formula will affect development, economy, health and population at large as people will tent to move where resources are,” Nyonje said. He said if the contested formula is implemented, some counties will only  pay salaries with no money for development. He said a good formula should not be biased in favour of certain regions. "Senators should work hand in hand to solve the stalemate on the floor and come up with an amicable solution that will keep the devolved units going," he said. “Though counties have not performed well, we have seen development compared to  when we were under the national government,” he added.
