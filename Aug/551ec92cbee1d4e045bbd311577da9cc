The body of a General Service Unit officer, who had been missing since Saturday, has been recovered from Kipnai river in Baringo county. Hillary Kiprono Kemboi is suspected to have drowned on his way  from Arror market to his base at Loiwat camp. “The body was found floating on the swollen Kipnai River about three kilometres from the camp,” according to OB report. Platoon commander Samuel Maranga reported on Sunday that the 25-year-old officer had asked for permission to go shopping at the market on Saturday. He left the camp in the morning on a motorbike. He did not return to the camp. “It was established that the deceased was last seen at Kipnai shopping centre on Saturday at 20:00 hours waiting for the heavy rain to subside. He must have attempted to cross the flooded river when he drowned,” the OB report said. The body is at Baringo County Referral Hospital mortuary.  - mwaniki fm
