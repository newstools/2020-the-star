Controversial pastor Robert Burale says he lost friends after he tested positive for corona. Speaking on Jalang'o TV yesterday, an emotional Burale said even his close friends wished him death. Burale says while he was not bothered by those who said he was faking his illness, he was hurt by comments from some his close friends. Burale made headlines after he announced he had tested positive for corona on social media. Hours later, he was trending because, according to KOT, the pastor was faking illness as a publicity stunt. "I got some screenshots while in hospital and I wasn't hurt by what they were saying but some people who spoke," he said. "People you've invited for dinner, people who stood with me and then went and wrote 'I canâ€™t wait to wake up to 'RIP Burale'." The man of God and motivational speaker added that since then, he learnt to reduce the number of seats at his dinner table because he no longer has time for dilute friendships. "I will tell you one thing if you think you have five friends, I will advice you to go to the hospital and get checked," he said. "My burden was heavy. It is only by the grace of God I walked out healthy both physically and mentally," he said. Burale then advised comedian Jalang'o that he must not think people around him are genuinely there for him but some are there because of his platform. He told him to remember those who stood with him when he went to pay his dowry because those are his true friends. "Today if your platform is taken away from you, no one will remember you. People sit with you but not to support you but to look for ways to hurt you," he said.
