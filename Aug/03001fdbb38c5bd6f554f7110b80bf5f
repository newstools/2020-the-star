The Kenyan embassy in Lebanon has said the process of issuing the Emergency Travel Certificate (ETC) to Kenyans stranded in Lebanon following the deadly explosion last week has been frustrated by those camping outside the consulate. Through a statement on Friday, the Kenyan Embassy in Kuwait said that efforts by security agents to restore order and allow seamless activities has not been successful. “The police have therefore asked the honorary consul and his officers to stay away for security reasons,” the embassy said. So far, the embassy has received documents from 43 Kenyans for facilitation and the number is expected to rise. The embassy has also urged stranded Kenyans to cooperate and provide necessary information to fast-track the process of returning to Kenya. Also, the consulate is working with some of the Non-Governmental organisations to necessities such as shelter and food. The paperwork for issuing ETC and obtaining clearance from the immigration department usually takes one week but those with valid documents can leave at anytime. Clearing the exit documents might also be slowed since the military took over management of essential services from the public. The state of emergency in Beirut has was extended following a devastating blast that took place on August 4, claiming more than 160 lives and leaving many people with injuries. On Thursday, hundreds of Kenyans protested in Beirut demanding flights home and saying they were being exploited and mistreated by Kenya's Lebanese-run consulate. They said they cannot afford the Sh40,000 for a ticket to Nairobi, as money is virtually worthless and many have lost everything.
