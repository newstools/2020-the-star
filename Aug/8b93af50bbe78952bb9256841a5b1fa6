A Mwingi farmer has shifted to banana farming after discovering that mangoes have low returns. Patrick Musyoka, a farmer in Katakani area of Kyuso subcounty in Kitui, practices irrigation along River Thunguthu. Musyoka had over 100 mango trees but has since changed his line of farming. Three years ago, he began felling mango trees which had been on his shamba for over 10 years and replacing them with bananas. “The trees had taken a lot of space on my shamba but the fruits were less profitable,” Musyoka said. He said once mangoes ripen, they flood the market and their value decreases. Musyoka spoke at his farm when agricultural officers visited him at the weekend. Now he has over 150 banana plants and is still planting more. The bananas bring him better income than mangoes. Musyoka who solely depends on his farm said that he is able to financially support his family. “I sell different banana seedlings between Sh200 and Sh250 each. The banana bunches go for Sh500 Sh600 each,” the farmer said. He said that banana farming is more profitable, occupies less space, and is not highly attacked by pests like mangoes. However, his new challenge is that he has to ensure the crop has enough water and organic manure, which is difficult to find. Edited by Henry Makori
