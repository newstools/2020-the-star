The Court of Appeal has rejected an application by Kenya Pipeline Company (KPC) to temporarily suspend a demand for payment of Sh4.4 billion to a Lebanese company that constructed the Mombasa-Nairobi pipeline. In a ruling delivered by judges Roselyn Nambuye, Wanjiru Karanja and Hannah Okwengu, they said KPC failed to convince them that the appeal will be rendered useless, if the payment is not stopped. The judges said there was uncontroverted evidence that Zakhem International Construction limited completed the works and handed the pipeline to the state agency. “As the execution is in regard to a liquidated amount, there is no way the appeal, if successful will be rendered nugatory,” the judges ruled. In June, Justice Grace Nzioka had directed KPC to pay the amount within 30 days, even as the parties proceed with the hearing of other matters, touching on the construction of the pipeline four years ago. “Taking into account the aforesaid and evidence herein in total, I find and hold the applicants claim of EOT 1-4 is not in dispute and therefore, I enter judgment in favour of the applicant in the sum of USD44,019,024 as claimed,” the judge said. The judge further said the interest arising from the amount, will be determined alongside other unresolved claims. As a way of resolving the matter, the court suggested to the parties to consider a third party intervention to reconcile the accounts and settle the dispute. She said if they fail to agree, the matter will be determined by the court. KPC however rushed to the Court of Appeal arguing that the judge arrived at her decision erroneously. The court also heard that the judge delved into the merits of the case during the hearing of an application and arrived at a wrong conclusion. Further, KPC said the amount will be paid by taxpayers yet they are not sure of recovering the billions, in case the appeal succeeds, since the company has no known assets in Kenya.
