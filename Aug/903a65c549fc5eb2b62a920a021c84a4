Singer Esther Akoth alias Akothee says divorce is worse than death when children are involved. For 10 years, the single mother of five was married to her first love and father of her three daughters, Jared Okello. In a long post on Instagram, Akothee said divorce is something she would never wish for any parent. "I would never wish for any parents to divorce after living together for years and bringing up their children as a family," she said. She, however, advised that no one should stay in a toxic, violent and unsatisfactory relationship. "If it ever happens that there is need to break up, then please try do it decently without involving your children," she said. Akothee says she tried to cover her children's eyes never to see their father as an enemy, although it was hard. She says she took bullets, broke down when bills were overwhelming and made sure her children never saw her tears. Akothee says her children came to learn of her struggles on social media after she first shared her past. "My children thought I have all solutions in the world and that's my strength," she said, adding that she made sure she gave them the best life. "I forced every man in my life to love my children equally but never asked them to call any of them daddy." Akothee and her first baby daddy are still friends and the children meet him. "It was difficult at times when they insisted they wanted to talk to him. This broke me down, knowing he has moved on with another family and calling him will distract his peace and the other family might feel like I am interfering with their peace," she said. In a recent interview, her daughter Vesha Okello opened up how her parent's divorce affected her life. She said the situation left her confused and angry as she could not comprehend why they couldnâ€™t work things out.
