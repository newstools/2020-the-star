After sitting out for close to year, former Western Stima midfielder Augustine Kuta is hoping to return to action next month. Kuta got injured in October last year when he tore a meniscus on the right knee. He underwent surgery in December at Coptic Hospital to trim the torn part of the meniscus and was to be out for up six months. However, his contract at Western Stima was terminated in February which affected his recovery. The power men also terminated the contracts of other injured players David Ojwang’, Kevin Ochieng and Luke Ochieng. They were all injured while playing for the team which was formerly sponsored by Kenya Power. “With good rehabilitation and physiotherapy, I was to be out for between four and six months. Following the termination of my contract, it became a bit tough financially to pay for rehabilitation sessions and that derailed my return to active football,” said the former Nairobi Stima player. He added: “I’m now getting better, thanks to the best sports physios Patrick Ngusale and Noel Mandi. They have helped me and I’m targeting to be back by the end of September.” Even though he has not received any offers at the moment, Kuta is upbeat that he will be back in the Kenya Premier League. The Moi University finance graduate further noted that he has used the Covid-19 pandemic period to ‘refresh his studies’ as he also worked on his recovery. “Covid-19 has been a blow to all of us but I have taken it positively. I have used this opportunity to refresh things I learned in school and put them in practice in my side hustle,” he added. The midfielder runs a side hustle under Kuta Collections where he sells sports equipment such as football boots, sports shoes, balls, shin guards, agility ladders, and resistance bands, among others.
