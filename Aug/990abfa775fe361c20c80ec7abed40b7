The man behind a con syndicate who has been defrauding unsuspecting Kenyans  has been arrested by DCI detectives. Director George Kinoti had on Wednesday issued an alert for John Ng'ethe Mwaura and put him on its wanted list "We can confirm that this individual is in our custody," DCI said via twitter on Thursday. "We thank all for the information we have received since we issued this alert. " Details of his arrest has not been released yet as investigations kick off. Kinoti said Kenyans had lost thousands of shillings at the hands of fraudsters led by Mwaura. Last week, DCI detectives based in Nakuru arrested a notorious robbery with violence suspect.
