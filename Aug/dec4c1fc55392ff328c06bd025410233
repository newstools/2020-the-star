Keroche Breweries CEO Tabitha Karanja has opened up how the death of her last-born daughter Tecra Muigai broke heart into pieces. The late Keroche Breweries heiress died on May 2 while in the company of her boyfriend Omar Lali at their at Shela Village, Lamu home. She suffered cerebral oedema resulting from a fall on April 27 from a staircase at a house she shared with Lali in Lamu . "Her death left me brokenhearted without an idea of how to move forward. People say to give it time," Karanja said. "But truth is that time changes nothing. What has changed is my eyes have been opened to more truths." Karanja while commemorating 100 days since her death said 29 years ago when Tecra was gifted to her, she was drawn to her insatiable curiosity. "Through the years i benefited from her outlook of the world. She became my sounding board in my very private life and my public life as an entrepreneur," she said. "I dearly miss her counsel and company." Karanja appreciated everyone whose lives Tecra touched and inspired while he was alive. "I've heard from friends in 20 countries whose lives Tecra touched and inspired. Her life proves what differentiates people is - opportunity," she said. "Thank you all for prayers that helped ease our pain. For those in a similar place, i pray for grace to live & grieve at the same time." Tecra Muigai’s boyfriend Omar Lali ,54, was to be charged after the DPP reviewed toxicological evidence, detailed postmortem reports, phone records, other documentary exhibits and witness statements. Lead prosecutor Eddie Kadebe and his colleague Zakaria Kiongo said they were satisfied that there was sufficient evidence to have Lali take a plea for murder. Lali was released on May 27 by the same court on a Sh300, 000 bond and two sureties provided by his mother and brother-in-law. Until her death, Tecra was the strategy and innovations director at Keroche Breweries.
