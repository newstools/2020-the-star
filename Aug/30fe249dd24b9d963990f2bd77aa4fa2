@Waithaka06 A court in Nanyuki town has issued an order restraining the Laikipia government from evicting tenants from land behind Governor Ndiritu Muriithi's office. Francis Ndegwa, Esther Wanja and Peter Mukora, representing Stephen Gakuu, obtained the order from principal magistrate Ben Mararo in an application that listed the county as the defendant. In his August 7, 2020, ruling, Mararo certified the application as urgent and ordered the applicants and the defendant to refrain from interfering with the land until the application is heard and determined. "...the defendant/ applicant, his agents, employees, servants or anyone claiming through him be and are hereby restrained by a temporary injunction from selling, transferring, charging, developing, wasting, damaging, evicting tenants or howsoever interfering in any way with those parcels of land pending the hearing and determination of this application," the magistrate directed. The parcels of land listed as suit properties in the application are Number Nanyuki Block 6/186, UNS Residential Plots numbers "C" and "D" and UNS Residential Plot number "F". The principal magistrate scheduled the mention of the matter for August 18, 2020. On Monday, the county government's head of legal department Alexander Muchemi, in a letter to the applicants, confirmed that they had received the court order. "We are in receipt of a court order dated the 7th of August 2020 in relation to the referenced matter and in which the matter is to be mentioned on 18th of August 2020," Muchemi said.
