The senator on Friday visited KRA office to seek explanation as to why his accounts were frozen, where he met KRA commissioners. After a lengthy meeting, Malala said that the authority established that he had no debt that could cause his accounts to be frozen. “We have a group of lobbyists who are moving around the town trying to coerce and intimidate senators to have them vote in a specific way,” Malala said. He continued that “I will not be intimidated and I will maintain my stand on the Third Generation Formula, the stand that champions for a WIN-WIN formula and a WIN-WIN situation for our counties,” Malala said. Malala has asked those behind the intimidation to respect the democracy of the legislators and their decisions. The senator has reiterated he will not stand with the formula that will divide the country on the basis of marginalisation. He has also called upon the senators who are supporting the formula to negotiate with others on the same. The senators will have another special sitting on Monday, in an attempt to unlock their differences for the ninth time. His accounts and that of his Meru counterpart Mithika Linturi had been frozen under unclear circumstances. ““Yes (my accounts have been frozen), but I have decided to remain silent on the matter though I remain firm on my decision to save Kenya,” Malala said. The senator said that it was established during the meeting that he does not owe KRA anything. “It has been confirmed in all my accounts, both personal and business that I owe no debt to KRA. In fact, KRA owes me sh324,” Malala said.
