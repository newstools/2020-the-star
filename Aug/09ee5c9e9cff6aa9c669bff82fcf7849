The government is working on normalising relations with Tanzania, Principal Secretary for the East African Community Kevit Desai has said. His assurance comes some days after border communities in Kwale asked President Uhuru Kenyatta and his Tanzanian counterpart John Magufuli to solve their differences. Desai said in Kwale on Monday that the government is making steady efforts to reach mutual agreement that will strengthen friendship and promote trade between the two countries. “To bring normalcy at the border is a priority of the state. Commendable efforts to keep the trade moving have been undertaken with respect to manage Covid-19 and we are engaging to support peace talks and agreement,” Desai said. The PS said screening truck drivers to meet international health standards at the border was one way of keeping cross-border trade vibrant. However, there has been a disagreement between the two states on how to deal with coronavirus. Tanzanian authorities have often rejected the testing of truck drivers at Namanga, paralysing transport and trade activities between the two countries. It is alleged that the high number of Covid-19 cases of Tanzanian truck drivers at the border is what sparked the blame game. Magufuli once reported that the number of coronavirus cases were dropping but there are no updates for Tanzania since April. Desai said Kenya still allows truck drivers from across the border and the country is looking forward to finding an amicable solution to challenges brought by the pandemic. He said the country has future strategies of creating safe trade zones to enhance equity and fair trade for small scale business people. “Trade is booming both in Kenya and Tanzania. That’s why there is a need to focus on good policies that will see people follow rules to protect lives and livelihoods and take advantage of opportunities,” Desai said. Edited by Henry Makori
