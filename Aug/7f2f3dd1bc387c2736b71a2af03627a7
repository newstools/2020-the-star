Kenya has become the first country globally to receive Safer Tourism Resilience Seal recommended by Rebuilding Travel. Tourism CS Najib Balala presented the award virtually, in an event that was attended by global tourism leaders under the Rebuilding Travel umbrella. Rebuilding Travel umbrella is a global pro-tourism industry group, comprising of tourism boards, ministers of tourism, professional associations, industry stakeholders, researchers, academics as well as travelers. Balala said during the event that the award is a testimony to Kenya’s continued efforts to ensure travellers' safety amid coronavirus pandemic. “As a destination, we have put together health and safety measures that are aimed at ensuring the safe reopening of the tourism sector. This is to ensure that our citizens, travelers, and workers are well protected,” Balala said. He also said that the recognition follows the Safe Travel Stamp award to Kenya by the World Travel and Tourism Council earlier in June. The rebuilding travel members congratulated Balala for the award and recognised the initiatives taken by the government to ensure that the travellers are safe. The CS said that global recognition means that the country is on the right direction in regard to Covid-19 safety protocols. Kenya joined the world in the World Tourism Organisation asking travellers to stay safe at home following the outbreak of the pandemic. The ministry through the Kenya Tourism Board also partnered with the private sector to keep the destination alive even as the virus continued to bite.
