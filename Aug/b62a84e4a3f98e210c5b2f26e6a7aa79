Gilgil MP Martha Wangari has asked the government to reopen schools the same way churches, airports and markets have resumed operations. The MP expressed doubt that implementation of community-based learning would solve the current crisis following the closure of schools in March. Community-based learning starts on September 2, but it will not be about the normal curriculum. Children will be taught life skills and good behavour. Wangari said chances are high the new mode of learning will fail as those responsible are not ready to implement it. Speaking in Mbegi, Gilgil, when she inspected development projects, the MP said the solution to the current challenge lay in reopening schools. “We have opened our airports and even churches and it is time we allowed our children back to school as this community learning programme cannot work,” she said. The MP said that the virus was here to stay, adding that there were no grounds or rules set on the community learning. She said candidates should be allowed back to class so that they can sit for their exams. The MP decried the rising cases of teenage pregnancy and the use of drugs by students who are currently at home due to the closure of schools. “We fear we might have few girls returning to school in January due to early pregnancies and all those men responsible should be arrested,” she said. The MP called for a thorough investigation of the alleged embezzlement of Covid-19 funds. “It’s sad that thousands have lost their jobs due to this pandemic which has been used to enrich some few individuals,” she said. Community leader Jane Wacera expressed concern over an increase in teenage pregnancies and cases of FGM in the area. “Some people have taken advantage of the school closure, hunger and lack of sanitary pads to misuse young girls, leading to increased cases of early pregnancies,” she said.
