Comedian Erastus Ayieko Otieno alias Flaqo says his parents did not support his talent. Flaqo is commonly known for his online skits featuring Mama Otis and her family. Speaking on YouTube with Carolina Carls, Flaqo said he has always been alone. "To be honest, I have always been alone and nobody has ever believed in myself except me," he said. Flaqo says his parents always wanted him to study and get a career. In a past interview, he said his mum was very tough and did not take whatever he was doing seriously until recently. He said the character Mama Otis was something he picked from his mum. Flaqo is one of the best comedians the country has and currently has partnered with the Communications Authority of Kenya.
