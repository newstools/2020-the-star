Residents of Garissa have been asked to change their social behaviour and follow the Ministry of Health guidelines to win the war on coronavirus. County secretary Abdi Ali said disregard of regulations and guidelines issued by the government in the war against the pandemic will be catastrophic to the population. He spoke on Thursday during the launch of Care Emergency Response to Covid-19 and the Kenya Livestock Market System in partnership with Garissa county initiatives to distribute  sanitiser, liquid soap and modern  hand washing tanks in a bid to mitigate the Covid-19 pandemic. Ali said  cases of virus transmission were increasing within the county. He said the county government was concerned about the recent spike in the transmission of the virus that has claimed three lives. Another 94 patients are  currently under medical in the county health facilities. The secretary confirmed that 11 frontline health staff had contracted the virus. He said the team responded to 920 alerts. Plans to have an oxygen refilling plant at the county referral facility were in progress following the demand for constant  supply to support patients, he said. "Right now we are in partnership with G4S to ensure our cylinders of oxygen are filled and readily available," Ali said. He warned members of the public who are still in denial and lax in observing the safety procedures that they were at a high risk of contracting and transmitting the virus. The officials from the organisations  and the county team later went to the livestock market to donate masks and sanitiser to traders. Edited by Henry Makori
