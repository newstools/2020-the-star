Hundreds of youth on Friday held demonstrations at Uhuru park to protest the alleged mismanagement of Covid-19 funds in the country. The demonstrations were disrupted by police officers who lobbed teargas canisters at the protesters. The disruption spilled over into the CBD where anti-riot police arrested 12 and dispersed activists who demanded for the arrest of 'Covid-19 millionaires'. Those arrested were taken to Central police station. The protesters condemned the used of force by police officers in spite the riots being peaceful. "The police should be in their offices investigating instead of teargassing us,"one of the activist said. "We will not stop demanding for our rights as Kenyans, they can teargas us as much as they want. We are demanding for the arrest of people who are known to have stolen Covid-19 billions but are still free." The expenditure of Covid-19 funds has raised a lot of concerns leading to Health CS Mutahi Kagwe appearing before the National Assembly Health committee over queries on the same. Kagwe dismissed claims that the Covid-19 billions can’t be accounted for as built on “theories and innuendos that are just fiction.” "Reports from media are not part of proceedings of this House. We are not going to rely on innuendo or newspaper reports but a report by investigative agencies," he said. The ministry further dismissed claims it has spent Sh43 billion towards the emergency, saying it has only received Sh23 billion.
