The Jubilee Party has called all its 66 MCAs in the Nairobi County Assembly for an urgent meeting today at the party’s headquarters at Pangani. The meeting comes a day before the assembly elects a new speaker following the resignation of Beatrice Elachi on Tuesday. In a letter by the Party’s Secretary General Raphel Tuju, the Majority Whip Paul Kados has been asked to whip members accordingly and ensure the ward reps attend the meeting. "In light of the current developments at the Nairobi County Assembly, you are required to attend a consultative meeting of all Jubilee elected and nominated MCAs at Jubilee Headquarters in Pangani at 12.00 noon on August 13, 2020 without fail," reads the letter. Meanwhile, eight Jubilee MCAs will be appearing before the disciplinary committee before the meeting to be chaired by Tuju kicks off. On Tuesday, in a letter by National Chairman of the Jubilee Party Nelson Dzuya, the MCAs were told to appear before the Party's disciplinary committee at 10.00 am. The MCAs summoned include; John Kamangu Nyumu (Ruai), Millicent Mugambi (Ziwani) Jeremiah Karani (Kayole Central Ward) and Charles Thuo (Dandora Three MCA)The rest are four nominated MCAs; June Ndegwa, Joyce Kamau, Susan Makungu and Margaret Mbote. The last time all the MCAs were at the headquarters was on June 10, 2020. This was amidst the internal wrangles facing the Jubilee MCAs at the assembly as divided camps had continued to fight over leadership.
