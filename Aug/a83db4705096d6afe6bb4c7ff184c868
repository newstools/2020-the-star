The United Nations Population Fund last week handed over PPEs, Mama Care kits, and midwife birth models to NMS to be used by frontline workers and new mothers. In attendance were Pumwani Hospital CEO John Murima, UNFPA county representative Ademola Olajide and NMS Health chief officer Ouma Oluga. Oluga said new mothers should be given proper healthcare during these tough times. "As much as there is coronavirus, sex does not stop and new children will still be born. Therefore, we should take care of new mothers and ensure they get proper health care," she said.
