The United States government, through its Embassy in Uganda has issued a caution over the situation of Coronavirus in the country. According to the Embassy, the capital-Kampala has more cases of the virus than what has been reported. "Covid-19 is in Kampala – possibly a lot of it. Please let me repeat. Kampala has a lot more cases of Covid-19 than are currently known,"  U.S. Mission Uganda Chargé d'Affaires Christopher Krafft said in a statement on Friday. He said the country has inadequate supply of test kits disabling widespread community testing. Krafft urged US citizens to be cautious of asymptomatic cases who continue to spread the virus without knowing it. "We know now that there are many asymptomatic cases for each symptomatic one, and many symptomatic cases for each person who dies with Covid-19 disease. We have seen a handful of deaths in a very short time without seeing the increase in diagnosis of asymptomatic or symptomatic cases at the same time," he said "In the phase we are now in, we will continue to have a lot of cases out there that we just don’t know about. And it is not only Kampala. We’ve had “hotspots” of community transmission for several weeks now in other areas of the country, and will expect to see more." According to Krafft, the Government of Uganda started to ease lockdown measures since June and will soon be making efforts to “flatten the curve”). As of Thursday's tally by Worldometer on Coronavirus, Uganda had a total of  1,254 confirmed cases with six reported fatalities. The data also indicated that 1,113 people had recovered from the disease leaving 135 active cases in the country. Meanwhile, Kenya crossed the 25,000 mark on Friday with a total of 25,138 infections. At least 413 people have succumbed to the disease in Kenya.
