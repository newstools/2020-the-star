The Council of Governors is unhappy with the Ministry of Agriculture for not consulting devolved units before making decisions on agriculture, according to Kiambu Governor James Nyoro. “Agriculture, under Schedule Four, is a devolved function and as governors there are many things that the Ministry of Agriculture is doing without consulting us,” Nyoro said in Kiambu town on Friday. He cited the new tea regulations, which the ministry introduced without involving the CoG "yet agriculture is devolved". Nyoro said the Kenya Tea Development Agency needs to be overhauled as  "there is no way it can continue doing things the same way and expect  different results. KTDA needs to be restructured. We cannot also let it go under like KPCU.” Restructuring, he said, involved removing people who have been with the agency for many years with nothing to show for their long stay. "Tea farmers toil every day with many challenges of cost production like high prices of fertilisers and poor returns yet those in office earn so much money,” Nyoro said. The said while KTDA does not need new regulations, there was a need for strategic thinking to enhance high tea returns. According to Nyoro, competition in the tea industry should be encouraged so that farmers get good returns for their investment "but we should discourage hawking and arrest those responsible for the impoverisation of farmers". He said there should not be interference with the ongoing DCI investigations of alleged misuse of funds at the agency. On Monday KTDA chief executive Lerionka Tiampati, legal affairs head John Omanga, procurement boss Brown Kanampiu, his finance counterpart Samuel Rugut and the audit in-charge Lincoln Munyao were questioned at the DCI headquarters over management issues.  - mwaniki fm
