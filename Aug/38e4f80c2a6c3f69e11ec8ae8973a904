Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has congratulated Benson Mutura on his election as the assembly speaker. Sonko said on Friday that Mutura, who was the former Makadara MP, will use his long experience in politics to restore dignity to the assembly. The governor also urged the section of MCAs who had different opinions about the person to fill the post to end their differences and work with the new leadership. “However, unity and progress cannot be achieved unless all others who opposed him and those with divergent views put aside their differences and support the new Assembly leadership,” Sonko said. Mutura was declared the Nairobi assembly speaker after garnering 99 votes out of 122 members. "I hereby declare Mr Benson Mutura the new Nairobi County Assembly Speaker having attained more than the required two-thirds majority votes," acting Speaker John Kamangu said. Voting took place on Friday afternoon and Mutura took oath after winning the election. The former legislator is filling a seat that been rendered vacant on Tuesday following the resignation of Beatrice Elachi. Mutura pledged to serve all MCAs equally and urged them to support his office. Addressing the members, Mutura said he was ready to work with the whole House. “I understand the roles of the Speaker and I will attend to all MCAs regardless of the party,” he said. He thanked President Uhuru Kenyatta and the Jubilee Party for having faith in him to take the position.
