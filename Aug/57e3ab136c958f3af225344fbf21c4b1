Pastor Godfrey Migwi of House of Hope Church, Kayole, has called out singer Bahati and rapper Khaligraph Jones for using clerical clothing in their music videos. Migwi says the two artistes are disrespecting men of God and welcoming curses to their generations. Bahati wears a bishop’s gown in his song 'Taniua', which he released with 'BondoocksGang', a secular group. Bahati said he does music for God and not for the gospel industry. "I just separated myself from the gospel industry for a while but I am in Christ. The Lord is my saviour," he said. Khaligraph also shared a video of himself with dancers, jamming to his latest song 'Tuma Kitu'. Through a social media post, Pastor Migwi said such artistes are just after money and fame. "Mark my words, you better repent and break the curses, God is never mocked," he wrote. "Woe unto you and your generations to come after you Bahati and the one I heard he’s called Kaligraph Jones, wearing Bishops gowns is wrong." He advised them to take the priest headgear and gowns to the nearest bishop and repent. "Good to know that even in the Church, not all ministers of the Gospel wear them; there’s a procedure to follow before you wear priest gowns." He went ahead to urge other gospel players who don’t live according to the word to read Daniel 5, how King Belshazzar’s downfall started, and 2 Chronicles 26:16, about Uzziah.
