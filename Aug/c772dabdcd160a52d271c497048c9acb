A Chinese investor has promised Kakamega residents most jobs if it wins the bid to set up a gold processing and refinery factory at Litambitsa in Ikolomani. Bai Yuehwa toured the 10-acre site in the company of Governor Wycliffe Oparanya, Devolution Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa and Bungoma Governor Wycliffe Wangamati. Gold mining in the county has also attracted, among others, London-based Shanta Mining Company. The property was acquired by the county government and handed over to the National Government which, in turn, has set aside Sh50 million for the plant. During the tour on Friday, Oparanya said his administration is committed to engaging serious investors to build and operationalise the factory within six months. “The factory will be a boost to the economic growth of the county and this region,” he said at Litambitsa centre. The governor said the investor will be expected to use modern mining technology to ensure that goldmines are no longer death traps. “The Lirhanda gold corridor stretches to Siaya county. With the processing factory in Kakamega, it will be a major boost because miners from other counties will bring gold to our factory,” Oparanya said. The factory is expected to serve miners from as far as Migori and Kisii. The governor said there was urgency to build the factory so that the artisanal miners from the Western region are economically empowered. He welcomed other gold miners and asked them to present their proposals to the relevant authorities.
