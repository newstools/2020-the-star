Emirates Airline has announced it will increase its passenger services to Nairobi to daily starting  August 17. The expanded schedule will offer enhanced connectivity for Kenyan customers to Emirates’ growing destination network via Dubai. Emirates will operate its modern Boeing 777-300ER’s between Nairobi and Dubai on flights departing Jomo Kenyatta International Airport. In a statement on Thursday, Emirates said customers can stop over or travel to Dubai as the city has re-opened for international business and leisure visitors. It noted that visitors to Dubai should hold an international travel insurance policy covering Covid-19 for the duration of their stay. Travel restrictions Customers are reminded that travel restrictions remain in place, and travellers will only be accepted on flights if they comply with the eligibility and entry criteria requirements of their destination countries. Last month, the airline said it will cover medical expenses of up to EUR 150,000 (Sh18.7m) and quarantine costs of EUR 100 per day for 14 days, should a customer be diagnosed with Covid-19 during their travel, while they are away from home. This cover is provided by the airline, free of cost to its customers regardless of class of travel or destination. This cover is immediately effective for customers flying on Emirates until October 31, 2020 (with the first flight to be completed on or before 31 October 2020). It is valid for 31 days from the moment they fly the first sector of their journey. This means Emirates customers can continue to benefit from the added assurance of this cover, even if they travel onward to another city after arriving at their Emirates destination.
