Sofapaka left back Titus Achesa is not afraid of setting sky-high targets ahead of the new season. The lanky defender revealed that he has set himself a target of at least five goals from set pieces and even more from open play as he seeks to help his employers win their second top flight title. Sofapaka will be seeking to end their more than a decade trophy droughtÂ  after renewing a revamped sponsorship deal with betting firm Betika last week. The club last won the league in 2009 in their maiden appearance at the top level. Achesa, a dependable free-kick taker, says he wants to pick from where he left season where he scored three goals, all from set pieces. "We were challenged by our sponsor to win the league in the new season and this calls for every player to step up. I am planning to score at least five goals from set pieces and even more from open play just to help the club achieve our target," said Achesa. "I had three (goals) last season, before it was terminated in April and I hope to extend my scoring form in the new campaign," said the former Posta Rangers player. At the same time, the overlapping defender said he will be keen to bag at least 10 assists. "Our style of play allows the full backs to overlap and bring in crosses. It's an area I want to improve on when football resumes and register at least 10 assists," he said.
