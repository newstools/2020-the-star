Germany based organizer, Fairtrade is set to host a Virtual agricultural event between October 19 to 22 2020 in the country. This four-day digital event brings leading global manufacturers and decision-makers from the African agrofood & plastprintpack industries together, creating a sweeping network of valuable business contacts through a matchmaking platform backed by robust and secure artificial intelligence. The organizer will join forces with B2B Africa in Kenya to ensure that high-profile participants from Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda actively make use of Virtual agrofood & plastprintpack Africa for their business. At the virtual trade show, each exhibitor has a virtual booth showcasing their profile, logo and an image of their stand rep. Through this booth, exhibitors can disseminate corporate videos, showcase products, interact with visitors via instant video calls, live streaming of product demos and much more. For visitors, the event is free to attend. In addition to the B2B meetings, the event offers conferences with inspiring speakers and relevant content, webinars, workshops, roundtables, live demos, panel sessions and product launches. “Virtual agrofood & plastprintpack Africa is a direct response to what our trade visitor network has told us they need – an opportunity to meet with suppliers, source new products, network with existing and new business contacts as well as a place to be inspired and learn,” said Paul Maerz, Managing Director at Fairtrade.
