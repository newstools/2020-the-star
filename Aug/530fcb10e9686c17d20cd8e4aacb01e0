Senator Steve Lelegwe on Tuesday presented himself at the Maralal police station for questioning by DCI detectives over cattle rustling in Samburu County. The senator was also questioned by the officers for one hour on Monday before he was released at 7 pm and directed to report back to the DCI office today at 10 am. He was quizzed on Monday evening over incitement. He was then released at around 8 pm and asked to report today morning for further questioning. While speaking at Maralal police station, the senator said DCI officers grilled him over cattle rustling incidences in the county. “I don’t know why they want me to confirm livestock that have been stolen instead they should be the one to confirm and explain to Samburu people why we are losing livestock, government officers, lives and property,” he said. The senator has vowed to stay firm on his decision in ensuring that the county will not lose even a single shilling through the proposed revenue sharing formula during his tenure. “I stand firm that Samburu County should receive its fair share of revenue from the national government. I have voted for what I think is right and I will still vote for what is right,” he said. Lelegwe said he will always engage in constructive engagements in the senate to defend interests of counties. “I will stand to protect counties Samburu people elected me to the senate to protect counties of Kenya while in senate through constructive engagements like the third generation formula,” he said.
