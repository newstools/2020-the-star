Dear Felly, How can I tell if my husband is cheating on me, and what can I do? P. Dear P, Thank you for writing in. Your question can only mean one of two things. I am not trying to be insensitive. I would like to have a candid conversation. What do you know? Why would you just ask that specific question? If you know something, then you already have an answer, and there is no need to seek clarification from outsiders who do not know you or the nature of your relationship. If you are looking for problems, please stop it. The world is full of challenges; please wait patiently your turn to deal will come up. Do not go rattling snakes. As for what you can do, I am assuming this is if you know he is cheating. Well P, that is up to you. You decide what to do. You weigh the pros and cons. You decide what you can live with. Whether you stay or go, there will be things to deal with. If there are children involved, consider the children and do what is best for you and your children. All the best.
