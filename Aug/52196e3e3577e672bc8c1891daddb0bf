Covid-19 has forced the closure of four health centres in the city after 210 Nairobi Metropolitan Services healthcare workers contracted while on duty. The Pumwani Maternity Hospital is only accepting emergency cases. While some of the affected workers are in isolation, others have fully recovered, NMS director-general Mohamed Badi said on Friday. As of Thursday, Nairobi led the country in the number of infections at 14,854 and 140 deaths. The figures countrywide were 24,441 and 399 respectively. “Covid-19 is ravaging the country, especially Nairobi. Ours own is to do our bit to reduce the transmission,” Badi said as he received Personal Protective Equipment at Mama Lucy Kibaki Hospital from Covid-19 Fund and Equity Bank Foundation. The hospital received stock of PPEs to last 15 months. “The virus has taken a toll in our informal settlements. NMS is working to increase treatment, isolation and quarantine facilities including an ICU unit at Mama Lucy,” the NMS director-general said. He has pledged to build 24 health facilities in the informal settlements to decongest national and major county hospitals like Mama Lucy and Mbagathi. Each of those hospitals will have about 16 maternity beds. More than 1,000 outpatients are attended to daily at Mama Lucy from Nairobi and the neighbourhood. Today (Friday), there were 45 deliveries, according to superintendent Mohammed Musa.  The numbers for Thursday and Wednesday were 55 and 65 respectively. Badi asked those in home isolation to adhere to the Ministry of Health protocols to avoid infecting their friends and relatives. Equity  Bank CEO James Mwangi said during the presentation that the real story is not about the money put into the programme but collaboration. “We decided to rely on local manufacturers due to the uncertainty of the global supply chain,” Mwangi said.  - mwaniki fm
