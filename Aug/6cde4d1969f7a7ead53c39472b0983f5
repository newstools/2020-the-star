More than 2,500 smallholder maize farmers in 25 wards in Trans Nzoia county are to receive free fertiliser for planting and top dressing. In the North Rift, 6,000 farmers will receive 18,000 bags of fertiliser worth Sh55 million. The programme includes capacity building and support with digital information. Yara East Africa senior commercial manager Vitalis Wafula said on Tuesday the initiative will improve productivity and profitability. He spoke at the fertiliser flagging-off ceremony at the Agriculture ministry grounds in Kitale. Wafula said the initiative, Action Africa: Thriving Farms, Thriving Future, will help promote farmers' knowledge and food production by borrowing from global best practices. “Farmers will be given a code they’ll present to the agro-dealer they’ve been assigned. The code will be verified, then the farmer will receive three 50kg bags of  fertiliser for planting and top dressing,” he said. The Sh800 million national programme targets farmers to receive fertiliser in 22 counties. The support aims to boost production especially during the Covid-19 pandemic that has set back many sectors, including agriculture. The fertiliser and extension support covers Bungoma, Busia, Kakamega, Vihiga, Siaya, Homa-Bay, Migori, Nyamira, Narok, Bomet and Trans Nzoia. Other counties are Nandi, Machakos, Makueni, Kitui, Kiambu, Muranga, Embu, Tharaka Nithi, Meru, Taita-Taveta and Tana River. The programme will also provide support to farmers using digital communications on soil, fertiliser, seeds, weather and other information. Trans Nzoia Governor Patrick Khaemba welcomed Yara's Sh22 million support for his county. “We are also offering innovative extension practices using the digital platforms to sensitise the public and encourage farmers to grow nutritious crops," he said. "As the strategic food basket region, we need a new approach and new knowledge to make the best use of the resources we have," he said. (Edited by V. Graham)
