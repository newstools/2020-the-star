The Kenya ni Yetu Festival will take place on August 29. The concert will feature local artistes, among them veteran singer Suzanna Owino, Eric Wainanina, Redfourth choir, Samido and H_art the band. Speaking to Word Is, legendary singer Wainaina said, "This pandemic has made us revise different ways to do and share our music." Talking about the future of live music, he said people have adapted to that kind of music. "They will get used to it even after the pandemic is over." Wainaina, who has been working from home since the pandemic hit the globe, is working on new projects. The virtual concert aims to uplift the spirit of Kenyans and unify communities across the country at this time of social separation and anxiety. The inaugural and official launch of these productions will be aired on a digital platform to reach the huge masses that have access to a phone with Internet connectivity.
