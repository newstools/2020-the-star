The office of the Director of Public Prosecutions in West Pokot county has been closed indefinitely after five staffers tested positive for Covid-19. The county government has started testing other workers of the Judiciary and the Prisons Department after it was confirmed that the five Covid-19 patients came into contact with the other officials. Speaking in Kapenguria on Monday, West Pokot Governor John Lonyangapuo said the county's health department received communication from the Ministry of Health in Nairobi about the five cases of Covid-19. The patients were confirmed following tests conducted on employees of the ODPP. “Upon receiving the information, the county sought to establish the story behind the new cases and the five cases have already been put under home-based care in conformity with the Health Ministry’s guidelines,” Lonyangapuo said. He said the results of the tests were released eight days after the collection of samples. “At the time the county was notified of these results, each of the five cases had been contacted and advised to stay in their homes and await the county health teams to provide further advice. Their offices have been closed and everyone, including those who returned negative results, advised to stay home,” the governor said. Four of the patients reside in neighbouring counties and often commute to work in West Pokot. The other is a resident of West Pokot, Lonyangapuo said. "They are asymptomatic and stable," he said. He urged state departments in the county to work together with the county health department in the fight against Covid-19. He said the ODPP had not notified the county about conducting tests on its employees. "We were shocked to hear about Covid-19 cases." Lonyangapuo said the county had put up an isolation centre at Aramaget with 300 beds.  Edited by P.O
