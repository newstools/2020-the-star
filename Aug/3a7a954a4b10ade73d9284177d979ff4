Farmers in Kiambu have benefited from Sh130 million to boost their dairy, banana, indigenous chicken and Irish potato farming businesses. Governor James Nyoro said on Monday when he gave out cheques in Kiambu town that the cash will boost the farmers' production. Nyoro said this is the third time farmers' groups in the county are received financing from the programme. He urged more farmers to form groups so that they can benefit. The programme has been financed through the National Agricultural and Rural Inclusive Growth Project, a national government initiative funded by the World Bank. The governor said that to complement the programme, the Kiambu county government is also giving farmers kienyeji chickens and constructing animal feed plants. The county government also plans to introduce fish farming and enhance dairy farming. “We have a chicken farming project in which we have started giving farmers 10 chickens each,” Nyoro said.
