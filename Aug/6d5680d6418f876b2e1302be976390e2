The government, through the Ministry of Health, has said that it will change its contact tracing strategy, adding that the current method used is unfeasible due to community spread of the virus. Speaking on Wednesday during the daily briefing on Covid-19 updates, Health CAS Mercy Mwangangi said, "Doing contact tracing as we did in the beginning, unfortunately, is not feasible and this is the same experience that other countries are having." She said the decision was reached after wider consultation with other countries, Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) among other organisations. “Contact tracing is a very resource-intensive exercise and also with our scientists telling us that when it comes to community transmission, you actually have to change the contact tracing approach,” Mwangangi said. Foreign Affairs PS Macharia Kamau had two weeks ago complained about the lacklustre approach to contact tracing after testing positive. He has since fully recovered. Mwangangi said, “When you establish community transmission, you need to relook at your approach because it will be futile because the disease is within the community, it has already spread and contact tracing in terms of its merits becomes a little bit weaker.” Mwangangi's statement on changing the approach comes as the country reported 379 new cases of Covid-19, raising the country's total to 31,015. The new cases were derived from 3,867 samples collected in the last 24 hours. From the new cases, 372 were Kenyans while seven were foreigners. A total of 223 were male and 156 were female.
