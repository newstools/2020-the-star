Barrack Muluka has resigned as the secretary general of the Amani National Congress party. In a letter addressed to party leader Musalia Mudavadi, Muluka said ANC needs a fresh start ahead of 2022 polls. "I doubt that i could add more value to what i have done so far. Moreover, it is now fitting that the space around you should be decongested. this will allow you to make critical decisions on the population and leadership of the party under the new constitution," he said. Muluka said his resignation will easeÂ  Mudavadi's making of personal political choices in the lead up to the 2022 elections. "As part of giving you the necessary latitude on the arduous political journey ahead, I have now decided to step aside and move on to other horizons," he said. "This therefore is my formal letter of resignation both as secretary general and a member of ANC." He instructed the registrar of political parties to strike out his name in both capacities. "...please note, that I do not now belong to any political party or organisation," he said. Muluka wished the party well on the rest of the 'competitive journey' ahead. "Thank you for the experience we have shared and especially for writing your biography. I will be available to hand over formally to the next sec general as soon as one is in place," he added.
