You are most likely to live a life full of happiness if you reside in Makueni and West Pokot counties, a new study has revealed. The study by Infotrak released on Sunday also revealed that most unhappy people in the country are found in the five counties of Taita Taveta, Trans Nzoia, Nairobi, Mombasa and Siaya. Governor Kivutha Kibwana’s Makueni was ranked the happiest county of the 47 devolved units, with 64.4 per cent happiness index, followed by John Lonyangapuo’s West Pokot at 62.4 per cent. Machakos (62.1), Bomet (61.8) and Kwale (61.3) seal the top five counties with the highest happiness index. Other counties making it to top 10 were Elgeyo Marakwet (61.3), Marsabit (61.0), Uasin Gishu (61.0), Kericho (60.9) and Mandera (60.4). “When residents from the happiest counties were interrogated to shed light on what drives their high levels of happiness, many mentioned visible positive changes in their social and natural environments made them exceedingly happy,” Infotrak CEO Angela Ambitho said. The poll was conducted between November and December 2019 to January 2020. Each county was allocated 600 respondents, the survey had a +/- 4 margin of error with a 95 per cent degree of confidence. The data was collected through computer-assisted telephone interviews. Of the three Kenyan cities, Kisumu residents are the happiest at 57.4 per cent followed by Mombasa at 52.6, with capital Nairobi last with 52.5. “City dwellers are seemingly an angry and frustrated lot. Although towns have better services, the lack of social support and environmental ergonomics coupled with congestion, pollution and economic pressures makes city dwellers a dull and unhappy lot.” Some of the parameters cited by the respondents as the drivers of their happiness were peace, education, quality and affordable healthcare, food security, infrastructure, equitable development and good governance. Regionally, Eastern leads followed by Rift Valley, Northeastern, Central, Western, Nyanza, Coast and Nairobi. The Infotak findings closely mirror the results of the World Happiness Report 2020, which ranked Kenya at number 121 with a score of 4.583. The global report interrogates how the social, urban and natural environments combine to affect people’s happiness.
