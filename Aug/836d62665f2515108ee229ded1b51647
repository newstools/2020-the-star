The taxman has cleared Kakamega Senator Cleophas Malala in the tax evasion claims as his bank says his account is accessible. On Thursday, Malala said his accounts had been frozen by the Kenya Revenue Authority. Some senators said this was part of a wider scheme to intimate lawmakers opposed to the controversial revenue-sharing formula currently deadlocked in the House. Bank accounts of Meru's Mithika Linturi were also reportedly frozen. However, the Star could not reach the lawmaker for verification. Linturi did not respond to phone calls and text messages seeking comment on the matter. KRA cleared Malala in a tax compliance certificate issued on Friday seen by the Star. “Malala has filed relevant tax returns and paid taxes due as provided by law,” the certificate reads. Further, the deputy Minority leader in the Senate also got a confirmation from Co-Operative Bank informing that his account is accessible. “We thank you most sincerely for choosing to bank with us,” a letter from the bank dated August 14 reads. Speaking to the Star, Malalah said he has been tax complaint all along, adding that the entire scheme was aimed at intimidating him. Malala is part of Team Kenya that has opposed the controversial third basis for sharing revenue among counties proposed by the House Finance and Budget committee. Majority leader Samuel Poghisio, Minority leader James Orengo and Majority Chief Whip Irungu Kangata are all supporting the formula. Team Kenya is opposing the committee because 19 counties are losing Sh17 billion in the proposal. The losing counties are from the less populous regions of the coast, Northeastern, lower Eastern and parts of Rift Valley. Edited by R.Wamochie
