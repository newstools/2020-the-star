The Uwezo Fund will offer accessible interest-free loans to unemployed youth  during the Covid-19 pandemic. There will be a six-month grace period before affordable repayment is required. Public Service and Gender CS Margaret Kobia made the announcement on Wednesday while presenting the 2019-23 Uwezo Fund strategic plan in Nairobi. The fund also helps women and people living with disabilities. The loan programme opening date has not been set. The plan aims to ensure at least 30 per cent of all government tenders are allocated to young people and others eligible. The fund trains recipients and administrators. In Nairobi county alone 600 groups have been trained in entrepreneurship skills, Kobia said. “Through the Uwezo Fund, benefitting groups including youths have been trained in entrepreneurship skills to enhance their ability to undertake successful businesses," she said. Young people represent more than 70 per cent of Kenya's population. An estimated 800,000 young people enter the labour market each year. The unemployment rate among the younger generation is estimated at 35 per cent, compared with the national rate of 10 per cent - numbers are higher because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Uwezo Fund oversight board chairman Losenge Turoop said the strategic plan covers management and resource mobilisation, awareness creation, leadership, governance, strengthening institutional capacity, infrastructure for monitoring, evaluation and reporting of fund activities. The strategic plan will promote equitable social-economic transformation of youth, women and people living with disabilities, Turoop said. The flagship programme of Kenya's Vision 2030 blueprint is administered at the constituency level through a revolving fund. It provides accessible and affordable credit, capacity building and market linkages for youth, women and people living with disabilities. (Edited by V. Graham)
