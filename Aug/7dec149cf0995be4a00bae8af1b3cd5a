Kenyan journalist Collins Juma Osemo, well known as Yassin Juma who was arrested in Ethiopia has been moved to a government isolation facility. The Kenyan Embassy in Ethiopia managed to assist the journalist after Juma protested negligence at the Sostegna police station where he was being held. The journalist’s lawyer Kedir Bullo had confirmed that Juma tested positive for Covid-19 on August 13. On August 5, an Ethiopian court gave an order for the release of Juma but the police still kept him in custody. He was arrested on allegations that he was working for an Ethiopian opposition leader. Kenya’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been working behind the scenes to secure his release. Garissa Township MP Aden Duale had requested the Foreign Affairs ministry to provide information on the whereabouts of Juma. Duale sought the statement from the chairperson of the Departmental Committee on Defence and Foreign Relations last Wednesday. "What specific measures are being pursued by Kenya to secure the release of Yassin as well as to guarantee his absolute freedom?" he posed. Duale said the department should tell Kenyans what measures the government has put in place to safeguard Kenyans from similar treatment abroad.
