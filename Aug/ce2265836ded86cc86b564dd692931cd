Majid Al Futtaim, the leading shopping mall, communities, retail and leisure pioneer across the Middle East, Africa, and Asia, has launched an initiative to support healthcare workers in the fight against Covid-19. Carrefour, which is operated by Majid Al Futtaim in Kenya, has donated essential resources to healthcare workers at Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH), Kenya’s largest public hospital and its affiliates, offering them the much needed support during the pandemic. KNH is the premier health institution in Kenya, and has been spearheading efforts to combat Covid-19 by setting up isolation units and building the capacity of healthcare workers in the counties. Donations raised by Carrefour’s latest initiative included household appliances such as microwaves, refrigerators and water dispensers as well as food items. All donated goods will be for the healthcare staff employed across KNH’s Infectious Disease Units. Franck Moreau, Country Manager Carrefour Kenya at Majid Al Futtaim Retail, said: “Carrefour is committed to contributing to the lives of the people who have come to rely on us as a pillar of their communities.” Speaking during the handover ceremony, Kenyatta National Hospital CEO Dr. Evanson Kamuri, , said:“This is indeed a great gesture. Two things thrill me about this donation. One is Carrefour’s generosity, and the other is the continued faith in our mandate.” The initiative underlines Carrefour Kenya’s commitment to the health and wellbeing of the people and communities it serves, management said. The campaign follows a charitable initiative that Carrefour launched earlier this year to generate donations of more than 65 tonnes of staple food items, worth over Sh5 million, in support of underprivileged families across Nairobi affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. Majid Al Futtaim operates over 300 Carrefour stores, serving more than 750,000 customers daily and employing over 37,000 people.
