President Uhuru Kenyatta has ordered Interior CS Fred Matiang'i and the CoG to convene a conference to chart a way forward for a post-Covid Kenya. "They shall in three weeks convene an inclusive national consultative conference to review our response so far," he said. "....So that we chart Kenya's post Covid future. A future that we will see if we continue with our responsibility as citizens." Uhuru said there are no unbearable responsibilities in the face of pandemics. He said some strides have been made when tackling the pandemic. "We must acknowledge that this news is not a licence to backslide from our path of responsibility," he said. "Responsibility is not a burden but a civic duty. It is something you seek as a task. It is a habit that you pay to your fellow citizens," he said. He added that although Kenya has tried flattening the curve, there are challenges. "The infection is shifting to counties and rural areas. Expansion of the health sector has expanded to the counties. But more needs to be done," he said. Kenya recorded 213 more cases of Covid-19 on Wednesday, raising the country's total to 33,016. Another 241 patients have recovered from the disease, bringing the total number of recoveries in the country so far to 19,296. However, Uhuru announced that five more patients have succumbed to the virus bringing to 564 the number of fatalities in the country. He urged Kenyans to continue observing all guidelines by the Ministry of Health.
