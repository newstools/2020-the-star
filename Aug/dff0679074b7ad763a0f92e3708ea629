Two police officers accused of killing two Garissa residents at Soko Ng'ombe area will stand trial in Nairobi. Aden Ibrahim Salat and Abdirahman Roble Samow are accused of shooting and killing Aden Abdi Madobe and Muhiyadin Adow Shibin on July 25. The two were killed after police fired into the air to disperse a crowd protesting the arrest of a murder suspect. A woman was also injured. Before the trial, the two police officers will undergo a mental check-up to ascertain their fitness to take a plea. Depending on the medical report, the two will take a plea on August 12. The victims' lawyer, Brian Odhiambo, said the two officers will be charged before Justice Luka Kimaru. Speaking to the Star on the phone, Odhiambo said that because of Covid-19 measures, the case will be heard virtually. Odhiambo said the DPP instructed that the case be transferred to Nairobi because of security concerns. There was tension in Garissa on Monday after the two failed to appear in court as had been scheduled. Anxious residents flocked to the courts in Garissa only to be told the case would not be heard as expected. This led to speculation that the two officers may have been released. Local administrators and elders had to intervene to restore calm. “I want to confirm to family members and concerned residents that the two  officers were transferred to Nairobi and are in police custody. They will stand trial,” Odhiambo said. Garissa Woman Representative Anab Gure on Tuesday said leaders from the area  are demanding nothing short of justice for the victims. "Even as we continue to condemn this unfortunate incident, we want to see the officers prosecuted. We want to caution against any attempt to cover up the incident,” she added. Anab, who comes from the same clan as the two slain men, said police officers are supposed to protect lives and property, not take them. She said going forward they will pull resources together to help family members of the two slain men. Edited by A.N
