Nairobi county will no longer provide security services to public primary schools effective next month. A letter from regional director of Education Jared Obiero dated August 28 to the Kenya Primary School Heads Association notified the schools of the decision. Obiero, referencing communication from county chief officer for Education Gender and Social Services Ruth Owuor, asked school heads to make alternative security arrangements until a "lasting solution" is found. "Nairobi county will terminate the services of Vickers Security and Magic Security firms from August 31, 2020. Headteachers are asked to attend the handover in their respective schools on September 1,” the letter reads. Obiero asked boards of management to ensure the safety of school property. City Hall had contracted the two security agencies in 2018 to guard all public schools, spending a monthly average of Sh40,000 on each school. The withdrawal comes at a time when schools are closed because of the coronavirus. The burden of incurring security cost is likely to be transferred to parents. Headteachers are unhappy with the announcement, which they claim will not only place the school property at risk but also their performance. Kepsha national chairperson Nicholas Gathemia said the directive is not well thought out and will undermine primary education. “This move will definitely hurt primary education. Secondary schools have continued to gain as primary schools funds decline,” he said. The heads said without basic important learning materials and equipment, performance is likely to drop. Many public schools, especially those in informal settlements, have reported cases of theft and break-ins in the recent past, including stealing of barbed wire, security lamps and books, among other items.
