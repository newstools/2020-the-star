Police in Lamu East have shot and killed a panga-wielding thug who was among a group of three that ambushed police officers. Lamu county police commander Moses Murithi said two police officers were walking back to their Siyu police post in Lamu East at around 8.45pm. They were suddenly attacked by a group of three gangsters brandishing pangas and clubs. A police officer was critically injured during the attack, forcing his colleague to shoot at the attackers, killing one on the spot. Two of the goons, however, escaped into nearby bushes and are still being sought. The motive of the attack is still unknown. “The attack happened just a few metres from the station. The officer had to shoot at them when he realised his colleague had been injured by the thugs,” Murithi said. The body of the deceased thug, whose identity remains unknown, is lying at the Faza Subcounty Hospital. Locals have been asked to come and identity if he is a relative. Panga gangs, especially in Lamu East, are getting bolder and more daring by the day. The previous in a string of attacks since 2016 was on June 8, when police constable Rodgers Odhiambo, attached to the Tchundwa police post, was accosted by a gang of three panga-wielding men as he left a shop and slashed to death.
