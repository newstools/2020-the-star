Former Changamwe MP Ramadhan Kajembe was on Saturday buried at his family home in Kwa Shee in Jomvu. The burial ceremony took only half an hour. Only his son Sudi Kajembe and Coast Regional Coordinator John Elungata spoke during the ceremony. Elungata delivered President Uhuru's condolence message to the family. Kajembe's remains were carried to the family cemetery, 500 metres away, by 10 health officials clad in white Covid-19 PPEs. Hundreds of family members, friends and relatives were present at the home of the former legislator. Coast Regional Coordinator John Elungata led security officers in ensuring social distance at the home of the former leader. Kajembe died on Friday evening after a two-week hospitalisation at Pandya Hospital. Among those present at the funeral were Jomvu MP Badi Twalib, who is Kajembe's son-in-law and former Mombasa nominated senator Emma Mbura.
