Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has announced all lawsuits against the Nairobi Metropolitan Service will be dropped as an act of good will. This comes a day after President Uhuru Kenyatta directed Sonko and NMS Director General Mohamed Badi to work together to deliver efficient services to city residents. “Remember I had gone to court before we put our differences aside and pledged to work together . We shall put the past behind us,” Sonko said. Speaking on Thursday as he toured Mukuru Kwa Njenga, Sonko said he had a problem with some legal issues with the deed of transfer but will dialogue with Badi  on the way forward. “We all have to follow the law and if Badi and I put our differences aside, We shall also be able to come to an understanding on the  deed of transfer,” he said. To show goodwill, the Governor further said in the next 14 days he  will be handing over completed projects to General Badi and his team . Sonko also announced that he will be touring six wards each day to inspect the ongoing projects. The county boss said he will be accompanying DG Badi while he is inspecting the ongoing projects in the City . “DG Badi wasn’t able to come with me in  Mukuru Kwa Njenga as he is planning for the launch of Michuki Park tomorrow,” Sonko said. He lauded the President for bringing him and Badi together, putting an end to the ‘bad blood’ between City Hall and NMS Speaking on the upcoming elections of a new speaker, Sonko said he expects the assembly to have a leader who respects the law. “We have mature MCAs and I’m sure they will elect someone who can lead the house without favour,” he said.
