Ugunja MP Opiyo Wandayi has asked investigative agencies to bring to book senators allegedly turning the county revenue bill impasse into to a cash cow. Wandayi said there are many underhand deals going on, with some of the senators in the payroll of forces hell-bent on ensuring that the stalemate persists. Speaking during the burial of his sister-in-law Dorothy Anyango Oketch at Sikalame village in Ugunja subcounty, the legislator called on the DCI and the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission to move in swiftly and arrest those found to have given or taken bribes. He said some of the recipients of the huge bribes were senators who project themselves as progressive, with the interests of the country at heart. In the list, the lawmaker said, are some of the very loud senators who like projecting the image of nationalists and defenders of Kenya. He said the country cannot wish away the serious corruption allegations against the senators. The legislator, who doubles as ODM's director of political affairs, said he supported calls for a win-win situation in the revenue-sharing formula. The legislator at the same time urged Deputy President William Ruto to quit the government if he cannot speak in one voice with his boss President Uhuru Kenyatta. “If the DP can come out and start criticising the very government that he is part of, then we are a lost country,” Wandayi said. He said Kenyans do not want to see a government that is working at cross purposes, with the President saying this and his deputy contradicting him. “What are public officers working under the two supposed to do? Whose policy direction will they implement?" He asked, saying if Ruto was not thinking alike with the President, "he should honourably resign". Edited by R.Wamochie
