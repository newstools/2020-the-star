Treasury Cabinet Secretary Ukur Yatani will this morning face members of Parliament over the delayed disbursement of Sh18.7 billion Constituency Development Fund cash. The Treasury is yet to release Sh13.7 billion for financial year 2019/20. The rest dates as far back as the financial year ending June 2011. Yatani is expected to explain the delays to the Constituencies Development Committee chaired by Kanduyi MP Wafula Wamunyinyi. The lawmakers are keen to attend the meeting which, they hope, will unlock the cash whose delay has stalled several CDF projects. A status report of the disbursements obtained by the Star shows that only Galole, Garsen, Gilgil, Kamukunji, Khwisero, Kipkelion West, Lamu East, Likuyani, Lugari, Lunga Lunga, Rabai, Rongo and Suba South have received their full allocation of Sh137.4 million each. Some 152 constituencies are yet to receive their allocation for the last financial year. Aldai and Kitui East are owed Sh65 million each while 72 others are eyeing  about Sh54.4 million each to complete projects. At least 45 constituencies are yet to receive between Sh53 million and Sh2.2 million (Ijara). Kimani Ngunjiri’s Bahati, Peter Kaluma’s Homa Bay Town, Nyaribari Masaba, Mumias West and Majority Whip Emmanuel Wangwe’s Navakholo constituencies are among those with balances of below Sh10 million. Six constituencies had as of August 4 only received between 36-49 per cent of their total allocation. Joshua Kuttuny’s Cherangany had received Sh60 million followed by Embakasi West (Sh52 million) and Karachuonyo (Sh54 million). Limuru and Ganze had received Sh50 million each and are thus waiting for the Treasury to disburse the remaining Sh87 million. Some 107 constituencies have pending balances from financial year 2018/19 amounting to Sh908 million. Thirty-eight others have balances of Sh117 million dating back to financial year 2017-18 while 25 constituencies are yet to get Sh54 million for 2016-17. Balances for financial year 2015-16 add to Sh56 million while Sh38 million is yet to be disbursed for years running from 2011 to June 2015. Baringo Central, Jomvu, Lamu East, Mogotio, Turkana West, and Voi are yet to receive Sh19 million for 2014-15. Magarini, Shinyalu, and Mwingi North are owed Sh10.9 million for 2013-14. Shinyalu alone is owed Sh6.2 million. Bonchari, Dagoretti, Karachuonyo, Masinga, Mwingi South, and Starehe are yet to receive Sh6.1 million for financial year 2011-12. Yatani has attributed the delays to the revenue shortfall in the last financial year due to the effects of Covid-19 pandemic on businesses. Classrooms, roads and water projects are among those that have stalled. MPs say it beats logic how schools will expand classroom spaces for learning under the new Covid-19 measures when the funds are delayed. CDF has largely contributed to construction of classrooms in the country, a system the board says can help solve the space nightmare. The hue and cry by lawmakers that some constituencies are starved of cash yet others have received their full share is expected to feature in today's meeting. Minority leader John Mbadi said among the issues they seek to engage the Treasury on is to allow the use of bursary money to build classrooms. Luanda MP Chris Omulele has in the past warned Yatani that he risks trouble with the august House if he does not provide funds. “CDF is what mwananchi sees. We cannot legislate if the funds that go to citizens directly are not provided. “All constituencies are equal. What the board receives should be distributed to all the constituencies,” according to Omulele. Eldas' Adan Keynan said, “Treasury must take their functions seriously. We must not allow them make this Parliament a begging House.” House Majority leader Amos Kimunya said they are in continuous engagement with the Treasury over the delays.  - mwaniki fm
