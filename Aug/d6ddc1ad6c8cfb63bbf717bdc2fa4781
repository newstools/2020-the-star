A row has emerged between a land investment company and its members in Ruiru, Kiambu county, over use of land set aside for public utilities. Members of Ukombozi Green Gardens Estate Association are accusing the management of Ukombozi Holdings Ltd of asking them to pay so they can be allowed to worship in an old church building in one of the parcels earmarked for public use. Association chairman Patrick Muriuki said after they were denied access to the land, one of the directors introduced a fee of Sh7,500 for any member who wished to use it. “It’s very wrong for the directors to bar us from accessing or using public land. It’s even worse for them to charge members who use the land,” the chairman said. One of the company directors, Bishop J B Masinde, who is the Secretary General of Deliverance Church of Kenya, acknowledged to have received concerns from the members. He said before the end of this week they will have reached an agreement to end the row. “We will call all parties and find an amicable solution to the impasse,” he said. A meeting to end the wrangles was convened last week at Deliverance Church in Umoja, Nairobi county. Those present included members on Ukombozi association and directors of Ukombozi Holdings Ltd. The parcels in contention are LR NO28318/419 earmarked for construction of a hospital, L.R.28318/389 that has been set aside for construction of a church, L.R.28318/25114 that is meant for construction of a police post and 28318/31 which has been reserved for school. The parcels were hived off from 108 acres owned by the land company. Ukombozi Green Garden Estate is a project of Ukombozi Holdings Ltd spearheaded by Deliverance Church Kasarani Zimmerman. The estate is located along Ruiru-Githunguri road, two kilometres from Ruiru town. The project began in 2009 with an aim of empowering the members of deliverance church Kasarani, their families and friends with an opportunity to own a piece of land and eventually build homes.
