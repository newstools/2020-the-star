Deputy President William Ruto says if the BBI recommendation for a referendum will be persuasive enough, 'we will do what we have to do'. "I need to be persuaded on what areas to change. If there are persuasive areas that will make the constitution better that will be presented when the new draft of proposals come up, we are reasonable people, we will look at it. If they merit, we will do what we have to do," he said. "If it was what we saw on Bomas one, we have absolutely no problem." The Building Bridges InitiativeÂ  task force chaired by Garissa Senator Yusuf Haji is currently waiting for President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM party Raila Odinga's availability so it can present the final report. Ruto, however, noted that the Gender rule is something that he recommends to be on the list of amendments. "...It has not been implemented. That is something that we should be concerned about because it is a live pronouncement of the new constitution.," he said during an interview with Citizen TV on Thursday. On the position of Jubilee Party regarding the referendum, Ruto said the party is yet to make a stand on it. "To the best of my knowledge, we have never had a meeting as Jubilee to discuss about our position in the changing of the constitution," he said. However, he said he has canvased his views on the BBI team indirectly to make sure they (his views) are part of what they have. "The president knows how to change the constitution. He knows he has to involve the people," he said.
