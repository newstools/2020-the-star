 Paul Pogba will not be sold by Manchester United this summer and new contract discussions will start soon, says the France midfielder’s agent. The 27-year-old - an £89m signing from Juventus in 2016 - suffered from injuries last season but impressed in patches on his return as United finished third in the Premier League. His agent Mino Raiola said: “United will not accept any bid this summer. “We’re going to speak about a new contract soon, no stress.” Raiola also told Sky Sports: “He is key player for Man Utd. They’ve an important project and he’s 100% included.” Pogba, whose deal runs until next summer, made only eight appearances in all competitions before English football was suspended in mid-March because of the coronavirus pandemic. After recovering from his ankle injury, the World Cup winner played 14 games following the resumption and helped United reach the last four of the FA Cup and Europa League and qualify for next season’s Champions League. Meanwhile, defender Phil Jagielka and midfielder Jack Rodwell have signed new one-year contracts at Sheffield United. Jagielka, 38, and 29-year-old Rodwell, whose deals were due to expire on June 30, signed short-term extensions to take them to the end of the delayed 2019-20 season. “Phil is a valuable and respected member of the squad,” said manager Chris Wilder. “The same applies with Jack, who offered us versatility and gave us options within the group during the second half of last term.” England international Jagielka made 10 appearances after rejoining United on a free transfer at the beginning of last season following 12 years at Everton. Rodwell played two games after arriving on a free transfer in January.
