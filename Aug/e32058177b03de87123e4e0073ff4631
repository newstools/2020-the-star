Kenya's afro-pop band Sauti Sol has postponed its much anticipated virtual extravaganza to August 22. The much hyped online concert is a celebration of the band's fifth album 'Midnight Train', launched on June 5. According to a statement on Tuesday by music industry publicist Yvette Gayle, the  event has been pushed back due to overwhelming interest from fans all over the world for inclusion. The BET Award-nominated musicians were gearing up to celebrate through an African YouTube extravaganza at the beginning of August. "From Nairobi to New York, London to Lagos, Melbourne to Mumbai and Jakarta to Johannesburg, now everyone can take a trip through Sauti Sol’s latest musical offering," Gayle said. She said the change in date to accommodate more fans was largely thanks to the support of Radio Africa Group Limited. Gayle said the media house consistently shone a light on the Midnight Train album throughout many of its channels, attracting love from old and new fans. In May, Sauti Sol partnered with Radio Africa Group on the release of their first single off the Midnight Train album - Suzanna. Fans caught the release of the song exclusively on Classic 105, Smooth FM, Kiss 100, Radio Jambo and Homeboyz Radio. The online concert will feature songs such as My Everything, Feel My Love and Disco Matanga (Yambakhana).
