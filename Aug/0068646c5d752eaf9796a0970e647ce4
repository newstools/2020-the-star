Football Kenya Federation (KFF) Woman Representative candidate Kerubo Momanyi has welcomed the newly released elections roadmap for county and national elections, saying it was long overdue. “As candidates, we have been waiting for clear and concise directions from both Fifa and the Electoral Board and that's why I consider the elections roadmap that was released yesterday to be long overdue,” she said. “It looked pretty well thought out and I hope it signals the end to this exhaustive electoral process," she said. Momanyi is expected to battle it out with former Fifa referee Margaret Omondi in the elections scheduled for October 17 for the new FKF National Executive Committee position. The new FKF Constitution passed at the 2017 Annual General Meeting provides for an elective Woman Representative seat in the National Executive Committee. Elsewhere, FKF Kisii County chairman aspirant Jezreel Mbegera faulted the FKF Electoral Board, saying it had  failed to address issues raised by aspirants and other stakeholders. “We want a free and fair process. The board and FKF should convene a stakeholders meeting with all aspirants so that we can have an acceptable roadmap to the elections. We want the elections held once and for all because the current stalemate is hurting our game,” he said. He noted that board’s decision to adopt the Fifa standard Electoral Code was wrong, warning that the move is likely to be challenged legally. “Change of the code should be done by the FKF general assembly. What the board did might be challenged at the Sports Disputes Tribunal,” noted Mbegera. He asked club delegates to reject bribery and elect officials who can improve football both at county and national level. “Delegates should put the interest of the game ahead of their personal interests when the elections are held. We are lagging behind because of electing wrong people,” he concluded.
