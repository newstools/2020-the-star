The government has approved and allocated Sh200 million towards the construction of an overpass and corridor along the busy Moi North Lake road in Naivasha. Once complete, the overpass will provide an access route for tens of wild animals in Eburru in accessing the nearby Lake Naivasha. The overpass will help reduce cases of accidents involving the wildlife crossing the road and reducing cases of human-wildlife conflict in the area. According to Joseph Mutongu from Rhino Ark, work on the project would start in the coming months. Mutongu, who is the fence and community manager, said the site where the overpass along the North Lake road would be constructed had already been identified. “The plans and design for the Sh200 million overpass which will be 60m wide are ready and this will be constructed by the Ministry of Roads,” he said. He added that Rhino Ark and partners had already fenced the corridor from the forest to the lake ahead of the overpass project. “From the forest to the lake its 4.4km and we have used Sh2.7m per kilometre to erect this fence which will be crucial in addressing cases of human-wildlife conflict in this area,” he said. The community manager termed Eburru forest as a critical water tower, adding that fencing it had curbed cases of illegal logging, charcoal burning and poaching. “We have managed to recruit and reform former poachers and charcoal burners who are now working as rangers in our efforts to protect this forest,” he said. Friends of Lake Naivasha chairman Francis Muthui noted that the overpass would help protect wildlife from speeding motorists. He noted that tens of wild animals had been killed along the North Lake road and the Nairobi-Nakuru highway while crossing from one end to the other in search of pastures and water. “The move to construct the overpass for the use of wildlife is a noble idea which will reduce cases of human-wildlife conflicts and also attract tourists,” he said.
