The Nairobi Hospital has announced that it is now offering free Covid-19 tests but only upon admission. "As we continue to offer our patients care in an atmosphere of trust, safety and comfort, we are now offering free Covid-19 testing for all our admissions including surgeries. Speak to your doctor today," the hospital tweeted on Friday. In June, the Ministry of Health announced that the country's capacity to conduct more Covid-19 tests continues to be hit by the dwindling supplies. The ministry admitted a backlog of tests especially in Mombasa and Nairobi. MoH however, confirmed that part of the backlog was reduced. Director of Public Health Francis Kuria said the backlog had mainly affected truck drivers but most of the results had been released to the respective recipients. “This is of course not to say that we are not still facing issues with our supply chain management, we are trying hard to sort this out,” Kuria said. A few days ago, the Kenya Red Cross started free 40-days mass Covid-19 testing in Garissa county. It was launched at the Garissa Primary School playground. The programme by the Red Cross and the county is funded by the European Union. Red Cross county coordinator Muhamed Dubow urged residents to get tested, saying tests will reveal coronavirus cases that otherwise would have gone undetected in asymptomatic patients. The programme has engaged 1,100 Community Health Volunteers to sensitise people at the grassroots on the need for testing, hand washing, social distancing and mask wearing. Kenya on Friday recorded 241 new cases of Covid-19, raising the country's total to 33,630, Health CAS Rashid Aman confirmed. This was after a sample of 4,520 tested in the last 24 hours bringing the cumulative tests to 442,713. 47 of the new cases are foreigners. Speaking during the daily Covid-19 briefing at the Kemri headquarters, Aman said age wise, the youngest was a one-year-old infant while the oldest was 86 years old.
