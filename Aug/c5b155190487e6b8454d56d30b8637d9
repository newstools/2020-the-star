Kiss FM morning presenter says he would sit in the house and cry after high school. The comedian was heartbroken after most of the people he cleared high school with proceeded to campus and he did not. Speaking during the morning Kiss show, Jalango said, "When I finished form four my dad could not afford school fees. "I used to feel embarrassed as everyone else had gone to Nairobi to join campus. I would sit in the house and cry. "One day, I just woke up and said ‘kama mbaya, mbaya’. I had no option, whatever it took, I was determined to succeed." Jalang'o has since then gone on to become one of the most-sought-after radio personalities. He is also among the highest-paid MCs in Kenya.
