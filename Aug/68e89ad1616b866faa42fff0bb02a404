Former international Lucas Onyango has been appointed international development manager of the Kenya Rugby League Federation. Onyango, who is based in the United Kingdom, will be tasked to develop international relationships and partnerships that will be of benefit to the league. He will be a goodwill ambassador of the Kenya Rugby League to the world representing the country and league values, ethics, heritage and culture. Onyango, 39, is a professional sports scientist, a strength and conditioning coach with exceptional organisational skills and is an experienced development officer, a position he held at Oldham Rugby Club in the United Kingdom. Onyango had a distinguished rugby career having played for local side Mean Machine in the late 90s and early 2000s before switching codes to Rugby League in the United Kingdom in 2006 where he plied his trade for four clubs including Sale Sharks, Widens, Vikings Oldham and Oxford. He has also coached Sanford city Reds and is currently based with Mancunians Rugby League as a sports scientist and strength and conditioning coach. “Having played for both codes of the game, I'm happy to join a wonderful team in a bid to grow the Kenya Rugby League to greater heights," said Onyango. Elsewhere, the Kenyan Rugby fraternity has once again been thrown into  mourning following the death of youngster Ian Waraba who turned out for Kenya Harlequin. Waraba drowned in a dam on Saturday while he was on an outing with his friends in his Waitaluk area in Kitale. His body was retrieved on Sunday morning by divers. His brother Brian Waraba, who also plays for the Kenya Cup side, described the deceased as a humble individual and talented player who was passionate about rugby.
