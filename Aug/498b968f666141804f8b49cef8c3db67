Blazers’ attacking midfielder Yvonne Sifuna is hoping for more playing when sporting activities resume after the current coronavirus-imposed lockdown. The talented 20-year old has been forced to contend for a place on the bench in the star-studded team since joining the Jos Openda’s charges in 2019 from Misikhu Girls High School. Sifuna, a right midfielder, competes for a place with captain Tracy Karanja. Sifuna is firmly on the team’s plans and even played five minutes against USIU Spartans in the opening match this season in March. She, however, said she will have to remain patient. “I haven’t been exposed in games as much as I would have loved but it has been a good experience donning the jersey of one of the most successful teams in the country. Hockey is fun, I have passion for the game and I just have to train hard and I am sure my time will come. Sharing a dressing room with players who have achieved a lot is an honour,” said the Bungoma County-born player. She said given chance, she could form a formidable partnership with Eleanor Chebet in attack. The pair struck a rapport when they guided Misikhu to both the national and East Africa titles in 2017. Unfortunately, they were eliminated by Tigoi at the regional level the following year. “I can play as a striker since I did it previously. I am perfect at hitting the ball and could be an asset. I played well with Chebet and we could be a force to reckon with if we could be paired again upfront. I am open to the idea of being pushed further to attack.” Sifuna was in Misikhu’s main team in 2016 while in Form Two.
