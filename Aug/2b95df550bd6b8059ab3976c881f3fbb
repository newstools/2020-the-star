Diamond's manager Babu Tale has for the first time spoken after his wife died 45 days ago. Tale shared a video of his wife and said he was heartbroken and hadn’t come to terms with her death. He wrote, “RIP, my wife. Ni 45 days tangu umeniacha. Mama TT nahisi bado nipo kwenye ndoto." Reports indicated the Wasafi manager’s wife, Shamsa Kombo, died while admitted at the ICU after she had developed breathing complications from an asthma attack. Babu Tale’s brother, Abdu Tale, said she was in ICU after throat constrictions. "We got the news at 6am on Sunday. Before her admission to the ICU, she had malaria, she also had ulcers. She was ok but her health deteriorated." News about her death was broken on social media by Diamond's family members, who condoled with the bereaved.
