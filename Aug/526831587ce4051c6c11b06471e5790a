Former Kiambu Governor Ferdinand Waititu failed to appear in court on Monday for the hearing of a graft case against him because he tested positive for Covid-19. All the other accused persons in the case, including Waititu’s wife Susan Wangari, were in court. The hearing was adjourned to November. The case will be mentioned on October 21 to confirm Waititu’s health status. Waititu's lawyer John Swaka told magistrate Thomas Nzioki that the former governor had been unwell since last week and the doctor had advised him to self-isolate "We shall be seeking 14 days to enable my client to undergo another test before he mingles with anybody," Swaka said. In his ruling, Nzioki said the application for adjournment had merit after looking at the results from Lancet. He, however, ordered state counsel Nicholas Mutuku to confirm the authenticity of the Covid-19 results produced by Waititu. Mutuku said four witnesses will testify in the case. Waititu and his wife were charged in July last year in relation to the Sh588 million illegal road tender for upgrading gravel roads with bitumen. The prosecution alleged that the tender was irregularly awarded to Testimony Enterprises Limited. Edited by A.N
