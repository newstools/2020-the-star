A terror suspect has been arrested for threatening a High Commissioner in Nairobi. Tracy Wairimu, 34, is accused on sending two threatening letters-one sprayed with an industrial chemical and the other with hay fever pesticides- to the High Commission on July 31. Wairimu was arrested in Utawala by the DCI's Anti-terrorism Police Unit officers. An excerpt from one of the letters showed the woman threatening the embassy boss to facilitate travel documentation and residence to an unidentified individual failure to which they would assault him. "I know how much racism is in your Visa system but she must be awarded the travel documents," it read. “We will assault you and break your bones, we will rape you in turns and put explosives where you think you are safest.” Via Twitter, the DCI said the the suspect had earlier on June 23 been arraigned and charged with another terrorism hoax that targeted the Commissioner General of the Kenya Prisons Service. The suspect was out on cash bail. Wairimu is currently in police custody pending arraignment at Kibera Law Courts once all necessary procedures are completed. Earlier, three sleuths from the DCI were arrested and are in police custody waiting to be arraigned for involvement in the robbery with violence incident that occurred at Baraka Gas Company in Matuu-Machakos county. The three officers from the Special Service Unit were arrested on Monday evening for an incident that happened on July 31.
