Raila Odinga's ODM party has accused Deputy president william Ruto of creating chaos to disrupt an audit into the alleged theft at Kemsa. In a statement on Tuesday evening, party Secretary General Edwin Sifuna said,  "It is not surprising that the DP's position now seems to delegitimize an audit by the Auditor General." Sifuna said Ruto has consistently sought to delegitimize institutions such as the DCI and EACC in a bid to avoid accountability. "We do know that an audit at Kemsa is an uncomfortable prospect because it may just add Kemsa to the long  catalogue of corruption ills that include Arror Kimwarer, KCAA land KPC land and hundreds of other colorful assets of theft," he said. "In deed, Ruto's excitable mien lately shows that an audit will not surprise anyone by its findings." This was a hit back after Ruto  accused Raila of covering up for those behind the alleged theft at Kemsa. Ruto had said the "heist at Kemsa is a deplorable manifestation of the worst public vice that has seen the hypocritical “former” Opposition characteristically change the tune". In response, Sifuna said the DP has no evidence to back his claims otherwise he would have been 'falling over himself to present to the public'. Ruto had earlier on said the current "stammering, staggering and flip-flopping by Raila is a confirmation of thieves caught red-handed stealing from the sick, endangering the lives of the front line workers and robbing the dying". “It is clear that you, the owners and operators of the Corruption Laundromat are working overtime in your effort to “sanitise” the Covid Billionaires,” he said. Sifuna said Kenyans should 'demand that he (Ruto) takes a walk and become an activist or blogger' for 'prosecuting such weighty matters on Twitter'. The back and fourth war of words commenced after Raila in a statement called for a special audit of the country's Covid-19 funds.
