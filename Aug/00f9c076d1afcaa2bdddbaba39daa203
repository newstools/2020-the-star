A High Court in Nairobi has ordered the retrial of a man who was convicted to 20 years in jail for defiling a 14-year-old child by a magistrate court in Meru. David Thuranira was found guilty of defiling the minor on diverse dates between November 1, 2017, and January 27, 2018, at a village in Tigania West constituency, in Meru county. Delivering the ruling on August 20, Justice David Majanja noted that during the hearing of the case, Thuranira who had been released on bond absconded after the close of the prosecution case and after he had been placed on his defense. The accused had stated that he would make an unsworn statement. When the case came up for defence hearing last year on April 4 the trial magistrate revoked the bond and issued a warrant of arrest. The matter was fixed for mention on April 25 but the accused person was absent. The trial magistrate went further and closed the defense case and set a judgment date for May 2. The judgment was delivered in the absence of the accused person. Thuranira was later arrested and brought to court on June 26 when he was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment after mitigation on July 5. Majanja ruled that the trial magistrate fell into error when he closed the defense case in the absence of the accused. “Although the appellant had absconded, the matter was coming up for mention on the day the defense case was closed,” Majanja ruled. “There was no evidence of the efforts being made to locate the appellant on that date hence it cannot be said that the appellant had forfeited his opportunity of being heard in his defense having jumped bail to become a fugitive from justice,” he said. Majanja said that the appellant was effectively denied the opportunity to put forward his defence, hence cannot be said to have had a fair trial. “The appellant shall be retried before the magistrate court in Tigania on August 31,” he said. He said that since the case is not old, the witnesses may be found easily.  Edited by R.Wamochie
