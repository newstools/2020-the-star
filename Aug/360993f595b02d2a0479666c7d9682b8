@ppcheti At least 250 families dependent on stone mining in Manda-Maweni village, Lamu, have opposed a plan by private developers to introduce cutting machines in their quarries. They said such a move will push them out of the stone quarrying business, which they have manually conducted for decades. The villagers have accused local administrators of colluding with the private developers to "snatch" their only livelihood. Manda Island Community Development Organisation secretary William Muiruri accused chiefs of colluding with private developers to frustrate them. “The machines will definitely mean we will no longer have work. We have done this for years and it has always been manual and no one has complained. We can’t accept machines here,” Muiruri said. Manda-Maweni Quarrying Cooperative Society chair Benson Ojuok said they suspect the local administrators are collaborating with the private developers to grab their quarries under the pretext of introducing brick-cutting machines. He said the community had not been consulted on the move and as such the villagers feel the new plan is malicious. “We’ve been here for the past 40 years but we’re always told we’re foreigners. This was a no man’s land but we turned it into a home when no one else wanted to live here. All of a sudden, this village has become attractive and people want to grab it from us. We shall fight back,” Ojuok said. Residents said some of the quarries have been grabbed and fenced off and miners denied access. “We have tried to access several quarries but we are told they are private property. Sometimes we have to bribe guards to allow us to mine secretly without the owners knowing. It hurts because these mines belong to the community,” Issa Juma said. The villagers have appealed to the National Land Commission to issue title deeds for the mines to protect them from grabbers. (edited by o. owino)
