Some 120 vulnerable households in Kibera and Lang’ata on Monday benefited from a feeding programme set up by Kibera Vision Achievers in conjunction with Trending Teens Africa. The food drive targeted youths and young mothers. Speaking during the activity, Joan Kering, founder of JK Foundation, said, "We have a lot of young mothers in the society, most of them dependent on their spouses. This food drive will help them endure hardship amid the coronavirus crisis. "We also have a ‘chama’, whereby we target young mothers who contribute Sh10 daily, which helps put up small businesses to help them contribute financially in their families."
