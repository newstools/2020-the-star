Wiper party leader Kalonzo Musyoka  has implied that Deputy President William Ruto is deliberately isolating himself from the Jubilee and playing victim. "Anybody looking forward to elective posts will want to paint himself as a victim. Are they really victims or are they self-alienating," he said during an interview on Citizen TV aired on Friday night. This comes a day after Ruto  gave clear indication that he is done with the Jubilee Party and will be seeking a new outfit for 2022. In an interview with the Star on Thursday,  Ruto said he was working to solve the issues facing Jubilee but he was ready to consider other options. "When the President disagreed with Kanu, he formed TNA and when I was done with ODM, I formed URP. In politics, there are always options and I will employ them at the right time," Ruto said by phone. Ruto claimed Jubilee party has been 'hijacked by conmen and busybodies', a comment that has attracted scathing attacks from Uhuru's allies. In a bare knuckle attack on DP Ruto, the President’s lieutenants want him to resign from the party and chart his own political path instead of attacking the outfit from within. They say Ruto’s assertions that conmen and brokers have hijacked the party amounts to direct attack on the party leader, who installed the officials. “If he feels that the party is being run by conmen, then I would actually expect of him to leave the party now and join a party that is not run by conmen,” Nyeri Town MP Ngunjiri Wambugu, a fierce critic of the DP, said on Friday.
