Chiefs and village headmen have been warned against favouritism, corruption and cronyism in the implementation of the Kazi Mtaani programme. Housing and Urban Development PS Charles Hinga said on Friday there were reports that some chiefs in Kilifi recruited "outsiders" to the programme at the expense of locals. The PS urged residents to give the names of the "outsiders".Â  Hinga said once the exercise is complete, names of the beneficiaries will be published and if there are ghost workers, chiefs or village elders will be held responsible. "We are going to publish all the names and if there are ghost workers, we shall smoke them out," he said. The PS spoke when he toured Kilifi county to inspect Kazi Mtaani progress. Hinga also warned the chiefs against using the programme to enrich themselves as it is meant to empower the youth. "If there is a chief who is engaging in corruption or favouritism, it means he is preventing locals from benefiting," he said. Charles Amani, a youth from Mnarani in Kilifi, said he was among those who were bypassed during the recruitment. "I was born and brought up in Mnarani, but I was not picked for the programme," he said. Hinga said the government has so far spent Sh2.15 billion to pay 283,000 youths engaged in the Kazi Mtaaani initiative. Of the number, 6,000 are from Kilifi. The PS said 92.5 per cent of the beneficiaries have been paid but 7.5 per cent are yet to receive payment because some of them gave wrong mobile numbers, while others have been blacklisted by mobile phone service providers. "Some youths have been blacklisted by Safaricom and some opted to use other numbers because of Fuliza. To ensure one is paid, they have to sign an indemnity form allowing us to pay that number," the PS said. Hinga urged the youth to give correct details to avoid such delays in payment.
