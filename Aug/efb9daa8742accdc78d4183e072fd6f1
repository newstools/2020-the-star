Butula MP Joseph Oyula has given in to pressure from residents to repair a grader that was grounded three years ago. Constituents were concerned the Sh18 million machine was rotting away at Butula AP camp yet roads remain in bad shape. The CDF office, under then MP Christine Mango, bought the grader in 2007 to facilitate road repairs. “The grader was purchased using our money. It pains us when we see it rot away. The MP should ensure it is operational to rehabilitate roads that are impassable, particularly during the rainy season,” said Victor Juma from Lukhari village. Jane Awori criticised the CDF office for not repairing the grader. Oyula said Butula CDF has set aside at least Sh1 million to repair the machine. The first-term MP said the grader had already malfunctioned when he took over in 2017. “We have set aside money with the intention of recovering the grader for the sake of our people who want good roads,” Oyula said. “The grader stalled outside the constituency so we had to arrange to move it to Butula AP line, where it is now. We have already received a quotation from a mechanic so once we receive money we shall use it for repair works.” Former MPs have traded accusations over the grader. Mango blames it for her 2007 defeat. “The residents were furious that I used public funds to buy the grader,” she said. “They vowed to vote me out. It concerns me when I see a machine that was to fast-track the repair of roads grounded.” Butula has had three lawmakers since—Alfred Odhiambo (2007-2013), Michael Onyura (2013-2017) and Oyula.
