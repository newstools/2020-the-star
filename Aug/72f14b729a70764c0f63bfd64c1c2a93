The court will visit the crime scene where Deputy Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu's bodyguard was wounded in October 2017. Three men are charged with the shooting on October 24, the day before a petition seeking cancellation of the presidential election rerun was to be heard in the Supreme Court. The election went ahead. The three pleaded not guilty to robbery with violence before a Kibera court. The victim was police constable Titus Musyoka. State prosecutor Nancy Kerubo told court on Monday the witnesses were not bonded and the case should be adjourned. It was adjourned until September 11 when the court and suspects will visit the crime scene near Marsabit Plaza on Ngong Road. The first witness had started to testify in the previous session but was stood down so the court could visit the crime scene. The three were each released on Sh1 million bond and sureties of the same amount. Musyoka was shot three times after he dropped Mwilu at home. The suspects were arrested Ruiru on November 17 and the weapon recovered. (Edited by V. Graham)
