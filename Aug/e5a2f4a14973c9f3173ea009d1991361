Kakamega Senator Cleophas Malala has finally surrendered to DCI officers who have been camping at his Royal Finesse Kitengela home since Sunday night. Makueni Senator Mutula Kilonzo Jnr claimed in the Senate that Malala was arrested for the distribution of government sanitizers on Sunday. His arrest comes barely hours after his Bomet counterpart Christopher Langat was arrested. Langat was arrested a few minutes before 11.30 am on Monday at his house in Nyayo Estate, Embakasi. He left his home alongside lawyer Nelson Havi heading to Bomet Police Station for further questioning. Samburu senator Steve Lelegwe was also arrested on Monday morning. Malala’s arrest came on a day when the senators were supposed to decide on the fate of the appropriate formula to be used in sharing revenue to counties. Kakamega senator is one of the senators opposing the Third Basis Formula which seeks to allocate money to counties on the basis of population. During the arrest, some of the senators including Kipchumba Murkomen (Elgeyo-Marakwet) and Mutula Kilonzo Junior (Makueni) tried to stop the arrest, which ended in vain. The senators had rushed to Malala’s residence in solidarity following an adjournment at the senate until the arrested members were released. The detectives however ruled out that the arrest was in relation to his stand on the ongoing debate.
