Tanzanian opposition politician Tundu Lissu has been elected as Chadema party's presidential candidate for the October polls. Lissu, who survived an attempt on his life in the capital, Dodoma, returned to the country late last month. He had been living in Belgium since he was shot three years ago and has undergone more than 20 medical operations. Nobody was convicted for the attempt on his life. While out of the country, Lissu was stripped of his parliamentary seat. He was met by hundreds of cheering supporters as he left the international airport in the country's main city, Dar es Salaam upon his return.
