More than 2,000 Kwale private school teachers have called for the government to help sustain their lives while on Covid-19 long holiday. The government suspended learning in all schools in March to control the spread of the coronavirus and later scrapped the academic year. Naliaka Luseno, the Kwale Kenya Private Schools Association representative, said the virus has extensively ravaged their livelihoods. She said they have gone without salaries for over four months. “These teachers are going through a lot. The last salary they received was in March,” Luseno told the Star in Ukunda. She said many turned to alternative jobs for survival but to no avail as businesses don't do well either. She fears that some teachers might develop psychological problems because debts have accumulated. “The teachers are breadwinners and families depend on them, not forgetting the monthly rental bills and they have nowhere to go, so they are mentally strained,” she said. She added that the burden of getting school fees awaits them next year since some have children. Luseno said they have been looking for assistance in various departments but have had no response to date. She also urged Good Samaritans and well-wishers to get on board and save the teachers from starvation. Last month, Kenya Secondary School Heads regional chair Hellen Machuka advised private school teachers to develop new survival skills. “We hope and praying for the private sector that through their own innovations they will be able to meet their challenges because even the public school teachers are struggling,” she said.
