Health services are likely to be disrupted starting Monday after nurses said they would go on strike over delayed salaries. Kenya National Union of Nurses (KNUN) officials said none of the 47 counties has paid their health workers their July salary. Some, the union officials said, have not yet paid May and June salaries. KNUN secretary general Seth Panyako wrote to the County Public Service Boards, saying the union has advised all its branch officials to lead members in taking part in the salary parade. The letter, dated August 4, is copied to Labour CS and all KNUN branch secretaries. “By copy of this notice, the union branch official is authorised to seek and take collective action with other affected trade unions.” Last week, nurses threatened to strike, accusing the government of turning a blind eye to their grievances. Panyako warned that health workers will only go back to work when they are provided with N95 masks, are fully paid their salary arrears and their insurance package catered for. "From Monday it will not be business as usual in this country. You can't work when you don't have food, you have children in the house and you can't pay your rent," he said. Nurses are demanding a risk allowance of Sh20,000, saying they are three times more susceptible to nosocomial infections than any other health worker. Current data shows that 18 per cent of all health workers infected are nurses, laboratory officers account for seven per cent, while doctors and clinical officers account for six per cent of all infections. Volunteers account for three per cent, pharmacists three per cent while other staff account for three per cent. The nurses are also demanding the reinstatement of NHIF Civil Servant Medical Scheme with immediate effect. The union is also protesting what they term the employment of nurses on dubious terms. Panyako said this has reduced the nursing to a profession under siege.
