Wrangles have rocked Kanu party in Nyeri county, with two rival groups fighting over its regional leadership. One group led by Mt Kenya region chairperson Joseph Mukirai recognises John Muya as the branch chairman. The other is led by Karanja wa Njeru who is said to be mobilising his supporters to take the reins. Mukirai said the stalemate would be solved at the county level without involving officials at the national headquarters. On the contrary, Karanja alleged that the group led by Mukirai was a gang of political brokers out to milk national chairman Gideon Moi dry. He urged Moi to avoid the faction led by Mukirai, saying they were dividing the party instead of bringing its members together. The division comes days after the party launched digital registration of members. In a statement read by the partyâ€™s advocate Ann Githinji, the Kanu resolved to engage in massive recruitment of new members digitally in readiness for the 2022 election.
