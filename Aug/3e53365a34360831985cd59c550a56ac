Vihiga Queens’ head Coach Alex Alumira has set his eyes on the newly-formed Africa Women's Champions League set for next following years of dominance in the Football Kenya Federation Women's Premier League. He said the event, which was approved by the CAF Executive Meeting on June 30, will be an interesting challenge for his team having won the local title for four consecutive years. “Since we joined the league in 2016 we only lost against Thika United and finished second that year, our position ever,” Alumira said. “We are likely to have a Women's Champions League as from 2021 and this will provide experience for me as a coach and my players too." The coach lauded his team citing that despite the numerous challenges, the girls have been trying their best to post good results. "Payments and transport has been a major blow to the team. We are paid by the county government and most of the time it receives its share from the national government late," Alumira said. He added that they have been depending on one bus with Vihiga United which is a major when the teams are travelling for away matches on the same day.
