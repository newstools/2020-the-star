A woman was on Saturday arrested after she abandoned her newborn baby at a petrol station toilet in Runyenjes, Embu. Perpetua Mwende is said to have dropped her hours-old daughter inside a sanitary pads bin while on transit to Nairobi. According to a report lodged by a Shell watchman at Runyenjes police station, the woman who was a passenger in a public vehicle arrived there around 7.30pm in a Neno Sacco matatu and asked to use the washroom. About 30 minutes after the matatu had left, the watchman said he heard a child crying from the toilet and went to check. “She asked me for the keys and said she wanted to relieve herself. I only heard a baby crying after the matatu she was traveling in had long left,” he reported. They found a baby thrown inside a sanitary pad container and bloodstains on the floor. He rushed to the police station about a kilometre away and reported the incident. Officers rushed to the scene and rescued the baby. She was taken to Embu Level 5 hospital where she is undergoing treatment and in a stable condition. Mwende was later arrested by Makuyu station officers while on transit to Nairobi after the driver was informed of the incident by a petrol station attendant. He drove to Makuyu police station where he reported the incident leading to the arrest. The woman is in custody pending investigations before she is charged in court. Edited by R.Wamochie
