Health CS Mutahi Kagwe has pointed out that there are doctors in the private sector who are undermining the process of protecting families. "We are aware that there are doctors, in the private sector who are undermining the process of protecting families by exploiting their emotions and colluding with some of them to ensure burials are done normally," he said during a press briefing while in Kisumu. He also pointed out that wearing a mask and following government directives is not a favour to a law enforcement officer "Bidding loved one’s farewell is important to all of us but it should not end with greater pain or loss of more lives. Wearing a mask and following government directives is not a favour to a law enforcement officer," he said. Kenya today recorded 599 people who have turned positive out of a sample size of 4,420.
