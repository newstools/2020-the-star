A woman was on Friday charged with smuggling 22 Ethiopian nationals into the country contrary to the Kenyan Citizenry and immigration act. Ayato Iribo Wato, was charged before Kibera senior principal magistrate Derrick Kuto where she denied the charges. The charge sheet read in court says that she committed the offense on August 27 at around 5PM at Chokaa in Kayole Sub-county within Nairobi County. The Ethiopian national lacked legal permits that allowed them in Kenya, the charge sheet says. Ironically, she was charged after the same Ethiopian nationals pleaded guilty to being in the Country illegally. They mitigated that they spent two months in the desert with no food or water and were in Kenya to look for opportunities. Kuto ordered them to pay a fine pf Sh 50,000 each or spend seven months in Jail and be taken back to their country after paying the fine or finishing their sentencing. The woman on the other hand was granted Sh400,000 bond or a cash bail of Sh200,000 with the surety of the same amount. The case will proceed on September 12.
