@ppcheti About 650 families on Faza island in Lamu East will be connected to piped water for the first time ever following completion of a Sh20 million project. Technicians are already installing meters in homes before pumping begins. Lamu Water Services Company acting managing director Paul Kimani said the project is almost ready for launching. "We have laid the groundwork for piped water in Faza Island. The pipes have been flashed and both sump and elevated tanks installed. This metering installation paves way for access to tap water in the coming weeks," Kimani said. Faza ward has benefited from flagship water projects at a cost of Sh118 million. Kizingitini, Tchundwa, Myabogi, Mbwajumali Siyu, Pate and Mtangawanda have had water pipeline extensions over 105 kilometres and household connections. Governor Fahim Twaha said solving Lamu's water scarcity and inaccessibility will break the existing inequalities. "The value of water and water footprint is central to human and economic activity, and this problem shouldn't be allowed to continue any longer because it extends the marginalisation. It is our vision that every household in Lamu be connected to piped water," Twaha said. Fatuma Mohamed, a resident, said the quality of water in the village has been extremely poor and many have suffered from waterborne ailments. "But now that we are getting water at home, we expect ailments like diarrhoea to reduce dramatically. It also does not make financial sense to buy water expensively when life is tough," Mohamed said.
