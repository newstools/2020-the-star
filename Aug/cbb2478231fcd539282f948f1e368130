A chief in West Pokot county has been sacked for subjecting her two daughters to FGM. It was not immediately known if she was also arrested for the crime. Her name, location and details of the offence were not disclosed. "We have already sacked a chief who subjected her two daughters to the cut. The government won’t tolerate such behaviour. Those tasked to protect the girls are the ones spoiling them,” county commissioner Apollo Okello said. Speaking at a recent anti-FGM meeting, he again warned chiefs about the escalating cases of FGM, especially now that schools are closed because of Covid-19. He warned that chiefs will be sacked if any girl is cut in their locations. Committing and abetting FGM is a crime. Failure to disclose it is also an offence. Most cases happen with the knowledge of chiefs, assistant chiefs and administrators, Akello said. Curbing and ultimately stopping FGM requires the combined efforts of all leaders and chiefs must take a tough stand, he said. Chiefs who take part in or abet FGM are not able to effectively fight the practice, he said. Government representatives must be at the forefront of protecting the rights of girls, Akello said. “The government will not negotiate with such officials if caught fronting their girls or being silent on the issue,” the commissioner said. He said the government is committed to eliminating FGM and will support chiefs to access remote areas and arrest perpetrators. Akello said the Anti-FGM Act clearly stipulates the role of chiefs in fighting FGM and if they are reluctant, the law will catch up with them. “If you fail to arrest the perpetrators, then either you are part of the problem or you are supporting FGM,” he  said. The commissioner also called on political leaders to come on board and fight FGM. “Some politicians don’t want to talk publicly about FGM because they fear they might lose votes in areas where the cut is carried out," Akello said.
