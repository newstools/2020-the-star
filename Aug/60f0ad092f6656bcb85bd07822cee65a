The Kakamega county assembly has adjourned for recess following suspicion that  three MCAs could have contracted the coronavirus. The assembly was scheduled to break on Thursday but it adjourned on Tuesday for fear that the virus may spread to other ward reps and staff. The house adjourned unprocedurally via a decision communicated online by the business committee chaired by Speaker Morris Buluma on Tuesday. A motion must be moved on the floor by the house leadership for adjournment under the Standing Orders. The speaker’s rules require that a maximum of 20 MCAs attend sittings at any time. "We made the decision because three members were suspected of having contracted the virus. Though they wanted to keep it secret, we thought this would endanger the lives of members,” deputy speaker Kasaya Soita said. He said the ward reps have in the recent past been reckless in their conduct in public. MCAs have been mingling with citizens at public functions organised by other elected leaders in Western region. Majority leader Joel Ongoro said closure of the assembly was a precautionary measure to protect members. “We’re yet to confirm whether the suspected members are positive or not but this is not a secret because it’s in the public domain,” Ongoro said. He said that the assembly leadership would summon special sittings in the event of any urgent issues that require the assembly's deliberation. Assembly clerk Laban Atemba said the assembly planned to carry out mass testing of ll the 89 MCAs and staff once funds were available. “We have taken precautionary measures within the assembly precincts by providing hand washing points, sanitiser and ensuring social distancing during sessions to minimise spread of the virus,” he said.
