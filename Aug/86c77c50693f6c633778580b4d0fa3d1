The Russian Emergencies ministry’s Ilyushin Il-76 aircraft carrying the ministry’s experts departed for Beirut on Thursday, a spokesperson said. "An Il-76 plane, which returned from Lebanon the night before, had once again left for Beirut, carrying rescue workers from the Centrospas group and special equipment," the spokesperson said. This was the fourth flight heading to Lebanon to help deal with the aftermath of Tuesday’s explosion. More than 100 Russian rescue workers and doctors had already arrived in Beirut. In addition, Russia had delivered a 50-bed makeshift hospital to the country to be deployed at Beirut’s Rafic Hariri Stadium. A powerful blast rocked the Lebanese capital’s port area on August 4. Shockwaves from the explosion destroyed and damaged dozens of buildings and cars. Local authorities said the blast was caused by the detonation of 2,700 tonnes of ammonium nitrate, seized by customs officials in 2014. According to the latest data, the explosion killed 137 people and left about 5,000 others injured, while dozens are missing. A two-week state of emergency has been declared in Beirut.
