President Uhuru Kenyatta's family marked Mzee Jomo Kenyatta's 42nd death anniversary on Saturday. However, this was the first time it was a private affair and Uhuru did not lay a wreath at his father's grave. UhuruÂ  announced last year that the memorial service held for the country's founding father would be the last. He said the agreement was reached after consultations with the entire Kenyatta family. "As President, I have consulted with the family of Mzee Kenyatta. We have agreed together that this is going to be the last celebration of 41 years of Mzee in this manner," Uhuru said last year. Last year's memorial was held at the Holy Family Basilica. Mzee Jomo Kenyatta died on August 22, 1978.
