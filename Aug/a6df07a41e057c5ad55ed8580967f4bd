Mandera Woman Representative Amina Gedow on Wednesday opened market stalls in Kuttulo subcounty and donated 20 motorbikes to Elwak youths. She also distributed water pumps to River Daua women's groups for irrigation farming and increased crop production. Another Sh7.5 million was donated to people living with disability, youths and women for economic stimulus programmes and post-Covid-19 economic recovery. The battle against the coronavirus can only be won if the public fully follows health guidelines to contain it, Gedow said. Speaking in Kuttulo town, she said everyone must take more individual responsibility. “We are seeing a worrying trend in which patients undergoing management and are stable one minute suddenly deteriorate the next minute and succumb to Covid-19," she said. The lawmaker rejected Covid deniers who call the disease a 'creation of the government'. She urged beneficiaries of the modern stalls to adhere to health protocols while doing business. The stalls were constructed through the National Government Affirmative Action Fund. They will help women do business and generate income for their families. She said women bear the greatest responsibility to feed their families and urged them to develop a culture of saving money for use in hard times. “This disease is a living threat to humanity, deaths are increasing and from the look of things, the worse is yet to come. Developed countries have lost and keep losing lives in the hundreds of thousands," she said. Gedow also urged residents to observe Covid-19 protocols during burials and said funeral laxness is a cause of concern. “We urge our people to take this killer disease seriously and take personal protection seriously," she said.
