Gospel singer Emmy Kosgei and her Nigerian husband Anselm Madubuko are celebrating their 7th wedding anniversary. Taking to social media, Emmy thanked God for keeping them and for having a peaceful love. "Thank you for walking with us! Thank you for drawing us closer to you. You have been faithful in this year of completion, we give you praise," she wrote. Emmy then appreciated her husband for loving her and taking care of her. "You are an amazing husband, thank you for protecting me! Thank you for showing me Jesus, thank you for treating me like a queen that I am." Emmy added that she has no regrets for accepting Madubuko’s proposal, despite what naysayers said. "Looking at seven years back, I’m glad I said yes! I have grown spiritually, emotionally and otherwise," she wrote. Emmy, who shared a photo of them, also appreciated her husband for supporting her career. "Oh this picture was during the recording of my soon coming song #MALOO and my #2020project after preaching and a long day, you stayed there until the recording was done," she wrote. "Over 15hrs just to ensure this project is a success. This touched me so much… In your capacity, you would have sent your staff, sons, etc., to stand in for you but you gave your attention." Emmy turned 40 years while her husband is 62 years old.
