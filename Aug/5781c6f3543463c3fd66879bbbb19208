Vihiga County Sports Executive Patrick Saisi has advocated for a partnership between the county and Football Kenya Federation that will ensure Vihiga Queens make a successful sojourn in the newly established Caf Women's Champions League. Saisi, who is also the Vihiga Deputy Governor, said it will be difficult for the county to facilitate Queens with everything they want now that this is a brand new path that they are embarking on. The Women's Champions League was approved in June during a Caf Executive Committee meeting and is expected to kick off next year. “The county alone won’t be able to manage the team at that level and therefore we are trying to reach out to FKF to see how we can join hands helping our girls,” said Saisi. "Vihiga Queens have been doing well in the FKF Women's Premier League and with this tournament, I am sure our girls are going to make us even more proud at the continental front. I will do whatever it takes to ensure that they feature in the Champions League." Queens have been winning the national title since 2017. Meanwhile, the Vihiga County government has constituted eight members to serve on the sports board committee in order to streamline sporting activities in the county. The committee will be chaired by Albert Masiolo, principal of Senende High School. “We believe the county has the potential to produce the best talents in all sporting disciplines. We need to identify and nurture these talent and as well work towards improving our sports infrastructure," sais Saisi. “We have confidence that the board will deliver and I look forward to working with this great team in achieving our objectives.” Other members include Peter Emodia, Vincent Amwayi, Willy Asienwa, Daniel Ndafu, Claire Indire,  Ebby Sagala and Elizabeth Omuyoyi.
