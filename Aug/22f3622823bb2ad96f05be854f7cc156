The Gusii Council of Elders has launched a cultural centre at Ekerubo in Masaba South to revive and preserve the community's customs. Council chairman James Matundura said the community is facing adverse cultural effects that threaten its way of life. “Our culture is being eroded and that is why we are here to launch a cultural centre to revive it,” Matundura said on Sunday. He said the youth are most affected because they have adopted western cultures. “We are ready as elders to sensitise youths on moral and cultural values. They need to observe and appreciate our cultural diversities and embrace them,” he said. Speaking to the Star after the ceremony, Matundura disclosed that they will set up a worship chapel at the centre where residents will get spiritual nourishment. “The centre will store artefacts from the local community for use by researchers and learners,” he said. Learners, the chairman said, will be assisted to compare past and contemporary cultural aspects from the material culture. A former director of the Seventh Day Adventist Church pastor Jonathan Maangi said the establishment of the chapel will help demystify culture. Pastor Maangi urged people to stop dismissing traditional culture, noting that even Jesus Christ was born and brought up in Jewish culture. "Culture should be adopted purposely to instil morals in society especially among the youth who have totally been swallowed by the western culture,” Maangi said. Daniel Ondabu, a resident, observed that young couples will learn more from the centre on how elders solved marital disputes. Priscah Keiri raised concern over the emerging trend where youths married elderly women instead of young women of their age. Getembe Masongo asked the elders to ensure that young people are trained on the need to respect and obey their elders. Matundura urged the local community to take advantage of the centre to preserve the culture as an identity for posterity. Edited by Henry Makori
