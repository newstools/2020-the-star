Two people died on Friday when the car they were travelling in plunged into Gucha River in Nyamira county. Nyamira County Commissioner Amos Mariba said the driver of the private vehicle tried to maneuver a corner and ended up plunging in the river. The vehicle had three passengers and one man and woman succumbed, while the driver escaped unhurt. "We call upon drivers to be careful, especially when negotiating such corners along the river. This is among the many black spots that we have in the county, and the only way to save lives along this road is to drive within the required speed limits," said Mariba. The bodies were taken to Nyamira Referral Hospital.
