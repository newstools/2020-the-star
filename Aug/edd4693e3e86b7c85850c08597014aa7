ODM leader Raila Odinga's wife, Ida,  raised Sh176.9 million for the building of a 500-student capacity library at her alma mater - Ogande Girls High School in Homa Bay county. The project is estimated to cost at least Sh300 million. Ida held a fundraiser on Friday for the upcoming state-of-the-art library. She said the project will secure her legacy as a dedicated alumna as well as a lifetime teacher, career and life coach of the girl child. Several dignitaries attended the fundraiser, including Raila, Speaker of the Senate Kenneth Lusaka, Westlands MP Timothy Wanyonyi, Kisumu Deputy Governor Mathews Owili among others. Ida used the opportunity to extend her appreciation to those who took part in contribution. “I, therefore, wish to let everyone who was part of this to know that I deeply appreciate the support and I am deeply grateful from the bottom of my heart,” she said on Twitter on Monday. The school's graduates include Chief Registrar of the Judiciary Anne Amadi, Homa Bay Energy CEC Beatrice Ogolla, and chief principal of Bunyore Girls Mary Akunja. Corporate entities and international donors had also been invited to the virtual and physical fundraiser. MPs, professionals, and leaders from all walks of life have been incorporated in the event and the project. Ida presided over the project's website launch on August 13.
