 Police are pursuing two suspects who escaped after they were found ferrying guns on a motorbike along the Chemoling’ot- Marigat in Baringo road on Friday night. Baringo county police commander Robinson Ndiwa said six guns - three G3 and three AK47 rifles were recovered. “Six magazines and 169 rounds of ammunition were also recovered,” Ndiwa said on Saturday. He said officers from Nginyang police station in Tiaty were on patrol around 8pm when they got an alert from the locals that some people were ferrying guns. “They have briefed about two suspects riding suspiciously on a red motorcycle, registration number KMDX 467K.” He said officers ordered the suspects to stop but they instead abandoned the motorbike and escaped into nearby bushes. “On searching the bike, police found a sack tightly tied behind it containing the weapons,” Ndiwa said. He said all the guns are being kept by police as the suspects are pursued. “It is good also that we have detained the motorcycle so it would be easier to trace the owner,” the police boss said. He urged the public to help locate the suspects' hideouts. The area is home to suspected armed bandits who have been terrorising locals in cattle rustling attacks. Ndiwa said so far they have recovered 36 guns in the area since January. He said owing to the onset of the African amnesty month, they have put on hold the forceful disarmament which kicked off in parts of Tiaty in April. “We have given the illegal gun holders until September to surrender the weapons failing which we shall embark on the forceful disarmament exercise and seize all the illegal guns in the hands of civilians,” he said.
