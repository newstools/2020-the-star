Liverpool could turn their attention to Olympiakos left-back Kostas Tsimikas after their initial attempt to sign Norwich’s Jamal Lewis failed. The Reds had a £10m bid for 22-year-old Lewis, which included a substantial sell-on clause, rejected. It is understood they were prepared to go to £12m but the Canaries wanted significantly more. Liverpool, seeking cover for Scotland captain Andy Robertson, have also been monitoring Tsimikas, 24. The Greece international played for Olympiakos in a 1-0 defeat by Wolves in the second leg of their last-16 Europa League tie last week as his side went out 2-1 on aggregate. He also played for them in their six Champions League group games earlier on in the campaign as they finished third behind Bayern Munich and Tottenham. After Olympiakos dropped down into the Europa League, he put in an impressive performance as his side won 2-1 at Arsenal and knocked the Gunners out of the competition at the last-32 stage. Real Madrid left-back Sergio Reguilon, 23, was also an option looked at by Liverpool.
