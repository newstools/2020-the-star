Health CS Mutahi Kagwe officially opened the Infectious Disease Unit and Intensive Care Unit at the Kenyatta University Research and Referral Hospital on Wednesday. It has a 500-bed capacity. Non-executive chairperson Olive Mugenda said the institution has planned for 60 ICU and HDU beds. "Currently, 30 of them are ready. The remaining 30 will be ready in two weeks. Out of the 24 ICU beds we have here, 15 are occupied. The other close to 440 isolation beds will be ready in a month," she said. "The increase in bed capacity, new HDU and ICU at KURRH comes in handy to tackle the virus infection especially in Nairobi being the epicenter of Covid-19 accounting for 60 percent of positive cases across the country," Health CS Mutahi Kagwe said.
