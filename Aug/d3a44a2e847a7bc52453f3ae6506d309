Barcelona said on Tuesday they sacked sporting director Eric Abidal, a day after dispensing with coach Quique Setien in response to exiting the Champions League last week with a 8-2 drubbing by Bayern Munich. Abidal, a former Barca defender and two-times Champions League winner with the club, had been in the role for over two years.
