This yearâ€™s Diamond League athletics meeting in Doha, initially scheduled for October 9, has been brought forward by a fortnight and will take place on September 25, organisers announced on Monday. The event in Doha, which serves as the traditional season opener, had previously been pushed back from its April 17 slot due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The fifth meeting of the season was scheduled for October after it could not be held as the traditional season opener in April, but will now take place instead on September 25. The plan is to stage 12 disciplines. A list of athletes who will compete in the Qatari capital will be announced in due course. Due to the ongoing global health situation and ever-changing COVID-19 regulations, the 2020 Wanda Diamond League calendar remains provisional and subject to further changes. Following exhibition events in Oslo and Zurich earlier this summer, the competitive season is set to begin in Monaco on August 14. The 2020 Wanda Diamond League will not be a structured series of events leading to a final as is usually the case. Athletes will therefore not earn Diamond League points this season, and there will not be a single, 24-discipline final in Zurich as originally planned. A total of six meetings, including a street event, are currently scheduled to go ahead between August 14th and September 25th.
