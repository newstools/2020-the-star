Marking World Breastfeeding Week, Aman said most newborns do not develop severe or critical illness if infected with coronavirus. He said most infants if infected are asymptomatic or show mild disease and recover rapidly. He said breast milk is the best source of immunity for infants and it is essentially important for infected babies. "Transmission of this virus via breast milk is highly unlikely. Research has shown that the benefits of breast milk substantially outweigh the potential risks for Covid-19 transmission," he said.
