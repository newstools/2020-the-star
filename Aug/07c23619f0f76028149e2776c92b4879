Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko and NMS Director General Mohammed Badi have called on health workers to pursue dialogue in their quest for improved payments rather than going on strike. The two, who have agreed to work together in order to solve grievances raised by health workers, said that the concerns being raised are already under consideration for an immediate solution and that there is no need for a strike. They have called on all health workers planning to strike to continue working as deliberations on their grievances are still being handled. On Friday, the two said that they are going to work together on how best to settle the issues raised by the health workers. Speaking after an event where President Uhuru Kenyatta issued title deeds to Embakasi and Tassia residents, Badi said he is working with the county government to ensure all the key grievances of health workers are met. “We are working with the county government to avert the ongoing strike and we will initiate talks with the union of doctors and nurses officials to ensure the payroll system has been met and salaries timely paid," Badi said. He further said all the public hospitals have been equipped with PPE kits in management of the Covid-19 pandemic. "Health care workers are the heartbeat of this response and so we are in negotiations and discussions with them to evaluate their concerns to be able to come to a middle ground where we can actually move forward,” he noted. Sonko concurred with Badi’s sentiments and agreed to work together to combat the strike. “I want to condemn the negative union officials inciting the health workers to bring it to an end as we are all aware the workers are being pushed to strike bringing Nairobi and the Nation at a medical crisis,” he said. The Kenya Medical Practitioners Pharmacists and Dentists (KMPDU) had earlier on Friday met with Badi.
