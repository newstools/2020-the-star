The weatherman has warned that the rains currently being experienced across the country will continue for the next seven days. In a forecast released on Monday, the Kenya Meteorological Department said the country will receive the rains from August 25 to 31. The Highlands West of the Rift Valley, the Lake Victoria Basin, the Central and South Rift Valley and the Northwest are expected to continue receiving rainfall. The Highlands East of the Rift Valley (including Nairobi County) and some parts of the Southeast Lowlands and the Central and South Rift Valley are likely to experience occasional cool and cloudy conditions. Last week, Met said that more people may be displaced by rising lake waters along the Great Rift Valley. At least 30,000 have already been driven out of their homes by severe flooding near Lake Baringo, caused by unusually heavy rains that began this month. Met director Stella Aura says the rains have been increasing since August 3 and there is a strong possibility the same pattern will persist this week, especially in the Rift Valley. Aura said the weather station at the Kabarnet DC’s office in Baringo county recorded the highest seven-day total rainfall in Kenya last week. The 10 wettest stations in Kenya were all in the Rift Valley. Early in the month, Met said rainfall will likely continue over several parts of the country. In a forecast, the Kenya Meteorological Department noted that the rains will continue particularly within the Highlands West of the Rift Valley, the Lake Victoria Basin, the Central and South Rift Valley and the Northwest. A few areas in the Highlands East of the Rift Valley, the Northeast and the Coastal Strip may also receive occasional rains.
