Keroche Breweries CEO Tabitha Karanja has paid a glowing tribute to her late daughter Tecra 100 days since her untimely death. Sharing a photo with a young Tecra, Tabitha said her daughter's death left her broken-hearted, without an idea of how to move forward. "What has changed is my eyes have been opened to more truths," she wrote in part. Tecra died in an accident in May after falling down a staircase in a cottage in Lamu, where she was staying with her boyfriend, Lali. Tabitha said she misses Tecra, describing her as her counsel and company. "Iâ€™ve heard from friends in 20 countries whose lives Tecra touched and inspired. Her life proves what differentiates people is opportunity," she said. According to a postmortem report, Tecra had injuries on the left side of her head. She suffered cerebral oedema.
