More than 500 vulnerable schoolgirls in Kasipul, Homa Bay county, have benefited from a sanitary towel donation. True Vine International in collaboration with the US-based Compassionate Health Initiative made the donations. Programme director Winter Ogacho, True Vine International, said the girls aged between nine and 16 benefited. They were from Aolo Primary. During the donations at the Canaan SDA church, 300 widows also benefited from food and supplies donations to cushion them from the effects of Covid-19. Ajo Mbuta of Royal Media Services also donated sugar and bar soap to the widows. Donations included maize flour, bar soaps, and sugar among others. The organisations educated the girls to focus on studies and avoid early pregnancies. Ogacho advised the girls to keep safe from men who are out to take advantage of them. “You must remain steadfast in your studies. Education is the best tool to make your future more bright,” she said. The programme director warned girls to be wary of men who lure them with money to engage in sexual activities. Ogacho added, “Keep away from bodaboda riders and those who entice young girls.” She noted the increase of teen pregnancies and urged the government to take stern action against men preying on schoolgirls. “Those responsible for early pregnancies should be in prison. We should not allow them to be in our midst,” Ogacho added. Ajo also championed the protection of girls by tackling the cause of teen pregnancies. “These young girls are the leaders of tomorrow. They should be safeguarded and well educated,” he said. The girls were also asked to observe health directives such as wearing masks.
