More than 8,000 new students of the university of Nairobi are expected to start online classes on August 31 this year. They will join the more than 70,000 students at the university. “All students, including the freshers, will start the 2020-21 academic year online,” UoN vice chancellor Kiama Gitahi said on Friday. He was addressing the institution's staff virtually. All students will be trained on how to use online platforms for their studies, how to access library resources and other online services. “The orientation will be for all undergraduate and postgraduate students,” Kiama said. For those set to graduate, the VC said, the ceremony will be held on September 25, 2020, at the Great Court. He further said that the university will not hold the innovation week this year due to the pandemic. “However, I'm glad to inform you that it is now scheduled to take place on March 8-12, 2021,” he said. The university will also hold the Annual Research Week 2020  on October 12-16, 2020. Edited by A.N
