Nurses in Mandera county will go on strike on Wednesday to demand promotions and better working conditions. Kenya National Union of Nurses (KNUN) Mandera chapter chairman Abdirahman Haji said on Tuesday that the Governor Ali Roba-led administration has for years been giving the 450 nurses empty promises. He said for seven years now, there have been no promotions for nurses in the county except for those who were seconded to the devolved unit by the national government in 2013. “We issued a strike notice on July 10 and it will end on Wednesday when we shall all go on strike,” he said. Haji said that in 2013, nurses inherited from the national government were promoted and in 2015 when KNUN issued a strike notice, Governor Roba averted it by promising to promote all union members in Mandera. “In 2017 we went on strike again but as always, Roba used the same trick and the nurses went back to work. Surely for how long will our members be treated like this. It is only fair that they are considered for promotion. We're now saying enough is enough!” he said. Health executive Mohamed Eda defended the county government, saying promotions for nurses have been factored in the 2020-21 county budget, which is yet to be passed by the assembly. “It should be noted that we have already factored in their promotions in this year’s budget. Unfortunately the standoff that continues to be witnessed in the Senate has in one way or another affected us since that means the entire process has been stopped,” he said. Edited by A.N
