Deputy governors across the country are oppressed by their bosses and denied chances to serve residents as anticipated, Embu Deputy Governor David Kariuki has claimed. He said reports of how deputy governors are frustrated, including himself, are true. “When you read the paper, watch TV or listen to the radio about how deputy governors are oppressed you should know that I am in the same situation,” Kariuki said in Manyatta. He said he has decided to open up about the issue so that people do not wonder why things go wrong. Kariuki was accompanied by MPs John Muchiri and Cecily Mbarire. Muchiri had said that some politicians from the area were aspiring to be deputy governors in the next general election, yet it is a powerless office. “Even Kariuki can tell you how powerless the office of the deputy governor is,” Muchiri said. But Kariuki said he is optimistic that one day the oppression will come to an end. The functions of the deputy governor are provided under Section 32 of the County Government Act. The section states that the deputy governor should deputise the governor in executing the governor’s functions. The governor may assign the deputy governor any other responsibility or portfolio as a county executive. Article 179(5) of the Constitution says that when the governor is absent, the deputy governor should act as the governor. However, when acting in office, the deputy governor should not exercise certain powers of the governor. He or she cannot nominate, appoint or dismiss anyone. The governor should also not delegate to the deputy governor any of the functions that relate to hiring and firing. Nevertheless, deputy governors continuously want Parliament to define their roles strictly in law. Edited by A.N
