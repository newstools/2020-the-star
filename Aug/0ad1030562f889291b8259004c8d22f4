Football Kenya Federation presidential aspirant Tom Alila is set to meet Western and Nyanza delegates this weekend as he seeks to solidify support ahead of the polls. Alila, who announced his candidature early last month, revealed that the meeting will seek to sensitise sub county-based clubs on registering and doing business the legal way. Last year, Football Kenya Federation (FKF) was taken to court by some of  their  sub-branches over the Electoral Code which locked them out of the polls. The exercise, which still remains uncertain due to the Covid-19, is set to start from the county level “Sub counties were not allowed to vote since they are not registered. It means they stand not to gain in case there are goodies to be shared too. I am meeting delegates to sensitise them on the importance of registering and being licensed to operate as well as sell my manifesto to them,” he said. Alila served as NEC member for one term in Nyanza from 2013 during Sam Nyamweya's era. He says he will be gunning for the top seat in a bid to inject changes and bring solution to the perennial problems bedevilling the game. “I am not interested in name-calling or blame game in my campaigns. All I want is to share my manifesto with the delegates and convince them that I am the right man for the job. Everyone is talking of grass roots and women's football as well as sponsorship but none is coming out to show how it will be done. I have the goodwill from sponsors and stakeholders who will help in face-lifting sporting venues and bringing more sponsors to the game,” he said Alila will battle it out against the incumbent Nick Mwendwa,former federation's deputy CEO Herbert Mwachiro, retired Kenyan international Sammy Sholei, former Cecafa Secretary general, Nicholas Musonye, Steven Mburu, Moses Akaranga, Alex Ole Magelo, Harun Shivachi, Cosmus Nabongolo and Nyamweya.
