Wazito have continued to beef up their squad ahead of the new season with the acquisition of former AFC Leopards defensive midfielder Jackson 'Pogba' Juma. The towering midfielder is the seventh player to be unveiled by the high-spending club after Kevin Kimani, Kevin Okumu, Vincent Oburu, Edwin Omondi, Boniface Omondi and Mark Otieno. "We can confirm that Jackson ‘Pogba’ Juma has joined the club. An alumnus of Kisumu Day High School, Pogba has previously turned out for AFC Leopards. He is a defensive midfielder by trade," said the club on its official social media pages. Moments after his unveiling at the club offices at Mombasa Road, Juma could not hide his joy, terming the club as organised and a dream team to many players. “I am happy to be here. Wazito is a good team and every player wants to come here. The team is well organised. To the fans I want to promise them that we will do a good job,” he stated. Wazito head coach Fred Ambani said of the hard-tackling midfielder; “Juma is a young player with potential. He is a good tackler and I hope that he continues to work hard in order to realize his full potential.”
