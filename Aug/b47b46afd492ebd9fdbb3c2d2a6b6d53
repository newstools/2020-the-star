Frankie Kiarie and Corazon Kwamboka welcomed a baby boy, Taiyari Kiarie, on Monday last week and kept the good news to themselves for a week. Speaking on his YouTube channel yesterday, Frankie described Kwamboka as a tough woman, adding that her high blood pressure was a risk for their baby. “Saturday night we had one of the most exhausting nights because she was having contractions throughout the whole night,” he said. “The whole of Sunday, the baby didn’t kick and never moved – he wasn’t active, and I didn’t want to panic but Corazon was panicking because it was her first pregnancy: "We went to hospital for a check-up that evening and the baby was fine but her blood pressure was high. It is not a good thing especially for pregnant ladies.” Corazon wanted to have a natural birth but underwent a C-section.
