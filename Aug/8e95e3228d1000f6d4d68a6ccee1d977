The issue of allegedly using fake papers to secure employment continued to stalk Kitui Trade executive Philip Mumo after he was on Thursday arrested by EACC sleuths over the offence. Hardly two months ago, Mumo lost a court case in which he sought to overturn his impeachment by the county assembly on account that he was hired by Governor Charity Ngilu’s administration on a phoney university degree certificate. On Thursday morning, EACC detectives pounced on Mumo before he left for work and whisked him to the Kitui police station where he was held as the process to charge him for forgery was being finalised. Kitui Central subcounty DCI boss Singi Nzioka confirmed that Mumo was arrested for faking academic degree documents.  He, however, was quick to mention that EACC had the full details of the supposed offence. In December last year, Mumo was impeached on grounds he used fake MKU degree certificates acquired from River Road to secure the job. After being impeached, Mumo moved to court to challenge the decision but lost at the High Court in July. However, he remained in office since Ngilu had declined to formally relieve him of his duties. State prosecutor Bonny Okemwa said on Thursday that his office had received from EACC the files on Mumo’s arrest and prosecutors were studying it before recommending charging. “If we fail to finish with the file today, he will be arraigned on Friday morning."
