A legislator has asked police to arrest suspects who killed a 25-year-old man who was pursuing their cows that were stolen last Friday from Karera village in Limuru constituency. Limuru MP Peter Mwathi urged youths from the area to remain as police investigate the death of Charles Karanja and follow up the 80 cows that were stolen. He spoke in Ndeiya ward where Karanja will be buried on Thursday at his parents’ home in Karera village. “We ask the police to speed up investigations and ensure his killers are punished by law. We appreciate the efforts of the police to follow up the lost cows since they have also recovered some sheep which had been stolen earlier,” Mwathi said. Kiambu police boss Ali Nuno said they recovered 20 cows out of the 80 that were stolen last Friday. The police commander revealed that they also recovered 11 sheep which had been stolen earlier. “We have engaged elders from Kajiado who have helped us together with some locals to search for the stolen livestock,” Nuno said. Mwathi said within six months over 120 cows, 600 goats and sheep and 60 donkeys were stolen from Ndeiya. “People used to report these cases but when they realised that the police did not take much interest, they stopped reporting,” he said. The MP said last Friday’s theft was daring since over 30 youths invaded Karera village. “Our young people were so angry about it. They reported to the police and on top of that they followed the animals and that was the time these cattle rustlers waylaid and attacked them killing Karanja,” he said. Edited by R.Wamochie
