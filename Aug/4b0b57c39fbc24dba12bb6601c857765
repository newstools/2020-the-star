Breastfeeding mothers should wear a mask while breastfeeding their babies, Health CAS Rashid Aman has advised. He made the statement during the daily briefing on the Covid-19 as the country celebrates World Breastfeeding Week. "Breastfeeding is the most environment friendly way to feed our babies. Breast milk is a natural food. Nursing mothers require a conducive environment for breastfeeding. As the world fights the Covid-19 pandemic, Aman stated that it is unlikely that transmission of coronavirus occurs prenatally or via breast milk. "Severe Covid-19 disease among infants appears to be very rare. To mothers who are Covid-19 positive, wash your hands before touching baby and wear a mask during breastfeeding," Aman said.
