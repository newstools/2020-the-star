Motorists have been advised to be cautious during a 2-3 week partial closure of the Thika superhighway for maintenance. Some lanes will be temporarily closed, according to the Kenya National Highways Authority (Kenha) which, on Monday, urged motorists to comply with traffic management plans and follow the directions of traffic marshals. Kenha identified the Nairobi–Ruiru and Ruiru–Thika sections as the ones to be affected. "These works may result in the temporary closure of some lanes during the day,” the parastatal said in a public notice. Kenha director of communications Charles Njogu told the Star they are resurfacing some lanes. "We are working on some lanes along the highway and we want to notify motorists to avoid inconveniences. The highway has many lanes and it’s only a few that are being worked on, thus giving motorists the alternative of using the other lanes,” he explained. Njogu expects the road works to last between two and three weeks. Kenha has since July been adjusting some sections of the superhighway. Two weeks ago, the agency partially closed a section of the highway around Garden City Mall for the erection of a steel deck. Motorists were using Exit 8 at Kasarani through Baba Dogo road and rejoining the highway via Outering road. This resulted in heavy traffic, with motorists stuck in jams for more than two hours. The partial closure lasted until August 25 by which time a footbridge was  erected. Kenha director general Peter Mundinia said the delay was caused by unforeseen challenges in transporting and hoisting delicate girders. "This particular bridge was a bit more delicate because it’s a girder bridge. Transportation and hoisting, therefore, took longer than anticipated,” he explained. The authority had announced a similar partial closure of the road at Drive Inn. Works have also been ongoing near the Kenya School of Monetary Studies, where a footbridge is being set up.
