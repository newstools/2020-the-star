A sacked senior state counsel has lost his bid to be reinstated after the High Court dismissed his petition, saying there was nothing to show that his rights were violated. Employment and Labour Relations Court Judge Nzioki wa Makau dismissed the petition by James Makura. “In the final analysis, I find that the preliminary objection succeeds and the petition is hereby struck out with no orders as to cost,” ruled Makau. The former prosecutor had served at the then DPP’s office. It was his case that he was employed by the Solicitor General on December 15, 2003. But on June 23, 2011 he was suspended until a criminal case he was facing was heard and determined. Makura had been charged with soliciting and receiving a bribe of Sh25,000 from Peter Chania Magere. He allegedly committed the offence on June 20, 2011 for Magere’s case to be taken to court. He was later dismissed, although the court acquitted him of bribery charges. The ex-state counsel sued the DPP for failing to lift the interdiction, claiming that his right to fair administrative action and fair labour practices was violated. He claimed he was dismissed contrary to the law since his salary was stopped contrary to Section 62(3) of the Anti-Corruption and Economic Crimes Act, which entitled him to automatic reinstatement after acquittal. Justice Makau dismissed the petition, saying Makura did not particularise and articulate in the petition the right said to have been infringed or every allegation of constitutional breach. The court heard that on March 18 this year, an advisory board in the office of the DPP recommended Makura’s dismissal on account of gross misconduct. DPP told the court that on May 22, 2019, Makura was asked to show cause why disciplinary action should not be taken against him and he responded on June 3, 2019. His response was placed before the advisory board and he was accorded a fair hearing before the decision to dismiss him from the prosecution office was reached. Edited by Henry Makori
