Senior Counsel Ahmednasir Abdullahi has sued communications consultant Njeri Thorne for associating him with terrorism. Through lawyer Ombati Omwanza, Abdullahi told Justice Msagha Mbogholi that Thorne’s tweets published last month have been widely circulated online and have occasioned him immense harm and loss. Thorne’s twitter account has over 21,000 followers. The injurious tweets, according to Abdullahi, associates him with a wide array of criminality among them, terrorism, money-laundering, corruption and piracy. Justice Msagha certified the case as urgent and barred Thorne from posting and circulating more posts about Abdullahi, pending the hearing of the case on August 25. “Based on the material presented, there are compelling reasons to grant interim orders,” the Judge said. The orders were issued ex parte. The court further heard that Thorne’s words were calculated to disparage Abdullahi’s profession as an advocate, Senior Counsel and in his said business. “She published and circulated the offending tweets on her personal twitter account knowing the same to be false and, therefore, with the sole object of discrediting, embarrassing and lowering my dignity in my capacity as a respected member of the society and Advocate of the High Court of Kenya,” Abdullahi said. He said he has no involvement whatsoever in crime, piracy, money laundering or any criminal activity, nor has he ever been investigated for, charged or convicted of any offence in that regard. “The tweets could not have been made by a fair person, no matter how prejudiced, however exaggerated and obstinate they are, but for malice,” he said.
