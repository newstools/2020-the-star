President Uhuru Kenyatta has asked government agencies to expedite investigations into alleged theft of funds at Kemsa. "Given the public interest the relevant agencies should expedite investigations and conclude the same within 21 days," he said. "All persons found to be culpable from the ongoing investigations on Covid funds should be brought to book notwithstanding their social status or political affiliations." Speaking during an address on Wednesday, Uhuru further formed a committee to review the efficacy of the country's response to the pandemic. "They should record lessons learnt. The group should formulate strategies to identify loop holes in our health facilities and recommend ways to improve," he said. Uhuru said the  National reference group should position health care  as a driver of the manufacturing sector. "They should expand ongoing work and establish the Kenya Covid vaccine consortium so that research centres can partner with those internationally and sharpen their focus on testing and developing vaccines locally," he said. Uhuru said there are no unbearable responsibilities in the phase of pandemics. He said some strides have been made when tackling the pandemic. "We must acknowledge that this news is not a licence to backslide from our path of responsibility," he said. "Responsibility is not a burden but a civic duty. It is something you seek as a task. It is a habit that you pay to your fellow citizens," he said. He added that although Kenya has tried flattening the curve, there are challenges. "The infection is shifting to counties and rural areas. Expansion of the health sector has expanded to the counties. But more needs to be done," he said. More to follow...
