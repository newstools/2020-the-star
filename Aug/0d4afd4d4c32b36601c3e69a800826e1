NTV presenter Grace Ekirapa says her father thought she was in a cult because of how much she loved to go to church. Speaking in an interview with Switch TV's Chat Spot, Grace said she found comfort in the church. "Oh, my dad said I was in a cult. Daddy, I’m sorry, but you said it. Because I used to go to church all the time, he thought I was doing other things," she said. Grace, who hosts Crossover, a gospel show, said her mother was Muslim, but later on, she got born again. "She was baptised before she died, and after that, we started going to church. I used to fall asleep at the pulpit because I knew Jesus lived in the church, I think I was around 12 or 13. I just really loved that environment,” she said.
