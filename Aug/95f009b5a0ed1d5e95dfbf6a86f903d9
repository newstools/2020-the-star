The crime rate at the Coast has reduced in the last three weeks, thanks to the Kazi Mtaani initiative, regional coordinator John Elungata has said. At least 30,000 young people in the region have been recruited. Elungata said theft, muggings, burglary and robberies that were rampant in Lamu, Kisauni, Likoni and other places of Mombasa had declined in the period the youth have been engaged in the initiative. The programme has also lowered the chances of radicalisation as many young people are now using the wages from the initiative to take care of themselves and their families, he said. “The programme has also succeeded in discouraging young people, particularly in Lamu and Mombasa, from using drugs, alcohol and engaging in any other immoral behaviour,” Elungata said Elungata spoke in Bargoni, Lamu West, when he inspected the Kazi Mtaani drive. A report from the office of the Coast regional coordinator shows 34,666 youths have been recruited. Of the number, Mombasa has the highest tally at 15,777, Kilifi is second with 6,581, Kwale (3,561), Taita Taveta (3,192), Tana River (2,988), while Lamu has 2,567. National Police Service Commission chairman Eliud Kinuthia expressed confidence that the skills and cash gained from the initiative will help the youth to set up their own businesses. “Apart from being employed and earning a salary, the youth are also being trained to be self-sufficient,” he said. Lamu West MP Stanley Muthama urged the youth to make good use of the opportunities that come their way to build their futures. Edited by A.N
