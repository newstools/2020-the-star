There was anxiety at the Naivasha law courts after a suspect developed a fever minutes before he was arraigned. The suspect had been transported from Gilgil in the company of other suspects and police officers. Security officers and court orderlies fled for safety for fear he might have contracted coronavirus. Officers from the Public Health department were called in. A junior officer in the court said they noticed all was not well after the suspect recorded a temperature of 41.4 degrees Celsius. “All the suspects and visitors seeking services in the courts must have their temperature checked and this is how we noticed the anomaly,” he said. The officer said the suspect and all those who had accompanied him were held in a separate room. Naivasha subcounty public health officer George Ndichu said they were not taking chances and praised the court officials for acting fast. “The patient has been taken to isolation and we are monitoring the others who came into contact with him on his way from Gilgil,” he said. Meanwhile, all the truck drivers who had been held at the isolation ward in Naivasha Subcounty Hospital have been discharged. The 11 drivers, who did not exhibit any Covid-19 symptoms, were allowed to go home in line with the government directives. Health executive Kariuki Gichuki said, “We have released all the truck drivers and we are concerned by delays from the laboratories conducting the tests.” Edited by A.N
