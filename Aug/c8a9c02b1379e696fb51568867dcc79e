The Correctional Services department on Thursday launched an art competition with a difference titled ‘Probation: A New Beginning’ at Villa Rosa Kempinski. The art competition is open to children who are on probation, supervised by the Probation and Aftercare Service (PACS). The competition is a joint initiative of PACS, the European Union and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. It will culminate with an exhibition later this year.
