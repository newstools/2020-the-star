The acutely ill Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny has arrived in Germany from Siberia for treatment. He fell into a coma after drinking what his supporters suspect was poisoned tea; they accuse the authorities of trying to conceal a crime. Doctors treating him in Omsk had insisted on Friday that he was too ill to be moved. But they later said his condition was stable enough for the flight. His wife Yulia is travelling with him. On Saturday morning, Mr Navalny's medical evacuation flight - paid for by the German NGO Cinema for Peace - landed at Tegel airport in Berlin. He will be taken to the Charit√© hospital for treatment. His spokeswoman, Kira Yarmysh, earlier tweeted: "Massive thanks to everyone for their support. The struggle for Alexei's life and health is just beginning." Ms Yarmysh said it was a pity that doctors had taken so long to approve his flight as the plane and the right documents had been ready since Friday morning. Navalny fell ill during a flight from Tomsk to Moscow on Thursday, and his plane made an emergency landing in Omsk. A photograph on social media appeared to show him drinking from a cup at a Tomsk airport cafe before the flight. His team suspects a poisonous substance was put in his tea. Disturbing video appeared to show a stricken Mr Navalny howling in agony on the flight. Passenger Pavel Lebedev said he heard the activist "screaming in pain".
