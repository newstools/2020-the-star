Health workers at Lamu's King Fahad Hospital Wednesday called off their strike after discussions with Governor Fahim Twaha. Twaha promised to look into their grievances and emphasised how essential they are to fighting the Covid-19 pandemic. "This is a time that patients need your services and nothing else. As you've seen, the county is doing all it can to ensure your concerns are fully addressed," he said. On Monday, services at the hospital were halted after the workers began the strike to protest poor working conditions which predispose them to Covid-19. They demanded personal protective equipment, a fully equipped quarantine facility and training on how to handle Covid-19 patients. The health workers also wanted a separate Covid-19 laboratory away from the main one. When Twaha met the medics and their union heads, he said most of their grievances had either been resolved or were being acted upon. The governor urged for calm. On Monday, the county procured Sh3.9 million PPE and other equipment in its effort to boost the war on coronavirus. The governor criticised some politicians for rushing to social media to say that the county was doing little to improve the health sector and combat Covid-19. He appealed to the medics not to allow politics into their affairs. "I assure all of you that we're working with speed to ensure your welfare is addressed. I would also like to encourage you, that my office is open for structured, non-partisan dialogue for your betterment and for the mwananchi." Union of Kenya Civil Servants Lamu secretary Haji Shibu lauded the governor for intervening to end the strike. Edited by R.Wamochie
