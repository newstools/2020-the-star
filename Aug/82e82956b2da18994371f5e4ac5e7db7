The government should reduce the retirement age from the current 60 years to 55 to create jobs for the the youth, an activist has said. Gusii Governance Watch Civil Society Organisation secretary Rachel Otundo said more fresh graduates will be employed if the retirement age was reduced. At the same time, she urged the government to revamp local industries and initiate new ones to create jobs and cushion youths against the impacts of the Covid-19. “Because of unemployment, some youths are engaging in serious crimes while others are wasting time in rural and urban areas because they have nowhere to earn a living from,” Otundo said. She praised the government's programme for cash transfers to persons aged 65 and above. Otundo also commended the government for the Kazi Mtaani programme and urged it to extend the period and recruit more youths. Meanwhile, Rigena Human Rights Civil Organisation chairman Thomson Osoro has urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to reject a bill granting former MPs hefty lifetime pension. Instead, Osoro appealed to the government to channel the funds to poor, aged persons and people with disabilities to improve their lives. “Covid-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the lives of millions of Kenyans. The funds should be used to cushion them against the adverse effects of the disease,” Osoro said in Kisii. He said the number of poor Kenyans and those with disabilities is increasing gradually and they need support. Paying the former MPs Sh100,000 per month will be a bigger burden to the taxpayers, he said.
