Ford Kenya party members allied to Senator Moses Wetang'ula want EACC and DCI to probe how Bungoma Governor Wycliffe Wangamati spent Sh300 million allocated to the county to fight Covid-19. Addressing journalists at the Ford Kenya party headquarters at H Young area, they said they are yet to see anything tangible the county government has done as far as fighting the pandemic is concerned. The cash was given by the national government and the World Health Organization, they said. Wafula Wakoli from Musikoma asked Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission chairman Eliud Wabukala to initiate investigations into how the funds have been spent. "We have over Sh300 million that have been brought here yet we do not have a single ICU bed, we don't have sanitiser and masks across the county despite being a frontier region that is prone to infections," he said. He accused Wangamati of engaging in Ford Kenya party leadership wrangles and politics at the expense of residents. "We have seen the county boss moving up and down doing nothing with the likes of old retired leaders who have hidden inside the BBI and handshake politics yet we need him to tell us how prepared we are as a county to fight the coronavirus pandemic," Wakoli said. He claimed police officers attached to the Webuye isolation centre have not been paid their dues for over five months despite numerous complaints. "Wangamati won the Bungoma governor seat after we Ford Kenya party members supported and campaigned for him vigorously. He cannot turn around and ridicule us with funny scandals like the Sh10,000 jerrycans saga," he said. He said the governor's days were numbered because he had created many enemies out of people who supported his election in 2017. "Residents can't wait to send him home for failing to live up to his campaign promises."  Edited by P.O
