Mandera county commissioner Onesmus Kyatha on Wednesday warned warring Garre and Murule communities to stop their feuds or they'll be vulnerable to al Shabaab attacks. Kyatha said suspected al Shabaab militia — about 50 of whom have been sighted in the area — had taken advantage of the fighting to advance into the county. The official said at a peace meeting in Yedho that if the communities cannot stop the fighting over contested lands, they would be evicted from the disputed area.  He warned of stern action against local armed militia used to cause mayhem. The joint peace meeting with the communities in Yedho was attended by area MPs, religious leaders, elders, security officials and Governor Ali Roba. "It is easy to start a fight but difficult to end it," Roba said. Recent fighting over a boundary row between Lafet and Mandera South caused the torching of houses and destruction of property. Two people have been arrested in connection with the skirmishes. "I have seen many killings of women, men, children and youth. However we managed to bring sanity and calm has been there for some time now," Roba said. The governor said local leaders should ensure the bad blood ends and no one is killed. The peace meeting continues Wednesday before a pact between the two communities is finalised.
