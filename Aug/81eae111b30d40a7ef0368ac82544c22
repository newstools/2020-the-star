A Kiambu MP has asked the government to compensate the family of a man who was killed by cattle rustlers in Ndeiya ward, Limuru subcounty, on Friday. Charles Karanja was killed when he and a group of youths were pursuing over 80 cows stolen from Karera village by raiders suspected to be from neighbouring Kajiado county. Ndeiya MCA Gideon Gachara said when the youths were about to enter Kajiado, the rustlers ambushed them. They caught Karanja and beat him until he died. Limuru MP Peter Mwathi asked Interior CS Fred Matiang’i to compensate the family and facilitate the burial of Karanja. He said security officials in Ndeiya have neglected villages like Karera, Kiawanda and Boma, where youths suspected to be from Kajiado county invade and steal livestock. The legislator said it was sad that Karanja was killed yet Ndeiya residents have been calling upon the government to protect them from cattle thieves. “We have been asking the government to beef up security at the boundary of Kiambu and Kajiado since our neighbours keep stealing from us,” Mwathi said on Saturday at Kiawada trading centre. The MP, who is the chairman of the Labour Relations Committee in Parliament, said Karanja’s death was a result of insecurity and his family should be compensated. He said within six months over 120 cows, 600 goats and sheep and 60 donkeys have been stolen. “We are so angry about the incident. We want justice for our son and we want security so as to ensure the safety of our animals” the MCA said. The legislator threatened to take the list of all people whose animals have been stolen by herders to Parliament to demand compensation. “We need security, if not so, we have a list of all people whose animals have been stolen at different times. I can comfortably take it to Parliament and push for their compensation. The state must come in and protect us” Mwathi said. He asked Matiang’i to build an anti-stock theft police station in the area. Edited by Henry Makori
