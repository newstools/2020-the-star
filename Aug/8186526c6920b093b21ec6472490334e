ANC lawmaker Omboko Milemba has said MPs should respect the Constitution and not seek an extension of their current term as has been reported. The Emuhaya MP said there was no need to extend the life of the current Parliament by one year. He spoke at Water Point resort Emalindi in Emuhaya subcounty when he met youths from his constituency. Milemba said extension of Parliament will have no value for Kenyans but will only benefit MPs. The five-year term the MPs got upon election was enough to implement their manifestos, he said. “For those who will not have what they want, they have a right to go back to Kenyans within their respective constituencies to ask for another term to deliver their manifesto,” Omboko said. Milemba said Kenya is a democratic society where all are free to seek any elective seat. He urged youths to form a strong network that will help them benefit from government programmes. He told the youth not to wait for white-collar jobs but become innovative and create employment. They should join technical institutions to get appropriate skills, he said. “The government has pumped in money to ensure our youths are equipped with practical skills for life,” Milemba said.
