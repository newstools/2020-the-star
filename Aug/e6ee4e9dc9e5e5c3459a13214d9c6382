Ugandan President Yoweri Kaguta Museveni has asked Ugandans to strictly adhere to the Covid-19 measures to avoid further spread of the virus. Leading by example while on his way to Jinja, Museveni refused to address a group of people along the road who were waiting for him. Instead of addressing them, the president asked them to go home and follow the guidelines given to curb the spread of the virus. “We can avoid this disease if we follow the guidelines that have been communicated time and again,” Museveni said. He has asked Ugandan leaders, especially the politicians to give the people the correct message, including social distancing, wearing masks which cover the mouth and nose, washing hands and desist from encouraging people to gather and form crowds. Museveni also toured Nyanza Textile Industries in Jinja, where proprietors are producing Personal Protective gear for medical personnel; hazmat suits, disposable caps, disposable gowns, disposable shoe covers, and surgical masks. President Uhuru Kenyatta was on Wednesday criticised for adressing a crowd which did not observe social distancing when he launched the construction of Level 3 hospitals in Nairobi’s slums. Uhuru stopped at various points to address hundreds of people who had gathered to hear from him, with some without face masks. Ina widely shared photos on social media, social distancing which has been part of key messages from the health ministry was not followed. Kenyans criticized the president for failing to lead by example even as the virus continues to bite the nation in its fifth month.
