Rapper Khaligraph Jones is pleading with President Uhuru Kenyatta to reopen clubs and restaurants so artistes can start earning. Tagging the President's official Instagram page in his plea, Khaligraph said youths are suffering from depression. Uhuru announced all bars would be closed indefinitely to curb the spread of Covid-19. The President also banned the sale of alcohol in restaurants and eateries for 30 days. According to Khaligraph, this has heavily impacted artistes' income, given most rely on performances to survive. "Kindly on behalf of the creative industry of Kenya, we are requesting you allow us to get back to work, allow for the reopening of clubs and restaurants, measures and precautions shall be taken to ensure Covid-19 doesn't spread further," he wrote. "The youth are suffering from depression in silence. Kindly look into this matter. Also, some of our hits songs are going to waste. People want to see @femi_one and @mejjagenge perform 'Utawezana'." He then shared a photo of Raila Jr, urging him to talk to his father Raila Odinga. "@railajunior1 Gathee ebu bonga na mzae wako Mr Agwambo Raila Amolo Odinga. Mwambie aongee na Uhuru Kenyatta watufungulie country turudi kazi, rada chafu sana, watu wanaumia," he wrote. In April, Uhuru directed the Sports and Culture ministry to set aside Sh100 million to cushion artistes from the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. In May, artistes were asked to submit proposals on artistic production for consideration for the Sh100 stimulus programme. Culture PS Josephta Mukobe called for applications. "All interested artistes, musicians and actors are invited to immediately submit their proposals on artistic productions for consideration by the ministry," he said. Edited by T Jalio
