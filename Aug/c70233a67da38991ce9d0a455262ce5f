Tourism and Wildlife CS Najib Balala on Monday curtain-raised World Rangers Day at KWS Headquarters, Nairobi. The ceremony was used to officially launch the KWS Kenya Rangers Welfare Fund, with Sh3.3 million raised so far through the naming of 33 rhino calves born this year. The fundâ€™s motive is to support rangers in appreciation of their continued efforts in protecting our wildlife. Balala said, "World Ranger Day was designed with a mission to afford the world the chance to show its solidarity with rangers and empathise with them, as well as to change the attitude towards the job of a ranger by awakening in everyone the spirit of conservation."
