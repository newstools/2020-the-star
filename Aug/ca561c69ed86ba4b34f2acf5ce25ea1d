Three sleuths from the DCI are in police custody waiting to be arraigned for involvement in the robbery with violence incident that occurred at Baraka Gas Company in Matuu-Machakos county. The three officers from the Special Service Unit were arrested on Monday evening for an incident that happened on July 31. Having been tipped of the said company illegally and unprocedurally refilling cylinders from various gas companies behind locked doors after curfew hours, the team of three constables; William Mutua, Henry Maitai and Jonathan Sankale organized and executed a raid on the facility. According to DCI, the rogue officers intercepted the company's surveillance car (a Toyota Probox) whose occupant was the manager and gained entry to the facility. They then confiscated mobile phones of all workers moments before the business owner called the manager seeking to talk to the officers.
