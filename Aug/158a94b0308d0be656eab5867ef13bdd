A non-government organisation in Migori county aims to plant 10 million high grade avocado seedling by the end of the year. Community Action Support Organisation (CASO) said they have 17,000 Hass avocado seedlings to be planted during the expected short rains. That will raise the number of seedlings they have planted to 500,000. Caso field officer Absalom Ouma told the Star in Migori town planting of the seedlings is ongoing. “We have already liaised with groups bringing together youth and women, and individual farmers to spur growth of the fruit,” Ouma said. He spoke in Migori on Monday when he distributed seedlings to several groups. “We are targeting to have donors build a factory in Migori county to help in direct export of the fruit to India and China,” Ouma said. He said the Hass breed of avocado is fast growing, trees offer better quantity and quality of yield with a longer shelf life. “We believe this venture will help improve the socio-economic life of locals,” he said.
