 The Kwale administration will build more than 200 modern toilets to boost hygiene and encourage proper sanitation. Deputy Governor Fatuma Achani said the programme is in line with the government's campaign to end open defecation. It is supported by the Water Trust Fund. “Good toilets mean good health so, as a county, we are aiming to reach hundred per cent of toilets users to eradicate the habit of using open fields and flying toilets,” she said on Saturday at Ukunda showground in Msambweni constituency. Achani said the programme will mainly focus on remote villages where residents will be paid for the toilets they have built. Each resident owning a standard latrine will be given up-to Sh80,000 depending on the number of toilets they own. The lavatories must be able to provide privacy, good hygiene and be of durable quality before one is compensated for the expenses they have incurred. About 115 toilets have been completed and approved by public health officers. So far 51 residents of Magutu and Kona Ya Musa in Ukunda have benefited from the programme. The deputy governor said the locals will also be educated on how to use the toilets and maintain good hygiene. “We won’t stop at emphasising stage but send officers in the grassroots who will provide them with basic skills oh how to keep general hygiene,” she said. She said the efforts will assist the government to effectively combat Covid-19 as waterborne and other stomach related diseases would have been prevented. In 2019, Matuga subcounty topped in the reduction of open defecation with 70 per cent of the locals reported having built toilets. Achani said the Kwale government is working hard to strengthen the water pumping system to make it readily available to the locals. She said constructions of major dams and water pans are ongoing to enhance agricultural activists and domestic use.
