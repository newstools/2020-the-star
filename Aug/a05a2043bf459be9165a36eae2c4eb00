The Mombasa assembly on Tuesday approved a new County Public Service Board chair, Farida Abdallah — after a one-year delay. The CPSB has been operating with one staff member, board secretary  Jayzan Farouk, since June 2019 when other members' contracts expired. Abdallah was among the six people who were nominated by Governor Hassan Joho in December 2019. They were vetted in June this year. Majority leader Musa Khamisi said Abdallah  is capable and has 17 years experience in private organisations. He said the Stanford University graduate is  capable of making needed changes. Nominated MCA Milka Moraa congratulated Abdallah and the governor for believing in women. Likoni MCA Athman Mwamiri  said the county has been working without a Public Service Board for a year and they expect work to begin immediately. The house also approved Tendai Lewa as the CEC for Agriculture, Livestock, Fisheries and Cooperatives. He previously worked in the department of Education. Khamisi said Tendai was chosen because of his good performance in his previous docket. "Mr Tendai is a capable man, he worked so well  and made many changes in the department of Education. That is why we had trust in him and gave him the position, he said. Khamisi said  Tendai was the first person to start the bursary project in the department and they expect him to bring development to his new docket. (Edited by V. Graham)
