Multimedia University is targeting a promotion to the women’s Premier League despite the uncertainty surrounding the return to action. The Melvin Muga-captained side is banking on their ruthless attack that scored 17 goals in three matches before the league was suspended in March due to coronavirus pandemic to help them achieve their end of season target. The varsity side beat newbies Nairobi Chapel 11-0 in a one-sided affair. They also managed to hit 5-0 past Daystar before being held to a 1-1 all draw by Nakuru. They lead the standings with seven points—one above second placed Nairobi University. The Super League outfit finished in fifth position last season. “Our aim is to finish in the top two positions to realise our dream of playing in the Premier League. We have one of the deadliest attack in the division and our defence is water-tight. We, therefore, need to get as many points as possible when action resumes,” said the 23-year-old third year accounting student. “I urge my teammates wherever they are to continue training and try to keep fit. We still have a long way to go but a good player can’t forget stick work. Prior to the break, we were training together as a team in Rongai—something that was not there last season. ” The Nyamira Girls’ alumnus, however, warned the team against complacency. “We need to keep it simple and work extra hard than before. We know very well UON is our biggest threat. They missed promotion by a whisker in 2019 and we should be worried of them. Teams have strengthened and the league is even difficult to predict,” she added.
