Human rights activist Okiya Omtatah has asked the High Court to cite Kenya Wildlife Service boss John Waweru for contempt after he allegedly refused to avail documents as ordered by a judge in July. Omtatah argues that unless the court intervenes, his right to access justice will be violated as the subject of the petition which the court set out to protect will be defeated. In July, the High Court ordered KWS not to conclude public participation on the Draft of Nairobi National Park Management Plan 2020-2030. But KWS issued a press statement on September 2 informing the public that it had concluded the review by stakeholders and the public of the park’s management plan. Omtatah said public confidence in the rule of law and the court’s authority would be gravely undermined and further eroded if it did not act. “Unless the application is urgently heard and determined, the petitioner and the people of Kenya will suffer great loss as the authority of this court, the Constitution, and the rule of law will continue to be undermined by the KWS,” says Omtatah in court documents. He further argues that it is not in dispute that valid court orders were made in the presence of the counsel representing KWS. He claims the order was extracted and duly served on the Attorney General, which meant that the entire government machinery had been served and made aware of the directive. The activist said he has no other way of enforcing the order other than by seeking the intervention of the court.
