The Vihiga government has entered into a partnership with the Turkish government to support agriculture, manufacturing and communication sectors starting next year. Governor Wilber Ottichilo said on Tuesday said the partnership will focus on fish farming, textile industry and upgrading of Vihiga FM radio station to national coverage. He said the partnership will build the capacity of the county's vocational training to cushion youth against rising unemployment. Ottichilo said the Turkish government had agreed to assist the county to procure machinery and equipment to encourage garment production. "This programme will start at Maseno, the county polytechnic which specialises in textile technology, next year so that they will be able to produce uniforms and other textile products," he said. Speaking after hosting Turkish Ambassador Ahmet Cemil Miroglu in his Mbale office, Ottichilo said the government of Turkey has also agreed to support fish farming in the county. Ottichilo said the Turkey embassy will also purchase modern broadcast equipment for Vihiga FM radio station to replace the outdated ones currently in use. "We have agreed to further explore the possibility of twining one of the cities in Turkey with towns in Vihiga on cultural and economic exchange programmes," he said. Miroglu said his government was keen to open up new frontiers through bilateral cooperation with Kenya.Â "The twinning of Turkey cities with Vihiga county will open up new frontiers on both sides," he said. Miroglu was accompanied by Turkish Cooperation Co-ordination Agency (TIKA) officials during the tour.
