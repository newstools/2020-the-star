A human rights organisation, Haki Na Sheria, wants civil registration offices in Garissa county decentralised to save residents seeking birth certificates cost and time. Speaking at Jarirot in the outskirts of Garissa town on Wednesday where they distributed 400 birth certificates to residents, the organisation's Garissa branch programme manager Haretho Bulle said the citizens in far areas are forced to travel hundreds of kilometres to Garissa town to apply for birth certificates. In March, Haki Na Sheria in partnership with civil registration and the United Nations High Commission for Refugee (UNHCR) conducted a mobile birth certificates drive in the Jarirot where 400 people were registered. “We are here today to issue these certificates to their owners. This is a partnership that was meant to assist the poor who cannot afford to travel to Garissa and acquire birth certificates for their children,” Bulle said. Among those issued with the documents were elderly people whom Haretho said hadn’t acquired the important document due to lack of funds or awareness. Bulle urged locals to acquire birth certificates immediately a child is born to make it easier for them to obtain other important citizenship documents such as ID cards and passports. Muhumed Ahmed, a resident and an elder, said they have been forced to make numerous trips to registration offices to seek services. “The government has said children must have birth certificates for them to enrol in schools but we have had so many problems in accessing these offices. Something should be done and urgently to make it easier for citizens to acquire birth certificates,” Ahmed said Haki Na Sheria is a human rights organisation that promotes the welfare of marginalised communities by resisting human rights violations. Only Garissa town and Masalani have fully-fledged civil registration offices. Although an office was recently opened in Balambala, it has been dogged by lack of adequate personnel.
