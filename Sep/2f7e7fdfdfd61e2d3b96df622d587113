Children with disability have much to offer society do not lock them away, Taita Taveta parents have been urged. Governor Granton Samboja's wife, Stellah, urged the parents to seek help for children with disability from free medical camps. She said many parents hide their disabled children due to a common misconception that they were bewitched. “I urge you to shun the myth that people with disability are victims of witchcraft. They can be treated," Stellah said. She spoke at the free orthopaedic camp at Moi Referral Hospital in Voi. The outreach programme conducted by AIC Cure International Hospital targets children under 18 years with orthopaedic conditions. Stellah said she is on a mission to ensure all people living with disability get medical attention. “My office has partnered with AIC Cure International Hospital to change the lives of these children. Our efforts are geared towards ensuring people living with disability are given the attention they deserve," she said. Stellah appealed to more well-wishers to join the programme, which offers services at no cost to children with disability. “Regular visits to treatment facilities will enable proper recovery," said Daniel Kimeu, the mobile clinic coordinator at AIC Cure International Hospital. He said many children have fully recovered. Health Services executive John Mwakima said parents who take their children to receive medical attention are compassionate. “Before, orthopaedic services were sought in Kijabe, which is far away. With the unavailability of night travel due to the curfew, more [cost is incurred for] accommodation. Surgeries, on the other hand, can be costly thus making the entire process expensive,” he said. Mercy Eghwa, a beneficiary, expressed gratitude that her daughter was among the 30 children operated on free of charge. Edited by Josephine M. Mayuya
