Sauti Sol's Bien Aime Baraza married his wife Chiki Kuruka early this year in an invite-only vintage-themed wedding. The two met in a parking lot years ago. Speaking in their reality show, Sol Family, Bien said Chiki is the love of his life. "I do not know how you can love and fight with someone at the same time that much," he said. Chiki came to Kenya after her best friends moved back home. Speaking about the day they met, she said, "The real story is I won tickets to see Talib Kweli and I went with my very good friend, Emmanuel Jambo. That was when they first saw each other. Bien said he thought Chiki was dating Emmanuel. "One of her friends was a very huge fan of Sauti Sol so they came up to me to say hi and take pictures. Then I popped the 'your boyfriend doesn't get mad when you do these things?' She then told me Emmanuel was not her boyfriend," he said. "That night we ended up talking for so long and I was like 'this girl is intelligent'. That time I had been single for about a year. When I met her, I wasn’t actually looking for love in her, but in her, I felt like I was drinking a fresh glass of juice talking to Chiki.” Chiki does not believe in love at first sight and never will, but the couple say they felt a connection from day one. Chiki said culture was a barrier at first. She would barely laugh at his jokes because she did not understand the meaning behind them, she said. Emmanuel said he was shocked to see the two a few days later in a club. Their love grew so fast yet so real, he said. Chiki's friends said she has changed a lot and has calmed down, which is one of the things they loved about her relationship with Bien.
