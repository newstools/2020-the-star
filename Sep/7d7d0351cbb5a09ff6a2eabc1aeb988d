@alalmaurice Parents in Kisumu have been told to guide and protect their children to reduce cases in teen pregnancies. Truevine International Programme director Winter Ogacho attributed early pregnancies to lack of proper parenting and irresponsible sexual activities among youths. She said parents should advised their children and ensure they return to schools in good shape when the institutions are reopened. “The duty of ensuring children are protected from harmful activities should be a concerted effort,” Ogacho said. She said some parents had abdicated their roles leading to their children engaging in risky behaviours. She was speaking at Calvary Baptist Church in Rangumo, Kisumu East subcounty during a sensitisation meeting of schoolgirls. More than 600 schoolgirls were given sanitary towels. They were also educated on how to keep safe and avoid early pregnancies. Ogacho said it would be sad when some girls remain at home when schools reopen  because of early pregnancy. "Lack of towels has forced many girls to engage in illicit sex. They become vulnerable with some men taking advantage of their situation." The organisation also create awareness on the dangers of HIV/Aids and other sexually transmitted infections. The girls who attended the session hailed the initiative which they believed will help in protecting them. Calvary Baptist Church senior pastor Domnic Awuoth asked the government to address the increasing cases of teenage pregnancies. He cautioned children against engaging in sexual activities at a tender age. The church is sponsoring 67 learners in secondary schools. Awuoth told parents to closely monitor the activities of their children.  Edited by P.O
