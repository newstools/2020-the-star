President Uhuru Kenyatta on Thursday presided over the launch of the Kenyatta University Teaching, Research and Referral Hospital. The 650-bed capacity national referral hospital is well equipped to offer services in oncology, trauma and orthopedics among other specialised areas. Uhuru lauded board chairperson Prof Olive Mugenda for her commitment to making the vision for the hospital a reality. "To those who work here, God give you good health, strength and love to serve diligently all those Kenyans and citizens from other parts of this continent who come," he said. Uhuru toured the facility and laid a foundation stone at the Integrated Molecular Imaging Centre. The President said as a nation and the rest of the world grapples with pandemic, it is gratifying to note that Kenyaâ€™s health sector continues to make tremendous progress. "I wish to thank the Governor of Kiambu for signing a collaboration agreement between Gatundu Hospital and Kenyatta University...I want to encourage other governors to also consider partnering with level six hospitals," he said.
