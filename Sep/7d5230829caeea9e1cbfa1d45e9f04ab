Kenya is at crossroads over whether to mine 400 million tons of coal in the Mui Basin in Kitui county. Environment ministry official Thomas Lelekoitien said on Tuesday the issue and project had been shrouded in politics and blocked by opposition since concessions were awarded to a Chinese firm in 2013. The climate change official said it was not decided whether the project would proceed due to politics and resistance from various quarters. Lelekoitien spoke during a four-day virtual training for journalists on reporting climate change. He said coal is a dirty source of energy and many countries are rejecting it andÂ  turning to clean and sustainable energy sources. Residents, environmentalists and human rights activists are also opposed to the proposed Lamu coal-fired energy plant. Lelekoitien said opposition has slowed down that project despite the availability of technologies that could assure clean processing of the product. The concession to mine coal in Blocks C and D of the Mui Coal Basin was awarded to the Fenxi Mining Industry of China in December 2013. No work has begun. Coal mining concessions in Bocks A and B have also been put on hold, even after the tender was advertised. The Media Council of Kenya is supporting the climate change training for journlaists in collaboration with the UN Food and Agriculture Organization. The council's deputy head Victor Bwire called on journlaists to write stories about climate change that inspire people to adapt and make positive changes. Edited by R.Wamochie
