Media personality Betty Kyallo has shared the struggles she has been going through for the past few weeks in regards to her health. In one of her YouTube episodes, she said that she was not feeling good and her body was acting strangely and she knew she had to visit a doctor. She said she went to visit her gynecologist who not only knows about the woman's body but also the physical aspects of the body. "I wanted to do a pap smear which is very important for us as women to do every year and my last pap smear was last year in April. "After doing a test, my blood pressure was so high and I had had a stressful day and week but it was not just about that day or week. It was about fatigue that had grown for so long over time and I was just feeling I was not okay." Betty added that they even had to do three tests and the blood pressure was even going higher. She said the doctor advised her to try as much as possible to take things slow and rest. "My gynaecologist advised me to take it slow and to relax. I'm always up and about with meetings and Flair, always working. I felt like my body was telling me it's tired," she said. She added that at some point, she even decided not to be on social media and not post anything. "People kept asking questions, why I was not posting anymore on social media. I didn't want to share things with people because I felt it was too much," she confessed. Betty is known as a go-getter, a woman who sees an opportunity and goes for it. During the episode, she revealed that she was getting an apartment in one of the upcoming buildings in Upper Hill. She was showing one of her good friends and lawyer the showroom, giving him a tour of the building, urging him to invest in one of the apartments.
