Kisii Governor James Ongwae has warned that his administration will not tolerate contractors who delay projects they are awarded. Ongwae said contractors should complete projects within the stipulated time to get all their payments. “I am telling our contractors who win tenders to ensure that they complete work within the stipulated time, failing which they will lose the tenders,” Ongwae said. The governor spoke to Star about the progress of the banana factory which will serve farmers from Kisii and Nyamira counties and neighbouring Migori and Homa Bay. The banana factory that will cost Sh170 million will be completed in a year's time. The European Union gave a grant of Sh110 million and the county added Sh60 million. Ongwae, however, said money for equipment was never factored in the Sh110 million donor funds, adding that additional funds are required to purchase equipment for the plant. The county chief said the region produces 95,000 tonnes of bananas but hoped that production will soon be raised to 120,000 tonnes. “I am urging our farmers to plant more bananas to be able to serve the factory, which will be operational in 12 months' time,” he added. The factory, Ongwae said, will cushion farmers from exploitation by middlemen who buy their produce at throwaway prices. “The farmers will be paid based on kilograms of their produce and not in  the manner middlemen are currently doing,” the governor said. He said a foreign contractor will be contracted to run the factory, saying they have since received a number of them who have shown interest. Ongwae’s remarks came a day after Kisii County Contractors Association urged his administration to clear their pending bills before awarding new contracts. Edited by Henry Makori
