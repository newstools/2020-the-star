Regional low-cost carrier JamboJet has partnered with various hotels to promote domestic travel. The campaign dubbed “Now Travel Ready” is part of the airline's strategy to encourage air travel as the country begins its Covid-19 recovery process. “With the launch of this campaign, we want to show our customers the new normal of travel. From the moment they leave their home, to when they get to the airport, arrive at their destination, the hotels they can stay at and the measures in place, as well as the activities they can take part in,” said Jambojet head of sales and marketing, Titus Oboogi. The airline resumed operations on July 15 with three daily flights to Mombasa, two to Kisumu, two to Eldoret, one to Malindi, and four weekly flights to Diani. The hotels that are part of the campaign include Swahili Beach Resort and Diani Sea Lodge in Diani; Ciala Resort, Grand Royal Swiss Hotel and Sovereign Hotel in Kisumu; Voyager Beach Resort, Pride Inn Hotels and Hotel Englishpoint in Mombasa. Others are Turtle Bay Beach Club, Plan Hotel Resorts, Ocean Beach Resort & Spa and Luxury Springs Villas in Malindi and Watamu; The Noble Hotel and Naiberi Resort in Eldoret. Last week, the airline announced entry into charter operations to address emerging consumer needs and diversify its product offering.
