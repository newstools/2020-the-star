Themed “Breaking Barriers and Redefining Leadership in Africa,” the e-conference sponsors are KBA, DTB, Stanbic, Mastercard, Safaricom and Strathmore Business School. “The e-conference topics have been designed to showcase the immeasurable opportunity a gender inclusive leadership has on the overall performance of an organisation.” said KBA CEO,  Habil Olaka. He called on financial service providers and corporates across Africa to tap into the different viewpoints emanating from a diverse leadership team to aid further innovation. The pertinent topics set to be covered include the impacts of the coronavirus pandemic and the Fourth Industrial Revolution on the financial services sector, and transformational leadership and cross-generational culture management approaches. The former World Bank Treasurer Arunma Oteh, who currently serves as an Academic Scholar at St. Antony’s College,  is confirmed as the keynote speaker. Central Bank of Kenya Deputy Governor Sheila M'Mbijjewe and Bank of Zambia Deputy Governor Rekha Mhango are also confirmed as guests of honour.
