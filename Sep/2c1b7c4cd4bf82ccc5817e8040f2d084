Concerns have been raised following a move by the Muthaiga Residents Association to restrict boda boda operators, commercial vehicles and pedestrians withoutÂ  authority letters from accessing a section of the suburb. In an email addressed to members of the Muthaiga Residents Association dated September 22 with the subject 'security update', the secretariat said there is an ongoing operation. "No motorbikes and commercial vehicles are allowed to enter Main Muthaiga Road from Oil Libya Plaza, Kiambu Road and from Mini Muthaiga Round-about including all house helps, construction site employees, etc," the email signed off by Christine Chiriba, for the secretariat, read. Residents were asked to provide details of their employees, including job card or a letter indicating the name of the staffer, ID number, plot or house number, employer and their contact number. "For commercial vehicles... a letter must be provided to the vehicle by again the developer and or private house indicating the following: vehicle Number, driver name, ID Card Number, going to which plot number, purpose of visit," the email reads. Former Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero, who is a resident, raised concerns about the directive, saying no explanation was given for it. Muthaiga is one of the few suburbs which has managed to keep its serene look and avoid the invasion by developers who have come up with high-rise apartments, spoiling the aesthetics and straining basic utilities such as water. Lavington, Kileleshwa and Westlands are examples of upmarket residential locations where standalone houses have been torn down and replaced with apartments with several units.
