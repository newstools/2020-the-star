Mix genius DJ Mo says people should learn to appreciate more than hate on what people share on social media. This is after he received massive hate from followers, who told him he and his family should dress decently while vacationing at the beach. DJ Mo had shared a photo of his wife Size 8 in a bikini, appreciating her. Speaking to Word Is, the father of two said he posted the photo intentionally to shut his critics up. "You can't live for people and what they are saying about you," he said. "When people put their pictures or videos on social media, that means they are very comfortable with who they are. So any person who thinks they can use that time to body shame or put their hate, it is very wrong." One follower, Kong'ani, commented, "That picture for a gospel musician is a total shame, bro. Please delete." "The swimming kit is cool, but she is not just a gospel artiste, she is God’s servant, and this is a total shame if she can be seen in public looking like this." DJ Mo, who always has time for people who come after his family, replied. "Kong’ani malingu, advise your wife, bro ….. Stuff of God you can’t teach me, I know better." DJ Mo also asked Kenyans to support Kenyan creatives in whatever industry they are in. "With all the hate, we are killing our industry. If you notice, there is nothing different in our secular and gospel industries," he said. "If you keep on saying gospel is dead, even the secular industry what are they doing? Hakuna kitu wanafanya. "So may our fans learn to support Kenyan creatives. That is my message. Whatever industry a person is, let us learn to support them."
