The decision by Chief Justice David Maraga was bold. It was long overdue and he should have actually given it earlier. Going forward, Parliament should pass a constitutional amendment bill giving a formula for gender inclusion, which is basically the Duale Bill (former Majority Leader Aden) which has failed in the past. Going for fresh elections is not so that we elect more women but to give the new parliament a chance to enact the two-third gender bill. It is also for the voters to elect people who meet the gender balance. But the trick lies in the law and not in elections. The elections would give the public a chance to elect members who are willing to pass a new law. It is basically an indictment of this Parliament that has been unable to pass the two-thirds gender bill. We need another parliament to try and pass the law. If the next parliament also fails, then it will also be sent back home in keeping with Article 261 (7). Anyone who proposes that the two-thirds rule should not apply to elective positions can be likened to someone who argues that leadership is a preserve of white people and not Africans. These people are taking us back 50 years ago when we had no independence, when our minds were not liberated. We have made significant strides since then. That’s why we managed to get 47 women plus six who are nominated and there’s evidence to show that when women are nominated, it empowers them to seek elective positions and win, just like men. Women who were nominated then went on to win elections include Sarah Korere (Laikipia West), Naisula Lesuuda (Samburu West), Martha Wangari (Gilgil), Aisha Jumwa (Malindi), Sofia Abdi (Ijara) and myself (Suba North). There's also Fatuma Dullo (Senator Isiolo) and former Runyenjes MP Cecily Mbarire. If you're keen, you would notice most of these women are from conservative communities, where they could not have easily been elected as MPs. The Suba North MP spoke to the Star
