Despite going for five months without pay at Mathare United, South Sudan forward Dani Lual says he harbours no intentions of leaving the Kenyan Premier League until he achieves his target. The lanky striker, who joined the 2008 league winners in January from Atlabara FC on a three-year contract, opened up on his decision to stay put in a bid to achieve his long term dream of breaking into the senior national team. Lual, who graduated from the U20 set-up last year, believes the Kenyan league is competitive enough to shape a player for national team duties. The forward, who prior to signing for Mathare had unsuccessfully tried his luck with Spanish side Valencia City FC, said he was hoping that sporting activities will resume soon for him to boost his chances of being considered for the Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers against Uganda in November. South Sudan will warm up for the qualifiers against Cameroon during the international week next month . New Gor Mahia winger Tito Okello is among the players who have been summoned for the friendly. Okello, who joined Gor from Vipers snubbed Uganda for the Africa's youngest state. “I like the competition levels in KPL and I think if I extend my stay, despite the financial challenges, I have a chance of making it to the national team. Before football was adjourned, I was on course to achieve that and I hope to pick from where I left once the suspension on sporting activities is lifted. I want to increase my chances of being summoned for the qualifiers,” said Lual. In the meantime, he revealed he is scheduled to meet Mathare honchos on Tuesday to resolve the pay dispute. “I will be meeting with the club's Chief Executive Officer Jecton Obure this Tuesday to discuss the way forward as far as my salary arrears is concerned,” he added.
