 Arsenal have big ambitions, French striker Alexandre Lacazette said after their opening-day 3-0 victory at Fulham in the Premier League on Saturday. “It was the best way to start the season,” Lacazette, who got on the scoresheet alongside new signing Gabriel and captain Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, told the BBC. “(Manager Mikel Arteta) wants us to be perfect. We have a lot of big ambitions. I want to help the team to be on top and I know it is my job.” Lacazette denied media reports he had wanted a move away from Arsenal during the close-season. “I am really happy at Arsenal,” said the Frenchman. “It is only the press and other people that say I am not. I want to play and win titles. We want to be aggressive with and without the ball and improve every aspect of our game.” Arteta said the situation regarding striker Aubameyang, who is yet to extend his contract which expires next year, was likely to be clarified soon and singled out the performances of several players at Craven Cottage. “I’m really positive we’ll get it (Aubameyang’s new contract) done,” the Spaniard told BT Sport. “Hopefully in the next few days you can get some news. “I wanted to see my team determined with a lot of energy and do the things we did in training. We did it today. “Gabriel didn’t play for six months before today. Mohamed Elneny was brilliant. He has been excellent in training since day one. All the boys tried really hard.”
