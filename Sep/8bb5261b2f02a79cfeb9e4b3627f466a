Three men suspected of stealing former Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero's Sh3 million golden watches will spend the weekend in custody. Augustus Ndeto, Titus Mwinzi and Barrack Odhiambo were arrested on September 14 in Mwiki. Police constable John Mwangi asked Kibera senior principal magistrate Sharon Maroro to allow the detention of the suspects for four days for the conclusion of the investigation. He said Kidero had yet to identify his property as he had travelled out of town. Mwangi also needed to travel to the suspects' rural homes toÂ  recover more items and record statements from witnesses. Maroro allowed the continued detention of the suspects and set next Wednesday as the mention date. Mwangi, who is based at Mwiki police station, told the court on Wednesday that the suspects were brought to the station for allegedly stealing Kidero's golden watches.  - mwaniki fm
