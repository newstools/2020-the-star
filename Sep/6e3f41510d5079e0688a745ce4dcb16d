DPP Noordin Haji has ordered the prosecution of senior Garissa county officials, including Governor Ali Korane, over the embezzlement of Sh233 million that was issued by the World Bank as a grant. In a statement on Thursday, Haji said that he handed over investigations to experienced prosecutors and recused himself since the probe involved his county of origin. Others facing charges are Finance chief officer Ibrahim Malow, Treasury head Mohammed Abdullahi, Municipality CEC Abdi Shale and head of accounting at municipal, Ahmed Aden. It was found that instead of the money being used for the construction of a market, re carpeting of CBD roads and putting up of pedestrian walkways and setting up of drainages, it was diverted between February and September 2019. The DPP said diversions were facilitated by the county officials. Governor Korane is accused of abdicating his role in the management of resources. The county officials face charges including conspiracy to commit an economic crime, willful failure to comply with the law relating to management of public finances and misappropriation of public funds. Other charges they will face include engaging in a project without prior planning contrary to provisions in the Public Finance Management Act and abuse of office. Korane will become the latest of a string of governors to be prosecuted. Last week, Haji ordered the prosecution of Tharaka Nithi Governor Muthomi Njuki and other county officials over a Sh34.9 million tender awarded irregularly. Prior to that, Migori Governor Okoth Obado was barred from office after being linked to Sh73 million graft in the county.
