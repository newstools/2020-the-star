Another long serving Wazito player Eric ‘Ero’ Odhiambo has retired from professional football and will now join the club’s management. He announced his retirement through the club's website, days after another long serving player David Oswe retired. Oswe will also join the club’s management as an assistant team manager. Odhiambo has been with Wazito FC since December 2012 and played a key role in the team’s rise from the Provincial League to the Kenyan Premier League. “All these years donning the Wazito Football Club colours have been undoubtedly the happiest of my life. I only have feelings of enormous gratitude for this club and for this sport which has given me a lot to date,” he told the club’s website. He added: “However, I believe  the time has come to open a new stage in my life and transition into a management role within the club.” The club’s chief executive officer, Dennis Gicheru thanked Odhiambo for his service to the club and wished him well in his new career phase. “He has been a great servant of the club. Ero is one of the most disciplined and loyal players that I played and worked with. Many clubs were interested in him over the years but he chose to stick with Wazito. He has always been very committed,” he noted. The CEO added: “I want to thank him for the many years of service to the club and wish him well as he partakes some new roles behind the scene.” Wazito President Ricardo Badoer said in Twitter post: “The chapter of Eric the player has sadly come to an end but the story continues as Eric will still be part of Wazito FC working with  media related duties. Thank you for eight great years of hard work and dedication. We look forward to working with you for many decades.”
