A video clip circulating on social media alleging a robbery incident at Westland’s Sarit Centre is false. The Star’s fact-check desk has established that the incident happened in New York and not in Kenya. The clip had widely been circulated on WhatsApp groups with people being warned to take precautions while shopping. “This happened to one of our colleagues at Sarit Centre Nairobi,” read one of the messages attached on the clip. But looking at the clip keenly, the power adapters in the lift are round as opposed to the traditional square ones popular in Kenya. Secondly, the elevator/lift doors in Kenya are not designed to close in the manner shown in the clip. Most lifts do not have an inside door, just the lift doors that close and open. Thirdly, lift walls at Sarit Centre are white as opposed to blue. Using the Google search tools, we established the clip had been posted on an online channel indicating the incident had happened in New York over a week ago. The exact location is not, however, indicated in this link https://www.liveleak.com/view?t=sXU40_1598455896 This story was produced by The Star in partnership with Code for Africa’s iLAB data journalism programme, with support from Deutsche Welle Akademie.
