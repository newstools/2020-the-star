Emurua Dikirr MP Johanna Ng’eno and his Kapseret counterpart Oscar Sudi’s recent utterances were from the same script, a colleague has said. Nyeri Town MP Ngunjiri Wambugu said what both MPs said was essentially the same thing and it was no coincidence that the two  talked about the President and his family. Wambugu said the utterances are a clear indication that there is an attempt to create a national security crisis, then force a negotiation. “This effort is being run by supporters of the Deputy President [William Ruto] in Parliament. They seem focused on ensuring we get a violent crisis as soon as possible,” he said. The legislator told journalists in Nyeri town on Tuesday that their aim is to make it look like because the President and the DP are not working together, then it is a matter of national crisis. He said the utterances by the two were inciting Kenyans to attack each other because the DP is not happy with his relationship with  the President. “What Ng’eno and Sudi are hoping is that the supporters of the DP are going to start causing chaos to protest against what they think is an unfair treatment of the DP,” Wambugu said. He said the DP has not been treated unfairly but has been treated according to what the Constitution says. “The country can only have one President at a time. He [Ruto] may never become anything more than that [Deputy President],” the legislator said. “We can’t then start having a conversation based on how he could become president. There is no guarantee that he will become one.” Edited by A.N
