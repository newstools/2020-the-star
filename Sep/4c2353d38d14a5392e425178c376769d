The national government is planning to re-establish regional and county planning offices to coordinate development activities in the counties. Planning PS Saitoti Torome said on Friday that officers will start arriving in the course of this month. "The national government implements a lot of projects which have impact on counties,” the PS said. Torome said the new move will enable the government monitor the projects effectively and to track down their implementation. “We will therefore require technical officers who will work very closely with National Government Administrative Officers (NGAO)  to monitor and evaluate the implementation of the national government projects in all the counties and in the region,” he said. He said the department will start with regions where it will dispatch directors of regional planning in the eight regions before moving to the 47 counties. County planning offices will be headed by deputy directors of planning who will be reporting to regional directors of planning. The PS spoke when he visited regional commissioner Wilfred Nyagwanga and Nyeri county commissioner Loyford Kibaara in their offices in Nyeri town.
