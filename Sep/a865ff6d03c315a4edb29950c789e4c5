Journalists have been barred from accessing the Anti-Corruption Court with police officers citing 'orders from above' for their actions. The journalists were seen stranded outside the court buildings as they tried to access the area after were told they could not go in. Reports indicate that the journalists were barred over a picture that was taken of a leaking roof. The journalists were going to cover the case of Tharaka Nithi Governor Muthomi Njuki whose bail hearing was scheduled for today. Njuki was charged with conspiracy to commit an offence of corruption of over Sh34 million alongside 20 others. Muthomi denied the charges on Tuesday before Chief Magistrate Douglas Ogoti. The governor was also charged with another count of conflict of interest in a tender worth Sh34 million. The county boss spent another night in police custody ahead of Wednesday's bail ruling.
