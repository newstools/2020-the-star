Migori Governor Okoth Obado's pretrial hearing of a Sh73.5 million corruption case failed to take off as had been expected on Monday. The court was told that Obado's lawyers had not picked documents from the EACC. EACC says the documents are ready and the defence can collect them anytime, adding that they should liaise with the Investigating Officer in the case. Chief magistrate Lawrence Mugambi said the pre-trial hearing could not proceed due to the above circumstances. Obado was charged last month alongside his four children and six others with several counts of corruption related charges. They all denied the charge of conspiracy to commit a felony relating to fraud of Sh73.4 million from Migori county. It was alleged that being the governor he held an indirect private interest in several contracts that paid money into his children's accounts. Obado was separately charged with eight counts of conflict of interest for the different times that each of the children received money in their accounts from the county's coffers. He was also charged with money laundering where it was alleged that alongside his son Dan Okoth they entered into an arrangement of transfer of Sh10 million for the purchase of a Land Cruiser vehicle knowing that the money was proceed of crime. The case will be mentioned on October 7.  Edited by Henry Makori
