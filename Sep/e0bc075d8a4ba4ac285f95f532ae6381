Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho is expected to attend the wedding of Juney Karisa, daughter of Karisa Maitha, on Saturday. Juney is set to wed Patrick Mwavula, an information officer at the Mombasa governor's office. She is a journalist based in Mombasa, working for Kenya Broadcasting Corporation. Speaking to Word Is, Juney said the two met during the 2017 elections. "We are in the same line of work and so it was easy to get along," she said. "We've since been friends rather than lovers and that gave us a firm foundation to who we are today." The two will exchange their vows at the Methodist church opposite Tononoka Hall after a traditional wedding set for Friday. Juney's message to her husband to be is that the highs and lows have proven that their love can overcome all challenges. "Even through the fire, we will emerge as gold and not ashes. This year has been my lowest, but it's during the low tides we found God who steered our ship to where we are," she said. "I am glad God gave me a silver lining in my low moments, and tomorrow I begin a hopeful chapter full of love around me." The wedding's colour theme is teal blue and peach. The reception will be at Bahari Gates Restaurant, Mtwapa. Other guests include Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi and Lands CAS Gideon Mung'aro, who is also a relative, among other top national and county government officials.
