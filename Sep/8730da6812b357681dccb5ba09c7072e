ODM leader Raila Odinga on Saturday took an indirect jibe at Deputy President William Ruto over his 'hustler movement' slogan. Raila said all the former Presidents in the country were also from poor backgrounds. He said contrary to what Kenyans have been made to believe, anyone aspiring for the top seat including him stands a chance and should not be branded as from wealthy families or dynasties. Raila maintained that the push for a constitutional change through the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) was unstoppable. He said the BBI proponents will soon hit the road again to popularise the initiative. The former premier said as proponents of BBI, they wanted a united and peaceful country. He said the only way to ensure such is realised is through a change in the Constitution. "We had paused reggae for a while but since everything is slowly coming to normal we shall soon be relaunching it," said Odinga. Raila spoke on Saturday during the thanksgiving ceremony of Knut Secretary General Wilson Sossion's daughter upon her admission to the bar. Speaking at Motigo in Bomet on Saturday, the ODM leader also called on leaders to stop spreading hate messages. Those present during the thanksgiving ceremony were Cotu Secretary General Francis Atwoli, Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa and James Orengo. Others were MPs Atiende Omolo, Eve Obara, Johana Ngeno, Kanu Secretary General Nick Salat among others. Wamalwa asked Kenyans to support BBI saying the devolution has given much focus in it. "Let us support it as it will ensure the success of devolution which is aimed at benefiting all Kenyans," he stated.
