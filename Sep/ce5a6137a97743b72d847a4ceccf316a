Speaking on Kiss 100, Kamene said they were left touched after the wedding planner Bob and Eunice had contacted turned out to be a con. "A few days to their wedding, he ran away with the money they had paid him. The money they had saved for their honeymoon was used to cater for the wedding bills so they didn’t have their honeymoon," she said.

"Fiona, sister to Eunice told us the story and from that moment we knew these were the people who needed this kiss of kindness.
