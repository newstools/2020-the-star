Tests on fish from Lake Naivasha have established they are safe for human consumption and do not have heavy metals as earlier feared. Kenya Marine and Fisheries Research Institute (KMFRI) chief executive James Njiru said, “We have finished our studies around the lake and we can confirm that fish from Lake Naivasha is fit for human consumption.” However, there are nitrates in the lake although the level is not high, Njiru said and clarified that the level has no effect on fish. If uncontrolled, nitrates could affect the lake ecosystem, leading to death of fish, the KMFRI executive said in Naivasha. He said nitrates lead to fast growth of lake plantslike algae, which take a lot of oxygen in the water and lead to the death of other marine life. “As the plants grow fast, they end up consuming a lot of oxygen for other species and this could end up in a crisis,” he said. Njiru said the nitrates were from fertilisers washed into the lake from surrounding flower farms. “With the rise in water levels, pollution is evident but due to the ongoing rains the effects are minimal,” he said. Njiru said KMFRI is working with other government agencies to support fish farming. “The government has zero-rated ingredients used to manufacture fish feed so that they are easily accessible and affordable to farmers,” he said. Prof Charles Ngugi from Karatina University and a fish farmer said access to quality fingerlings and fish feed is a major challenge. “The only way to increase fish production in the country is through aquaculture. There is also a need to address the availability of fingerlings and fish feeds for farmers,” he said. Edited by A.N
