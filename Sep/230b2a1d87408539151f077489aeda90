Highly-rated Kenya Under-20 midfielder Fidel Origa is determined to help turn around the fortunes of moneybags Wazito after he joined them from Kenyan Premier League rivals Western Stima. Origa was one of the top-performing midfielders in the league last season and has been tipped by many to be a Harambee Stars’ regular in the not too distant future. Origa, a Mautuma High School alumnus, has previously played for Kariobangi Sharks. At Wazito, he will meet some familiar faces like Musa Masika, Bixente Otieno and Joshua Otieno who were all part of the Kenya U-20 set up. “I am delighted to be here because I believe this is a good move for me. I join the team at a time when my form is very good and I want to improve even further. My goal is to help the team win trophies, and at a personal level, become a better player. To the fans, I want to tell them that they will enjoy the football here,” he stated on the club’s website.. Coach Fred Ambani hailed the arrival of the battling midfielder, admitting that he will be crucial cog in the Wazito’s wheel. “Origa is a very good young midfielder and one of the best in his position in the country. Last season when we played Stima both home and away, he caused us many problems and I am happy that we will now play for us and not against us,” stated Ambani. “He is hardworking, skilful, positionally disciplined, his ball distribution and pressing are top-notch. He is also a very disciplined player who takes instructions and is willing to learn,” he added. Wazito performed dismally in the league last year despite splurging money on high calibre players who failed to live up to their billing much to the consternation of owner Ricardo Badoer.
