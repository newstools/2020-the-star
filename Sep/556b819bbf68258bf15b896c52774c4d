The CBD is looking beautiful by the day, so is the road in my estate that was recarpeted last weekend. The cracks and potholes were an eyesore. Big up, Maj Gen Mohamed Badi. I feel, however, that Badi will score a major point if he actually solves the cityâ€™s waste management problem. In my estate, for instance, the Kazi Mtaani people and cleaning crews before them scoop dirt from trenches and dump it on sidewalks and the now recarpeted road (before it was repaired, but how long do you think it will take before they go back to that?) The sidewalks are actually disappearing beneath all the soil (mostly) and garbage. In fact, while before the cleaners would place small heaps on sidewalks, they have now transferred all the heaps from the road to the pavements. In some sections the sidewalks are totally covered up. Who cares about the walking nation, anyway? Finally, can Badi, or City Hall, make it illegal to operate a business, car wash as well as parking a car or cart, on sidewalks, complete with hefty fines? Sidewalks are public property, and not meant for a select few.
