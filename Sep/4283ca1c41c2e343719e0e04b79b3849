A person who was trapped in a four-storey building that collapsed in Mamboleo, Kisumu, on Sunday night has been rescued. Five others who were in the building under construction escaped with slight injuries and were treated at Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital and later discharged. The building crumbled around midnight. County commissioner Josephine Ouko said the six were workers at the building and were staying in one of the rooms on the lower floors that had been completed. She said their response team sprung into action immediately to rescue them. "Our rescue response teams have been here since midnight and we are happy the operation was successful and the person who was trapped has been saved," she said, adding that already, two other workers thought to have been trapped have been accounted for. She said the relevant authorities including the police have started investigations into the matter. "We want to engage professionals to tell us why the building might have come down," she said. According to a police report, Robert Gitau, 30, said they were resting on the first floor when it came down. Another survivor said the incident happened after they had eaten and gone to bed. There was confusion during the process and they could not trace three of their colleagues, they said. Planning and Urban Development CEC Dixon Obungu said the building should be approved and monitored by qualified engineers, adding that they are confirming if indeed it was fit. Building owner Wilkister Masila told the media that it was about to be completed and did not understand how it collapsed.  Edited by R.Wamochie
