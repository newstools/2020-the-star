The people of Western have never had a serious presidential candidate since Kijana Wamalwa's stab at the top seat in 1997. The millions of voters from Western are yearning for a man or woman who will stand up and fly the region's flag at the ballot. They are looking forward to a man or woman who would one day redeem them from the political oppression they are going through. Despite the community boasting massive numerical strength in terms of votes, it continues to be abused. The region has for long suffered in the hands of individuals driven by their own interests instead of rallying the community together. Time has come for the community to field one of its own at the ballot in the 2022 presidential election. However, it must be noted that the region will not settle on individuals without focus. The community will settle on someone with the wherewithal to serve as the region's rallying call. Once the community gets a leader who can serve as a rallying call and therefore a unifying factor, the leaders from the region will have no choice but to support that person. Kijana Wamalwa left a vacuum that no leader has been able to fill. The region is looking for a leader who will fill his shoes. What I must warn against is an attempt by some self-driven elements to position themselves as the region's kingpins yet they are self-serving. We need a selfless leader who will be serious and not a joker out to mislead the community. Time is over for political fraudsters who have superintended over the political abuses our people have suffered despite their numerical strength. In 2022, Western will find a dedicated and strong man who will rise above self and rally the community together. The Tongaren MP spoke to The Star.
