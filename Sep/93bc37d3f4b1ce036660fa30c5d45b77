 The government has ordered closure of all quarries in Mandera citing terror attack threats from al Shabaab militants. Northeastern regional commissioner Nicodemus Ndalana who visited Mandera last week said the decision was reached following reports that al Shabaab might be planning an attack targeting miners. He said the militants have been suffocated after heightened security surveillance around the border but that they were now looking for a soft target. Ndalana warned that anyone who contravenes the directive will be held liable for any deaths in the quarries. But miners have criticised the directive, saying it will negatively affect their income with many drawing their livelihoods from the quarries. Quarry owner Abdullahi Ahmed said al Shabaab have been killing people even in residential places and not quarries alone. He said the decision to close quarries was unfair. The government has in the past closed the quarries over similar threats. Some owners and workers have, however, continued with their activities despite the closure order. In 2015, al Shabaab attackers killed at least 14 people working at a quarry. Ndalana said the government will monitor the situation and advise when work can resume. The administrator also issued a warning to locals collaborating with al-Shabaab. “Anyone working with al Shabaab is our enemy. We shall treat him as such and the punishment meted on al Shabaab suspects will be meted on them,” Ndalana said. He added, “I want to urge wananchi, security agents and police reservists collaborating with the al Shabaab that we shall soon catch up with them and they will dearly pay for their crimes.”  Edited by P.O
