The government should construct water pans in drought-prone areas to help residents produce food crops by irrigation, Limuru MP Peter Mwathi has said. Mwathi said people lack food in some areas of Limuru but the region can produce food with surplus for sale. "If we can have more water pans in this region and our people are supported with linings so that water is not absorbed, then people can do a lot of agricultural activities," he said. He added, "We had dug several water pans in Ndeiya ward with National Irrigation Board and people are saving rainwater. The stored water is used for irrigation and to feed animals. The MP asked the government to also provide farmers with drought-resistant cereals seeds. Mwathi spoke at Kiawada Primary School on Saturday, where he hosted Lovely Children International to distribute relief food to over 2,000 needy residents. John Kimani said many residents own between five and 10 acres of land but they grow maize once in a year. However, without adequate rainfall, their yields are destroyed. "This is bad. We have not had adequate rainfall. We only hear of rains elsewhere. We planted maize, but it all dried up. That is why we are all looking for help," he said. Lovely Children International programs coordinator Wycliffe Msayu said that the number of needy people is still rising. "We have heard people sleeping hungry, and they had never slept without food. The economy was hit by the disease and the lack of proper methods of food sustainability," he said. The MP asked the government to reduce proces of food items such as maize flour, rice, cooking oil as well as cereals such as maize and beans.
