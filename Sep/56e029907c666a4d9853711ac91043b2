Former Nairobi County Deputy Governor Jonathan Mueke has resigned from Wiper party. In a statement on Friday, Mueke said he will soon announce where he is headed to. "I hereby tender my resignation with immediate effect as well as relinquish my platinum membership, " he said. Mueke said he has been a loyal and committed member who made an effort to popularise and grow the party nationwide. "I request the office of the registrar of political parties to immediately delete my name from the member list in Wiper," he said. "I wish you and your party all the best as you continue your political journeys." Mueke's move comes two months after former Machakos Senator Johnston Muthama ditched the party saying it was a tribal outfit. The Wiper Democratic Party dismissed the allegations and said Muthama’s remarks were least expected from him, bearing in mind that he abandoned it in the run-up to the 2017 General Election. Wiper said that Muthama is "full of bitterness and resentment after realising that he has little political value" to offer anyone who had hoped to use him to win popular support, particularly in the Ukambani region. “The garrulous former Senator has a good reason to panic: he now realises that Ukambani is solidly behind Kalonzo, implying that his (Muthama's goose has already been cooked and is now ready to be served,” part of the statement reads. Wiper also said that Muthama will be like other opponents who have tried to battle party leader Kalonzo Musyoka, ending up achieving nothing.
