Gem MP Elisha Odhiambo has told off those eyeing the seat to stop distracting him before the campaign period opens. Odhiambo regretted that some of his rivals were in office for long but never initiated even a single development project to improve the lives of residents and are only interested in personal gain. Three people have shown interest in the race. They are former MP Jakoyo Midiwo, Booker Ngesa and Rading' Otieno. Odhiambo said a right-thinking leader should not undermine development projects meant for the people. “Some of the aspirants bickering around yearning for my position have been in politics from the Moi era and were given a chance to lead but never brought any development to Gem people.” He said those who have been in power are hanging on his projects to mislead residents that they were the initiators, yet residents know they did not deliver during their tenure. Odhiambo said the newly tarmacked roads in Gem have been initiated during his tenure, saying his predecessor, Jakoyo, only used them as campaign tools. The lawmaker added that only development record will shape Gem politics in the next two years. At the moment his agenda is development, he said. Before his term ends, he will initiate construction of a medical training college in Yala, a teacher training college in West Gem, and a technical training college in East Gem, he said. Odhiambo said will ensure all major roads are tarmacked and floodlights installed to boost security. He said the ongoing rural electrification programme that he initiated will boost the local economy and improve security. The MP's supporters told the Star that they are firmly behind his reelection bid because of his track record, citing tarmacked roads, power connection, and new administrative offices.
