Universities, teachers’ and technical training colleges have been directed to prepare for reopening beginning October 5. The reopening will begin with all final year students in universities and students taking final exams in teachers' and technical training colleges. The decision announced by Education CS George Magoha marks the first step to reopening the education sector and comes after the President put brakes on plans to reopen schools. “The boards of TVETs and TTCs will announce the resumption of in-person for the other classes with consideration given to those taking practical courses,” Magoha said. University councils and senates have been instructed to determine the appropriate dates for resumption of other students. To safeguard those to report back, the ministry directed that all learning institutions enforce strict Covid-19 health and safety protocols. "These include monitoring body temperature for learners and all other persons accessing the institutions,” reads the directive by Magoha. The institutions will be required to maintain a high level of hygiene by hand washing, use of sanitiser, adopting the physical and social distancing measures and wearing of face masks. Magoha further directed all universities and tertiary institutions used as quarantine facilities be fumigated. The institutions will also be required to link up with medical facilities in their proximity prior to reopening. Learning institutions have been asked to provide psychosocial and spiritual support to learners. “Councils, boards shall ensure full compliance with the guidelines and protocols issued by the Health ministry failure to which their respective institutions will be closed," the circular says.
