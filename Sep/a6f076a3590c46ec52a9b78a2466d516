Wazito head coach, Stewart Hall has challenged the club’s forwards to replicate the prowess they depict in training on match days. Wazito have struggled to win matches convincingly with Hall blasting his goal poachers for their input during their league matches which he noted fell below his expectations even after depicting class in training. The former AFC Leopards tactician who is fine-tuning his boys to end Tusker’s 13 matches unbeaten run this weekend, says his strikers’ lethargy in front of the goal has proved costly and has demanded a positive reaction. Besides seeking to gun down the high-flying Tusker, Wazito will be out to register their fourth win of the season. The league returnees are placed 13 with 15 points “It really concerns me because we are creating many chances but we are not converting them as we should and in some matches, it has hurt us really bad. "We spend a lot of time on finishing but during the game, we don’t reproduce that. In training, we do it very well. The finishing is excellent and I now want my players to reproduce that during matches,” said the former Azam coach on the club’s official website At the same time, Hall who restated his faith with the attackers called for their patience which he observed will yield goals. “ I have full faith in them and I want them to be a little calmer and clinical in front of goal,” he added.
