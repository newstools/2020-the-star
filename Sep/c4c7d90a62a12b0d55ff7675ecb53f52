Residents of Kisii estate in Thika have been warned against illegal power connections. Northeastern regional manager David Mutitu told the Star on Saturday that illegal power connections pose danger to people living on the estate. “Residents have done unprofessional wiring, which poses danger to them,” he said. Mutitu said while it is the right of every Kenyan to be connected to power, it is good to stop being ignorant of the laws put in place by the government. A week ago, iron sheets that were blown off from a house in the area by a strong wind, hit a power line and caused a huge blast. Head of security at KPLC in Thika, Henry Migwi, said an infringement notice had been issued to those owning structures under the power line, asking them to vacate. He said that at times people put up structures without KPLC noticing, and they run to court once they are asked to vacate. “Many Kenyans are aware that it is illegal to build under power lines, but they still ignore. It becomes hard for us, especially when they move to court to block us from moving them,” Migwi said He said that at the beginning of the year, they had to instal concrete beacons, to mark land belonging to KPLC, to ensure that nobody builds there.
