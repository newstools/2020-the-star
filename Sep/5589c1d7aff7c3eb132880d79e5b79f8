Embu youths in the Kazi Mtaani programme have rescued a hapless mother living in a shanty after she ran away from her allegedly abusive husband. They built a three-room iron sheets house for 30-year-old Mercy Muthoni and her three children. Muthoni said she escaped years back from Kisii where she was married and went back to her parentsâ€™ home at Kangaru village in Embu West subcounty. She said she walked out on her husband and her in-laws after alleged mistreatment and irreconcilable differences. Ann Muthoni, a member of area advisory committee, took her plight to the attention of the administration. Embu West subcounty commissioner Caroline Imaya accompanied Embu county commissioner Abdullahi Galgalo and his security team to visit Muthoni on Wednesday. Imaya said a tree was felled for timber and the youths engaged to build the house with other donated materials. Galgalo, who handed over assorted foods to Muthoni, thanked the government for the programme. He said many youths have been engaged and insecurity has gone down in the county. The Sh10 billion National Hygiene Programme is in its second month after the countrywide launch in August. The 3,000 youths hired in Embu are engaged in various community activities for Sh450 daily wage. Other activities the youths have been engaged in include construction of a sanitary block at the Kangaru assistant county commissioner's office. The facility is being constructed under a partnership of Kangaru Development Association, the local administration and well-wishers while Kazi Mtaani youths provide labour. The youths have also been clearing bushes at the Embu county police headquarters compound, unblocking water and sewerage systems and cleaning up public places. The county commissioner said there was no misappropriation of Kazi Mtaani funds since the money is sent directly to the phones of the youths involved.  Edited by Henry Makori
