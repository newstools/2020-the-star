Security officers based at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport have confiscated 150 cartons of miraa that were labelled as 'Fine Beans' and 'Ravaya' for export. The khat had been packed in the motor vehicle with registration number KAW 122R at the Airways Cargo Export section before being intercepted by the officers. It was discovered that the cartons contained french beans and eggplants at the top but had miraa concealed underneath. Six suspects namely Ahmed Habib, James Ngure, Duke Mutambo, Raphael Ngotho, Stephen Ngugi, and Julius Mulwa have been arrested. The police said that the six suspects will be charged accordingly.

DCI said via Twitter that Bare was arrested for concealing 20Kgs of dried Khat in his two suitcases while Osman had concealed 5Kgs of fresh khat in his trousers.
