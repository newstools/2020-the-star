A suspect was on Wednesday arrested for an alleged robbery with violence incident in Bungoma County. Kuntai Charles Alube was arrested along Awasi, Chemilil road by DCI sleuths. In a statement via Twitter, the DCI said the suspect is part of a trio gang whose vehicle believed to have been used in a robbery was tracked and intercepted by detectives. "DCI Detectives based at Bungoma County have intercepted a motor vehicle Reg No. KCY 674 G along Awasi/Chemilil road," the directorate said on Wednesday. "The said vehicle was involved in a robbery with violence incident in Bungoma Town where a member of the public lost a considerable amount of cash, two mobile phones, cheque books among other personal items." A manhunt has been launched for two suspects who managed to escape. The arrested suspect was found in possession of five mobile phones and a pair of handcuffs. This comes barely a week after three suspects were arrested for abducting a lady and stealing her belongings in Narok. Rose Waithera, Jackson Kamau and Julius Guchu were arrested at Siyapei area while hiding in a thicket after abandoning their runaway vehicle. DCI boss George Kinoti said the trio bundled the victim into their runaway vehicle (KBS 350W) and drove off. The DCI sleuths managed to recover the victim's personal belongings including a mobile phone and money that she had earlier on withdrawn from the bank.
