Two men have been charged with conspiring with others who are still at large to steal a truck worth Sh6 million in Dandora, Nairobi. Thoman Maiotha and Noah Busoro were charged on Tuesday before Kibera senior principal magistrate Sharon Maroro. They denied the charges. The charge sheet says that they committed the offence between August 24 and August 27 at Kenyango.Â They allegedly stole the Ashok Leyland truck belonging to Flexilease Limited. The police say the truck had been parked in a yard and but the accused drove it towards Mlolongo at a garage where they requested a man to repair its ball joint and later requested him to get a suitable buyer. A CEO of a company paid some cash for it. The accused requested lenient bond terms. The magistrate granted them a Sh6 million bond and alternative Sh3 million bail each. She directed the case to be mentioned on September 29 before chief magistrate Abdulkadir Lorot.
