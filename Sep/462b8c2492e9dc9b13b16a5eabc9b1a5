Environment CS Keriako Tobiko has put corporates that put profits top on the agenda at expense of environment on notice. "You employ 3,000 people but killing many. The National Environment Authority will mercilessly carry a crackdown on those who discharge waste into the environment," Tobiko said as he led the World Clean Up day at City Park. Tobiko who was accompanied by Environment PS Chris Kiptoo and Nema DG Mamo Mamo said the ministry is not about to relent in clearing up the mess. He urged industries dealing with single-use plastic bottles to up their game. "We have been discussing with Kepsa and KAM about single use plastic bottles but they have been taking us in circles, one excuse after the other. Don't force us to take the painful decision of banning plastic bottles like we did to single use plastic carrier bags," he said. He said the endless blame game must be stopped. Tobiko said Kenya Forest Service had taken over City Park from Nairobi County and is currently getting a facelift. "The park is historical as Kenya's second vice-president Joseph Murumbi and his wife are lying here," he said. Tobiko said restoration exercise is set to be completed in nine months. The World Clean Up Day is an annual event celebrated every third Saturday of September and is aimed at combating global solid waste problem including marine debris.
