Nakuru Governor Lee Kinyanjui has said Covid-19 has helped counties increase hospital bed capacity, acquire new equipment and employ more workers. “The pandemic was a wakeup call and in Nakuru, we have increased our bed capacity to 300, created more in the ICU and hired extra personnel,” he said. He challenged the national government to open up other sectors so that Kenyans could continue with their businesses. “The economy is hurting and it's time that people return to places of work as we have managed to contain the pandemic,” he said. Kinyanjui spoke after visiting the Sh300 million Naivasha outpatient hospital which is under construction by Kengen. He praised the power generation company and the contractor for being on schedule despite the challenges posed by the pandemic which had delayed works in other sectors. “This hospital when complete will go a long way in assisting hundreds of sick persons and we thank the President for issuing the directive for its construction,” he said. Kengen geothermal development director Abel Rotich said that the facility would be completed four months ahead of schedule. He noted that Kengen had contributed Sh300 million, the county government Sh30 million towards the ongoing works while the Ministry of Health would equip the ultra-modern facility. “The project was originally meant to be completed in October 2021 but due to diligent work from the contractor it shall be ready by June,” he said. He added that Kengen was keen on supporting neighbouring communities. “This hospital will not only support area residents but patients from neighbouring counties like Narok, Kiambu and Nyandarua,” he said. Viwandani MCA Eric Gichuki was full of praise for the outpatient hospital. “For years we have experienced congestion at the Naivasha Subcounty Hospital but under this partnership the issue of health for area residents will be fully addressed,” he said.
