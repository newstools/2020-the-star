Nominated Senator Naomi Shiyonga has asked the Senate to end the stalemate on revenue sharing so money can be released to counties. Shiyonga said she supports the one man, one vote, one shilling formula where funds are shared with more weight on population. “Revenue should be shared according to the population. Those with fewer numbers should accept that fact and move on with whatever the formula gives them,” Shiyonga said. She said the senators should think about Kenyans who need services. “This fighting in the Senate should end so that the money can come to the counties and help the people. There is no need for the money to stay in the National Treasury, while our people continue to suffer." Shiyonga spoke at the weekend in Webuye County Hospital where she visited Kaburengu accident victims. Twelve people died and scores were injured after a lorry ploughed into them at Kaburengu along the Eldoret-Webuye highway on August 24. Last week, a Senate committee formed to broker a deal on the contentious formula announced a breakthrough. The 12-member team made the announcement on Wednesday after eight days of intense negotiations on the third basis for sharing the national cake among the 47 devolved units. The panel did not disclose the contents of the final formula they have agreed, citing standing orders that bars it from making the disclosure. Edited by A.N
