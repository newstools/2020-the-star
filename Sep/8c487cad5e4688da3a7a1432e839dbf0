In spite of problems, Kenya has not been devastated by the Covid-19 pandemic as had been expected, Health CS Mutahi Kagwe has said. Speaking during the national Covid-19 conference at KICC on Monday, Kagwe said the disease has left Kenya stronger in numerous ways. "We must first appreciate that we have not experienced the apocalyptic projections we had for the disease," he said. "We have been saved from what was happening in Europe. We had very little capacity.." Kagwe said that Kenya has built substantial bed capacity, increased health workers among other measures. "I do not want to own the success. We now have 7,000 isolation beds from zero. It is not an individual effort," he said. Kagwe said Kenya has increased the number of public hospital ICU beds from 153 to 319, and isolation beds to 11,426 in both health and non health facilities. "Despite our preparedness, we found ourselves in the scramble for PPEs.. and running to protect our front liners," he said. President Uhuru Kenyatta is expected to announce the way forward for a post-Covid Kenya after the conference Leaders will give their views on the lessons learned in fighting the virus that can be used to reopen the country and move the country forward. The conference will begin with prayer by Archbishop Anthony Muheria, who is the chairperson of the Inter-Faith Council. The President will recognise heroes of the response (communities, governors, religious leaders, security, and transport agencies) The president is expected to rally the country around a shared vision to work towards a strong recovery and build on lessons from the crisis. Interior CS Fred Matiang’i will give his remarks, as will Senate Speaker Ken Lusaka.
