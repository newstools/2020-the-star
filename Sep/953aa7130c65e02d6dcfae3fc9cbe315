A 52-year-old landlord has been granted a Sh500,000 bond or alternative Sh300,000 bail after he pleaded not guilty to defiling and impregnating a 16-year-old. Julius Bogonko was arraigned on Monday in Mavoko, Machakos, following a public outcry after he was released from police custody under unclear circumstances a day after his arrest last Wednesday. Bogonko allegedly committed the offence at his residence in Katani. The court ordered that the suspect be remanded at the Kitengela GK Remand Prison in Kajiado county if he fails to raise the bond or bail. He was still under police custody as his relatives sought to process his car logbook to secure his release. The five months pregnant girl claimed she was defiled in March by Bogonko, while her two months pregnant sister blamed her pregnancy on Bogonko’s younger brother Wycliffe Mayieka, 30. The case is slated for hearing on October 1. The court issued an arrest warrant against Mayieka. Bogonko was arrested last Wednesday but released the following day, with police officers citing health grounds. Mayieka fled and is still on the run. The twins’ parents said they reported the matter at the Mlolongo police station following revelations by the children that their pregnancies resulted from defilement by the two brothers. It was recorded under OB NO: 42/25/8/2020 and OB NO: 43/25/8/2020. The sisters — Form 2 students — shocked their parents after they turned pregnant following several tests conducted in various health facilities. The pregnancies were confirmed by Kitengela Subcounty Hospital in Kajiado. Their father, a boda boda rider, said he took them to the hospital for verification after preliminary tests in local private clinics showed both were pregnant. According to medical reports dated August 26, 2020, both girls tested positive for pregnancies. However, HIV and STI tests returned negative results.
