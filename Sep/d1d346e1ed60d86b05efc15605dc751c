Meru Governor Kiraitu Murungi has castigated Kenyan institutions tasked with conducting investigations into theft of public funds Kiraitu said it makes no logic for Treasury to pay detectives to probe governors but does not aid in releasing county funds. “Why does Treasury fuel vehicles for inspectorates to come here now and then? If they are denying us money due to corruption, the national government has the biggest scandals. Why can’t Treasury obey court orders and release the 50 per cent of funds. Stop killing devolution,” Kiraitu said. Kiraitu said all national government functions have been running uninterrupted despite scandals and have never been grounded like counties that had not received money since June. He condemned senators for not resolving quicker the stalemate on revenue sharing. On Thursday, a 12-member Senate committee tasked with developing a win-win revenue formula announced it had reached a consensus. Several counties including Kiraitu’s had announced a shutdown on all operations for two weeks since September 17 to protest delays in disbursement of the funds. The Council of Governors through chairman Wycliffe Oparanya had declared that all devolved units were to suspend all non-essential functions until they receive the funds. “I am sad to announce shut down of all operations as guided by Meru county secretary Rufus Miriiti for the next two weeks unless funds are released. All workers will go home. The Senate must stop making unnecessary noise failing it roles of protecting counties interests,” Kiraitu said. Edited by R.Wamochie
