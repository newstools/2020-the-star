Two students from Busia want Governor Sospeter Ojaamong to help them buy a Sh20,000 blender to expand their fresh fruit juice business. Speaking to the Star at Budalang'i trading centre, the two - Annette Owala and Brandon Oundo - said they aim to become large-scale juice producers. Owala is undertaking a diploma course in cosmetology at the Kenya Institute of Professional Studies in Nairobi, while Brandon Oundo is a Form 4 student at Ambira Boys High School in Siaya county. They make juice from pineapple, watermelon, avocado, pawpaw and banana fruits. The duo said they came up with the idea three months ago after discovering there was high demand for fresh fruit juice in the area. "We informed our parents and close relatives about our plan to set up a fresh fruit juice business to keep us busy and meet our financial needs. They readily agreed to support us with funds that have enabled us to acquire a medium-sized blender," they said. The two students said if Ojaamong and other well-wishers support them with funds to acquire a bigger blender, they will be able to increase production. "We are therefore appealing to Governor Ojaamong to support us with grants to empower us to acquire a bigger blender that would enable us to increase production and earn more profit," Owala said.
