One person has died and 12 others are nursing injuries after renewed fighting in the Mariashoni area of Eastern Mau Forest, Njoro Sub County, The injured are receiving treatment at the Nakuru County Referral Hospital after they suffered arrow wounds on different parts of their bodies. One case with an arrow lodged in the eye has been referred to Kenyatta National Hospitals in Nairobi for specialised treatment. Nakuru County Commissioner, Erastus Mbui said tension was high in the area that has been experiencing recurrent ethnic clashes for the past three decades with the situation deteriorating by the day. The clashes that are caused by land disputes, cattle rustling, and competition are more frequent and intensive lately as there are nearly three incidents reported monthly. Mbui said more police officers were deployed to the area a month ago after eight people were killed, 83 injured and more than 198 houses torched in 10 villages of Mariashoni and Nesuit areas in late July this year. More than 3000 families were also displaced during the chaos that compelled the government to impose an impartial curfew in the area. Several other attacks have occurred since the July attack despite several peace meetings, increased security and the impartial curfew that lasted five days. “Security in the area still tight and today’s incident wash an ambush by one of the two rivaling communities within Mau,” he said. The administrator said the affected villages in the latest attack were Tritagoi, Sigaon and Sigotek.
