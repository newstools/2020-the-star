Three police officers attached to the Recce Squad were on Tuesday charged with violently robbing a businessman of Sh150,000. The three, Gideon Leyioyio, Kevin Omerikwa and Shallan Ouma denied the charges before Kibera senior resident magistrate Charles Mwaniki. They are accused of robbing George Olang' using force and threats on September 8 along the Eastern By-pass in Embakasi, Nairobi county. The trio is also accused of demanding money by menaces contrary to Section 302 of the Penal Code. Before they were charged, they told the court through their lawyer that the complainant who was present wanted to withdraw the case. However, court prosecutor Kimande James objected and told the court that he needed a clarification from the Director of Public Prosecutions office. Mwaniki thus ordered the case to proceed. The police allege the officers had been approached by the businessman, who sought their help to trace a man who had defrauded a third party of Sh823,000. The matter had been reported at the Kiambu police station under OB number 27/17/6/2020. Olang' handed the officers a photo of the person they were to look for. They traced the man and on arresting him, they sent his photo but they were told he was not the "wanted man". The prosecution says they then robbed the man of the cash under threat of violence. They were released on Sh500,000 bond or a bail of Sh200,000 each with a surety of the same amount. The case will be mentioned on October 14 before senior principal magistrate Derrick Kuto.
