Kenya Morans coach Cliff Owuor is pursuing France-based Joel Awich to bolster the teams front court during the 2021 Fiba Afro-Basket qualifiers in November. The national team head coach revealed that he has watched the player’s video clips and concluded that he is the kind of player he needs at the post. “Based on what I saw, Awich is big and dominant and can really help us down there. He loves contact and I need someone like that playing down there,” noted Owuor. The 6’7 ft player turns out for France Division NM1 club  Dax-Gamarde and plays both position 4 and 5. He is the son of former national women star Lynette Awich. Prior to joining Dax-Gamarde, Awich played in the minor leagues for Georgia Kingz and at Cal Poly where he graduated in 2017. Owuor said with Awich, Tom Wamukota who plays in Rwanda and Desmond Owili (Australia) in the team, the future looks bright. With the trio in the team, Owuor is convinced Morans have a strong chance of making it to next year’s championahip in Kigali, Rwanda. “I had discussions with Awich’s mother, who in based is the USA and she is very supportive of her son doning national team colours,” Owuor stated. An excited mother, who played for Kenya in the women Afro-Basket in Maputo, Mozambique in 1986, said his son would love to play for Kenya if all goes right. Lynette said his son already had talks with two other national team stars Peter Kiganya and Ronnie Gundo both of whom are in the USA and was upbeat. In an effort to build a formidable side, Owuor has also approached another USA-based player Preston Bungei and the prospects are good. “He is an explosive player, very positive and ready to come. He is versatile and plays three positions which is really good for us,” said the coach. Kenya will face off against host Senegal, Angola and Mozambique in the Group B qualifiers in November and another window in February.
