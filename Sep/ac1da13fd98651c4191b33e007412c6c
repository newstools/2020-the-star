University Education and Research PS Simon Nabukwesi on Thursday said many students have benefited from online classes being offered by universities and other institutions. Speaking during a preparedness inspection tour at Taita Taveta University, Nabukwesi said many students had enrolled for the virtual classes. He said Kenyans had not embraced online courses despite its existence even before coronavirus. “We acknowledge that some parts of the country experience low network coverage. Virtual learning has, however, benefited a large number of learners since learning institutions were closed in March,” he said. He lauded the institution’s readiness for gradual resumption of learning, further pointing out that the anticipated opening would benefit students who are unable to access online learning. The PS also launched a smart solar-powered hand washing machine and a mechanical and automated Covid-19 bed, both designed by the School of Mines and Engineering. The hand washing machine is set to help in combating the spread of coronavirus in the institution. “This is a great innovation that is going to serve the university’s community. The ministry is fully supporting such inventions that will eventually place Kenya in a global map,” the PS added. Ag Vice Chancellor Fred Simiyu said the innovators used locally produced materials in the spirit of empowering Kenyan manufacturers. “This is in line with the Buy Kenya, Build Kenya project and it is going to bring convenience in terms of cost, convenience and other factors that are likely to come in place,” Barasa said. He said the institution has further supported Jua Kali groups in Voi to make more mechanical beds for the coronavirus isolation centres. The university, he said, has fully rolled out online classes with first-year students expected to undergo online orientation. Edited by R.Wamochie
