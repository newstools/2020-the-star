Brighton & Hove Albion wing back Tariq Lamptey said the praise for his heroics in Sunday’s 3-0 win at Newcastle United in the Premier League will only drive him to work harder. Lamptey began brightly on the right flank and drew an early foul from Allan Saint-Maximin for a penalty that Neal Maupay converted, before releasing Leandro Trossard to provide the assist for the French forward’s second. The 19-year-old terrorised Saint-Maximin so much that Newcastle manager Steve Bruce switched him to the opposite flank, while former Liverpool defender and Sky Sports pundit Jamie Carragher declared on Twitter that he “loved” Lamptey. “I appreciate all the praise and I’m thankful for it but I have to keep working hard and keep focusing and putting in good performances for the team,” Lamptey, who was substituted in the 58th minute with a knock, told Sky Sports. “Yeah there were quite a few tackles but that’s football. You just have to keep getting up really. “It’s just great to get high praise from such fantastic ex-players. We won the game in the end, which was the main thing. We played good football at times and dug deep. It was good football, a good win.” Lamptey hailed Brighton boss Graham Potter’s impact on his development. “He’s a fantastic coach, especially for a young player like me,” the England under-21 international added. “The way he wants to play football is excellent. He has a clear project and we know exactly what he wants from us.” Potter said he was delighted with Lamptey’s performance. “He’s got such pace, he threatens the backline of the defence so well and then he does his own defensive work as well, he’s amazing,” Potter said. “I’ve spoken about his personality a lot, he just wants to improve, to learn, he’s so refreshing to work with.”
