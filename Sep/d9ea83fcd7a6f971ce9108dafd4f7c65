ANC party leader Musalia Mudavadi has urged the East Africa Church of God not to involve politicians in their power transitions. “Politicians like shortcuts in everything they do as much as is of their benefits,” Mudavadi said. Mudavadi was speaking at KIMA Mission where he joined the East Africa Church of God followers to eulogise the Late Archbishop Byrum Makokha. Mudavadi said the church has its own constitution that should guide them on transition matters without involving political class at any point. He said the church should serve as an example to unite itself for the sake of the late Archbishop. The late Archbishop died on 24th August while undergoing medication at Aga khan hospital. Among other leaders who joined Mudavadi to mourn the Iconic Archbishop were MPs led by area MP Chris Omulele. Others were Omboko Millemba (Emuhaya), Majority  Whip in National Assembly Emanuel Wangwe, Mwambu Mabonga (Bumula) ,Chris Aseka (Khwiselo), and Bernard Shinali (Ikolomani). Kakamega County Governor Wycliffe Oparanya, Kivuta kibwana of Makueni, ODM secretary general Edwin Sifuna, Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli among others were also present.
