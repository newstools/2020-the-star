Ugandan utility defender Yusuf Mukisa has joined Nairobi City Stars from Uganda top tier side, Proline. Mukisa, 27, signed a two-year contract. His earlier move to the KPL returnees in January 2020 failed to materialise. Team co-ordinator Samson Otieno welcomed the former Uganda Under-20 captain, saying he will solidify Simba wa Nairobi’s backline. “Mukisa is a utility back who is comfortable as a left, centre or right back. He is,  however, coming in to fill the right back position vacated by Kevin Okumu,”said Otieno He won the Ugandan league title with Vipers in the 2015/16 season. Mukisa expressed his excitement after joning the KPL side which is sponsored by the Jonathan Jackson Foundation. “We have been in contact for the past six months and I came over in January and trained with the team in Nairobi. I was impressed by the playing unit, coach,  structures and the feel good atmosphere around the team,” he told the club’s official website. He thanked the club’s chief executive officer Patrick Korir and  Otieno for their efforts in signing him. “City Stars have a great history and they are known for grooming Ugandan talent such as Danny Sserunkuma, Bruno Sserunkuma and Jimmy Bageya, among others.  I am happy to be part of this group. With the performances from last season, I’m certain the team will have a good season in both the Kenyan Premier League and domestic cup,” said the 27 year-old. During his youthful days, he captained Proline Academy which toured England courtesy of Manchester United legend Rio Ferdinand and returned with 2-0 and 3-2 wins over Manchester Academy and West Ham Academy, respectively. He featured for Proline at the Cecafa Club Championship and Caf Confederations Cup in 2019. Mukisa becomes the third player to join the main team after striker Erick Ombija from Gor  and defensive mid Sven Yidah from Kariobangi Sharks.
