DP William Ruto was conspicuously missing on Monday during the first session of the Covid-19 conference currently happening at KICC, Nairobi. Ruto was among those who were to attend the function alongside Pesident Uhuru Kenyatta and other government officials. But after the president arrived at around 2:20pm, it was clear that his deputy was a no-show. It was at this moment that the seat designated for him was quickly removed. In the front row were ODM leader Raila Odinga, Chief Justice David Maraga and Uhuru. It is not clear why the second in command did not make it to the conference even though his name was in the programme. According to the programme, Interior CS Fred Matiang’i will give his remarks, as will Senate Speaker Ken Lusaka. After Lusaka, Council of Governors chair Wycliffe Oparanya will make his remarks before ODM leader Raila Odinga takes the stage. Matiang’i was supposed to invite Ruto to make his remarks. Upon concluding his remarks, Ruto was to welcome the president to the stage who will address the nation at 6pm. The address by the president will unveil the containment measures that will guide Kenya into the new normal.
