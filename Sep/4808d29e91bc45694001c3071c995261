John Sibi-Okumu, Eddy Kimani and Shiviske Shivisi are some of the stars set to be part of  ‘The Schemer’, a mystery thriller scheduled to release later this year. The film by Dots Village Entertainment is set in Kitale and Kapenguria and is co-written by Kenyan filmmaker Peter Pages Bwire and Ugandan-American writer Nicole Magabo Kiggundu. Bwire is also producing the project alongside Indian creative producer Shristi Goswami. ‘The Schemer’ follows the tale of an enigmatic antique trader played by John Sibi-Okumu, who goes missing for three decades after hiding his last box of treasure, the Alpha Pack, somewhere in Kitale town. Pockets of influential people fight over the missing boxes. His family inevitably gets dragged into the thick of things. What follows is a series of unexpected events and encounters that push the otherwise idle town into action. The film will be Bwire’s directorial debut, and he describes the thriller as a plot-driven fiction story, a genre film with bits of factual events. “The film is written to reflect the cultural, racial and environmental heritage of Trans Nzoia county,” Bwire said, referring to the diversity of the characters his story is deeply rooted in. The team is also currently in talks with Ian Mbugua, an actor recently seen on stage in 'The Mousetrap' by Agatha Christie, for a promising role. Peter Bwire has vast experience in the film industry and previously worked as film production designer and producer in local short films, notably as a production designer in ‘Angles of My Face’ (2015), which won best East African short film at the Zanzibar International Film Festival.
