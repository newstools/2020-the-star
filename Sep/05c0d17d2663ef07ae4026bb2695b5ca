@Waithaka06 Laikipia Governor Ndiritu Muriithi has warned that the revenue sharing stalemate at the Senate risks eroding gains made by devolution. Muriithi said in his Nanyuki town office that the stalemate had starved counties of cash for almost three months and disrupted service delivery and development. He said the law allows the Treasury and Controller of Budget to disburse 50 per cent of the county allocation for last year but no funds were forthcoming to counties. “All we are seeing is a ping pong game between the Senate and the National Assembly on the division of revenue yet the lives of Kenyans are at risk. Health and other services suffer as each House blames the other,” Governor Muriithi said. Services in counties would shut down starting next week as there are no funds to run operations, he said. “Operations in counties will shut down next week not because Kenyans have not paid taxes, but because by using bureaucratic and other manoeuvres equitable share remains inaccessible to counties,” he said. There is a plot by powerful forces to kill devolution by starving counties of money for operations, he said. He urged Kenyans to stand up and reject the machinations aimed at killing devolution. “There is no doubt in anybody’s mind that devolution is what for the first time in independent Kenya has made citizens be proud of our country. We can build roads, bridges and health facilities that Kenyans had waited for, for over 50 years,” he said.
