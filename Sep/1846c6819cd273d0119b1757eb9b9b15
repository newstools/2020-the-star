ODM leader Raila Odinga has asked counties to find and expand their sources of revenue to reduce their dependence on the national government. Raila said the cash collected and distributed by the national government is not enough for the counties to properly develop. According to the law, sources of revenue for counties are diverse. They include revenue received from the national government, revenue generated locally, and revenue from external sources The county governments require revenue to implement their functions. Therefore, it is important that the devolved units have adequate resources and sources of revenue. County governments are, however, still blowing billions of shillings on dubious projects that deny the public much-needed services. The Auditor General's reports since the introduction of devolution have shown widespread financial anomalies, unsustainable projects and imprudent ventures. They have also revealed a litany of dead projects and suspect procurement not supported by documentation. Indeed, a number of governors are in court answering corruption charges. County governments must address these issues if they hope to make a difference in the lives of their people.
