Seven years after the death of former Makueni Senator Mutula Kilonzo, an inquest has ruled out any foul play. In a ruling dated September 15, Senior resident Magistrate B Bartoo ordered the closure of the matter saying there is no evidence of any cover-up. “I hereby order that this inquest in line with section 386 of the criminal procedure code be closed with no further police action unless any new evidence is unearthed,” the magistrate held. The magistrate added: “The family of the deceased and indeed many Kenyans treated this death with a lot of suspicions, it is important to note that there was no evidence presented pointing a finger to any individual.” The magistrate noted that an independent pathologist, Dr Ian Galder from the UK did not testify or send a report alluding to the alleged interference with the samples. “It is indeed sad that we lost a dedicated servant to the republic in the manner it may. I have evaluated all the evidence presented to the court through this inquest and I am in agreement with the state that there is no evidence pointing to any person(s) having a hand in the cause of death of the late Hon Mtula Kilonzo,” the court ruled. Mutula was found dead in his bed at Kwa Kyelu Ranch on April 27, 2013, by his workers. A government report later revealed that the former lawyer and senator died of massive bleeding caused by high blood pressure. His family, however, led by his son and current Makueni Senator Mutula Kilonzo Junior doubted the theory and claimed cover-up into his sudden death. During the inquest hearing about 15 witnesses among them his employees and family, together with doctors and police officers testified. Mutula Junior said he was called to the ranch after a cook, Mulwa Mulee, told the ranch manager, Shadrack Mwaniki that “chairman” appeared dead.
