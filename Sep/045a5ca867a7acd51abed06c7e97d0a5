Maendeleo Chap Chap party leader Alfred Mutua has told politicians to stop spewing ugly words that divide Kenyans. The Machakos governor and presidential candidate said on Thursday that Kenya yearns for peace to enable development. "These noises [ugly political speech] every now and then and insults are primitive. It's an indication of people who don't understand the purpose of stability and civilisation," Mutua said. He spoke during the burial in Kisumu for the brother of former Cabinet minister Robert Ouko. Politicians must be at the forefront in promoting peace and harmonious coexistence, not in dividing and inciting people, Mutua said. The Machakos governor said the current politicking countrywide is setting Kenyans against each other. "This work of politics is a service. We should not get too excited and desperateÂ  about it," Mutua said. "We want leaders to build the nation, bring Kenyans together and calm them down," he said. "Let's cool down our temperatures." Mutua said development depends on stability. The governor said the 22 General Election is two years away and politicians should tone down their rhetoric and deliver services. Tribalism is creeping into Kenya and must be eliminated, Mutua said, adding that people must live as brothers and sisters without attacks based on tribe. (Edited by V. Graham)
