Upcoming artistes have been urged to sign up with the Kenya Film Commission to benefit from free production of their content through the Studio Mashinani programme. Commission's chief executive officer Timothy Odhiambo said they have a directory to help expose local artistes to the national and international market. The commission also has an online portal that helps market local content. “The government also started the Kalasha festivals to bring content creators closer to buyers and appreciating local productions,” Odhiambo said. He spoke in Gatanga on Friday during the graduation ceremony of over 100 budding artistes who underwent a five-day training in production, film and sound editing and acting in preparation for the Sh25 million studio being established in the constituency. The CEO said the commission is in the process of putting in place co-production arrangements between Kenya and other countries. It is also working on incentives that will make the country competitive and attract international producers to make their films here. Before producers decide on a favourable location, the CEO said, they consider several factors including crew availability, communication barriers, accessibility and money transfer systems available. He said the country ranks high as a production hub on the African continent as it fulfils most of the requirements. MP Nduati Ngugi said he appealed to the President to establish the studio during the burial of musician John De'Mathew to support budding artistes. The President agreed to set up the studio in Kirwara. It is set to be completed in 10 weeks. “This is why my CDF partnered with KFC to train the artistes for five days on good quality production. This training sets an example that youths are ready to learn and improve themselves,” he said. Edited by A.N
