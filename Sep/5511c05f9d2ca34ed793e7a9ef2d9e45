Property worth millions of shillings was lost following a fire incident at the Kisii county assembly on Friday. The cause of the fire is yet to be determined. Speaker David Kombo called on the relevant authorities to do a forensic audit. "We have lost millions and we don't have an assembly now," he said. The Assembly gallery and the entire broadcasting section has been burnt down. Govenor James Ongwae visited the scene and also called for investigations into the matter.
