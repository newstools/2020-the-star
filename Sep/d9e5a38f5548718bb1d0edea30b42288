Kiambu Woman Representative Gathoni Wamuchomba on Tuesday tore into LSK President Nelson Havi, accusing him of disrespecting women. The MP accused Havi of belittling women and lording over leaders yet he is holding an office of high repute. Wamuchomba took offence with a comment made by the LSK chairman to the effect that he (Havi) alleged he could not share a podium with MPs. “I feel that we should not treat the LSK as special. The LSK President has held a lot of contempt for members of Parliament,” the Kiambu Woman MP said. “If he cannot hold a discussion in a television panel with an elected MP like me, then even his submissions here don’t make sense,” she said. “I should not sit to discuss with him if he feels I am daft, downtrodden and misunderstand the matters of law. I deserve respect. I am sorry. You have to give me space and treat women with respect,” Wamuchomba said. Kajiado East MP Peris Tobiko weighed in on the matter, saying the LSK boss’ actions and utterances were regrettable. The lawmakers made the assertions during a public participation hearing on the National Aviation Management Bill, 2020, where Havi was a participant. The LSK president, for his part, said there was nothing wrong in them raising issues on matters of administrative justice and legislation. “When you give your criticism, just be as good as you expect people to be good to you when criticizing others,” Havi said, inviting the two leaders for representation should they need his services. Havi has been a voice in the call for the dissolution of Parliament in the face of the advisory by Chief Justice David Maraga to President Uhuru Kenyatta. Mandera North MP Abdullah Bashir warned that the issue of discussing Havi’s actions amounted to a deviation from the core issues that informed the meeting.
