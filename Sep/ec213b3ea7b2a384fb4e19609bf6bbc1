Kenya Premier League returnees Nairobi City Stars have completed their third signing of the season by confirming the arrival of defensive midfielder Ronny Kola Oyaro, 20. Oyaro, joins the Jonathan Jackson Foundation-sponsored team  from lower tier side, Kenya School of Government, a club that made the semis of the Nairobi region Chapa Dimba na Safaricom finals in February at Jamhuri High School. He becomes the third signing at Simba wa Nairobi in the current transfer window after Rowland Makati from Vapor Sports and Timothy Ouma from Laiser Hill Academy. The three are the fresh entrants among the five developmental players being roped in for the upcoming season. “Oyaro has very impressive midfield defensive qualities that our scouts noted while he was playing at Chapa Dimba,” said team coordinator Samson Otieno. He added: “He is a good addition to our setup and we are now giving him a platform to further develop his skills at City Stars. We welcome him on board.” Oyaro told the club’s official website: “It has been my dream to feature for a big club and it therefore excites me to join City Stars.” He added: “First is to thank KSG for nurturing my skills over time and I want to make full use of the chance granted to me by City Stars to up my game to the highest level. I thank them for handing me this rare opportunity.” City Stars chief executive officer, Patrick Korir, says he is eagerly waiting for the team to start training. “Managing players you don’t get to meet or converge them at one point is proving tough for teams,” said Korir.
