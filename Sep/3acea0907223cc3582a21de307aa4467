Following the death of celebrated black actor Chadwick Boseman popularly know as the 'The Black Panther', Netflix has decided to delay a virtual preview event for the film Ma Rainey's Black Bottom. This was announced after the world received news that Chadwick had succumbed to colon cancer at the age of 43. This film will be his final movie performance, which is an adaptation of August Wilson's play, about the queen of the blues and her band in the 1920s. Speaking after the death of Boseman, whom many termed as a black super hero, Netflix' boss Ted Sarandos described Chadwick as a superhero on screen and in life. "It's impossible to imagine working at the level he has while valiantly battling his illness," Ted said in a statement. "His legacy as a person and an artist will inspire millions. Our thoughts and prayers are with him and his family during this difficult time," he added. He died at home in Los Angeles with his family by his side. HeÂ had not spoken publicly about his diagnosis. "A true fighter, Chadwick persevered through it all, and brought you many of the films you have come to love so much," his family said in the statement. "From Marshall to Da 5 Bloods, August Wilson's Ma Rainey's Black Bottom and several more - all were filmed during and between countless surgeries and chemotherapy. It was the honour of his career to bring King T'Challa to life in Black Panther." Boseman first came to prominence playing real-life figures - baseball great Jackie Robinson in 2013's 42, and musician James Brown in 2014's Get on Up. However, it will be as the titular Black Panther in the blockbuster 2018 film he will be best remembered.
