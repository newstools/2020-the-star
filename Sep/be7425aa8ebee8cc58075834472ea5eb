Lawyers in Meru have protested the shooting of a colleague in his office in Maua town, Igembe South constituency. Kirimi Mbogo was attacked on Wednesday evening by unknown assailants who escaped on a motorcycle after shooting him in the stomach at close range. The lawyer is currently receiving treatment at a local hospital after undergoing successful surgery. Law Society of Kenya President Nelson Havi paid Kirimi a visit. About 100 lawyers demonstrated on Friday and marched to DCI offices in Maua and later went to the law courts. Meru Bar Association chairman Keneth Muriuki said lawyers should not be intimidated in their line of duty. Muriuki said police should investigate the case and arrest the culprits. He said that a while ago, Kirimi escaped after his vehicle was burnt down as he went to tour clients' land. Kirimi was representing some clients in a disputed parcel of land in Igembe. “We suspect maybe he might have been shot because of this. Maybe someone is not happy with his articulation,” Muriuki said. Muriuki said Kirimi should be provided with security and a thorough investigation done. Most cases in Meru and Tharaka Nithi were rescheduled as the advocates held a protest in solidarity. Mbogo was rushed to Maua Methodist Hospital before being transferred to Kiirua Hospital. Igembe South police boss Henry Akang’o assured the lawyers they will do thorough investigations. Lawyer Michael Ngunjiri said it was not the first time a lawyer had been attacked, adding that the case should be treated as serious. Edited by R.Wamochie
