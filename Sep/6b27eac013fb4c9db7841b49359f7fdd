A Kibera court has granted a man who allegedly caused another grievous bodily harm a cash bail of Sh100,000. Detectives failed to prove to the court why they wanted to detain him longer. In an affidavit filed before Kibera senior principal magistrate Philip Mutua, police constable Zacharia Situma requested the court to allow him to detain Vincent Omondi  Moeni for five days at Dandora police station so as to complete investigations. Moeni, the officer told court, inflicted deep head injuries on James Bibol who is the complainant. "On August 27, the respondent beat up the complainant and inflicted head injuries. He is currently at Mama Lucy Hospital in unstable condition," he told court. Situma said five days would be enough for him to complete the investigation. But the respondent told court that he had overstayed in the police custody. "I request the honourable court to detain the respondent for five working days so that I complete my investigations,” Situma told court. However, the magistrate ruled that the respondent had been held at the police station for long and granted him Sh 100,000 bail. The magistrate also ruled that the respond appear to the investigator any time they need him. The matter will be mentioned on September 14. Edited by Henry Makori
