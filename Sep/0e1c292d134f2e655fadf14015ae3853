Top flight returnees Nairobi City Stars continued with bolstering their squad as they confirmed the acquisition of striker Erick Ombija from champions Gor Mahia on a two-year deal. The 25-year-old becomes the latest arrival at the Kawangware outfutit and the fifth in the current transfer window after youngsters  Rowland Makati from Vapor Sports, Timothy Ouma (Laiser Hill Academy), Ronney Kola Oyaro (Kenya School of Government) and keeper Elvis Ochieng Ochoro (Hakati Sportiff). Ombija has an envious scoring record having scored 11 times in the National Super League (NSL) in the 2018 season and 17 goals in the just ended 2019/20 season while on loan from Gor Mahia. “He’s a proven goal scorer and is a good addition and firepower to our striking department,” said team coordinator Samson Otieno said on the club’s official portal. “He has been a long term target and we are happy to welcome him to Simba wa Nairobi. He gives us extra options upfront and is a great boost to the team,” he said. Prior to departing to his homeland in Taita Taveta after putting pen to paper, Ombija shared his reasons in joining City Stars. “My decision to join City Stars comes at the right time and I am glad to join the Lions Pride and be part of a team which will challenge for the title,” he said. “I am happy to join the likes of Muki (Anthony Kimani), Pinchez (Peter Opiyo), (Oliver) Maloba and many more talented players at City Stars,” he said. Ombija will don his favourite jersey No. 24 and will be contesting for the No. 9 position with Gambian marksman Ebrima Sanneh, Ezekiel Odera, Kaimosi High alumnus Davis Agesa and teenager Vincent Jamaica Otieno.
