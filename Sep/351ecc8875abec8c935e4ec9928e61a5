Kenyatta National Hospital health workers on Monday began their strike over salaries. The workers carried placards as they protested in front of the hospital. With no adherence to social distancing rule, the workers who were wearing masks while removing sang as they demanded their pay. "We will not accept the SRC to take us round and round," one worker said as they sang 'when the devil comes we will be ready'. Speaking to KTN News, secretary-general Seth Panyako said they resorted to strike because the SRC had decided to behave like it is the only institutional body in the country. "The money that we are talking about has been approved..no going back. We want SRC to give a letter advising KNH on payment, thereafter, the strike will be called off," he said. Panyako said the Treasury had already released the money and Parliament had approved the Sh601 million. "... the only problem is that SRC does not want Kenyatta to implement the salary review process. We will not have any engagements until we receive a letter from SRC," he added. SRC says re-categorization did not involve a salary review. The health workers vowed to down their tools on Monday if SRC doesnâ€™t review their salaries in accordance with the new salary structure submitted to the commission in 2012. The employees are accusing the SRC of failing to honour the implementation of the new salary structure eight years down the line.
