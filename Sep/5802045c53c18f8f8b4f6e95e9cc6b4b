Former news anchor Louis Otieno has announced that he will be making a comeback to the screens after regaining his hearing. In a video that has since gone viral, Louis said that he would like to talk to Kenyans as the country is going through a difficult time. "I plan to be back with a program called "The Second Act". This has taken a lot of work and it's happening because certain people have put together their time, money, effort and they want to see me back to talk to you because the country has been going through a difficult time and when this happens I'd like to talk to people who are going through the difficult decisions," he said. Louis had been missing from screens after he announced that he was deaf. About two years ago, he appealed to Kenyans to help him raise funds to help him undergo cochlear implant surgery. He has now decided to once again grace our screens with his talks and interviews. "When this happens I would like to talk to people who deal with the difficult decisions and get answers for you from them. Before I even start to meet these people I must give thanks to you, the Kenyans, because I reached out to the country and you came out, and you made your effort because you wanted me back," he said. He also pointed out that the show will deal with current affairs that are affecting Kenyans among them the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI), the expected referendum and political intrigues shaping the 2022 General Elections among other things. However, he did not disclose where his show will air. In 2018, aÂ court recommended fresh investigations into Louis Otieno's link to the death of Careen Chepchumba. Former Kibera senior resident magistrate Charles Ondieki, concluded that Careen's death was not by suicide. The court further ruled that the cause of Careens death was not accidental, agreeing with the state pathologists' conclusion that the woman was strangled.
