Many families in Karanjee village in Limuru constituency have been sleeping on empty stomachs because of lack of food. The families, most of whom depend on casual jobs at the neighbouring Tigoni estate, said since the outbreak of Covid-19 in the country they have been unable to secure work . They now want the government to give them food or at least come up with a strategy of lowering food prices. Lovely Children International programmes coordinator Wycliffe Msayu on Tuesday urged the government to give residents relief food, since some are starving. "We have people with small children who are sleeping on empty stomachs. The government needs to chip in and help them." Resident John Kimani said he has been jobless after the firm he was working for sent him and other home. "We used to get weekly wages, then we were told to go home. We have sold all our livestock to buy food and there is nothing more left to sell,‚Äù he said. Tigoni assistant county commissioner Peter Mose said many families in Karanjee village are suffering since most live in rental houses. "Many of them lost their jobs," Mose said. Resident Joshua Virebwa said now that the economy is reopening, they hope to get jobs.
