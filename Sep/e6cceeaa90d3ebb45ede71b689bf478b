Kisumu Governor Anyang' Nyong'o will Thursday launch Maseno town. The move is aimed at unlocking untapped economic fortunes of the area and its environs. The event will be held at Agriculture Training Centre in Maseno. Located in Kisumu West subcounty, Maseno is among five urban centres that were elevated to towns in a gazette notice dated March 1, 2019. Others are Ahero in Nyando, Muhoroni and Kombewa (Seme) and Katito in Nyakach. Nyong'o said the elevation of the centres to towns would enable them to access financing from development partners. According to the Constitution, an area shall be eligible for the grant of the status of a town if it has a population of at least 10,000 residents and can demonstrate economic, functional and financial viability. The areas must have an integrated development plan, the capacity to effectively and efficiently deliver essential services to residents and have sufficient space for expansion. Residents have welcomed the upgrade, saying this will increase business opportunities. Earlier this week, Urban Development CEC Dixon Obungu said Maseno town will be headed by a town administrator who will be in charge of the day-to-day management. Since the centre has grown as a result of Maseno University and Maseno School, Obungu said most of the facilities will be aligned to complement the learning institution. He said they are considering building a research centre and light industries to support thousands of residents who live in the fast-growing town. Edited by A.N
