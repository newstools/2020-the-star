Former Sports CS Rashid Echesa's Range Rover has finally been released. Echesa went to Milimani law courts on Monday to have it inspected before he took it. The Office of the DPP had unsuccessfully attempted to have the vehicle and two firearms withheld from the former CS. However, the court in July ruled that there is no legal justification for the continued detention of the vehicle. Echesa was charged in February with six counts of making a false document in the Sh39.5 billion fake arms deal among other offences.
