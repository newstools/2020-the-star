The head of state and the envoys also spoke about the peace process in the Republic of Sudan and commended president Kiir for his diplomatic engagements which led to the Juba Peace Process. The hallmark of the Juba talks will be the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement on October 3rd this year between the Government of Sudan and the Sudanese Revolutionary Front (SRF).
