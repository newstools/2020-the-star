 A Nyamira legislator has denied he misappropriated Sh2 million donated to two schools by Deputy President William Ruto. Shadrack Mose, the Kitutu Masaba representative on Monday said he had clear instructions from the DP on how he should release the money to the institutions. He was also supposed to top up the donation with funds from the NG-CDF kitty. Mose was reacting to parents' accusation that he squandered the money Ruto donated in 2018 for the construction of classrooms at Ikonge Secondary and Primary schools. On Monday, he released Sh3 million to the two schools and Sh1 million each to 11 neighbouring schools for construction of classrooms and other forms of development. He said the construction will be done ahead of the reopening of schools. Learning was disrupted by Covid-19 in March. “My intention to withhold the money was positive, contrary to what the parents are saying. I plan to give them more money from the CDF kitty so that they can construct at least four classrooms in each school,” Mose said at Irianyi Primary School. The legislator warned school management boards against misusing resources. “I will deal with any school administrator who misuses or misappropriates the funds that the government has given for the development of the institutions. These funds should be used in the right manner and the money must be accounted for,” Mose said. He accused his political opponents of using parents to taint his image. "These are just a few people who want to taint my name by politicising everything that I do. No time will be wasted in listening to them because all I want to do is work for the people who elected me to represent them in Parliament,” he said.  Edited by P.O
