@robertomollo3 A search for three fishermen who went missing a fortnight ago is ongoing in Suba North, Homa Bay county. The trio — Kennedy Omondi, 38, Brian Juma, 22, and William Otieno, 28— had been fishing in Lake Victoria but never returned home. Residents suspect they were involved in an accident. The wreckage of their canoe has been located near Goziba Island by fishermen in Tanzania, but the men, who were based on Ringiti Island, have not been found. They left their island for a fishing expedition across the border. Suba subcounty beach management unit chairman William Onditi expressed fear that the fishermen could have drowned when their boat capsized. “We have been in agony for two weeks now trying to locate the men. Their whereabouts are still unclear because their mobile phones are switched off,” he said. Subcounty police commander Charles Mwangi said his office has been informed of the missing fishermen. “I cannot confirm whether the fishermen are dead or not. What I know is that a report has been made to my office about them. We are working with locals to locate where they are,” he said. Homa Bay beach management unit chairman Edward Oremo urged Kenya Maritime Authority to help them in the search. Oremo appealed to fishermen to put on lifesavers whenever they get into the lake. “We appeal to Kenya Maritime Authority to expeditiously involve in the search to enable us get our colleagues. Let’s not forget putting on our life jackets to avoid risks,” Oremo said, also urging their colleagues from Tanzania to help.  Edited by F'Orieny
