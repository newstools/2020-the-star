The Nairobi Metropolitan Services has issued a statement in which it says it regrets the incident where a mother delivered outside the gates of Pumwani Hospital. The Director of Health Services, NMS Josephine Kibaru Mbae on Saturday said that it has since been confirmed that the incident took place on September 13, 2020. This was two days after nurses began a legally notified 'go slow' which has since ended after NMS and the health workers agreed on a return-to-work formula. Even then, essential services were being offered at the Facility. "The security guard denied the patient access to the premises in a very unfortunate incident before a nurse from the maternity ward was notified of the occurrence and rushed to the scene to assist in the delivery and admission to the maternity ward," Mbae said. She said that NMS commends the nurses who quickly came to assist the patient adding that the mother and child are both well and were discharged on 18th September 2020. Mbae further added that NMS commits to training front office staff in all its facilities. The security team has been changed and a customer care desk set up. "Going forward officers from the National Police Service will augment the provision of security at the Pumwani Hospital, Mbagathi Hospital, Mama Lucy Hospital and Mutuini Hospital in Dagoretti to prevent disruption of services," she said. "We take this opportunity to apologise to all Kenyans and our mothers in particular for this unfortunate incident."
