Tension was high in Migori town ahead of Tuesday's reopening of the assembly and the start of Governor Okoth Obado's impeachment process. On Monday, ODM ward reps supporting the impeachment motion said they were ready to start the process on Tuesday. However, a team supporting Obado has been holding meetings and press conferences to look for ways to convince their colleagues to drop the bid. South Sakwa MCA and majority leader Ken Ouma said the impeachment process would go on as planned. “We are beginning the process on Tuesday and the office of the majority leader will ensure it passes,” he told the Star on the phone on Monday. Ouma said starting the process would allow speaker Boaz Okoth to slot a date for debate and the governor to defend himself. “On Tuesday, we will begin the process, but so far the house business committee is yet to meet. We have orders from the party which we will follow. We call on residents to let members do their duties in peace,” he said. Migori ODM chairman Philip Makabong’o and county secretary Joseph Michael led a meeting of all party officials across the eight subcounties at the ODM offices to help solidify their numbers. “We are confident we will attain the minimum of 38 MCAs to impeach Obado. We have moved smoothly and believe it will sail through,” he said. The two teams want security to be heightened in the town as the impeachment motion starts. At the weekend, the Ministry of Interior made drastic changes and replaced Migori county police boss Celestino Nyaga and several other police officers. On Monday, when journalists tried to get briefing on the changes, the officers were in a security meeting at county commissioner Boaz Cherutich’s office. Edited by A.N
