Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua has announced his 2022 presidential run with a pledge on a fresh start and job creation. "It is time for Kenya to usher in a new dispensation...a new period of better leadership and life. We need a new way of thinking, of doing things and a new type of leaders," he said. "The Kenyan Computer has frozen. ... Kenya needs a reset â€“ a reboot. We need to start afresh. We need to change the way things are done and the way leaders serve. We need something new." Speaking on Sunday, Mutua said Kenyans are tired of a system that has over the years let them down. "Today, the truth is, Kenyans are fed up. I am Fed up and I know you are also fed up. Kenya is a great country and God loves us but our style of politics and the way we chose leaders has made us continue to suffer," he said. "We have become a country of a few billionaires and millions of poor, struggling, unemployed and desperate people." Mutua said he has agonized about the pain and the political circus going in Kenya. "I, therefore, declare that in the General Elections of 2022, I, Alfred Nganga Mutua, will vie to be the next President of the Republic of Kenya so as to return Kenya to the railway tracks of where we were meant to be after independence," he said. "I am ready to press the reboot button. I am ready to give Kenya a new, fair, organized, caring, rich country of happy people." He said that Kenya needs a young, dynamic, innovative but mature leader. "A person who understands the system but is not a captive of the system. Kenyans do not want politics. Kenyans want a doer. We are tired of government plans that never get implemented," he said. "When you support me, you will be supporting someone who is tried and tested. ..I understand the dynamics of governance and real development." Mutua said he will build roads and highways in every constituency. "Our education will produce young and dynamic citizens who will find jobs waiting for them," he said.
