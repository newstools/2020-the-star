Kitui County Governor Charity Ngilu on Saturday censored Deputy President William Ruto’s allied MPs for hailing insults directed towards Kenya’s founding First Lady Mama Ngina Kenyatta. Ngilu said tainting President Uhuru Kenyatta’s mother was a not only immoral and reckless but crazy and uncouth act. She pointed out politicians should endeavor to retrain themselves from insults and instead of the toll the line of soberness in politicking. Ngilu spoke in Kitui town when she launched the improvement and expansion of the Genery- Kaveta B7 road that straddles Kitui town. "Political leaders must refrain from using abusive language. It is crazy and uncouth to hurl insults to the person of the respectful founding first lady of Kenya-Mama Ngina Kenyatta," said Ngilu. The governor’s sentiments came at a time when there was condemnation across the country with leaders demanding an apology from Ruto for what they termed as offensive utterances from his political allies. Emurua Dikirr MP Johanna Ng’eno and his Kapseret counterpart Oscar Sudi’s recent utterances that were regarded as an insult to top members of the Kenyatta's family. Ng’eno has already been charged in court while Sudi is under the radar of investigators. Ngilu at the same time poured scorn on Kitui leaders who are obsessed with criticising her style of doing development. She said that her mind is focused on growing the county to prosperity and not engaging in premature politicking. The governor emphasised that she would not abandon her agenda for Kitui and delve in early election campaign politics. “I will not be derailed by people who have nothing to do. I was elected to serve and that's where my focus is", Ngilu said.
