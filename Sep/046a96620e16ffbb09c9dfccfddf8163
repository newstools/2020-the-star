A man who allegedly broke into a neighbour’s house and defiled a 14-year-old girl has been charged. James Thuo denied the charges before Makadara senior principal magistrate Angelo Kithinji on Friday. The court heard that Thuo defiled the child on the night of September 9 at Ruai in Njiru subcounty, Nairobi. He is also faced with an alternative count of committing an indecent act with a child. According to documents before court, the girl was at a neighbour’s house where she has been sleeping since July. The victim was woken up by the voice of a man who ordered her to keep quiet. The masked man then proceeded to the neighbour who was sleeping on a sofa, held a knife to her throat and demanded he give her all her money or he would kill her. The woman pointed him to the top of a refrigerator. The man grabbed the money then went back to the child, dragged her to the carpet and defiled her. He threatened to stab the two if they do not cooperate. When he was done he walked out and as he passed under a security light the two identified him as one of their neighbours by his clothes. The neighbour followed the man undetected and noted the house he entered. She then called the girl's parents, who also live in the same neighbourhood, and told them about the attack. The girl's father kept watch at the assailant's house as an ambulance took his daughter to Mama Lucy Kibaki Hospital. The assault was reported at Ruai police station and the officers arrested Thuo. Kithinji freed him on Sh300,000 bond with a similar surety. The matter will be heard on February 17. Edited by Josephine M. Mayuya
