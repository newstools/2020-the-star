The TSC has directed teachers to return to school by Monday next week. Teachers Service Commission CEO Nancy Macharia made the announcement on Monday following a meeting among stakeholders at the Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development to map out reopening of learning institutions. Macharia said teachers will ensure that learners recover the lost time. “Teachers are free to report back to school anytime from now until Monday in readiness for when schools reopen,” she said. Present during the meeting were officials from the Ministry of Education, Kenya National Union of Teachers, Kuppet, religious leaders, medical unions, parents and school heads associations. On when schools will reopen, Education CS George Magoha said, “We are waiting for the larger stakeholders' meeting which will be before September 28 to endorse the recommendations reached today.” However, Magoha gave a go-ahead to final year students in universities and taking courses that could require physical engagement to report back to school. The students will be required to observe guidelines put in place to stem the spread of the coronavirus. The government through President Uhuru Kenyatta closed all schools after the outbreak of Covid-19 in March. Since then, schools have grown grass and turned bushy while some have dilapidated infrastructure. “Let teachers do everything possible to make schools have a good atmosphere for learning. Children will resume learning as soon as possible,” Magoha said last Friday at Mawego Technical Training Institute in Karachuonyo. He had said the reopening of schools will begin with national examination classes before it is cascaded to other classes at different levels.
