Gospel singer Joyce Omondi was yesterday made the Kenyan brand ambassador of Uhai Haircare. Uhai and Joyce will collaborate and work together for the distribution, design, content, promotion and marketing of Uhai’s award-winning haircare products in the Kenyan market. Joyce is the wife to Citizen TV's Waihiga Mwaura, and she says she is thrilled to join the Uhai family. "I look forward to helping my audience achieve their own hair care goals by experiencing these great quality products at an affordable price," she said "Uhai’s brand was born right here in Kenya a few years ago. So, it’s such an honour for me to be part of its homecoming in celebrating our strong, beautiful, African hair."
