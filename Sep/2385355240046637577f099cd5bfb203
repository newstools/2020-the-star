The Kenya Medical Supplies Authority (Kemsa) procured items relating to Covid-19 worth Sh7.6 billion despite getting an approval of Sh758.6 million. Documents (below) seen by the Star show that in April, Health Principal Secretary Susan Mochache wrote to the suspended Kemsa CEO Jonah Manjari indicating the list of supplies the country needed. Mochache told Manjari that an approval of Sh758.6 million had been made following funds received from the World Bank. The document shows that Kemsa had already made emergency procurement of various supplies costing billions of shillings before receiving the letter by Mochache. However, the list shows that several suppliers were issued with commencement letters after the April 15 letter from Mochache with documents showing that all that was procured was delivered. Following the development, Kemsa is now stuck with Sh6.2 billion worth of goods it is seeking MPs help to dispose. Curiously, the letter from the Ministry contained an annex of suppliers with estimated costs - some higher than what the list shows Kemsa  had procured the same items at. The procurement queries are now at the centre of an investigation by the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission following concerns that the taxpayer could have lost money in inflated tenders. At least five politicians, top government officials and directors of 50 companies  linked to the Kemsa scandal are expected to be questioned at EACC headquarters on Monday. The Star has established that the Commission is pursuing politicians from both the ruling Jubilee party and the Opposition.
