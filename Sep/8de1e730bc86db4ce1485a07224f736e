The Jubilee Party has announced it will not field a candidate in the Msambweni by-election. The seat was left vacant following the death of ODM MP Suleiman Dori. Jubilee said with its recent cooperation with ODM, it saw it fit not to field a candidate. It also said the country faces serious issues currently following CJ David Maraga's call for the dissolution of Parliament for failing to legislate laws to implement the gender rule. "The country has very serious constitutional matters to deal with that will require sobriety and reaching across the political divides in order to navigate our beloved country across some of these challenges," Tuju said. He further added, "This announcement has been made in good time so that any aspirant who has interest in a Jubilee ticket still has other pathways to running for the seat." The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission was compelled to set a date for the elections after residents threatened to stage huge demonstrations. IEBC has pushed the voting date to December 15 after the initial by-election date in June was postponed due to the unprecedented Covid-19 pandemic. Candidates had taken to campaigns on social media with hope that the virus would soon pass. At least 10 candidates showed interest in the seat. ODM party leader Raila Odinga said opinion polls will be used to pick a "perfect" candidate for the upcoming by-election. Raila on September 12 said the use of polls will enhance fairness in the nomination process. He said they also want to speed up the selection process to give the party ample time for campaigns. Raila said the party will not favour any aspirant but listen to the voices of the majority of the electorate. “No one will be chosen by the party. We want transparency and justice so that we can prove to our rivals that Msambweni is indeed an ODM stronghold,” Raila said.
