Two suspects have been arrested for burglary and 81 assorted mobile phones recovered in Kisumu county. Daniel Chimota 28, and Samuel Yassin 27, were arrested at Monalisa Guest house within Kisumu CBD on Monday night. County police commander Ranson Lolmodooni said the two who are Kakamega residents, had booked a room at the guest house on Monday at 9 pm. Later on during the night, the two allegedly broke into a Kenshop Limited shop and stole the phones. The shop is located on the Oginga Odinga Street adjacent to the guest house. "...the suspects were arrested following a report by the JRS Security control room of a continuing crime being committed," Lolmodooni said. He said police officers who were on patrol were activated and responded promptly by cordoning the entire place. “On close scrutiny, it was established that the breaking had been done from the guest house,” Lolmodooni said. A search was then done at the guest house and the suspects who were in room 301, were nabbed. “We expect to take them to court today. They will be charged with burglary and stealing,” Lolmodooni said. The police boss said the backdoor of the shop had been broken into and mobile phones of unknown value stolen. He noted that the arrest and recovery was a breakthrough in combating cases of shop breaking within Kisumu CBD.
