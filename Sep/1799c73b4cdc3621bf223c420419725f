There will be temporary disruption of flow of traffic on some sections of Mombasa Road and Uhuru Highway due to the construction of Nairobi Expressway. Kenya National Highways Authority (Kenha) on Thursday urged motorists to comply with traffic management plans and follow the direction of traffic marshals as well as road signs. "The contractors will minimize disruption to traffic as works are expected on the project road beteen JKIA Turnoff-Cabanas, Next Gen Mall-Capital Centre and Kenyatta Avenue- University Way roundabout," Kenha Director General Peter Mundinia said in a notice. Mundinia said although construction will be limited to the central median of Mombasa Road, closure of a single lane on either side of the highway may be effected to ensure safety of motorists. "We apologise for the inconveniences that may be caused as we endeavour to improve the excising infrastructure along this critical section of the Mombasa-Nairobi Highway," he said. This comes two days after the Thika superhighway was closed for maintenance. Motorists were on Monday advised to be cautious during a 2-3 week partial closure of the superhighway. Some lanes will be temporarily closed, according to Kenha which identified the Nairobi–Ruiru and Ruiru–Thika sections as the ones to be affected. "These works may result in the temporary closure of some lanes during the day,” the parastatal said in a public notice. Kenha director of communications Charles Njogu told the Star they are resurfacing some lanes.
