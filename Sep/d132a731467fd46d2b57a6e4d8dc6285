Regional low-cost carrier Jambojet has announced entry into charter operations, a move that is expected to address emerging consumer needs and boost its revenue stream. Jambojet acting managing director Karanja Ndegwa said this is part of the airline’s strategy to diversify its product offering to supplement the scheduled operations. “Due to the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, we have seen a shift in consumer needs. Consumers now, more than ever, want privacy, convenience and their safety and well-being assured," Ndegwa said on Tuesday. "As an airline, we pride ourselves in being customer centric, thus the introduction of this non-scheduled service,” he added. The airline is targeting business people, families, groups that may be attending social events such as weddings, corporate, missions and humanitarian bodies with operations outside of major towns to take up the charter operations. The charter can accommodate up to 78 passengers per flight depending on the route. With its low-cost model and internationally recognised safety record, Jambojet is looking to offer a safe, reliable product at an affordable rate, management notes. Since its inception in 2014, Jambojet has been a scheduled service operator, serving the domestic market, and expanded to Uganda and Rwanda in February 2017 and November 2019, respectively.
