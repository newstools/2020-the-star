Chief Justice David Maraga has gazetted new High Court stations in Isiolo, Vihiga, Kwale and Nandi. Maraga also announced gazettement of 14 new magistrates’ courts across the country. The new stations gazetted on Friday bring the number of High Courts to 43 spread out in 42 out of 47 counties. The 42 counties have one High Court station each, except Nakuru which has two stations, in Naivasha and Nakuru town respectively. The Chief Justice on Friday opened the new High Court block in Isiolo, which has been built by World Bank funding for Sh379 million. “This brings us closer to the aspiration of having the High Courts in each of the 47 counties as spelt out in the blueprint we launched in 2017,” he said in Isiolo. Samburu, West Pokot, Wajir, Mandera, and Elego Marakwet are the only counties yet to host a High Court station. Maraga said that under his tenure, the number of magistrate court stations has increased from 120 to 127 excluding the 14 announced today. This marks a sustained progress in devolving judicial services hence making access to justice less of a hassle, he said. He said that he has overseen building of 61 court structures across the country out of which 15 have been official opened for use. Another seven court buildings, he said, are ready for use and will be opened in the next few weeks. The seven are in Kakamega, Kajiado, Nakuru, Maralal, Siaya, Voi, and Kapenguria. The Isiolo court complex has eight courtrooms and 12 chambers. Maraga said that while ensuring courts’ presence was vital, focus should not shift from alternative dispute resolution efforts that ensure amicable settlement of disputes while maintaining cordial ties. “Alternative justice systems have had tremendous impact in Isiolo, with not only a significant reduction in the number of cases that end up in courts but even more importantly, easing of conflict between different communities that live here,” he said.
