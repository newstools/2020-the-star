President Uhuru Kenyatta made a surprise visit at Mama Ngina Waterfront Park in Mombasa County on Sunday evening. The President toured, interacted and spoke with vendors of the park who narrated the economic strain brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic. The tourism sector is one of the most affected with a global health crisis as industry players anticipate more than five million job losses due to coronavirus. During the tour, Uhuru assured traders of Government's support to ensure normal business at the refurbished park is restored following the slow down. The park which was named after former first lady Mama Ngina Kenyatta has recently faced a backlash from some rights groups from Mombasa demanding for a rename. However, Tourism Cabinet Secretary Najib Balala said the attempts to rename the old park is malicious. The park was opened on October 20 during the Mashujaa Day celebrations in 2019 after a Sh400 million renovation. Balala said several consultation meetings were held at the park before it was finally yet anybody come up with an objection about it's name. Balala said the name Mama Ngina has been in existence for over 50 years, and the names being suggested by the rights group, among them Mzimule, are not even known to the public. “I read a lot of malice in this campaign to rename Mama Ngina Waterfront Park. That name has been in existence for over 50 years, why now? Why are they coming out to change the name after the park was rehabilitated,” Balala told the Star in an interview in March.
