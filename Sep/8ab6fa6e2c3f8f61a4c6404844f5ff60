Four ethnic communities in Kenya have dominated the top management in the civil service, according to a report sent to Parliament. The report by Public Service CS Margaret Kobia shows that Kikuyus hold 120 of the 416 senior positions in government. They are followed by the Kalenjins with 45 positions, Luo (41), Luhya (33), Kamba (27), Meru (27) and Kisii (22). Others are Maasai (19), Mijikenda (10), Taita (8), Turkana (7), Boran (7) and Embu (6). The rest are Kenyan Asian (1), Gabra (3), Degodia (1), Kenyan Arabs (2), Kuria (3), Mbeere (2), Ogaden (1), Orma (2), other Kenyan (1), Pokot (3), Samburu (1), Shirazi (1),  Teso (4) and Tharaka (1). The CS however notes that a comparative analysis of the total number of top managers across government in comparison with the 2019 census shows that all counties are represented. "The government endeavours to adhere to the policy on regional balancing and affirmative action during recruitment and promotion of its staff while cognisant of  the need to maintain professionalism and meritocracy in order to match between job requirements and competencies,"Kobia  said. She added; "In addition, senior positions in government are competitively  filled through advertisements and interviews." Out of the 416 senior mangers in government, 22 are Cabinet Secretaries, 26 CAS, 42 PS, seven are in job group v, 48 in job group U and 272 in job group T. Kobia said that the existing policy supports equity, diversity and fair distribution of opportunities with increasing attempts to address any historical systemic and structural factors that impede the same. The audit comes at a time when Kenya is grappling with cohesion and inclusivity issues that prompted the creation of the Building Bridges Initiative. Section 7 (2) of the NCI Act, 2008 provides that no public establishment shall have more than one third of its staff from the same ethnic community. The report shows that out of 180 heads and CEOs of 286  state corporations, 36 are Kikuyu, Kalenjin (35), Luo (26), Luhya (18), Meru (13) and Kamba (10). Out of 51 heads of foreign missions, 14 are Kikuyu, Kalenjin (7), Luo (5), Luhya (5), Kamba (4) and Meru (3).
