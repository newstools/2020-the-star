The government has prepared a raft of guidelines that will be followed once the schools reopen later in October or next year. While it is commendable that the government is working hard to ensure students are safe, some of those regulations should be revised. The government should appreciate the country is not equal in very many aspects, among them socioeconomic levels, infrastructure and even the weather. It is, therefore, not practical to place rules such as "students must be taught outdoors" without considering the nature of climate in specific areas. There is also need to rethink the issue of transport as it either becomes an extra burden for parents or students get home late at night. When the government talks of discouraging boarding, it must be also be cognisant of the fact that students had already been placed in schools far away from their homes. All conditions set cannot be applied uniformly as this is not a case of one size fits all. There must be room to align them with the specific needs of each school. Finally, the resumption of learning will be costly and the government must release funds to schools on time. It has not spent on education for six months now and therefore this money should be readily available.
