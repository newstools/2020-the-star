Owners of bulls that participate in bullfighting want the government to relax protocols and allow bouts to resume. Bullfighting is a popular sport and a cultural practice among communities in Kakamega, especially in Ikolomani, Shinali and Lurambi subcounties, and attracts huge crowds. Across the world, it's practised in Japan and Spain. Kakamega County Bullfighting chairman Hudson Amalemba on Thursday said the bulls have become hostile because of staying long without fighting. "The bulls are now attacking people in homes,” Amalemba said. Champion bulls participate in what is equivalent to the champions’ league in soccer. However, the sport has not been turned into an income-generating venture despite its popularity among some of the Luhya community. Amalemba said bullfighting officials were ready to sensitise their support on Covid-19 social distancing requirements during matches. Coordinator Bonventure Munanga said some rituals where bulls fight such as funerals of respected elders have been curtailed by the Covid-19 protocols because of the limited number of people allowed to attend. In 2005, then Ikolomani MP Boni Khalwale - now county bullfighting patron and bull owner, visited Madrid in Spain where he and others learned  how to turn bullfighting into a money-making activity and help fight poverty. The county government is preparing to rehabilitate Khayega ground popularly known for bullfighting and football to promote the two sports. But bullfighting will be strictly regulated if a new animal protection law initiated last year is enacted. The proposed Animal Welfare Bill makes it mandatory for a bull owner to provide proof that the animal is trained before it is allowed to fight. It seeks to impose a Sh100,000 fine against anyone found to promote or take part in any public performance which includes riding, wrestling or fighting any untrained animal. Edited by R.Wamochie
