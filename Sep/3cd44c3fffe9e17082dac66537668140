Bungoma matatu owners will start paying 65 per cent of levies to the county government from October, with a review scheduled for December. The local matatu owners association has accepted a 15 per cent reduction to the 50 per cent waiver granted by the devolved unit to cushion them against Covid-19 shocks. The lobby said business was slowly returning to normal from the tough time during the partial lockdown and travel restrictions. In March, the county government met business leaders, among them matatu owners, to find ways of supporting their businesses. Deputy Governor Charles Ngome met the Bungoma Matatu Owners Association and they agreed to the new rates. Director for revenue Ambrose Makokha welcomed the cooperation of the matatu sector. Makokha said there has been tremendous growth in revenue collection since the introduction of tickets. "We have grown from an average of Sh2 million to Sh6 million after sealing of loopholes from our initial practice of using barriers," Makokha said. Bungoma Matatu Owners Association chair JohnMax Wafula thanked the county government for the cordial relationship. He said that the gradual rise in revenue has been received well by matatu owners. "We are hoping that by December the President will fully open the country so that we go back to our normal operations," Wafula said.
