Wajir Governor Mohamed Abdi on Friday praised the Senate for resolving the standoff on the new formula to share revenue to counties. The impasse lasted three months and failed in nine attempts. Cash-strapped counties were on the verge of shutdowns. Abdi said in Wajir town that the stalemate has persisted for long and counties suffered but it was worth the wait. In the 2021-2022 allocation, Wajir will get Sh9,474.73 up from Sh8,545.50 this financial year. “I salute our senators for showing leadership during the long difficult and trying process. The win for all formula determined by the Senate yesterday is an indication of its commitment to protecting devolution. This was not a "winners versus losers" battle but one meant to garner for a united Kenya,” he said. Abdi said it was now time to move together as one people and country. He thanked President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga for showing true leadership that helped in ending the stalemate. Uhuru and Raila met senators at State House hours before the vote. Present at the meeting were Council of Governors chair Wycliffe Oparanya, Samuel Poghisio (Majority leader),  Irungu Kang'ata (Majority Whip), James Orengo (Minority leader) and Fatuma Dullo (Deputy Majority leader) It was resolved that the government will, in the next financial year, allocate an additional Sh50 billion to counties. The additional cash will ensure no county suffers any funding cuts.
