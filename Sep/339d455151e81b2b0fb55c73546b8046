The High Court has stopped the environment regulator from shutting down the Mara Ngeche Safari Camp pending a case its owners filed on Monday. Last week, the National Environmental Management Authority ordered the camp closed after a video emerged of the facility staffers blocking the wildebeest migration in the Mara. But on Wednesday Narok High Court judge Mohamed Kullow stopped the closure of the camp and suspended Nemaâ€™s September 17 directive shutting down the operations of the facility. The judge directed the camp to file and serve the petition within the next 21 days. The case will be mentioned on October 22. On Thursday last week, Nema accused the camp of non-compliance with environmental requirements. The authority ordered the management of the camp to undertake a fresh environmental assessment to determine its suitability at the current site. Nema also ordered the camp management to demolish structures encroaching into the riparian reserves of the Mara River. The authority said it will constitute an interagency team to audit all facilities in the Mara ecosystem in the next month. All non-compliant facilities will be closed and their owners prosecuted.
