The Tiriki community has suspended circumcision plans until next year when it is expected the coronavirus will have been put under control. Vihiga Deputy Governor Patrick Saisi, who is a Tiriki, said at the weekend that the community cannot practise such an important cultural activity amid the Covid-19 crisis. “Culture is there and is with us. It’s not going anywhere; we can’t afford to lose our children in this crisis,” Saisi said. Elders have also resolved to comply with state coronavirus regulations, he said. The Tiriki hold the transition of boys from childhood to manhood ceremony after every four years. The deputy governor said the decision to put the circumcision on hold followed a series of consultative meetings among the elders and leaders. The latest meeting was at Sosa cottage. It was that meeting that resolved to suspend the activity until the coronavirus is controlled. It is not unusual to suspend cultural activities. Circumstances like outbreaks of war, diseases and famine determine the suspension of an important cultural activity, Saisi told the Star by phone. This, he said, was meant to save children from death, starvation and death during their transition into manhood. “The current situation is a disease outbreak and we have seen how damaging the virus is. We can’t take the risk,” the deputy governor said. During the circumcision, the youths are kept in the forest for a month as they are taught various aspects of their culture. They stay close and are unlikely to observe mandatory Covid-19 intervention measures like social distancing and frequent washing of hands.  - mwaniki fm
