Kisumu Saints and Kisumu Academy have been declared the 2019/2020 Victoria Handball Super League champions as the organisers cancelled the season due to the coronavirus pandemic. Speaking to The Star in Kisumu on Sunday, league coordinator Robert Owino said they have used the first leg results in declaring the winners. Saints retained the men's title after finishing top of the log with 16 points followed by four-time winners Kisumu Academy with 12 points. In the women’s edition Kisumu Academy clinched their inaugural title with six points with Thea Queens second with four. “All teams had completed their first leg fixtures. Since some teams are sponsored by education institutions which are unlikely to open until January, we decided to cancel the season. It would have been unfair to declare the season null and void because teams had invested heavily to take part,” Owino added. Owino further added that they intend to organise a Super Cup Challenge between November 14 and 15 in Kisumu. So far, Kisumu Academy, KAJ Academy, Kanyamedha Boys and Migingo Handball Club have confirmed participation in the men’s category. In the women’s category, Thea Queens, Kisumu Academy, Rainbow Academy and Migingo Handball Club have registered for the two-day tournament. Owino added that Kanyamedha Secondary will stage the first leg of the Victoria Handball Super League with Maseno University hosting the second round. The third and fourth rounds will be held at Kanyamedha Primary and Sigalagala National Polytechnic respectively.
