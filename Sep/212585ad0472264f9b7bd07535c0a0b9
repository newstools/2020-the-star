During the 2010 referendum, William Ruto and his 'No' side had the backing of the Church but they were defeated at the ballot. A closer look at the people who voted 'No' would show they did not cast their votes at the Church's bidding; it was not a Church versus 'Yes' team affair. Kenyans voted along tribal lines. The areas where Ruto had influence returned the 'No' vote. Nothing has changed since then. Kenya is still the same, with only one demography during polls—tribe. Countries such as the United States have quite a number of demographics: Colour, age, blue collar versus white collar, evangelicals and many more. In Kenya people vote according to regions and are greatly influenced by tribe. If people listened to the Church during the 2010 referendum, the 'No' team would have won. This is because almost everybody in Kenya is a Christian or a Muslim. I don’t think Kenyans have reached a point where they can vote beyond tribe. Many people are unhappy with the Building Bridges Initiative but at the ballot, they will vote with their political leaders and not the Church. If Kenyans had been voting with their religious leaders, then the Church would be the one deciding who becomes president. In places such as the Philippines, the Church can determine who becomes president, but not Kenya. Think about it, when the Church announces that it has backed the 'No' side, will the Christians in Nyanza vote with ODM leader Raila Odinga or the religious leaders? Definitely Raila. This, therefore, means that the church announcing it will support the 'No' team will be no earth-shaking declaration. The senior lecturer and political analyst spoke to the Star
