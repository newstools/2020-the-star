The government of Kenya has finally added its neighbouring county Tanzania to the list of countries allowed to land in. In the latest review of the countries whose travelers are exempted from the 14-day mandatory quarantine upon arrival, Tanzania is among the 147 countries. This is the second review of the flights allowed in the country since the government reopened its skies for international travel. Other countries that have been added to the list include Ghana, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone. Kenya resumed international flights on August 1, with only 11 countries with mild and limited community transmission allowed in. The CS said the list will be reviewed on a regular basis depending on the circumstances on the ground and after a comprehensive global mapping of the intensity of the disease. On August 19, the countries were increased toÂ 130 but Tanzania was left out among the East African Community. Some of the countries added to the list earlier include; Uganda, US (except California, Florida, and Texas), Russia, Turkey, Poland, Rwanda, Cuba, and Australia.
