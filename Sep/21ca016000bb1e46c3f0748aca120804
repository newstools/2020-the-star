Former Tokyo marathon champion Helah Kiprop has turned her focus on Tokyo2020 Olympic Games after her hopes of competing in Boston Marathon were curtailed by the coronavirus pandemic. Kiprop, who competed in a virtual Boston Marathon relay last Friday, has returned into full training with an eye on the summer games. Kiprop last competed in Tokyo Marathon in 2018, finishing fifth. “I was in shape for the Boston Marathon but coronavirus happened. I want to continue training and ensure I make the team to the Olympic Games in July next year,” said the former Berlin Half Marathon winner. Kiprop, who is returning to action after a two-year sabbatical, said the virtual race was good for her to gauge her speed and endurance. “It was not all that competitive since I ran alone. I have an idea of what to expect next time,” said the 2009 Nice Half Marathon winner. Kiprop completed her eight miles (12.87km) in 48:00 minutes during the relay, where she teamed up with Margaret Wangare, who ran eight miles in 39.55 on 1960m above sea level and Risper Chebet, who ran 10,2 miles in 52.09 minutes on a 2,330m above sea level.
