Media personality Carol Radull has revealed that she spent her birthday in bed last year after undergoing surgery. Taking to Instagram as she turned a year older on Friday, she said that in as much as she was still in recovery, the day was still special because she was surrounded by family. "Last year I spent my birthday in bed. I had surgery on my sinuses on the 12th of September and I was still in recovery. But I was surrounded by family and so much love. So it was still pretty special," she said. Radull said she hoped that this year, she will have a mega bash, but there were other plans. "Still I promised myself I would have a huge bash this year and really let loose. But God had other plans. Things are different this year but I feel so blessed to be alive and healthy," Radull added. 2020 is one year that many will never forget because of the pandemic and Carol said that if we all learned something this year; it's that our health is not something we can take for granted. "So I am grateful to God that I get to see this day and that I am healthy and strong," she said. Radull went ahead to ask Kenyans to support former boxer Conjestina Achieng who has made headlines for a really long time, the only gift that she would want this year. "Thank you to everyone who spread the word about supporting Conjestina and to those who followed up with a contribution. It is appreciated. It's the only gift I want this year. 🙏🏼Please make my day and send your support now. Paybill 5181441 Acct 2030 @Tufund. 🙏🏼 #SupportConjestina," she said.
