Migori county assembly for the second time in a row failed to table the impeachment motion of governor Okoth Obado on Wednesday. Speaker Boaz Okoth suspended the morning session which started at 9:30 pm, saying his life is in danger. The session is expected to resume later in the afternoon. Addressing the press, Okoth said his official bodyguard was withdrawn last night and said his house in the outskirts of Migori town was attacked by goons. Okoth recorded a statement at Migori Police station. "Right now my life is in danger, I have to record a statement and get to know why my bodyguard was withdrawn," Okoth said. Over the weekend, Okoth who is a close ally of governor Okoth Obado claimed that his house in Kisumu was attacked by thugs allied to the ODM party which is pushing for Obado's ouster. On Tuesday, despite building tension with a contingent of anti-riot police in the assembly, the motion was not tabled. Okoth said he decided to call off the house from resuming because MCAs had failed to abide by Covid-19 rules as most of them wanted to access the assembly. He also said because there was high anxiety in the assembly, he decided to call it off. On Tuesday, he refused to give his speech at the assembly and only allowed the assembly to reopen after recess since August 6.
