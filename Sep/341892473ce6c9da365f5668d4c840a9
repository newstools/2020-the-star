National Olympic Committee (NOC-K) President Paul Tergat is mourning the death of his mother who succumbed to illness early Wednesday morning. The late Mrs. Esther Toyoi Tergat was taken ill on Sunday, September 20 and admitted to Mediheal Hospital in Nakuru, where doctors had frantically tried to save her life before she lost the battle. NOC-K Acting Secretary General, Francis Mutuku, while sending a message of condolence, termed her death as a big loss to the family especially coming only days after Tergat had also lost his mother in law. Said he: “It’s with a heavy heart that we announce the sudden passing on of Mrs. Esther Toyoi Tergat, the mother to our President, Paul Tergat.” “As a National Olympic Committee, we join our President and his family in mourning the loss of such an icon in the family, coming so soon after the loss of his mother in law. We stand in solidarity together with him as he griefs and send our own condolences and those of the entire Olympic and sports family in this Nation,” said Mutuku. Mutuku further said that the incident was a major setback for NOC-K, who were gearing for a resumption to sports in line with guidelines issued by CS Amina Mohammed. “For us, this development is devastating news not only to our President but the NOC-K family as it has come just as when we are gearing up for a resumption to sports as announced by our Sport Ministry, especially with the Olympics in sight,” he said. “The NOC-K President and the Executive have been at the forefront towards building this momentum to active sporting in the country under the pandemic health guidelines,” said Mutuku.  He wished the family strength and fortitude during this trying moment. “We are confident that God will grant the family fortitude and strength to go through these trying times even as we assure them of our own and Kenyan athletes’ solidarity and prayers.”
