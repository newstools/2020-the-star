Commonwealth Games 3,000m steeplechase silver medallist Abraham Kibiwot has revealed that he was barred from traveling to Monaco Diamond League because of his association with Conseslus Kipruto, who tested positive for Covid-19 prior to the race. Kibiwott said while he tested negative for the disease, he still could not travel to Monaco because he trains alongside the Olympic and world 3,000m steeplechase champion. The former school-mates at Kosirai High School prepared together for the Diamond League opener in Monaco. “Imagine how hurting it is when you test negative but you can’t still travel because of conduct tracing. This disease is a monster in the world of sports and it is real. I was very sure I was going to improve on my 8.05 minutes personal best which I set on the same track in Monaco in 2019,” said Kibiwott. He said skipping Monaco was like adding salt to an injury considering that they have been yearning to have races since February. “The decision to bar me from traveling hit me like thunderbolt because I had just finalised on my training and was looking forward to winning the race. I was psychologically affected and I am now trying to come to terms with the fact that I couldn’t compete in the DL season opener,” he added. Kibiwott finished sixth in 3,000m steeplechase at the 2019 World athletics Championships in Doha, Qatar and won silver at the 2018 Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast, Australia. He said he is now eyeing the Kip Keino Classic Continental Tour on October 3 in Nairobi. “I am also supposed to run during Doha Diamond League on September 25 but it has not been confirmed,” he said.
