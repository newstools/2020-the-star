Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli has hit out at Deputy President William Ruto over his 'hustler' movement, saying he only gives out peanuts, yet he is wealthy. "You are calling yourself a hustler yet you are not a hustler.. then you go to the church to lie... google who a hustler is... a person who employs fraudulent means to obtain money... " he said on Thursday at the union's headquarters. "If you go further you will find a hustler is a male prostitute... why do you want to be associated with such a name?" Atwoli said the hustler movement was a plan to defraud the poor in the country, adding that Ruto is a rich man. "He has five choppers, a mansion and owns every empty space in the country yet calls himself a poor man.... The wheelbarrows he is giving out are just peanuts compared to his wealth. We cannot form a government of gamblers," he said. "We cannot allow our children to be called hustlers but we are championing for a structured government that will provide an enabling environment to all Kenyans." Meanwhile, Atwoli asked President Uhuru Kenyatta to sack all ministers failing to act on workers' issues. "The ministers who are not listening to workers are not helping the president achieve his Big Four Agenda," he said. Last month, Atwoli asked Ruto to step down, adding that the DP does not believe in the government he is serving. He added that Ruto does not respect his peers in government and has undermined state officials a number of times. “Ruto is a daytime dreamer. He is dreaming. He will never be the president of this great country,” Atwoli told the Star on phone on Wednesday. “In fact, no one will stand in his way to stop him. We will see where he will get votes.” Atwoli was responding to Ruto’s remarks that he was not afraid of powerful people in government calling themselves the 'deep state'.
