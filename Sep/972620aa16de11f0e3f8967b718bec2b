Governors are mulling over closing county offices if senators fail to resolve the revenue stalemate that has left the devolved governments cash-strapped. The Senate has failed to adopt a formula for revenue sharing among the 47 counties, meaning the devolved units cannot get disbursements from the Treasury. Council of Governors chairman Wycliffe Oparanya and Bungoma Governor Wycliffe Wangamati on Sunday said operations in the counties were at risk. Speaking in Namwacha village, Kanduyi constituency, both Oparanya and Wangamati called on the Senate to quickly resolve the standoff. "We as governors will be forced to shut down operations if we don't receive funds so that the common mwananchi is forced to react,” Wangamati said. Oparanya said, “It's a route we don't want to take but will be forced to bring all operations to a standstill if the Senate keeps wrangling over this issue." The Kakamega Governor said he will call for a Council of Governors meeting on September 17 to announce a total shutdown of all 47 counties unless the Senate resolves the deadlock before that time. "We won't keep county government workers in office without pay and funds needed to offer services. We will send all our workers on leave if funds aren't forthcoming," Oparanya said. Essential services including healthcare are among those to be suspended. “This is the only way for the Senate to see the dire need of the situation when the entire nation starts rebelling,” Oparanya said. The two governors, however, said cash allocation should be based on population and not landmass. Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa said it would be unfortunate if the Senate, which is mandated by the Constitution to protect devolution, will be the cause of shutdown in the counties. He also urged senators to resolve the disagreement on the revenue-sharing formula as soon as possible. Senators have adjourned a record nine times after failing to agree on which formula to adopt.
