Two men were on Wednesday evening arrested for impersonating DCI officers and attempting to extort Kasipul MP Charles Ongondo. The two; Dennis Nyakundi and Victor Onsare were arrested at a Hotel in Nairobi after summoning the MP through social media. "They had a forged notice compelling him to present himself at DCI HQs for questioning on an undisclosed matter," DCI director George Kinoti said. Kinoti said the Legislator later received a call from a private number rescheduling his appearance at DCI offices to a later date. "....but required that they meet at the hotel for a talk," Kinoti said. On being suspicious of the inconsistent events, the MP reported to DCI Parliament where a trap was set and the two suspects nabbed. They are in custody undergoing interrogations on a suspected Extortion attempt. They are set to take plea. Meanwhile, the DCI is also holding four suspected Child Traffickers. Christine Ndinda, Lydia Mumo, Jacinta Mutua and Winrose MuuÂ  were arrested on Wednesday after being connected to a three month old child who was set to be trafficked. They were arrested in Machakos after a probe. The four are connected to the trafficking of a 3 month old baby girl whose mother is reported to have sold her to the 45-year-old Christine Ndinda who had earlier taken the baby to clinic whereby she was rescued. The child has been handed over to Children officers pending the arraignment of the four suspects.Cases of child trafficking are on the rise in the country. Most children are sold across the borders.
