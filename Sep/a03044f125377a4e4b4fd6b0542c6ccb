Education CS George Magoha has been accused of ignoring MPs in school resumption preparations. Manyatta MP John Muchiri said for schools to be well prepared to avoid the spread of the virus among learners, extra amenities such as more classes should be provided to allow social distancing. He says this requires the involvement of legislators because they are key sector players. Muchiri said the NG-CDF plays a crucial role in funding construction of public education facilities and is expected to fund constructions before schools open. The lawmaker, therefore, termed it wrong for the CS to act alone, expressing concern that Magoha’s way of doing things might complicate the situation. Muchiri said schools are not prepared for reopening, yet barely four months remain to the end of the year. He spoke on Thursday at Kangaru Boys’ High School where he hosted school heads and chairmen of boards of management. Schools will open in January if the virus is contained. The meeting, therefore, deliberated on required interventions before schools reopen. Muchiri said MPs should be involved in preparations to avoid duplication of facilities, arguing that the government cannot have enough funds to build extra classes, hence the NG-CDF will have to come in. Muchiri said toilets and latrines are also crucial, yet most schools do not have enough. He said schools in his constituency are ill-prepared as no classes have been built and his CDF is expected to contribute, yet the education ministry has not consulted him and the fund’s officials. The school heads concurred, saying they need more funding to construct new classes. Most classrooms accommodate more than 60 learners against a requirement of 25, they said. They urged the government to intervene in the remaining three months before January so schools can be properly equipped.
