The battle for control of key voting region between Deputy President William Ruto and ODM leader Raila Odinga continued to intensify. On Monday, Ruto hosted leaders from the Luo and Luhya communities that have traditionally been Railaâ€™s strongholds. Other than seeking their support for his bid, the DP dismissed politicians peddling false information that President Uhuru Kenyatta wants to extend his term in office. Cotu boss Francis Atwoli had over the weekend claimed that a referendum arising from the BBI process would change the constitution and give Uhuru more time in office.

The causes of this inadequacy are related to quantity and quality. They include limited availability, population pressure, mass consumption, misuse, environmental degradation, pollution and climate change.
