More than 12, 000 farmers in Kwale will benefit from maize shelling machines and certified seedlings distributed by the county government. The machines are aimed at reducing the cost and time of processing of the farm produce. They will be distributed in 20 wards to serve about 625 farmers in each area. Eight kilograms of various seedlings will be distributed to each individual. Speaking on Saturday at Patanani village in Matuga, deputy governor Fatuma Achani said the county wanted to improve food security by providing a conducive environment for the agricultural sector. She said the government launched the project to assist small-scale farmers grow by making resources and machinery readily available. Achani said the county had made dams, water pans, boreholes and strengthened water piping systems to enhance irrigation. Kwale residents have for years depended on relief food during dry seasons. The county government will cut the chain of dependency and help produce surplus food for everyone through irrigation. The machines can shell maize and green grams at the same time. County tractors do free ploughing and farmers are offered manure and pesticides to boost food production. Achani said the programme will empower more farmers to engage in agribusiness to create employment opportunities and raise the living standards. The county government is working hard to get reliable markets for their products and create international networks for agribusiness. The deputy governor said they are creating mechanisms to protect local farmers against exploiters. She said the multi-million-shilling Kombani fresh produce wholesale market was expected to be a game-changer for the local economy. “We are preparing our farmers because soon the Kombani market will be opened and a lot is expected to happen because it will draw in various businesses,” she said. The new market will serve more than 6,000 farmers and traders. Edited by Henry Makori
