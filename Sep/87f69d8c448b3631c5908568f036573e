The Employment and Labour Relations Court has suspended the appointment of two members of the Kemsa Board pending hearing of a petition. In the case, Advocate Samuel Chelongo moved to court challenging Health CS Mutahi Kagwe’s decision to appoint Dorothy Atieno and Timothy Waema as Kemsa Board members. Justice Hellen Wasilwa on Wednesday suspended Kagwe’s appointments, pending hearing of the case. “This honourable court hereby issues a conservatory order staying the CS Health's decision to appoint the 1 and 2 interested parties to the position of board members of Kemsa,” the order reads. The judge directed Chelongo to serve the CS and the AG. The case will be heard on September 23. Chelongo has opposed Kagwe's appointments that were gazetted in May, arguing that the two were illegally appointed. Through lawyer Dorcas Mwae, Chelongo claims that Atieno and Waema both hold two public offices because they are yet to resign from their previous posts. Mwae says Atieno works at the Kenyatta National Hospital as an assistant chief pharmacist, a position that she allegedly holds to date, while Waema is a still a professor of Information Systems in the School of Computing and Informatics at the University of Nairobi. “It goes without saying that both Atieno and Waema earn a double salary as public officers, an act that is against our Kenyan Constitution of 2010 and the Public Officers Ethics Act,” the petition reads in part. Chelongo further claims that in the recent past, there has been public outcry of the happenings at the Kenya Medical Supplies Authority to the point that President Uhuru Kenyatta called for investigations into allegations of graft.
