Gospel singer Wahu has urged women to strive for financial independence so they do not have to rely on their male partners for financial support. The singer said women should stop borrowing money from their men. Wahu said it is okay for women to ask for money from their men but real women should strive to have their own. In a video posted on Instagram, she said it is quite embarrassing for women to always ask for money from their men. "You cannot be asking for money to buy credit from your man every day, weave and other stuff," she said. "You must have your own money. You must have your bank account with money. You need to get the knowledge on how to save your own money. You should not be begging." Edited by T Jalio
