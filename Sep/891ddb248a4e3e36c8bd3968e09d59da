Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi has refused to apologise over his controversial remarks against President Uhuru Kenyatta and former First Lady Mama Ngina Kenyatta. Sudi doubled down, saying he did not abuse anyone and those condemning him were brokers and looters who had destroyed the country. He said he did not speak on behalf of Deputy President William Ruto and it was wrong for some individuals to demand an apology from the DP. The MP insisted that respect was two-way and he had to be told the exact mistake he did. “If I am found to have made any mistake in my utterances then I will apologise but they have to tell me what mistake I did [and] who I abused,” Sudi said. He said no amount of intimidation would cow him. “I have my own brains and can think well on my own. William Ruto does not carry for me my brains and I know clearly what I said,” Sudi said. He said those lecturing him over the remarks had no moral authority to address Kenyans on decorum. "All mothers are the same and we respect them but I didn't abuse anyone. It’s even in the bible that any child who sucked his or her mother must respect her," Sudi said. He said those criticising his remarks in the media should apologise to him instead. The outspoken MP said President Kenyatta was his party leader in Jubilee and statements aimed at correcting each other were appropriate. Sudi said all Kenyans must be treated equally. He told ODM leader Raila Odinga and his backers to apologise first for their past remarks and abuses against Uhuru. The lawmaker told journalists at his home that some of the ODM leaders were deeply involved in mega scandals in the country. He faulted Kirinyaga Governor Ann Waiguru for joining those condemning him yet she had questions to answer at the ethics agency. Sudi said he had heard reports that he would be arrested by the police. "They don't have to come for me. Let them just call and tell me where I'm needed and I will go. No need to send so many police officers here," he said.
