Wolves have made their second signing in two days after completing a deal for Lyon’s Brazilian left-back Marcal. The 31-year-old has signed a two-year contract at Molineux, with Wolves paying Lyon a fee of 2m euros. Marcal has spent the last three seasons with Lyon and helped the French side reach last season’s Champions League semi-finals. Wolves signed Portuguese teenager Fabio Silva from Porto for a club record fee of £35.6m on Saturday. Marcal can operate as an orthodox left-back or at wing-back and will bolster manager Nuno Espirito Santo’s options in that area after Jonny Castro suffered cruciate knee ligament damage in Wolves’ Europa League last-16 victory over Olympiakos last month. Wolves are hoping to make further signings before their opening Premier League game at Sheffield United on Monday, with a midfielder and a right-sided defender — who will replace Matt Doherty who joined Tottenham a week ago — the target areas. “Having played over 280 games in top leagues, as well as Champions League football, Marcal will add a huge amount of experience to our young team,” said Wolves executive chairman Jeff Shi. “He is a player with the technical ability to be able to contribute in the build-up play from the back, all the way through to threatening the opposition in the final phase.”
