Media personality Betty Kyallo says she wanted to be a Catholic nun. Betty was featured on the journey series on Churchill Show, where she spoke about being raised in a staunch Catholic family. "I wanted to be a nun but mabudesco (men) changed me. They confused me (walinichanganya wakanimaliza)," she said. "I used to admire nuns, how they looked nice in their white clothes during mass and I was like, I wanna be like them hakuna kusumbuliwa na machali," she said. "Alafu you serve God… But it was not easy. That is how I ended up becoming a news anchor or I do what I wanted to do." She hopes her daughter Ivanna will be a nun. Betty is currently concentrating on her business, Flair By Betty, and plans to get into politics. "I will definitely join politics and it is my next thing I'm looking forward to doing," she said. "There is only one thing that is remaining for me to do in media, and that is having my own talk show, where I will be talking to people, and I am done." Betty says her role model in the media industry was veteran media personality Catherine Kasavuli. "I’d watch the news just to see her. I interviewed her on KTN but when I saw her I got so nervous. She was so sweet to me. It was one of my best shows," she said. During the Churchill interview, Betty recounted her early childhood, when her parents could not afford to give to the children much. "I remember a time we would eat pumpkin with strong tea. But I thank my family for supporting my dreams," she said. Edited by T Jalio
