A demonstrator was on Friday killed by a stray bullet in Kericho East as police were trying to stop a mob from lynching a man who was mistaken for a robber. Kericho county police commander Silas Gichure on Sunday confirmed that the demonstrator was killed by a stray bullet. It is not clear how old the deceased was. Trouble started after residents spotted a man they mistook for a suspect who had robbed and killed an M-Pesa operator a fortnight ago. Gichure said the irate crowd did not try to establish if the man was indeed the suspect they were looking for. “As they were preparing to lynch him, a police officer from the market rushed to rescue him. The irate mob then went on the rampage and barricaded the Kericho-Kisumu highway for more than three hours using rocks and burning old tyres,” Gichure said. The officer called for reinforcement from a nearby police station. When the officers arrived, they started firing in the air and lobbying tear-gas canisters to disperse the mob. “A stray bullet from one of the police officers hit and killed the young man,” Gichure said. But Kapsoit MCA Paul Tarimbo said, “The alleged stray bullet completely shuttered the skull of the young man,  indicating that the police officer opened fire at close range.” The body was taken to Kericho Level 4 Hospital mortuary.
