The Law Society of Kenya has filed a case in court challenging the restructuring of the Kenya Meat Commission (KMC). LSK through LawyerÂ  Manwa Hosea says he learned on an executive order dated on September 7 that purports to transfer the Commission from the Ministry of Agriculture to the Ministry of Defence. He says the move is unlawful as the same has been done without any amendments to the KMC Act. "The Ministry of Defense has no role or representation in the KMC as established under section 3 of its Act. The President ought to trigger relevant amendments to the Act before reorganizing the commission," he says. Hosea seeks to have court suspend directive transferring ministerial responsibility of the commission to the Ministry of Defence. He says the directive is unlawful as the executive arm of government cannot restructure or assign functions of the statutory body without such amendments of the statute. "The directive purports to amend KMC Act by taking away its functions and transferring the same to the Defence Ministry, which has its own functions," read the court documents. On Thursday, senators opposed the government's move to transfer KMC to the Ministry of Defence. The legislators said there was no public participation that was undertaken before the decision was arrived at. The senators now want the two cabinet secretaries for Agriculture and Defence to appear before the house and explain what informed the transfer of the commission to KDF.
