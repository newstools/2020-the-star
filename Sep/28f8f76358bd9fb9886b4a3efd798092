Former Ndhiwa MP Agostino Neto’s United Green Movement Party has given Chief Justice David Maraga 14 days to advise President Uhuru Kenyatta to dissolve Parliament over the two-thirds gender rule stalemate. The party’s Women's League on Wednesday said Maraga should move with speed and advise for the dissolution of Parliament for its inability to enact the two-thirds gender rule in line with the Constitution. They want Maraga to invoke Article 261 (7) of the Constitution which provides that the CJ can advise for dissolution of Parliament in the event it fails to enact legislation. “The party is asking you to exercise judicial authority and do justice to women. We wait your action in the next fortnight with bated breath, ” UGM Women's League national chairperson Catherine Dzame said. Dzame said they will rally women and storm Maraga’s office after two weeks if he fails to act. “If we do not see any action within two weeks of this statement, we will lead our women in defence of the Constitution to your office.” The women leaders spoke at the party’s headquarters in Nairobi. In July, the Law Society of Kenya asked Maraga to write to President Kenyatta to advise him on dissolving Parliament on grounds of non-implementation of Section 27 of the Constitution. LSK accused MPs of failing to initiate implementation of constitutional provisions that would ensure gender balance in both levels of government. The LSK petition adds that Parliament’s failure to craft the laws on gender balance is also a violation of court orders. Edited by R.Wamochie
