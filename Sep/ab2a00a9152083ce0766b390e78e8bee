Garissa Governor Ali Korane's plea has been deferred to Tuesday. The governor spent his afternoon in his car waiting to take plea since 2 pm. His lawyers say they have been told to come back on Tuesday morning at 8 am. Korane presented himself to the EACC at Integrity Centre on Monday morning as the anti-graft agency begin a probe into a Sh233 million grant fund. The DPP had ordered his immediate arrest alongside four top county officials over the grant fund. Korane, a first-time governor, is accused of colluding with the county officials to illegally divert Sh233,506,000 grant given by the World Bank to finance an urban programme. Korane becomes the sixth sitting governor to be hauled to the corridors of justice as the government tightens the noose on corruption in counties. Investigations by the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission revealed that the funds were irregularly diverted from the county coffers. The money was to be used on specified projects under the Kenya Urban Support Programme.
