The hearing of a case in which Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko is facing corruption charges involving a Sh14.1 million tender has been adjourned to October 6. The case was to commence on Monday but senior prosecution counsel Alex Akula told the court they were not ready to proceed. He told magistrate Peter Ooko that another corruption case facing Sonko and two others before magistrate Douglas Ogoti is currently ongoing and a protected witness is expected to take the stand. The defence led by lawyer Cecil Miller did not oppose the application. In the case,  Sonko, Fredrick Odhiambo trading as Yiro Enterprises, ROG Security Limited and its director Antony Otieno Ombok alias Jamal have denied charges of  conspiracy to commit an offence of corruption, conflict of interest, money laundering and acquisition of proceeds of crime. It is alleged that the Governor in December 2018, received an indirect private interest of Sh8.4 million from Fred Odhiambo in a contract connected with the county over hiring of heavy equipment. ROG Security and its director Jamal is accused of unlawfully receiving Sh14 million through Equity Bank from Fred Odhiambo. The money was in respect of a contract for hiring heavy equipment.
