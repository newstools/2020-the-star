Efforts are underway to rescue three people trapped in a four-storey building that collapsed in Mamboleo, Kisumu last night. The building that is still under construction came crumbling last night around midnight. According to the county commissioner Josephine Ouko, three people have already been rescued and taken for treatment. She said the six were workers of the building currently under construction and were staying in one of the rooms in the lower floor that had been completed. "The three who were rescued were treated at Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital and discharged. We are with them here because they said they want to witness the colleagues being rescued," Ouko said. According to a police report, Robert Gitau aged 30, said they were resting with five others on the first floor of the building when it came down. " Three of them managed to escape with slight injuries as but their colleagues were trapped,". However, the county commissioner said they are currently communicating to one of the people trapped inside and still trying to establish the whereabouts of the other two. " The operation is ongoing and we have received a good response from both the national and county response team and we hope within the next one hour we would babe rescued that one person speaking under," she said. Ouko said they are going to engage experts to find out why this building came down so that they can be able to instigate legal actions against the owner if at all there is any aptitude. " We want to engage professionals to tells why the building might have come down, she said.
