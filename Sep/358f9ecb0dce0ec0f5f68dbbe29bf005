Selected schools in Bungoma, Siaya and Kisumu are to get support to build toilets with shower rooms, water tanks, a washing station and incinerator to keep girls learning during their menstrual period. Ace Africa, a non-governmental organisation, has already selected several schools in the three counties to benefit. Laura Doresi, an official from the NGO, said the girl-friendly toilets will provide needed privacy for girls so they stay comfortable while in school. "We realised that most girls keep off school during their menstrual days. This is why we are constructing such toilets to enable them to manage their hygiene and reduce stigma surrounding menstruation while at school," Doresi said. She said the latrines will enable girls to change their pads and stay clean without a hassle. Doresi spoke at Bungoma DEB when they commissioned the project. She said they chose Bungoma DEB because it was the most populated primary school in the western region. "This school has 1,699 girls. With this kind of population, it's difficult for the girls because during tea break they are forced to spend time queuing to access sanitation facilities," Doresi said. She said her organisation will distribute sanitary pads to needy students when schools resume from the Covid-19 closure. Doresi appealed to other well-wishers to partner with them to ensure that girls are well taken care of at schools. Bungoma DEB Primary School head teacher Tobia Khisa said that a shortage of classes and toilets was the biggest challenge facing them. He thanked Ace Africa for the support.
