A woman accused of operating a pharmacy without a certificate from the Pharmacy and Poisons Board was charge at a Makadara court. Mary Mutinda Nzioka was accused of operating Satellite Chemist in Kasarani while not registered as a pharmacist by the board. Appearing before senior principal magistrate Angelo Kithinji on Wednesday, Nzioka was also charged with forgery. The court heard that on August 25 at Satellite Chemist located in an isolated plot within Kasarani, the accused forged a pharmaceutical technologist's practice certificate purporting it to be of John Faith Mutheu. Nzioka was arrested by officers from the Ministry of Health who were on routine inspection when she presented the forged certificate. The officers ran a scan and established that the document was not in their system and the QR code was registered to Bristol Park Hospital under the name of Kithumbi Damaris. She was also charged with uttering a false document, carrying on the business of a pharmacy in premises not registered by the PPB and being in possession of poisons contrary to the law. Nzioka denied all the five charges. Kithinji freed her on a cash bail of Sh200,000 or a bond of Sh300.000 with surety of similar amount.Â The matter will be mentioned on September 30 and heard on February 16. Edited by Henry Makori
