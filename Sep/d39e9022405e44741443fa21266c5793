Impala Saracens head coach Mitch Ocholla will rely on his youngsters when the season reopens later in the year. Former international said the club doesn’t need to make necessary reinforcements based on the performance of last season, where they achieved their target of finishing fourth in the Kenya Cup. “Our target last season was to qualify and make the playoffs which we did. We, therefore, need to continue on that trajectory with the system and structure we have. I am sure we can achieve our goals,” added Ocholla. The core of the team that played last season is expected to stay with the likes of Sam Onsomu, Elkeans Musonye, Xavier Kipngetich, Davis Makori, Sammy Oliech, Alvin Marube, Anthony Odhiambo and Bill Omondi expected to play. Ocholla was bullish that his charges will remain competitive once the union is given greenlight by the Ministry of Sports to return to play. “The squad is a good mix of young and experienced players and I believe we will be very strong in all departments,” he added. The Sarries were due to play Mwamba in the playoffs with the winner set to face league leaders Kabras in the semi-finals but the season was suspended due to the onset of the Covid-19 Ocholla said players are training from home and a number of them are being given stipends to cope with the effects of the pandemic. “Most of our players depend on rugby but with no action at the moment, most of them are going through a difficult time and have been unable to sustain the urban life, forcing them to look for other ways of survival.” The former Kenya Sevens’ head coach said it’s highly unlikely rugby will be played this year, noting that January is a more realistic date for return to action due to the protocols in place. ”The cost of testing is way out of reach for most clubs yet rugby is a high risk sport. We may have to wait longer before we can return to play,” noted Ocholla.
