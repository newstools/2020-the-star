Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe should step aside to allow investigations into the Covid-19 tender scam at the Kenya Medical Supplies Authority. Luanda town resident Charles Amimo said Principal Secretary Susan Mochache and CAS Rashid Aman should also give way. “You cannot audit someone when he or she is still in office,” Amimo said on Monday. He said Kenyans are no longer interested in the figures being given out by the Ministry of Health on Covid-19 infections or deaths. “What we want now is for the CS and his team to give us a breakdown of the billions that are now being questioned,” Amimo said. Already, the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission is investigating the alleged scheme to steal the Covid-19 billions.
