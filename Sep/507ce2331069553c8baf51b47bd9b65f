A senate watchdog committee has summoned Meru Governor Kiraitu Murungi after he snubbed an invite to respond to audit queries. The Senate County Public Accounts and Investment Committee vice-chairman Hargura Godana (Marsabit) said the panel will on Tuesday announce the date for the governor's appearance. "Now that they have not given any reason (for nonappearance), we are left with the second option which is issuing summons," Hargura said. The county boss was supposed to respond to 2015-16, 2016-17 and 2017-18 audit queries flagged by former Auditor General Edward Ouko. Kiraitu was among the four governors the Committee lined up for grilling over the queries. On Tuesday, Isiolo Governor Mohamed Kuti is expected to appear before the panel before his Marsabit counterpart Mahamed Mahamud appears on Wednesday. Embu's Matin Wambora has a date with the committee on Thursday.
