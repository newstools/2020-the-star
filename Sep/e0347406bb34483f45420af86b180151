Sports CS Amina Mohamed is among five candidates who will progress to the next stage of interviews for the World Trade Organization's top job. She was nominated on July 7 by the Kenyan government. Other finalists include Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala of Nigeria, Yoo Myung-hee of South Korea, Mohammad Maziad Al-Tuwaijri of Saudi Arabia and Liam Fox of the UK. The Geneva-based body is seeking a replacement for Brazilâ€™s Roberto Azevedo who stepped down a year early at the end of August at a critical juncture WTO. His successor will need to steer reforms and negotiations in the face of rising protectionism, a deep recession caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and growing trade tensions, notably between the US and China. Amina, a veteran international diplomat and former Education CS, says she is qualified to becomed the next WTO director general. In a 30-minute interview in Geneva, Amina said in her many years of diplomatic life she has come to understand how the WTO corridors function. She has been endorsed by the East Africa Business Council. Amina said if chosen, she would help the organisation make progress on crucial issues to break the current cycle of despair. "The organisation is being tested. Its negotiating systems have been faulted with less success in the last 25 years," she said. "Trade tensions have increased and dispute settlement systems compromised." (Edited by V. Graham)
