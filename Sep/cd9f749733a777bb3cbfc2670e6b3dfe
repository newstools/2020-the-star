Makadara MP George Aladwa has asked authorities to investigate possible plans by some leaders to cause chaos in the country ahead of 2022 elections. Aladwa, who is the ODM party Nairobi chair, said the Directorate of Criminal Investigations and the National Cohesion and Integration Commission should interrogate whether such plans exist. “We are all aware of the bad effects of political incitement especially when a country is not far away from conducting the general elections,” he stated. Aladwa said it is unfortunate that their counterparts in Tangatanga are keen on making the presidential bid of Deputy President William Ruto a matter of life and death “While I am aware that ODM has fought for this differently in three consecutive elections, we recognise the need for political leaders to restrain themselves from vitriol and inhumane politics of character assassination,” he said. In a statement, Aladwa advised that political leaders should hold the highest political responsibility of bidding for a united country and fostering politics of prosperity. He said recent remarks by Emurua Dikirr MP Johana Ngeno levelled against President Uhuru Kenyatta and his family is an unfortunate incident that must not be tolerated. “We must respect the presidency and even the office of the former Prime Minister Raila Odinga,” he added. He asked Tangatanga legislators to explore better ways of engaging the President “if at all they are interested in him supporting the Deputy President come 2022”. “Using unorthodox means and outdated means geared towards violence should not be tolerated. Some of us in ODM have restrained ourselves from any abusive utterances despite the continued slurs against the handshake,” he added. Aladwa further added that Rift Valley leaders should respect their regional commission George Natembeya and support his peace initiatives. “We will not sit down and watch as some individuals with sinister motives plot to disparage work of by Natembeya,” he stated.
