A teenage girl is expected to be charged on September 23 with the murder in Nyakach subcounty of a 20-year-old man he had allegedly been dating. The 17-year-old Form 3 student is suspected of stabbing Julius Odhiambo on September 7 at Polo area in Nyakach following a disagreement. Odhiambo sustained serious injuries and was rushed to Nyabondo hospital and later referred to Kericho hospital where he succumbed to his injuries. Nyakach subcounty police commander Jonathan Koech confirmed the incident. Odhiambo is the son of a  senior police officer in Mombasa county, he said. He said that they were informed by villagers that a young man had been stabbed and later lost his life while receiving treatment. He said they are not aware of the circumstances that led to the stabbing but officers are proceeding with investigations. Koech urged parents to be vigilant and keep a close eye on their children. "Parents should know the whereabouts of their children, cross-examine them time after time, be closer to them in order to know their problems," he added. The girl told Nyando senior principal magistrate Samson Temu on Wednesday, "we are friends who had started dating". DCI officer Daniel Karanja told the court that the accused was arrested at Apoko area and placed in police custody. He requested time to conclude investigations into the murder incident. "I have not completed investigations and I'm currently waiting for postmortem results of the deceased." Karanja added that tension is very high at the accused's home area in Nyakach and it would be safe to keep the girl for 14 days while carrying out investigations. Magistrate Temu ordered the suspect to appear in court after two weeks. The girl is currently held at Pap Onditi police station in Nyakach.
