Kakamega county has received Sh160 million from the World Bank and the Water Sector Trust Fund for infrastructural development to upgrade Mumias town to a municipality. The World Bank has donated Sh143 million while the Fund has given Sh17 million for the establishment of a Decentralized Waste Management Plant. Deputy Governor Philip Kutima said World Bank funding will progressively increase to Sh210 million. "Kakamega and Mumias are the only municipalities we have. We are investing heavily in improving the road network and social amenities," Kutima said in Mumias on Wednesday. He spoke at Bomani Grounds after presiding over the groundbreaking for the construction of the waste management plant. The project will be undertaken by the county Urban Water and Sanitation Corporation. Laban Ayiro who is the corporation chair and CEO Abdikidir Abdi were also present. Kutima said the facility will stop the current practice where waste is discharged into River Nzoia. Abdi said the facility will help reduce water-borne diseases by targeting the urban low-income population. He said the facility will also help to improve public sanitation and living conditions for the urban poor. "The project will also include operator's house, solid waste incinerator, construction of Safisan toilets and training of local artisans, emptor and operators," Abdi said. Ayiro said the 50m3 facility will serve 4,500 residents. "Our mandate is to supply clean water to homesteads and offer sewerage services to people. I appreciate Water Sector Trust Fund for this project as it will improve sanitation in Mumias," he said. The project will also be a source of revenue through exhauster services and also improve environmental hygiene. The deputy governor said the county is also committed to ensuring all homesteads are connected with clean pipe water. He said only one-third of the water available in Mumias is being used. "Our target is to ensure everybody has clean water," he said. Edited by R.Wamochie
