Two factions fighting for supremacy in a contractors' association signed a Memorandum of Understanding on Monday to work in peace as the county looks forward to receiving the first tranche of funds from the national government. Group leaders Wilfred Bosire and Jared Atancha said it was time the 300 members of the Kisii Contractors Association pulled together for the sake of advancing work in the region. The association has been dogged by in-fighting after some members disowned Bosire as their chairman in favour of Ken Mariera. In separate press conferences last week, the faction leaders said they were the bona fide leaders of the association. But speaking on Monday, Bosire said the fighting had died down and that they had agreed to work together. He said the unity of purpose among the protagonists who had been trading insults would now help the association move forward. He asked contractors who are yet to register with the association to do so to benefit from tenders floated by the national and county governments. "There is no need for anyone to work independently. Let us join hands to ensure teamwork in the association," Bosire said. He, however, asked Kisii Governor James Ongwae to pay them pending bills. "Some of our members have died of stress related to constant delays in the payment of their dues. We are happy the Senate has okayed the disbursement of some money meant to pay these bills," Bosire said. The Association's welfare chairman Jared Atancha said the infighting in the association has been fuelledÂ by some unscrupulous individuals who wanted to topple the current leadership.
