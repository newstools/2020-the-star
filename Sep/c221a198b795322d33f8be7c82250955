Centum Real Estate has launched 975 unit  housing development dubbed ‘365 Pavilion Place Apartments’ in Ruaraka. Launched in April this year, the apartments are located between Safari Park Hotel and USIU. The development will offer two types of 1, 2- and 3-bedroom apartments, priced from Sh4.8milllion with flexible payment plans. During the 30-month construction period, buyers will be able to stagger payments as they monitor the construction progress while taking advantage of the unit value appreciation. “Despite the affordability, the development is not compromising on quality therefore the apartments will be fitted with rooftop breakout areas, a community center, play areas, an equipped gym, jogging tracks, and multiple green spaces,” said Kariuki. Centum Real Estate has put up a variety of large-scale mixed-use developments in Nairobi, Kilifi, and Entebbe in Uganda and has recently announced its plan to roll out affordable developments in other Nairobi nodes.
