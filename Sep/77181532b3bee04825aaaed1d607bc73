The Kenya Wildlife Service is yet to receive Sh3 billion for allowing mega projects such as the standard gauge railway and the Southern Bypass road to pass through protected areas. Tourism CS Najib Balala disclosed this during a meeting with the National Assembly Departmental Committee on Environment and Natural Resources on September 7. Balala said as per the agreement for Phase 1 of SGR through Tsavo, the service was to receive Sh1,475,000,000. Of the amount, he said, Sh1,469,000,000 has been paid, leaving a balance of Sh6,000,000. The funding was to take care of the restoration of environment and compensation of movement of structures. “The management continues to demand payment of the remaining amount but Kenya Railways (KR) is yet to respond,” Balala said. He said a further Sh4 billion for phase 2A was to be paid. However, only Sh3.5 billion had been paid by May 14 this year. Balala said the amount was to be paid in seven instalments. He said the full amount was supposed to have been paid by December 2018. For SGR, through the Nairobi National Park, Sh192,000,000 was to be paid. Not a single cent has been paid. The amount was to cater for habitat restoration, management of invasive species, aerial surveillance, wildlife rescue and incremental costs of security. “The amount was payable on or before March 31, 2015,” he said. The CS further said that the Kenya National Highways Authority was to pay Sh3,740,713,840 to KWS for allowing the Southern Bypass to pass through the park. However, Kenha had only paid Sh1,266,033,840 by May 14 this year. This leaves a balance of Sh2,474,680,000. The CS said the amount was to be paid to KWS in four instalments. Balala said Tourism and Wildlife PS Fred Segor on June 2, 2020, wrote to both PS’s of State Department of Infrastructure and State Department of Transport requesting for follow up on the payment.
