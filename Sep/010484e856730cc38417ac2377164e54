The Covid-19 pandemic has presented an avenue for drug dealers to operate under the guise of essential services providers, Coast regional commissioner John Elungata has said. “We have information that some drug dealers have been ferrying drugs within this region under the cover of darkness. They have been masquerading as essential service providers," he said. Elungata said they will crack the whip on the drug dealers so that the Miritini Rehabilitation Centre will be of great benefit to the region. The administrator spoke on Thursday when the Kenya Ports Authority donated Sh1 million to Miritini Rehabilitation Centre to help fight against drug and alcohol abuse in the Coast region. National Authority for the Campaign Against Alcohol and Drug Abuse board chairperson Mabel Imbuga said alcohol and drug abuse is a major challenge affecting the youth in the region. She said Nacada and KPA have partnered to fight the vice in the region. “From the surveys carried out by the authority the challenge of alcohol and drug abuse is growing and unless we all join hands to reverse this trend, it will undermine our economic development and impact negatively on our security,” Imbuga said. "Our concern is the upsurge in drug abuse in our schools and the workplace where productivity is undermined by addiction related to absenteeism and reduced hours of productive work." Rashid Salim, KPA acting managing director reiterated the need for treatment and aftercare for persons with drug use disorders. “We are always at the forefront to offer counsel and input for the benefit of our community,” he said. The Miritini rehabilitation centre was established following a presidential directive in 2015 that led to the transformation of the previous Miritini National Youth Service (NYS) Camp into a drug rehabilitation centre to provide care and support to affected youths.
