A week-long power outage in Mfang’ano Island in Suba North has disrupted health and other essential services. Yokya and Nyakweri dispensaries are among health facilities that have scaled down their operations because of the power blackout, with residents sent to mainland Mbita town. Among operations that are no longer available at the centres include immunisation, which require storage of vaccines in refrigerators. Residents have called on Kenya Power to restore electricity supply. Resident Omondi Okumu said sample collection for tests at the laboratory have been affected. “The worst affected are mothers who deliver at night. They have to use other sources of light like their mobile phones,” Okumu said on Sunday. Patients referred to other facilities have to cross the lake on boats, a ferry or a water bus. The journey is costly and consumes a lot of time. “Cases of emergency are a headache. It would take more than one hour for a patient to get to the hospital when crossing the lake from the island,” Okumu added. Apart from health services, local traders who rely on electricity to run their businesses in Yokya and Nyakweri trading centres have suffered losses. Some businesses that have been affected include welding, computer services among others. Mary Otieno, a trader on the island, called on Kenya power to restore electricity to enable them to get back to their businesses. They appealed to Homa Bay government to intervene.
