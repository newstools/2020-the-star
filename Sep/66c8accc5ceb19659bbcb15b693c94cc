The Thirdway Alliance party has expelled its party leader Ekuru Aukot over financial impropriety and lack of transparency to party members. The party's Secretary-General Fredrick Okango on Wednesday said the decision was made "without any malice, bias or hatred" despite the former party leader hopping from one media house to the other to disparage the party's NEC decisions. Aukotâ€™s fate was decided by a resolution made by the party's National Executive Committee following his snub to appear before the party's discipline committee. "The disciplinary committee convened on September 4 and all witnesses and complaints appeared and testified, however, Aukot did not appear nor did he send an apology," Okango said. "NEC has today received disciplinary committee report which it (NEC) adopted unanimously and recommended that Aukot having no need to defend himself be dismissed from the party membership and position as party leader." In a statement to the media, Okango highlighted chronology of events leading to the expulsion including alleged intentional absenteeism from NEC meetings, impunity and intimidation. "As a young, democratic, progressive party that is founded by the rule of law, we have no time for sideshows and ego contests. We have an agenda to achieve and there shall be zero tolerance to impunity from any party member regardless of their status within the party ranks and society at large," he said. Aukot was last week suspended after claims he assaulted his deputy Dr Angela Mwikalio using crude words which were later published by online bloggers. He has also been accused of defying a court order in a children's case, hence violating Chapter Six of the Constitution of Kenya. The party's NEC suspended Aukot indefinitely and barred him from representing or transacting any business on behalf of the party.
