A  Masinde Muliro university student on Saturday succumbed to a snake bite at Kilimangodo in Lunga-Lunga Kwale county. Joseph Maneno 23, a second-year student died while receiving treatment at Kilimangodo dispensary. While confirming the incident,  area OCPD Peter Nzimbi said the deceased had gone for cattle grazing when the tragedy happened. Though reports had indicated that Maneno was bitten by a Cobra,  police report couldn’t verify the type of snake that bit him. Ferooz Mohammed, a resident in the area Lunga-Lunga is mainly infested with deadly Puff Adders, Black Mambas, Pythons, Cobras among others. He said the majority of snakes are found along river Umba all the way to Vanga. Police boss Nzimbi said the death can be attributed to the remoteness of the area. “The hospital was a bit far and of course the terrain is not conducive for a speedy ride,” he said. Maneno died half an hour after he arrived at the dispensary. The officer said it could also be possible that relatives had delayed for a long time before seeking medical assistance. His body was taken to Kwale mortuary. Maneno was pursuing medicine and had anticipated to safely join colleagues when schools reopen next year. This is after the Covid-19 pandemic paralysed learning activities forcing the government to close all learning institutions. In June Maweni residents in Matuga protested against snake infestation after a 27- year old man died from a cobra bite. Then the number of deaths due to snake bites in the area had risen to over four within January and March.
