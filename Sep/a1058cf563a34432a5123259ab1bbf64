Singer Nameless' father underwent successful brain surgery 10 days ago. Speaking to Word Is, Nameless said although the issue was supposed to be private, he chose to speak out to show gratitude. "Some things we must be grateful for them. My dad is 84 years old and so overcoming that means a lot to us as a family," he said. "He was a bit weaker, especially although he is usually a very strong person but you see him getting weaker over time." Nameless says his father's health started deteriorating very fast and at some point, he could not work. They became worried and thought he was falling into depression. "He could not walk. One side of the eye was also not working. He had some blood clots in his head that caused some minor strokes," he said. He was treated and discharged at the Aga Khan Hospital. "It was nerve-wracking for our family especially because of his age, but the surgery went well thanks to a brilliant team of doctors under the leadership of neurosurgeon Dr D Olunya," he said. Nameless compared the moment to a life-threatening situation that left him in the High Dependency Unit three years ago. "My mum was so stressed seeing him helpless, but I remember my wife being in the same situation when I was in the hospital three years ago," he said, adding that she started brightening up after she saw some hope of recovery. "When I see God giving us another chance, I appreciate life more and live to the fullness." He will be visiting his dad together with other family members to celebrate the recovery. Edited by T Jalio
