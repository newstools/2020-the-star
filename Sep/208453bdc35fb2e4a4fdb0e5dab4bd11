Athletics Kenya (AK) president Jack Tuwei has revealed the criteria used to select team Kenya to the Kip Keino Classic Continental Tour. Tuwei said they relied on the current ranking and past results posted by home athletes during last year’s World Athletics Championships in Doha, Qatar, All African Games in Rabat, Morocco and the national championships to determine which athlete will fly the Kenyan flag. Tuwei said they settled for the three events due to the coronavirus pandemic which impeded them from holding trials and also engineered the suspension of sporting activities. “Since we couldn’t hold trials owing to the threat posed by the virus, we opted for the world rankings and results from the World Championships, All Africa Games and national championships,” he said. The AK boss further said the provisional lists of the participants will be out today. He, however, anticipates that the number will swell courtesy of the deadline which is set for Friday. “We welcome both international and local athletes to the event. Provisional lists of all athletes have been done and will be available to the public tomorrow (today). The number is expected to grow as the entries will be closed by Friday,” he added. In the meantime, Tuwei hailed Cabinet Secretary for Sports, Amina Mohamed for spearheading the renovation works at the Nyayo National Stadium which has been earmarked to host the event. “I sincerely want to thank the Cabinet Secretary for her efforts in ensuring the facility will be completed. I also thank the government for allocating resources towards the construction of stadiums in different parts of the country,” he added
