A businessman is seeking the court's help to stop the county government of Kakamega from repossessing his undeveloped plot. Robert Lutta, through Wafula Wawire and Company Advocates, on Thursday obtained temporary orders restraining the county from interfering with his plot L. R No Kakamega/Municipality/Block 1/164. Kakamega chief magistrate Billdad Ochieng issued the orders. The plot is listed among 135 undeveloped plots to be repossessed by the county government. The county government listed the plots on its website and in an advertisement on August 21. In a sworn affidavit, Lutta says the county government selectively listed his property for repossession and omitted other properties with the same status because of favouritism. "Action by the defendant is not only illegal, unlawful, untenable and actionable by law but also an attempt by it to unlawfully usurp my legal ownership and possession of the suit property," he says. Lutta says he has been paying the requisite rates and related charges accruing to the suit property. He says the county administration listed his plot for repossession without any probable cause and its actions could breach the peace. The businessman says his attempts to be informed why his plot had been advertised for repossession were met with hostility. The case will be heard on September 15. Edited by A.N
