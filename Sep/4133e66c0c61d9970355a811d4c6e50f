Matatus will be barred from the city centre after the Nairobi Metropolitan Services announces plans to decongest the city. NMS Director-General Mohammed Badi on Monday said that his office has set up various bus termini outside the CBD. Badi disclosed to the National Assembly’s Committee on Administration and National Security that President Uhuru Kenyatta will launch the termini once the plans are finalised in November. Once the plans are actualised, matatus currently using Jogoo Road and Haile Selassie Avenue will terminate their journey at Muthurwa, while those using Mombasa and Langata roads will use the Railway Golf land along Uhuru Highway. Also, an express way will be set up running from the Kenya Planters Cooperative Union near the Wakulima Market all the way to Jogoo Road. Matatus using the Thika Superhighway will terminate their journey at the newly completed Ngara and Parklands termini. “Some of these lands have been marked and works have kicked off. NMS is also looking for other lands that can be used as bus termini outside the busy city centre,” Badi said. On March 18 at State House when NMS was established and handed over to DG Badi, the President asked the office to operationalise two matatu termini at Desai Road and Park Road in order to avoid the use of city streets as parking for matatus. To further improve traffic management and help in decongesting the CBD, NMS was also tasked to rehabilitate and reintroduce the use of traffic signals. However, plans to decongest the city are not new to the public as it remains an unfulfilled manifesto for both Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko and his predecessor Evans Kidero. Also, the National Government had embarked on plans to introduce the Bus Rapid Transit bus plan that has not been actualised up to date.
