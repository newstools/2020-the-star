The number of deaths announced by ministry daily is not entirely the deaths that occurred on that day, Doctor Patrick Amoth has said. Amoth who is the Health acting director-general of ministry on Wednesday disclosed this during the question and answer session on Wednesday. "The deaths reported in the last 10 days are not entirely deaths that occurred in the 10 days. The numbers are based on a mortality audit which the Health Ministry commissioned," Amoth said. Amoth said that the ministry teams find deaths that may have occurred even months ago but which had to be accounted for. The country registered seven more deaths on Tuesday bringing the total number of fatalities to 707. He further noted that the deaths that are linked to Covid-19 are for patients who test positive for the virus and also meet a certain clinical presentation. "If someone were to die in a road accident after testing +ve for Covid-19, the death will definitely not be attributable to Covid-19 and hence will not be recorded as Covid mortality," he said. "We, however, continue aggregating the other deaths." On Monday, the President allowed restaurants and bars to close later, at 10 pm instead of 8 pm. They should operate in strict adherence to Covid-19 containment measures. Places of worship will be required to adhere to all health guidelines, with only a third of worshippers to attend at any one time. The number of people attending ceremonies such as funerals and weddings was reviewed upwards from 100 people to 200. The country's Covid-19 positivity rate has fallen from 13 per cent in June and seven per cent in August and it now stands at 4.4 per cent in September, Uhuru said.
