Non-governmental organisations and government officials on Thursday met in Dadaab, Garissa county, to discuss what to do with the decommissioned Sh2 billion Kambioos and IFO 2 refugee camps. The camps were closed in 2017 and 2018 respectively due to the reduction of the number of refugees after a voluntary repatriation programme.Â A total of 85,067 refugees have since left the camps. Both camps were handed over to the county government in June 2019. Speaking when he opened the workshop, Trade and Cooperatives executive Adow Jubat urged participants to come up with a sustainable redevelopment plan so that the local community could benefit from the two camps. Dadaab MCA Farah Mohamed urged the UN-Habitat team to involve the local community in every step and decision they make. The infrastructure left behind can provide the local community with housing, health, water, sanitation and livelihoods. The next steps in the process will involve the degazettement of the land, conduct an onsite infrastructure audit, rehabilitate infrastructure and develop a spacial plan. Those present included Lands chief officer Sirat Aden, his Public Works counterpart Hussein Farah, Housing and Lands committee chairperson Shindes Mohamed, representatives from UN-Habitat and UNHCR, and officials from the national and county governments.
