Jubilee Party vice chairman David Murathe has censured Deputy President William Ruto, accusing him of mobilising a 'No campaign' even before the Building Bridges Initiative hands over its final report. Murathe said it is wrong to oppose a referendum before knowing the contents of the BBI report. "I'm surprised that some people are opposing a referendum yet they have not seen the final report. People are taking positions on a document they have not seen. A document that has not been unveiled or presented to the two principals, " he said during an interview with Citizen TV on Tuesday night. Speaking during the he weekend at the Coast, Ruto said the Constitution should be fully implemented and not amended. Murathe said nobody is privy to the contents of the BBI's final report."We are all waiting for the document to be unveiled and only then will we know what lies ahead," he added. "Everybody had a chance to present their views to the BBI task force as it was going round collecting opinions." Last week, Ruto had said no one had sought his views on BBI as a member of Jubilee, but Murathe said the President's stand is taken as the stand of the party.
