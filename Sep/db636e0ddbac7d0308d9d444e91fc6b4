 Real Sociedad winger Mikel Oyarzabal has withdrawn from Spain’s Uefa Nations League squad after testing positive for Covid-19, with Villarreal forward Gerard Moreno taking his place. Oyarzabal, 23, said on Sunday he would have to self-isolate at home and miss next month’s Nations League matches against Germany and Ukraine. “I want to communicate that I’ve received a positive result from my last test,” Oyarzabal, who has won seven caps, wrote on Instagram. “I have to be at home for a few days and I won’t be able to go to the national team.” Moreno, who made his international debut last year, scored 18 goals for Villarreal in the 2019-20 season, guiding them to a fifth-place finish.
