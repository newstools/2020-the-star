Jubilee Party Vice Chairman David Murathe has acknowledged knowing a man linked to a company which is at the centre of the Kemsa tender saga, but has denied being involved in supplying goods to the government. The man he was referring to is William Gachoka, who is a director of Kilig Ltd, which was allegedly awarded a tender to supply Kemsa with 450,000 personal protective kits. "I have absolutely nothing to do with Kilig..." Murathe said during an interview with Citizen TV on Tuesday night. "I have partnered with William on a number of issues but not on this one... We are family friends from childhood... We are consultants. We do a lot of consultant business..." Murathe alleged Kilig was not under Gachoka during the Kemsa tender period. He went ahead to drag Deputy President William into the saga. Murathe alleged that 'known business associates' of Deputy President William Ruto were involved in the scandal. “We have the legal transfers, and the bank accounts.. The owners of the company are known partners of the deputy president,” Murathe alleged without tabling evidence. Murathe asked the investigative agencies to focus on firms which he said were awarded tenders but supplied air. “This is what we expect the investigative agencies to deal with and not to throw names,” he said.
