Bahati's wife Diana Marua says hormonal breakout two months after she gave birth left her face swollen. Speaking on their YouTube channel, Diana said she had bad breakouts that were not fading off. "I called my doctor every other time and he told me to give it at least six months. It was so hard for me to post and we had a reality show," she said. Someone sent her a message for products that made it even worse as her skin started reacting. "I had red pigmentation all over. My face was triple what it is now, I freaked out and woke up my husband to go to the hospital." Diana finally visited a skin specialist, who admitted her. "They injected me with an anti-allergy before and now, I can comfortably walk without doing makeup," she said.
