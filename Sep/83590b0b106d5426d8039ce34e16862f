Businessman Chris Obure and his bodyguard Robert Bodo have been charged with the murder of Kevin Omwenga. They denied the charge before Justice Mumbi Ngugi. It is alleged that on August 21 at Galana Apartments they murdered Omwenga. Earlier on Wednesday, Obure had his application challenging his murder plea dismissed. Justice Ngugi said Obure's application lacked merit and he cannot dictate to the DPP whether to make him an accused or a state witness. The court further ruled it is the trial court that will look at the said evidence produced by Obure as a defence. Obure and his bodyguard Robert Bodo are suspects in the murder of Kevin Omwenga on August 21. Obure’s lawyers opposed his taking a plea after their application to stop him from pleading to the murder charge. The Directorate of Public Prosecutions on Tuesday claimed that the businessman was seen near the late Kevin Omwenga's house on the day of the murder. In their response to Obure's application challenging murder charge, the state says they have evidence to charge the businessman with murder. The DPP says Obure was placed at the scene of crime adding that he was in the vicinity of Omwenga's house on that night. The court further heard that Obure has given contradicting statements about his whereabouts on the day of the murder. Meanwhile, Obure's lawyer told the court that his client was exhibiting Covid-19 symptoms and should be taken for testing. Justice Ngugi directed the police take him for a test. In the meantime, he will be remanded at Kileleshwa Police Station where he has been since his arrest to await results and bail hearing on Monday next week.
