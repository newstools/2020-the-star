A Kinangop farmer is a bitter man after he woke up on Tuesday to find his four cows writhing in pain, having been slashed at night by unidentified persons. Jeremiah Karanja said the incident happened at around 3am in the cowshed of his Rwanyambo village home. His family members heard a commotion in the compound and when they went to check what was happening, they found the cows on the ground with deep panga cuts in the neck, back and legs. Some could barely stand. Karanja said it was unimaginable that someone could destroy his family’s only source of livelihood given that they have no grudges against anyone. He estimated his loss to be more than Sh260,000. A  neighbour, Elizabeth Maina, said she heard the sound of footsteps outside her compound. “I checked the time and wondered why someone could be running at 3am. Minutes later, Karanja called me. He told me someone had slashed his cows and asked me to check if my cows were okay,” Elizabeth said. Nyumba Kumi elder Joseph Maina called on the government to step up security in the area. He condemned the incident, saying whoever committed the offence was out to undermine peace and unity in the community. Maina commended the local administrators and the police for promptly launching investigations on the attack. Kinangop subcounty police commander Phyllis Kanina said it was a matter of time before the perpetrators of the crime were arrested. “We have crucial leads. My people are on the ground and are coordinating well with the local community,” she told the Star by phone.
