The Busia county government will spend Sh54 million to expand Osieko-Nambo water project to benefit more residents of Bunyala South ward. Governor Sospeter Ojaamong said on Tuesday the Osieko community has submitted the budget for the planned project which he said will cover over 20km to areas like Mau Mau. "My government will fast track the completion of Sidokho bridge, which was delayed owing to Lake Victoria backflow that rendered it impassable to continue with the Sh47 million project, " he said. He presided over a community empowerment programme at Siagonjo stadium. Ojaamong said the county will receive an additional Sh1.1 billion in 2021-2022 financial year following the deal struck by senators in the revenue-sharing formula. The residents will benefit from increased resource allocation, he said. Deputy Governor Moses Mulomi appreciated the efforts of area MCA Casper Ajuma in empowering youth and women. A total of 40 motorbikes were issued to the youths, bringing to 80 the total issued to date. Also distributed were posho mills, motorboat engines, water pump generators, Jikokoa, bags of sugar andÂ  bales of wheat flour. Edited by Henry Makori
