Kisumu All Stars will name a new technical bench after the FKF/KPL relegation/promotion play off. The club’s chief executive officer said the interim technical bench led by Andrew Aroka will be in charge of the team’s end of the season play-off  against Vihiga United on October 7 and October 11. “We received quite a number of applications from Kenyans and foreigners. The board is going through the applications and we expect to have the new team in place after the play off,” said Ochieng. The Kisumu County government-sponsored team, popularly known as the Blue Eagles, are seeking to recruit  head coach, assistant coach, physical trainer and goalkeeper trainer. He said the club has started preparations for the play-off and exuded confidence that the team will maintain their top tier league status. “It has been a very long break and we welcome the announcement by the federation. The players have been training on their own but fitness levels are down. We shall use the three weeks to seriously prepare for the two games,” he added. According to FKF head of competitions, Frank Ogolla, a meeting will be held to determine the team that will play the first leg at home. Vihiga United will be seeking to return to the top tier league after the club finished third in the National Super League while Kisumu All Stars will hope to keep their KPL status. With the relegation of Chemelil and Sony Sugar, Kisumu All Stars and Western Stima are the only teams in the top tier league from Nyanza. Western Stima have so far lost 11 players, most of them having joined KPL champions Gor Mahia and moneybags Wazito. The team’s head coach Salim Babu also joined Wazito as an assistant coach.
