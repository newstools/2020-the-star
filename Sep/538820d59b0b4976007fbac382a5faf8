Nairobi County Assembly Deputy Speaker John Kamangu has officially resigned from his position. Speaker Benson Mutura on Thursday announced elections to pick a new deputy speaker will take place next week on Tuesday. Kamangu's resignation comes following a row over the ‘occupancy’ of the deputy speaker’s post after the Minority side settled on former Mayor Geoffrey Majiwa to fill the position. The selection last month happened despite there being no vacancy as Ruai MCA Kamangu still held the position. Kamangu told Jubilee MCAs after Majiwa's nomination that he was still in office. “Let me take this opportunity to tell our members that the seat of the deputy speaker is not vacant. I am the deputy speaker and I don’t want our people to listen to the rumour mongers. Please stand with me,” he said. ODM had said while announcing its pick that there was an agreement with Jubilee that the position would be filled by the Minority side after it backed the election of the ruling party's Benson Mutura as the speaker.
