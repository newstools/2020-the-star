The two-storey  Sh47.3 million Wajir North Technical Training Institute is supposed to be completed on October 3 but it is only 24 per cent done. “Despite the contractor having been paid over 50 per cent of the cost, it is pitiable so little has been completed," Wajir county commissioner Jacob Narengo said on Wednesday during inspection. He urged residents to actively supervise government-funded projects. “You should own any projects in this area since they are for the benefit of this community," Narengo said. Residents should monitor projects and report any laxity, he said. “If you notice work is slow or the contractor and his crew have not shown up on site, report to the deputy county commissioner or police, the administrator said. The training institute will house classrooms, workshops, a library and offices. Narengo instructed deputy county commissioner Jackton Ojwang, project supervising engineer Stephen Ndatho and county vocational director Yussuf Kassim to closely monitor the works.  (Edited by V.
