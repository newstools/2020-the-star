Health PS Susan Mochache now says there is no actual loss of public funds at the Kenya Medical Supplies Authority. Mochache while appearing before the Health Committee on Wednesday said most of the items are still under procurement and were immediately halted following the 'Covid millionaire' expose. "I can confirm that we do not have an actual loss of public funds. No funds meant for other programmes have been diverted to procure Covid-19 items," she said. Mochache said there is still money that has not been committed and utilised and thus any fears of misuse should be dispelled. She said the status of utilisation of the funds will only be revealed when the ongoing investigations and audit are completed. Mochache further dismissed claims that a company by the name KILIG Limited was among those that had been paid Sh4 billion to supply PPEs. She said the ministry was not aware of which stakeholders that Kemsa claimed to have consulted with in regards to the procurement. "I don't know who the billionaires are because I am not among the buyers and no one has asked me about the procurement. I believe that whoever bought them contacted the procurement agency," she said. She added, "Madam chair for the fact that we noted the mismatch in good time, it means we are well on top of things". Mochache said she has not been under any influence or pressure with regard to the procurement process. "Going by what has been paid the said company is not within any amount Kemsa has spent," she said. KILIG company was said to be among briefcase companies that had benefited from the procurement saga. According to an expose run by the Daily Nation, on January 22, Ms Onyango, barely 30 years old, registered the company weeks before Africa reported its first coronavirus case. Several weeks later, it was alleged her company was handpicked and handed a Sh4 billion tender to supply hundreds of thousands of Personal Protective Equipment (PPEs).
