Former Vihiga MP Yusuf Chanzu is plotting a comeback to the political scene three years after losing the gubernatorial seat. Chanzu vied on an ANC ticket in 2017, but came third after Moses Akaranga and Wilbur Ottichilo. “I have decided to do away with my gubernatorial race in the coming election of 2022 and focus on Vihiga seat,” Chanzu said. He was MP for three terms. He said he "contested for the governor's seat without thinking. That was my biggest mistake in my political life". Vihiga is the home base of ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi, who intends to vie for presidency in 2022. According to the former lawmaker, a balance for power-sharing in the county is needed. He sees the Bunyore community voting as a bloc against the Maragolis. “Contesting the gubernatorial seat with Senator George Khaniri and  incumbent Ottichilo won’t be easy,” Chanzu said. Khaniri is yet to publicly declare his interest in the gubernatorial seat. Chanzu, who was addressing the press at Friends Church Kidundu in Central Maragoli, said Ernest Kagesi has failed to represent the Vihiga people in Parliament. He cited that as the reason he intended to make a comeback "to tame the high rate of corruption that has marred CDF projects". He accused the MP of single-sourcing and awarding CDF projects to close allies. Efforts to reach Kagesi for comment failed.  His phone was turned off and text messages were not responded to.
