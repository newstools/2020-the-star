Nyeri has sworn in its first county attorney to handle all legal matters. Rucuiya Kimani took office on Thursday in an event presided over by Nyeri chief magistrate Wendy Kagendo. Governor Mutahi Kahiga said county attorney Kimani will represent the administration in all disputes and advise departments on legislative and other legal matters. He will also be required to interpret documents and agreements for and on behalf of the county among other roles as the law provides. Kimani will be the depository of all county laws and legal documents and agreements signed for and on behalf of the county executives. The county attorney will hold the status and rank of a county executive committee member and will sit in their meetings chaired by the governor. “This is a very important position in the county administration and my government is keen on having a model administrative structure. As you are well aware, the county’s attorney’s office was established by the Office of the County Attorney’s Act, 2020,” Kahiga said. The county chief said he has total confidence in his appointee and expects him to deliver on his mandate. Kimani has served the county for the last three years as legal adviser. “Even as we appoint him today, we are merely putting the seal of confidence that we have had in him,” Kahiga said. The governor called on the county assembly, the executive committee and the service board to support the attorney in his execution of his mandate. Kimani will be tasked with laying the legal foundation, including helping the county get an official flag and official court of arms.  (edited by o. owino)
