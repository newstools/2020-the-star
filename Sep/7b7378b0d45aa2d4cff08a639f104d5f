Bomet county aims to vaccinate more than 10,000 dogs to prevent deadly rabies. County director of veterinary services Dr Wilson Serem said the programme also aims to ensure herd immunity against rabies. He said they aim to vaccinate 70 per cent of the dogs, virtually eradicating the disease. However, it can also be spread by rodents and and bats. Rabies is a zoonotic disease that can be transferred to human beings and SeremÂ  urged pet owners to ensure their animals are vaccinated annually. He was speaking at Sugurmega in Chepalungu during the launch of the vaccination ahead of World Rabies Day on Monday, September 28. "Vaccination of the pets is done at no cost through the support of partners which include Red Cross, Tenwek Hospital and pharmaceutical companies," Serem said. The response among residents has been good, he said. Monica Okwanyi from the Red Cross said, "The programme strengthens the ability of communities and other partners in preventing, detecting and responding to disease threats." Health officials said despite the increase in dog bites, the number of reported cases has declined.  (Edited by V. Graham)
