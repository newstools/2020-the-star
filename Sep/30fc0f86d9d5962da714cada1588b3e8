President Uhuru Kenyatta has challenged leaders in the country to offer services to all Kenyans without considering their ethnicity. He admonished leaders who are going around the country preaching hate and division saying Kenyans need development and not empty political rhetoric. Addressing Changamwe residents in Mombasa on Monday evening, Uhuru said that Kenyans are focused on what will see them feed their families. “They want to be able to access medical services, good roads, food to their families but not to be told how people are based on tribe,” Uhuru said. The president started his extensive inspection tour of national government development projects in the Coastal region last Saturday. He started his day-long inspection at Liwatoni on Mombasa island where the government is constructing the Sh1.9 billion Likoni pedestrian floating bridge. The 1.2-kilometre bridge, the first of its kind in the region, is at a 51 per cent completion rate and will be ready for use by end of this year. When complete, the bridge is expected to ease pressure on the Likoni ferry crossing by taking up most of the foot traffic, leaving the ferries to serve vehicular cargo between Mombasa and the South Coast. Uhuru also rallied Kenyans to work together for the unity and development of the country. "It is good to desire leadership…but leadership must be about bringing people together. People should come together, love each other and walk the same journey because leadership belongs to the people," the President said. The President also inspected the ongoing construction of the first segment of the Mariakani Highway which runs from Mombasa to Kwa Jomvu.
