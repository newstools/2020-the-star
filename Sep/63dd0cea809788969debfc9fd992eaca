A Nairobi court on Wednesday barred Tharaka Nithi Governor Muthomi Njuki from accessing his county offices over a Sh34 million case. While releasing him on Sh6 million bail, chief magistrate Douglas Ogoti ordered him not to go anywhere near his county office unless he is accompanied by the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission officers to pick his personal belongings. The county boss has also been warned not to contact any of the witnesses in the case. Fridah Muthoni Murungi, the CEC for Environment and Natural Resources, was also released on a Sh6 million bail and ordered not to access her office until the case is heard and determined. Ogoti also released 19 other accused persons on different bail terms,  depending on the number of counts they each face. The magistrate said he had considered the seriousness of the offence they face when he granted bail to the accused persons. On Tuesday, Muthomi was charged with several counts of corruption relating to the loss of Sh34 million county funds. Muthomi was jointly charged with 19 others with the offense of conspiracy to commit corruption. It was alleged that between January 1 and October 31, 2018, at Tharaka Nithi county offices, they conspired to embezzle Sh34,998,500 from the county in relation to the tender of the supply and installation of an incinerator. Muthomi, David Mwangi, Margaret Mugweru were further charged with fraudulent practices in procurement. It was alleged that  being directors of Generation Electronics and Allied Ltd, they engaged in a fraudulent procurement practice by procuring and supplying an incinerator to the county government. The court heard that they supplied, installed and commissioned the incinerator while misrepresenting the facts that it was procured and supplied by Westomaxx Investments Ltd. Muthomi was further charged with a third count of conflict of interest in relation to the tender. The case will mentioned virtually on October 22.
