The State has 14 days to file its response in a case in which a parent is calling for the reopening of schools beginning this month. High Court Judge James Makau issued the directive on Wednesday following a case filed by Joseph Aura, a parent of three children. Aura claims the indefinite closure of schools was affecting children, yet the government has failed to put in place measures to address the issue, since the institutions were closed in March. Judge Makau also extended orders stopping the government's plans to roll out community-based learning, a programme that is meant to engage learners during the current period of Covid-19 pandemic. CS Education George Magoha has since filed a preliminary objection asking he court to dismiss the case. Magoha and CS Health Mutahi Kagwe claim that the unplanned reopening of schools will undermine the containment measures already put in place. The case will be mentioned on October 6.
