The back and forth between government officials has intensified publicly with Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen making the latest attack. Via Twitter on Saturday, Murkomen claimed that Environment CS Keriako Tobiko had not contributed anything to the union between President Uhuru Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto. "Tobiko, you contributed nothing to UhuRuto. In both Ilpolosat and Mashuri polling stations NASA won.Your MCAs both in Imaroro and Kaputiei wards are NASA," Murkomen said. He added: "No one knows you in your village, which you only visit for funerals. In Embobut, Uhuru won all votes. You can’t defend him better than me." The row that has been simmering in the Jubilee Party erupted into full-scale political combat after Tobiko blasted the deputy president, calling him a mere clerk. “The deputy president should be the clerk of the President. The way I respect the President as his clerk, even the deputy president and Murkomen should respect the President," he said. Tobiko’s stinging attack came when he toured parts of Narok. His statement was a response to a tweet by Murkomen in which the legislator referred to Tobiko as a mere clerk who needed to respect the President. The UhuRuto marriage that blossomed in 2013 started plummeting at the beginning of their second term in office in 2018. It worsened with the handshake between Uhuru and ODM leader Raila Odinga in March of the same year. UhuRuto's relationship is now characterised by hard-hitting attacks targeted at each other. The one-time unified Jubilee is in a shambles and the Cabinet deeply divided.
