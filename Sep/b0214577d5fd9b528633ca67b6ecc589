Singer Otile Brown has turned down an Afrimma Awards nomination. He was nominated among the best male artistes in East Africa. In an Instagram post, Otile mockingly asked, "Does Afrimma still nominate people? Always count me out." He then dragged in Tanzanian artistes, specifically Diamond, Rayvanny and Harmonize, saying the organisers should not nominate him but instead consider artistes who use animals' names as their AKAs. "It is not my style,'' he added. Diamond calls himself Simba; Rayvanny, Chui; while Harmonize calls himself Tembo. "My fans do not even vote for me in the awards, they already know I am the best," he wrote. Other Kenyan artistes nominated include Nadia Mukami, Khaligraph Jones and Tanasha.
