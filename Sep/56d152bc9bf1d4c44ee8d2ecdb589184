An appellate court in Nairobi has substituted a 15-year jail term with a five-year sentence for a man convicted of defiling a girl aged 16. The court established that the two had a relationship. Boniface Gitonga, 22, was sentenced to 15 years in December last year after Tigania senior resident magistrate found him guilty of defiling the child. The court heard that Gitonga committed the offence between January 2 and 6 last year at Amwari in Meru county. But delivering the appeal ruling on August 20, Justice David Majanja said that from the evidence at the trial, the complainant testified that she knew the appellant and that they had a sexual relationship between 2013 and 2016. The girl testified that on January 1, 2019 she had left home to go see her grandmother but she instead went to see Gitonga. After she went missing her parents started looking for her and later found her with Gitonga. Her father reported the incident to police and Gitonga was arrested. Gitonga denied the charges and in a sworn testimony stated that he did not have a relationship with the girl. Majanja said he considered the evidence and the ages of the complainant who was 16 years old and the appellant 22, and the fact that they had a prior relationship. “In order to protect children from sexual predation and exploitation the law provides for heavy penalties. In this instance, I find the term  of 15 years imprisonment harsh and excessive,” he said. "I allow  the appeal on sentence and substitute the sentence of 15 years imprisonment with five years imprisonment.” Edited by Henry Makori
