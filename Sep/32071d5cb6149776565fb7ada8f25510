Garissa police are investigating how 12 Somali aliens were smuggled into the country in a vehicle fitted with Government of Kenya number plates. Aliens smuggling involves a complex web of cartels colluding with rogue police, authorities say. The syndicate also smuggles contraband goods. North Eastern regional commander Nick Ndalana said public servants risk losing their jobs if they are found to be involved. The vehicle, a Toyota Land Cruise, was intercepted by police at the Tana Bridge barrier. It was fitted with number plates GKB 390 C. OCPD Joseph Muriuki told the press on Saturday a search of NTSA records established the vehicle belonged to Garissa county, registration plates KCT 620 Z. “Given that the vehicle had GK number plates, our investigating officers wanted to know which department it belonged to. To their surprise, it belonged to Garissa county, with a different number plate," he said at his office. “We wanted to establish how the GK number plates got into the hands of this county driver. We suspect collusion but are yet to establish it," Muriuki said. The aliens, all men, are aged between 15 and 35 years, the OCPD said. Authorities want to find  out who else e aided their movement to Garissa and beyond.  Preliminary investigation etablished that the aliens, who were coming from Mogadish, had no travel documents and were on their way to Nairobi. Ndalana said smuggling of aliens and contraband are flourishing despite continued warnings by the government. (Edited by V. Graham)
