Kemsa has exonerated Health CS Mutahi Kagwe in the Sh738 million procurement process. Suspended CEO Jonah Manjari had claimed that he received instructions from Kagwe on how to procure Covid-19 kits. Appearing in Parliament on Wednesday, Kagwe distanced himself from any alleged scandal at the Kenya Medical Supplies Authority. Kagwe admitted that he applied pressure on Manjari because of the emergency of managing the pandemic and he had no apologies to make. In an about-turn on Thursday, the team from Kemsa said the CS had no role in the procurement. The team tabled a status report of the spending in the procurement process for Sh738 million and Sh7.1 billion worth of Covid-19 supplies. "The PS and CS had no direct role in the procurement process. The role of the PS was to authorise the use of available World Bank Funds to make payments against procurements already undertaken by Kemsa," the statement read. It had been claimed that Kagwe and his PS Susan Mochache had written to Manjari, and even sent SMSs to put him under pressure to give tenders to particular companies, a claim Kagwe  denied. This comes as Manjari changed tune on procurement, saying that the agency was not coerced to award tenders to specific companies. "We were not instructed to procure those items from those suppliers as has been alluded earlier," he said while appearing before the National Assembly Health Committee on Thursday. "AS CEO, I did not work under any pressure, I did these with my eyes open." Manjari continued, "Under my watch, no money was lost and I did not oversee any loss of funds. All commodities supplied have been utilised and those not utilised are intact." The Committee chaired by Murang’a Woman Representative Sabina Chege questioned the suspended official on Kemsa's role in the procurement of Covid-19 items. Manjari was suspended last month following allegations that the authority flouted procurement regulations.
