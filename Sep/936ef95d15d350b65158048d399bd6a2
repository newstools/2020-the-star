The National Police Service has refuted claims that officers within the Nairobi region have been directed to secure the new uniforms at their own cost. Spokesperson Charles Owino in a statement on Wednesday said all officers have been fully kitted with the deep blue uniform since it was adopted in 2018. Owino's sentiments come after a local daily ran an article indicating that junior officers had cried foul after an order that they were meant to buy and wear the new uniforms. According to the article, Nairobi Regional Commander Rashid Yakub had directed the officers to make their own arrangements and secure the uniforms at their cost. But Owino said for the purposes of a smooth transition, police officers have continued to use the old uniform. "We wish to state that since Nairobi area police Officers have been fully kitted with the deep blue working dress," Owino said. He said there are 6,000 and 2,000 male and female officers' uniforms respectively awaiting collection at the central stores. "Officers who may have not collected their uniforms have been directed to do so immediately," he said. Earlier on in an interview with the Star, Yakub said no officer will be allowed to report to duty without the deep blue uniform. Yakub said the officers have also been instructed not to mix the new uniform with the old one. The Star had established that since Monday, officers who had not secured the new uniform were turned away from their stations. Yakub said action would be taken against such officers. "Two years since we adopted the uniform, all officers are supposed to have acquired more than two pairs. Why some officers are resisting change remains a mystery," he said.
