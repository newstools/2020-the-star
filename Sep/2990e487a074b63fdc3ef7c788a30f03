A Standard 7 pupil in Kachieng village of Karachuonyo constituency was Monday buried alive in a sand quarry. Steven Ochieng, 17, of Apuko DOH Primary School was harvesting sand for sale, a popular economic activity in the area. It is reported that Ochieng’ was in the company of his fellow villagers who were also mining in a nearby quarry. Ochieng’ was excavating sand inside the quarry when the topsoil became weak and buried him. Those who were harvesting quarry raised the alarm before a number of residents gathered at the scene to rescue him. However, their efforts proved futile after they found him dead. Residents suspected that the top soil was weakened by heavy rainfall on Sunday night. Speaking to journalists, chief Damianus Osano said the boy suffocated. “It seems the fallen soil caught the boy unawares. Residents who removed the soil to rescue Ochieng’ found him dead,” Osano said. He warned parents against engaging children in sand harvesting and other economic activities. “Sand harvesting will prevent children from going to school. Let parents desist from engaging them in income-generating activities,” the administrator said. The minor’s body was moved to Kendu Adventist Hospital mortuary. Edited by R.Wamochie
