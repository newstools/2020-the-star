The Covid-19 pandemic has brought huge challenges and uncertainties to the global populations and a lot of stresses. All the sectors are adversely affected— education, employment, economy, and health — resulting in poverty and social conflicts in many countries, especially developing ones that have scarce resources, and much higher population is at risks. We have started observing the direct impacts on food supply and agriculture in many regions. Small community enterprises are affected, and the tourism has shut down, leaving the most vulnerable groups of communities with multiple issues to sustain everyday life. Managing the outbreak of Covid-19 has been a challenge for many developing countries where testing services aren’t easily accessible to the communities; many have died without knowing the cause and deaths will continue to rise in coming days. Countries, which are generally staggering with higher mortalities, sessional communicable diseases and disasters, are hit hard by the rapid transmission of virus. A recent report of  the impact of Covid-19 in Nepal by UNDP notes that “the Covid-19 pandemic has disrupted supply chains, shut or threatened the survival of small and informal enterprises, and made people highly vulnerable to falling back into poverty through widespread loss of income and jobs.” The increase of social and economic and health problems in developing countries needs serious attention to implement tailored responses before the death toll becomes unmanageable. Without urgent and context appropriate strategic responses, the situation will get worse and the livelihood of most vulnerable communities will be impacted severely. This leads to the dreadful future of extensive inequalities which the world will struggle to address for many years to come. Lewis Khamasi
