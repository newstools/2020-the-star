Some Bungoma MCAs want Webuye East deputy county commissioner Chaka Nyamawi transferred for allegedly interfering with county development projects. Led by Maraka MCA Ali Machani and his Ndivisi ward counterpart Martin Wanyonyi, the ward reps have urged Interior CS Fred Matiang'i to transfer the administrator. "It's now clear that the biggest impediment to the development agenda of our constituency is one Chaka Nyamawi, the current Webuye East deputy county commissioner,"  Wanyonyi said. He said the official has frustrated construction of Sinoko maternity block and construction of Muchi polytechnic in Maraka ward. "He is bullying chiefs and their assistants into heeding his orders, hence disrupting the county government projects. He is no longer needed here," the ward rep said. Machani said he will fight to ensure Muchi polytechnic construction goes on as planned. "On Tuesday, the administrator ordered chiefs and their assistants to destroy the fence surrounding Muchi polytechnic without involving elected leaders," Machani said. However, Nyamawi has stood his ground, saying he was only following 'orders from above' to try and secure government properties. Edited by A.N
