The recent arraignment of Lari MP Jonah Mburu and his Malindi counterpart Aisha Jumwa on allegations of graft involving NGCDF cash has sent shockwaves in the National Assembly. The voltage has hit a high in the wake of indications by investigative agencies that they could have a date with more members. A lawmaker was overheard whispering to his colleague that they need to put their house in order lest they miss out in the next general election. Sleuths are said to have begun knocking doors of some of the CDF patrons with questions on how they’ve managed the kitty. *** Who is minting millions from a tent that is normally put up in anticipation of full Senate sittings and paid for despite the same not being used in the event a meeting does not take off?  Well, Corridors is apprised that whenever the tent — owned by a senior Parliament official — is erected, the man nets Sh1 million. The tent, which comes with full audio installation, was set on Monday but wasn’t used.

A first-term lawmaker from the Rift Valley is eliciting talk following the confounding signals of which side of the political divide the fellow is supporting. The MP recently shocked compatriots in the face of an attack on the government, yet had been judged to be pro-handshake. Before the dust of the fears of the shifting loyalties settled, the MP fired another salvo at Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi and Emurua Dikirr’s Johana Ngeno for lashing at founding First Lady Mama Ngina Kenyatta. The MP’s colleagues were overhead saying the fellow could be joining the list of politicians facing dilemma of whether to stay in the BBI train or jump to the DP William Ruto’s candidacy bandwagon.
