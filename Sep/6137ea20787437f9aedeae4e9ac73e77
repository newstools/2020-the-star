Hillary Musundi and veteran journalist Reuben Olita have been endorsed for the chairmanship and secretary position in the upcoming Football Kenya Federation (FKF) Busia branch Busia delegates also vowed to support Nick Mwendwa to continue heading FKF. The delegates assured the FKF officials that they will deliver 100 per cent votes, saying perpetual cancellation of elections has impacted negatively on the development of the game in the country. The delegates were speaking during a meeting  attended by among others FKF NEC Member (Western region) Bishop Tony Kweya, Fifa referee/match commissioner, Margaret Omondi and FKF western region spokesperson, Moses Mabwa. Bishop Kweya exuded confidence that Team Blue led by Mwendwa will carry the day. He also endorsed the election of Margaret Omondi who is in the race to capture the NEC women representative seat that will see her take charge of women football in the country. He appealed to Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong to spearhead the establishment of a county sports bill that will see the formation of a sports committee to run the affairs of sports in the county. “Vihiga is among the first counties to pass the sports bill and form a sports committee and we need to borrow  a leaf from them. Busia is the home of football talent.I urge the delegates to elect people who have football at heart and not brokers who reside outside the county,” he said.
