Ruth Matete has made a comeback on social media. Ruth had deactivated her account after losing her husband Beloved John in April. In a social media post, Ruth said September will be a special month for her as number nine symbolises divine completeness or conveys the meaning of finality. "Christ died at the 9th hour of the day. In this 9th month of the year, just as Christ died and overcame death at the 9th hour, you, too, shall overcome whatever battles you’re facing, in the name of Jesus Christ. "I know it’s been hard. It’s been tough! You have cried your eyes out. It is gonna be worth it. "Welcome to September. The month of completeness. The month of finality." Ruth laid her late husband to rest on July 23 at Langata Cemetery. She is expecting her first child soon.
