Senior Counsel Ahmednasir Abdullahi has claimed that Deputy President William  Ruto is stronger without President Uhuru Kenyatta's support. In a tweet on Monday, Ahmednasir said the biggest threat to DP Ruto's chance in 2022 is for Uhuru to make up with him and support him. "The best chance Hon Raila has for 2022 is to break up with Uhuru, fight him, find his voice and get back him .(Raila is stronger without Uhuru)" he said. He added "Uhuru will be most effective in the 2022 scenarios if he supports a third candidate other than DP Ruto and Raila...a greenhorn (i.e Dr. Fred) will give him and his message some traction and credibility." In their first term as President and Deputy President, Uhuru and Ruto — popularly referred as UhuRuto — , just like Jomo and Jaramogi, wore similar ties and shirts, with the President mostly having left the running of government to the DP as his ‘mtu wa mkono’. The media nicknamed them the Dynamic Duo. In the second term, UhuRuto has since degenerated into Uhuru and Ruto. Last month, Ruto said the current relationship with his boss was agreed on after Jubilee’s first term in office. He claimed that it was decided that  he should take a back-seat to allow the President build his legacy. “My life is easy….The situation between the President and myself is agreed upon…In the 1st term, it was UhuRuto… In the 2nd term, we want to build a legacy.…I am the DP and I know my place,” he told a local daily.
