Embu medics have ended their two-week strike over salary delays among others grievances. The strike ended on Friday after the county government and the health workers signed a return-to-work formula in which they agreed that some grievances should be implemented immediately and others over 60 days. Health Executive Patrick Waganagwa and officials of the workers unions announced the end of the strike, which started on September 9 this year, on Friday. The medics complained over July and August delayed salaries, un-remitted statutory deductions for the last financial year, lack of promotion, and varying pay for those on contracts ranging from Sh15,000 to Sh70,000 among others. Speaking to the press after the signing, Waganagwa said they had agreed the workers should return to work within 48 hours. Kenya National Union of Nurses (KNUN) national chairman, who is also the branch executive Secretary, Joseph Ngwasi, said they had agreed the grievances should not be implemented beyond 60 days. The strike had paralysed all the operations in the public health institutions in the county. The county government had also terminated contracts of about 1,200 striking health casual workers but reinstated them after permanent colleagues threatened to continue with the strike. Through a letter dated September 15 this year and signed by the County Secretary Johnson Nyaga, the county government had informed all the casuals over their services’ termination for “absconding duty without lawful permission with effect from 9th September to date.” Nyaga asked the casuals through writing to hand over government property in their custody to their immediate supervisors in order to be released.
