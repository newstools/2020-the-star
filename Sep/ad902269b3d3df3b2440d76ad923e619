There were isolated riots in Kisii County on Thursday morning ahead of Deputy President William Ruto's visit to the region. In central Kisii town, tyres were burnt by hired goons causing temporary traffic snarl-ups along the streets. Police had to lob tear gas to disperse the rioters. Other youths engaged police in hide and seek games with the police as they picketed. In some streets, rioters clashed with pro-Jubilee youth in a show of force. Ruto is the region to fundraise for bodaboda rider in Kisii town and South Mugirango. In Nyamarambe, the venue of the main event hired hooligans brought down tents where the Deputy President is set to hold the fundraises. Deputy Governor Joash Maangi and South Mugirango MP Sylvanus Osoro said both functions will go ahead as planned. "Nothing is going to stop a function being presided by State Deputy President. Let nobody think is going to stand in the way, all fundraiser will be done as planned," said Osoro.
