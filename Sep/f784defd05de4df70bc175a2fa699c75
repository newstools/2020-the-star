 Fulham vs Arsenal Saturday 14:30 It’s only recently that the 2019-20 season football was wrapped up across Europe but after a short break and some Uefa Nations League matches, the 2020/21 Premier League season gets underway this weekend. After a year absence from England’s top flight, Fulham are back having gained promotion through the Championship play-offs. Scott Parker’s side finished fourth in the second tier last season, before seeing off London rivals Brentford in the play-off final. Following successful loan spells last term, Anthony Knockaert and Harrison Reed have both been signed by Fulham on a permanent basis. Arsenal finished eighth place last season, with an FA Cup final victory over Chelsea —ensuring they secure a Europa League spot at the expense of arch rivals Tottenham. Arsenal endured a tricky start towards the 2019/20 season, but since Arteta replaced Unai Emery at the helm, it’s felt as though the club has been moving in the right direction.

Furthermore, ‘Les Girondins’ are yet to concede in this L1 campaign (W1, D1), and therefore have the opportunity to register a third straight league win for the first time in two years. Bordeaux marched to their first three points of the season with a 2-0 victory over Angers. Two goals from Josh Maja and Toma Basic put Angers to the sword early on. While the early season rankings are hardly ever expected to foretell the final table, Bordeaux can be encouraged by their current second-placed standing as they bid to improve on last season’s 12th-placed finish. There’s likely to be a winner in one way or another as Lyon haven’t drawn any of their previous 10 opening away games of a new season. Bordeaux’s Josh Maja scored the opener last time out. He has been his team’s first goalscorer in his previous six goalscoring L1 games. Memphis Depay scored a hat-trick in Lyon’s opening league fixture. Each of his last seven L1 goals were netted during matches producing over 3.5 goals.
