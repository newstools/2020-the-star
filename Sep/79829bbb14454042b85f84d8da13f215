Following his dismal performance at the Ostrava Golden Spike a fortnight ago, reigning Commonwealth Games 800m champion Wycliffe Kinyamal is eyeing good results in Friday’s Doha Diamond League. The athlete, who trains at Global Sports Communication in Kaptagat, said he is mentally and physically fit to face his rivals again ahead of next year’s olympic Games. “Right now, I am physically and mentally fit for the challenge and ready to rumble,” said Kinyamal, who dominated the 2019 Diamond League season. He said his preparations have gone well ahead of the race. “I know I will post good results on Friday,” he added. “Am just waiting that day when we will take on the track in such of my maiden title,” he added. Kinyamal was recognised by Sports Journalist Association of Kenya (SJAK) following his Commonwealth Games 800m victory in Gold Coast, Australia in 2018. The East Africa Junior 800m champion has a personal best of 1.43.91 which he posted the Diamond League meeting in Shanghai, China two years ago.
