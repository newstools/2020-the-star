Interior CS Fred Matiang'i on Wednesday held a consultative meeting with crime reporters on Wednesday at his Harambee Office. The CS said the meeting focused on creating a seamless information-sharing tool with the government through accurate and fair crime reporting. Matiang'i said the partnership with the association will guide further action and enhance security in the country. The delegation of the association was led by its Secretary general Joseph Muraya and Chairperson Dominic Wabala. The newly established association is Kenya's Premier Journalists Association on Security and Human Rights Seeking to promote quality Journalism and enhance accountability. "CJAK continues to engage with partners within the Criminal Justice System ahead of the official launch. We thank CS @FredMatiangi for a candid conversation on areas of cooperation," the association posted on its Twitter handle. SG Muraya said with the partnership with security agencies, will play a key role in breaking the barriers that have existed between the uniformed officers and the scribes. This will further allow easy access to information relating to crime. With a membership of over 100 drawn across the country, the leadership hopes it will be officially launched in a few weeks to come.
