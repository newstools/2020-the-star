Nameless and Wahu have celebrated 15 years in marriage. The celebrity couple tied the knot in Naivasha in September 2005. Wahu Kagwi reminisced about the boat ride she took to their wedding venue. "I got on a boat... Sailed across a lake 😝😝 and said "I do" to my campus sweetheart," she wrote on social media. The For You singer said they have had their fair share of problems and victories but, 15 years later, her heart is still fixed on her husband. The beautiful couple marked the occasion with a photoshoot. "I'm excited about the future! I love you always Nameless & May God continue to bless our family." Nameless said the two dated for seven years before walking down the aisle. "...The journey continues💪🏾!! and I still got your back," Nameless posted.
