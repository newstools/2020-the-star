Tuskys Supermarket employees on Wednesday took to the streets to protest salary arrears since July. They are ex-staff who were recently laid off by troubled retailer Tuskys. The employees who carried pink, green and white placards blew whistles as they marched in the Nairobi CBD. "Pay us our money, pay us our money! Salaries! We want justice" the placards read. Others read: "Obey court orders since July. We demand justice!  Stop unlawful redundancies and terminations of over 800 employees!" The over 50 employees wore yellow t-shits written Tuskys supermarket as they demanded their salaries. They said some ex-employees had been given post dated cheques which they doubt will be honoured. Last week, the struggling retailer received the first tranche of the Sh2 billion capital injection from an undisclosed Mauritius-based fund, giving hope to the cash-strapped family business. This, even as the retailer remains under pressure to clear supplier debt and pay salary arrears to its staff, amid an exit by some of its managers. Chief Executive Dan Githua says the disbursed first tranche of Sh500 million will cover immediate working capital requirements including partial settlements to staff, suppliers and landlords among others. Tuskys has partly blamed its financial troubles and efforts to bounce back, on effects Covid-19 on its business, including containment measures by the government such as curfew. Reduced disposable income in households, social distancing and stay or work from home measures have also cut activities at malls, affected retail businesses across the country. Tuskys is however confident it will regain its footing, banking on among others, the new restocking deal with suppliers, to replenish its stores.
