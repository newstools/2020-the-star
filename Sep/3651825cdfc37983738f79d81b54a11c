Juventus have completed a loan deal with Atletico Madrid to bring striker Alvaro Morata back to the club. The Spain international, 27, has signed until the end of 2020-21 but Italian champions Juventus have options to extend the loan by 12 months or buy him for a pre-agreed fee. Juve will pay the La Liga side 10m euros for each season they have Morata on loan. He only signed a permanent deal with Atletico on July 1 after a loan spell. Juventus have the option to buy Morata at the end of this season for about £41m, or after a second campaign on loan for about £32m. He previously played for Juve between 2014 and 2016, helping them to win two Serie A titles. The Spaniard has since had permanent spells with Real Madrid and Chelsea, before he initially joined Atletico on an 18-month loan deal. Juventus are seeking a 10th consecutive league title and started their Serie A campaign with a 3-0 win over Sampdoria on Sunday.
