Sixteen foreigners who were being trafficked were on Thursday rescued by a multi-agency team of DCI sleuths along the Marsabit- Isiolo highway. Six suspects alleged to be ferrying the aliens were arrested in connection to the crime. Abdi Majid Hassan Abdirahman Hussein Abdi, Mohammed Ahmed, Jamal Ali, Somo Wario, Salad Huka, Abdullahi Mohammed and Abbas Yusuf were arrested while transporting the 16 kidnapped foreigners. The DCI via Twitter said the suspects were trafficking the victims in three vehicles when they were nabbed. This follows an accusation by the US State Department that the Kenyan Government is not doing enough to stopping human trafficking. In a report released in June, Washington said that Kenya at times treats human trafficking victims as criminals instead of rehabilitating them. The Trafficking in Persons Report 20th edition showed that while Kenya has made significant efforts compared to the last two years, it does not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking. The report, which was launched by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, placed Kenya on Tier 2 of human trafficking, indicating a moderate prevalence of the vice. Meanwhile, the government has acknowledged that Covid-19 measures imposed by the Ministry of Health are exposing many Kenyans to human trafficking. Labour CS Simon Chelugui said the restrictions have increased poverty and hampered efforts to curb human trafficking both internally and internationally. “Some of these measures have led to limited access to services as most victim assistance programmes have scaled-down operations. Identification of victims, which is difficult under normal circumstances, has become even harder in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic,” Chelugui said during a webinar on the World Anti-Human Trafficking Day a month ago.
