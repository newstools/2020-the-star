Nyamira County Assembly Majority Whip Duke Masira has expressed concern over the slow pace of the construction works at Manga Stadium. Masira, who spoke when he donated uniform and balls to six teams, petitioned the county to hasten the construction of the facility. Each team received two pairs of uniforms and two balls. “The construction has been going on for more than five years and we now want the facility completed. It’s very frustrating. The county government should also upgrade Nyamaiya Stadium,” added the Nyamira Township MCA. He further announced plans to renovate of Nyamira Primary school grounds. “I will personally sponsor the upgrading of the pitch and also get standard goalposts and nets,” added the youthful MCA. The teams that benefited include Nyamira Tigers, Gesore FC, Nyairicha, Kiabiraa, Geseneno and Tente. He added that three more teams will receive uniform. “These teams have very talented players who can play even in the Kenya Premier League but they lack exposure. I want to continue supporting them so that the players can realise their dreams,” he added. He noted that he is seeking sponsorship to support the teams. “We are planning to have a major tournament once the government gives a go ahead for the resumption of sports activities. Scouts from various teams will be invited to identify players,” he said. Masira appealed to Sports Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohammed to allow the resumption of sports activities. The minister released draft regulations for the resumption of sports two weeks ago.
