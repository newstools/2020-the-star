The Director of public Prosecutions intends to appeal against a decision of a lower court that granted Sirisia MP john Waluke and business partner Grace Wakhungu bail. In a notice of appeal, the Dpp says he is dissatisfied with the decision of Justice John Onyiego and they will be challenging it. Waluke was on Monday granted a bail of Sh10 million and a bond of Sh20 million pending hearing and determination of an appeal he has filed against his conviction. His business partner Wakhungu was granted a bail of Sh20 million and a bond of Sh30 million. The duo was in June convicted of fraud involving shady maize dealings with the National Cereals and Produce Board. Wakhungu was sentenced to 69 years in jail with the option of Sh1 billion fine while Waluke was handed a 67-year sentence or a similar fine. The two have since appealed their convictions. Haji had on August 13 asked court to deny the embattled MP and co-accused bail pending appeal. He said claims Waluke that he is likely to lose his parliamentary seat is not an exceptional circumstance to warrant grant of bail pending appeal. The DPP said a parliamentary seat is a state office and not Waluke’s personal entitlement. “The possibility of Waluke losing his parliamentary seat if he fails to attend eight consecutive sittings is not an exceptional circumstance to warrant grant of bail pending appeal and there is no guarantee that he will win the said seat come 2022,” he said.
