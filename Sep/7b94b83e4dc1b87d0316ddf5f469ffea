Lugari MP Ayub Savula wants an evaluation committee formed to study counties' performance in health management every year. Savula on Thursday said the Covid-19 pandemic had exposed serious weaknesses in the management of health services in the devolved units. He said level 4 hospitals in counties that are not doing well in health provision should be reverted to the national government and left to manage dispensaries and health centres. "The national and county governments should form a committee through the intergovernmental liaison which will evaluate health performance annually and make necessary recommendations because health is critical,” he said. The MP, however, said counties that have invested heavily in the health sector by ensuring the availability of personnel and supplies should be left to run the docket. Fewer than half of the 47 counties were unable to fully prepare for Covid-19. Health is a devolved function according to the referral system, under the current Constitution. But Likuyani MP Enoch Kibunguchy said devolving health was a mistake and the entire docket should be reverted to the national government. "We must begin asking ourselves whether we're ready to implement devolution or not. And if yes we should rethink devolution of health and agriculture," he said. Kibunguchy said health has faced numerous challenges since the inception of devolution. “You only hear of strikes by medics because they are not paid in time, no allowances, they are not allowed to advance their studies and many others. Soon the hospitals will be without doctors,” he said. The two lawmakers said anyone found to have stolen the Covid-19 funds should be made to face the full force of the law. Savula said it was embarrassing that government officials have the audacity to steal money meant for the sick including donations. Edited by R.Wamochie
