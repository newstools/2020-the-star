A Migori MCA's arm was broken during a melee at the Migori county assembly ahead of the planned tabling of an impeachment motion against Governor Okoth Obado. Nominated MCA Mary Ogodo was on Wednesday assaulted and her left arm broken as the assembly descended into chaos over the planned ouster. It forced sergeant-at-arms to run away with the mace, the symbol of power in the assembly, as they left members assaulting each other physically, verbally with bottles of water being thrown around. Ogodo was rushed to St Joseph Mission Hospital. “She is in hospital, her left arm has been broken and she is receiving treatment. She can’t talk right now. She is in stable condition,” an aide told the Star on the phone. Tension started during the morning session as North Kanyamkago MCA George Omamba got orders from Migori High Court reinstating him as Deputy Speaker on Tuesday evening. Omamba was impeached by his colleagues on May last year together with assembly clerk Tom Opere, with Bukira East MCA Mathews Chacha and Emmanuel Abala taking over in acting capacity amid court orders. On Wednesday, trouble started as five pro-Obado MCAs led by Kaler MCA Thomas Akungo walked into the house which was in session and tried to disrupt the session as Omamba was still on the chair. “The five MCAs were hiding in one of the offices in the assembly controlled by Obado’s relative before they made their way into the assembly and started creating chaos,” a staff said. In the ensuing melee, the session was disrupted as Ogodo, who is said to be in support of the ouster, was attacked. She blamed Akungo for the melee.
