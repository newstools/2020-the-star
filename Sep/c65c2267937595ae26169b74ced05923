Two directors of a company involved in the Sh1 billion NHIF scandal have asked an anti-corruption court to free them from the case after agreeing to be prosecution witnesses. Danson Muchemi and Robert Muna of Webtribe limited wrote to the DPP asking them to review their decision to try them in the case. Muchemi said they were willing to cooperate with the DPP by availing themselves as witnesses and cooperating in the prosecution of other accused persons. The DPP in a letter dated June 5 agreed to have the charges dropped on grounds that Muchemi and Robert make full and frank disclosure of the circumstances surrounding the award of the contract. The DPP also said their cooperation should include availing themselves or their employees to testify as witnesses whenever called upon to do so. Another condition the prosecution gave is that Webtribe commits themselves to implement and complete the contract for the system purchase. Webtribe had been hired to collect revenue through the Integrated Revenue collection system on behalf of the NHIF. The contract between the two is dated August 15, 2014. Its directors were however charged in 2018 with the fraudulent acquisition of public property. They denied the accusations and were granted cash bail of Sh2 million. They will now be testifying against 16 others including NHIF chief executives Geoffrey Mwangi and Simon Kirgottty owing to the new developments.
