President Uhuru Kenyatta’s Jubilee Party has discharged nominated MP David Ole Sankok from the National Cohesion and Equal Opportunity Committee. Majority Whip Emmanuel Wangwe wrote to National Speaker Justin Muturi communicating the party’s decision. On Tuesday, Muturi approved the removal of Sankok saying it followed the due procedure. “I wish to report to the House that my office is in receipt of a letter dated September 25, 2020 from the Majority Party Whip, notifying that the Jubilee Party has discharged The Hon. David Ole Sankok, MP from the select Committee on National Cohesion and Equal Opportunity, where he has been serving as a Member,” Muturi said. “Having perused the documents through which the Jubilee Party transmitted the decision to discharge the said Hon. Member, I am satisfied that the process leading to the discharge met the requirements set out in Standing Order 176. Accordingly, the discharge of the said Member takes effect immediately.” The removal takes effect immediately and according to the House Standing Orders, Jubilee has 14 days fill the position. The decision is viewed as an extension of the purge targeted MPs allied to Deputy President William Ruto in the House. Sankok has been of late having a cosy relationship with DP Ruto.
