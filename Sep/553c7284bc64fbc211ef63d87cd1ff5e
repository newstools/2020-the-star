DCI detectives on Tuesday arrested two suspects of assault and gang rape in Kuresoi South, Nakuru county. Thirty-two year old Benard Korir and 40-year old Nelson Langat are suspected to be members of a gang alleged to have raped a woman at Chigamba village in Olenguruone on September 19. The 26-year-old victim died from the ordeal of being raped by five older men. According to a statement by the DCI, three other gang members connected to the offence escaped during the raid and are currently being pursued by police. The directorate said the arrested duo are in lawful custody and are expected to be arraigned in court soon with charges of murder. This comes barely a fortnight after the arrest of three suspects for abducting a lady and stealing her belongings in Narok. Rose Waithera, Jackson Kamau and Julius Guchu were arrested at Siyapei area by DCI sleuths. Via Twitter, DCI director George Kinoti said the trio bundled the victim into their runaway vehicle (KBS 350W) and drove off. They were later arrested while hiding in a thicket after abandoning their vehicle.
