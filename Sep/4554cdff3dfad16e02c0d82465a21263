MCAs have criticised Governor Mike Sonko's administration for failing to turn over projects to Nairobi Metropolitan Services, causing projects to stall. Contractors and suppliers are complaining as debts pile up. Majority Whip Paul Kados blamed the hold-back on delayed formal transfer of projects to the national government and NMS. “The delay of NMS to handle prior county projects before the transfer of functions [to the national government] is primarily because the county is yet to formally hand over existing projects,” he said. “This state of affairs has left contractors unpaid and projects stalled, despite budgetary allocations for the jobs,” Kados said. The functions transferred to the state through NMS are health, transport, public works and utilities, planning and development. The Majority Whip tasked the heads of the Sectorial Committee on Transport and Public Works to explain the problem. They are to report all ongoing projects launched by the Executive prior to the transfer, stating all measures put in place by City Hall and the NMS for formal transfer of ongoing projects to expedite completion. The two committees have also been told to state when the Executive and NMS plan to resume works on the stalled projects and how the resumption can be expedited. The Majority Whip also asked for the status of payment before and after the NMS took over transferred functions. Nairobi's Fiscal Strategy Paper (2019) of the Finance, Budget and Appropriations committee said the allocations are high. City residents have demanded completion of stalled projects as a priority. They expressed concern the projects had been abandoned and have started to deteriorate. In May 2019, the assembly passed an Sh33 billion supplementary budget with a Sh100 million reduction in development expenditures, saying the amount will be restored in the next financial year. Allocations to the offices of the governor and deputy governor were reduced by Sh120 million. (Edited by V. Graham)
