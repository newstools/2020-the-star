The maternity wing of the Port Victoria Subcounty Hospital is ready for use by expectant women seeking services at the facility. The one-storey wing was funded by the World Bank through the Kenya Devolution Support Program (KDSP) for Sh13.6 million. Bunyala subcounty administrator Nelson Otando said the facility will be of benefit to the residents especially expectant women. He spoke while receiving the keys for the building on behalf of the Port Victoria hospital management. Medical Services chief officer Dr Isaac Omeri who toured the facility said it will be fully equipped before operationalisation. “We have already identified a supplier to deliver the equipment including 20 beds, oxygen concentrators, delivery beds, incubators and baby warmers among other items needed at the maternity wing,” Omeri said. The official added that there are plans to upgrade the Port Victoria hospital to level 4 to improve health services.
