The national curfew has been extended by 60 days, President Uhuru Kenyatta has announced. The curfew hours have, however, been extended to 11pm to 4am. The hours were previously 9pm-4am. Bars will be allowed to operate from Tuesday. "Unaweza kukunywa pombe," Uhuru said on Monday during the antional Covid-19 address at KICC. Bars are to close from 10pm. "The prohibition against the operation of bars, and the sale of alcoholic drinks by ordinary restaurants and eateries shall stand vacated from the September 29. Mnaweza kukunywa pombe sasa (you can now drink)," Uhuru said. Uhuru noted that the country's positivity rate has fallen from 13 per cent in June to seven in August and now stands at 4.4. Uhuru also announced that church services, weddings and funerals can have a maximum of 200 people, up from 100. The President, however, said schools will not yet reopen until it is established it's safe to do so. Uhuru said for the past six months, the country has been in a season of paradoxes. He said as a result, it became necessary to shut in order to save it. "As we head into a new normal, we are even faced with a greater paradox as to whether the curve is flattening or not," he said. Uhuru said the greatest danger is at the moment of victory. "We have not yet won the war, we are faced with a possibility of second-wave. This clearly implies the enemy is still in our borders as we continue to record new infections every day," Uhuru said. He however challenged all Kenyans to continue adhering to laid down containment protocols. "It is evident that as a country we are not in a capacity to handle the aggression of the second wave...citizens must be at the first line of defense by adhering to all the laid down containment measures," he said.
