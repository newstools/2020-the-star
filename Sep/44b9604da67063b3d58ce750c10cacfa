Eight petroleum filling stations have been shut down by theÂ Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority after they were found with adulterated fuel in the period between July and September 2020. During that period, a total of 5,646 tests were conducted across 1,314 petroleum sites. From the tests 99.39 per cent of the sites were found to be compliant but eight sites were found to be non-compliant. The eight are; Obolla Filling station in Kisumu which was offering the sale of super petrol contaminated with domestic kerosene. Cafra filling station in Kakamega, Highway Filling station in Kakamega, Shanzu service station in Mombasa. Others are; Bulema road illegal site in Nairobi, Ongoro filling station in Kisii, Jotham Songori filing station in Bungoma and Wakam filing station in Nakuru. In September 2015, EPRA launched a retailer self-test kit for fuel products, for testing upon delivery before acceptance into storage tanks. The commission said the kits would help eliminate illegal practices such as the diversion of petroleum products meant for export into the domestic market. The kit uses technology known as the lateral flow device that is easy to use and greatly reduces the time and cost of monitoring and testing petroleum products. The commission, through Energy Act 2006, was awarded the legal mandate of managing the petroleum marking and monitoring programme.
