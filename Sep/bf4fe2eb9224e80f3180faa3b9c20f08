Rapper King Kaka posted a photo of Octopizzo, Khaligraph Jones and himself, asking them not to lose sight of where they have come from. The two have had a long-running feud. King Kaka thinks they should just reunite. He tweeted, "We have ground hard to be where we are now, let us not lose sight of the journey. Nothing but love." Octopizzo coldly responded that he does not appreciate the picture used to pass the message. "I have many clean photos, donâ€™t post another horrible photo of me like that. You are making my drip look like yours. That drip is expensive, my friend." In the latest beef, Khaligraph accused Octopizzo of being behind his latest track 'Lwanda Magere's declining views on YouTube. Octopizzo fired back at the rapper with insults, warning him to stop mentioning his name unnecessarily.
