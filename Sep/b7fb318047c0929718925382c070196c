The county government of Kakamega in partnership with an energy agency is implementing a Sh240 million project to instal power inÂ  60 wards. In the programme called Matching Fund, the county government has contributed Sh120 million and the Rural Electrification and Renewable Energy Corporation (REREC) has given a similar amount. Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya said the programme is to ensure all villages in the county have electricity. "The project will be used by the mwananchi for domestic and commercial purposes. It will also increase security as we target to light up market places, hospitals and other public utilities," Oparanya said in a meeting with REREC officials in his office. The governor said the county government will cater for connection fee. REREC director Ezekiel Weya said the project has started. "We came to brief the governor on the progress made so far. My team is tasked with connecting electricity because the county government has catered for the connection fee," Weya said. He urged other counties to emulate Kakamega. "Our target is to ensure all homes have electricity. After connection, Kenya Power will provide meters and users will pay according to their usage," he said. Roads executive Geoffrey Omulayi said the project will improve livelihoods in rural areas. "Under the programme, 60 transformers will be installed in all the 60 wards," Omulayi said. "Our aim is to improve the lives of our people by enabling them get connected to electricity for domestic and commercial use." Edited by A.N
