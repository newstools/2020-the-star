West Pokot Governor John Lonyangapuo has urged the government to reopen schools soon as the long break will affect the future of the children. He said that parents are also facing many challenges when staying with children at home. "The prolonged closure of schools is going to affect the future of our children,” the governor said. Schools were closed in March after the first case of the coronavirus was reported in the country. The governor's plea comes after parents from the region said children have lost a lot of learning time. Parent Joan Chepngetich said many children have been unable to  access online lessons due to poor network coverage and lack of proper devices. “Our children have not been able to attend online classes because of poor network. The government should consider our plea and reopen schools,” she said. Chepngetich said that reformed cattle rustlers who had started attending adult education classes have since moved on to other engagements because of the prolonged schools closure. “I don’t think the reformed warriors will go back to school again. The illiteracy level is going to increase in this region again,” she said. Lonyangapuo further urged the government to involve other stakeholders to help plan for the reopening of schools. He said the process of school reopening should not be left to Ministry of Education alone. “Several measures to help curb the spread of the coronavirus need to be put in place before schools reopen,” the county chief said. Lonyangapuo asked the Ministry of Education to set up infrastructure in schools that will help to establish social distancing. “They should put up temporary classrooms. Don’t wait for politicians to tell you what to do. We don’t want to stagnate the nation,” he said. On the coronavirus situation in the county, Lonyangapuo said his government has trained health workers in efforts to combat the disease. Edited by A.N
