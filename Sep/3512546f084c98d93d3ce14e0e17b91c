Residents of Wajir have been urged not to lower their guard in the fight against the coronavirus as cases drop across the country. The county has so far recorded 36 positive cases with one fatality. The 35 have since recovered – 29 at the isolation wards and six through home-based care. Speaking on Thursday morning when he received assorted personal protective equipment donated by the Kenya Red Cross Society in partnership with UNFPA and the EU, Abdi said residents cannot afford to rest on their laurels. He said he had noted with concern that basic rules such as wearing of masks, social distancing and regular sanitising were not being observed. “Let us not celebrate early as the disease has shown trend of resurgence globally. We can only succeed in the eradication of the virus through strict compliance with the Ministry of Health guidelines,” he said. Abdi said the county's 300-bed Covid-19 treatment centre is nearing completion. It will be used as an infectious disease centre in the long-run. Abdi said his administration is also alive to the fact that families are hurting due to the impact caused by the pandemic, and will continue to provide food to the most vulnerable. “Livestock prices and sales have gone down. This has led to the closure of several markets such as Diif, Daghahley and Korondille, thereby affecting the livelihoods of our people.” He urged residents to take advantage of the mass testing for Covid-19 that is being conducted by the Red Cross in partnership with the EU and the county government to know their status. “I want to appeal to residents to come out in large numbers and test for the virus. Testing is free and will take 40 days. The team will be moving around in all the subcounties to ensure every resident gets a chance to test,” he said. Northeastern Red Cross manager Mohamed Abdikadir said the organisation has been working closely with other players to curb the spread of the virus. Edited by A.N
