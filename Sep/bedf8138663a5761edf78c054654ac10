Emurua Dikirr MP, Johanna Ng'eno has been released on a Sh1 million cash bail with an alternative Sh2 million bond. He was released on Thursday by Nakuru Chief Magistrate, Elizabeth Usui. Ng'eno was charged with two counts of hate speech and offensive conduct. He was charged that on September 6 at Junction area, Olgos Sofia Village in Transmara, he used abusive language in which ethnic hatred was likely to be stirred up. He faced a second count of offensive conduct on the same day and place. The second charge states that at a public gathering at the home of the late Joseph Oitakei by directing insults to the Presidency. He denied committing the crimes when he appeared before Usui on Tuesday. The magistrate denied the prosecution application objecting the MP's release on bond saying that he was not a flight risk. She observed that claim that Ng'eno could interfere or influence the witnesses was not valid since the witnesses were police officers and an official at the Communication Authority of Kenya. The case will be mentioned on October 12.
