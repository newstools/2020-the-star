Any record set at the refurbished Nyayo Stadium during the final leg of the World Athletics Continental Tour in Nairobi on Saturday will be recognised by the global athletics body, Athletics Kenya president Jackson Tuwei has revealed. While speaking in the presence of President Uhuru Kenyatta, Sports CS Amina Mohamed and Principal Secretary Joe Okudo among other sports stakeholders, Tuwei disclosed that World Athletics had sent two technical officials to ratify the standard of the spruced up facility. "I can confirm that any record set during the Nairobi continental tour will be given due recognition as their technical officials from Germany have confirmed that the facility is of the required technical standards," Tuwei said. Kenyan athletes shone at the last Diamond League showdown in Qatar raising expectations of a similar dominant performance on home soil. Uhuru challenged athletes who will participate in the select events in the historic event to emulate the performance of their compatriots last Friday. The president further promised that in cooperation with counties like Kisumu, Kisii, Narok and Kakamega the government planned to redevelop the stadia to world class standards. The Head of State also promised that next year the government will build a stadium for the Kenya Defence Forces at their Langata barracks. Kenyatta also urged the Sports Stadia board not to let the facility be run down as they will be answerable if that were to happen. President Uhuru also reiterated that he was looking forward to the country playing hosts to the World Athletics Under 20 Championship as well as the return of the Safari Rally to the World Rally Championship calendar.
