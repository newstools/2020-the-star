The senate will soon find an amicable solution to the ongoing revenue sharing stalemate, speaker Ken Lusaka has said. Lusaka said senators are determined to pull all stops to ensure there is a lasting solution to the standoff. Speaking at in Bungoma County during the burial of the elder brother to former Kanduyi MP Alfred Khang’ati, Lusaka said the Senate is burning the mid night oil to ensure Counties get money. “Senate is the defender of devolution, as a protector of counties we cannot allow them to starve. I want to assure Chairman Council of Governors Wycliffe Oparanya that the Senate will not allow services to halt in devolved units,” he said. “As a house we will spare no effort in ensuring that the matter is completely resolved, and there is no fight over revenue every financial year, like it has been the norm,” he said. Oparanya said services will be crippled in counties from September 17 if the Senate would have not resolved the revenue sharing stalemate. Majority counties are unable to run their services due to lack of money from the national treasury. The Senate had failed to agree on the best formula in nine sittings, with the sessions often characterised by high emotions and name-calling. And after nine days of intense meetings, members of the team appointed to broker a deal on the contentious formula have remained tight-lipped. The Star established that the 12-member team is yet to agree on the way forward. "It is still very delicate. We cannot tell when this process will end,” said a committee member, who spoke off the record. Last week, the team co-chaired by senators Moses Wetang'ula (Bungoma) and Johnson Sakaja (Nairobi) held a daylong meeting in Parliament in an effort to reach an agreement.
