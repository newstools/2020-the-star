Thousands of young people in the Kazi Mtaani programme want it extended, saying ending it in January is too soon. The youths mainly from informal settlements said on Tuesday the programme had offered them a source of livelihood and called on the government to make it permanent. The programme was introduced four months ago to cushion unemployed young people against the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. It has helped more than 283,000 young people countrywide. In Naivasha, groups linked up with partners to learn new skills, such as making cabro paving bricks. Geoffrey Senero, the programme coordinator in Karagita Estate, said Kazi Mtaani has transformed many lives. Karagita is Naivasha's largest informal settlement. He said that the crime rate in the informal settlement had fallen and new sources of income will be needed once the programme ends. “Crime in this estate has come down due to the programme but what happens once it's over in January?" he asked. His deputy Derreck Wachira said 1,320 youths from Hellsgate ward had benefited.  Poverty had declined over four months and the lives of many families had been uplifted, he said. Gender-based violence has also declined sharply, he said. “Our plea is to make Kazi Mtaani part of the government programme and allocate it funds so we can continue to benefit the hundreds of unemployed youths,” he said. A programme organiser, Dorcas Wanjiku, said they had starting training youths to make cabro bricks and make glasses out of discarded bottles. She said residents of Karagita, which was better known for crime, had benefited greatly. Kazi Mtaani graduate Ruth Wambui who comes from the informal settlement said she was giving back to the community by training youths to make cabro. “After this programme, life has to go on and we have decided to empower the youths to make bricks so they can become self-reliant later on," Wambui said.
