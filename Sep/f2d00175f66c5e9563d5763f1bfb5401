President Uhuru Kenyatta and his Deputy William Ruto may have their differences but the two leaders can be reconciled. Reconciling the two is not an impossibility. It therefore goes to mean that efforts by religious leaders to bring the two together can bear fruit, but only if Uhuru and Ruto also want to be friends again. If Uhuru and Ruto want Kenya to be one country, they could just reconcile and it will not take them even one day to bring this nation together. Leaders have said it before that the rifts in Jubilee party can be resolved through talks between Uhuru and his deputy. Elders from various regions have also expressed willingness to initiate mediation and resolve the differences between the two. Any plan to reach out to the President and his deputy in a bid to end the ongoing rift between them is therefore welcome and should be supported for the sake of the country's unity. There should be not hard-line stance by the two and their supporters, like those who are saying it would be wrong to push the Head-of-State to reconcile with his deputy when it is not known what ruined the relationship. Uhuru should just call everybody to the table, Ruto and even ODM leader Raila Odinga included. He should then remind Raila that he won the seat with Ruto as his deputy. Uhuru should also then tell Ruto to remember that Raila has been in politics for long and should be respected The President should also insist that leaders must stop insulting each other and tell them not to show their supporter any signs of disagreements among them. He should take the lead in showing Kenyans that he can co-exist in harmony with his deputy and ODM leader until 2022 when those contesting for seats would be hitting the ground to hunt for votes. The media should also play a key role in uniting the leadership of the country. When we are in the wrong, say it as it is. If we are on the right let it be put that way so that we know what ails us.
