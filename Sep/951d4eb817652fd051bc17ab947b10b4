It is a dream of most golfers to hit a hole in one during their careers and on Sunday, the 72-year-old Moses Momanyi Bosire was lucky to achieve the  feat. Playing off handicap 16, he hit a hole in one at Kisii Golf Course during the  weekend fixture while playing alongside businessman Ken Mogere and senior advocate George Masese. “This is a rare feat which I achieved using a five fairway wood club. I’m very happy. I want to thank my caddie and colleagues,” an emotional Bosire said. Bosire has been playing golf for the last 12 years. Bosire joins a rare club of golfers who have achieved the feat at the Kisii Golf Course. “For his age,hitting a par three (174 yards) is a big achievement,” said Mogere. Masese said: “I have been playing golf for several years but I have not managed a hole in one. I want to congratulate my colleague.” Christopher Matagaro, who has been playing at the course since 1963, said: “About 10 golfers have managed to hit a hole in one at the Kisii Golf Course.” Golf was among the first sports to resume after suspension of sports activities due to coronavirus pandemic. However, no major tournament has been held in Kisii, forcing golfers resorted to organising their own weekend fixtures. The golf course has undergone massive improvements including the construction of a perimeter fence to ward off tress passers.
