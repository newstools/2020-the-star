Wajir Governor Mohamed Abdi has called for the strengthening of the health system to achieve universal healthcare coverage. Abdi said the UHC initiative should be supported by all Kenyans since good health is key to economic development of the nation. UHC is intended to ensure all Kenyans have access to preventive, promotive, curative, rehabilitative and palliative health services at minimum financial burden. "This type of healthcare system is the way to go, people getting what they need, when they need it and at a price they can afford to pay,” he said. Abdi spoke in his office on Friday when he received a team from the Ministry of Health which will offer the county technical support in strengthening the health system. The team was led by Dr Omar Mohamed. The county Health department has already started training community health assistants and public health officers on UHC. Some 178 healthcare workers recruited under UHC have been posted to health facilities. The county has also trained 1,380 community health volunteers. Abdi said the training would help improve access to health services. They include improved antenatal care services, skilled deliveries, postnatal services, family planning services and nutrition and immunisation services. Abdi said Wajir has further formed a county commodity security committee and medicine and therapeutic committee for Wajir County Referral Hospital in line with UHC requirements. He said the county is in the process of allocating 30 per cent of its overall budget to health as per the intergovernmental participatory agreement signed between Wajir county and the national government. Omar said the national government will continue to work closely with the county government to achieve universal healthcare. “Universal health coverage is a people-centred health system that ensures all people can benefit from quality health services where and when they need them without suffering financial hardships,” he said.
