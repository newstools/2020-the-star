Eldoret City Marathon has been recognised by Abbot Marathon Majors, according to race director Moses Tanui. Tanui said the three-year-old Eldoret race has been recognised despite this year's edition being cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic. “I want to share the good news that the Eldoret City Marathon has been elevated and recognised after meeting the set standards of an international race," said the two-time Boston Marathon champion. He said the prize money of US$35,000 for the winner was a major contributor to the elevation, adding that the money was equal to what  is being paid in Europe. The race was initially planned for April this year but was cancelled due to Covid-19.  “The race won’t take place this year due to coronavirus pandemic but we will be back next year next year,” said Tanui. He urged athletes to continue training ahead of next year.
