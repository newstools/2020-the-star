The Kenya Human Rights Commission has rolled out Covid-19 support funds to stateless persons through the KHRC’s Dignity Fund. The programme recently launched at the Kinoo chief’s office targets cushioning more than 1,472 households. This comes as most stateless communities were ruled out in the recent government’s mobile money transfer to vulnerable Kenyans amid the pandemic. Most stateless communities are at a disadvantage due to lack of IDs. Shona community member Nosizi Dube said, "I was born here and Kenya is the only home I know. My education journey has been tough. I'm supposed to have joined my Bachelor of Economics course but my dreams are being blown away because I lack an ID card."
