The Senate leadership on Tuesday resolved to push the revenue sharing debate to next Tuesday. Speaker Kenneth Lusaka said the move will allow for consensus building. The Senate 12-member committee had earlier held a meeting ahead of an expected sitting in the afternoon where the senators were to attempt for the 10th time to debate and approve the formula. According to sources, Lusaka had tried to convince the divided committee to support a disputed formula that cuts allocation to 18 counties by Sh17 billion. The leadership, however, according to the sources, wants the formula suspended by two years 'to minimise losses' The proposal to suspend the implementation of the proposed formula by two years was fronted by Majority Chief Whip Irungu Kang'ata. "They are trying to convince us to support the formula that will see Mandera lose Sh1.2 billion and other counties lose a lot of money. But we are still negotiating," a senator, who is a member of the 12-member team said . "The leadership says that all counties will for the next two years get the same amount as the one they received last year. They say this will minimise loses and then after that the new formula will kick in." The team, chaired by senators Moses Wetang'ula (Bungoma) and Johnson Sakaja (Nairobi) presented two reports to the leadership after its members failed to agree on the best formula.
