An 81-year-old woman was among two suspects charged in a Garissa court on Monday with performing female genital mutilation on two minors. Circumciser Isinino Shangale Ali and the mother of the five and seven-year-old girls (names withheld) were arrested by police officers on Saturday in Madogo, Tana River county, after a tip-off from members of the public. The mother is accused of aiding in the performance of the act, while Isinino is accused of circumcising the girls. Prosecutor Allan Magero told the court that on getting to the homestead, police found the children crying while bleeding profusely. They were then rushed to Garissa County Referral Hospital, while the two suspects were taken to Garissa police station. The court was told the girls were responding well to treatment and were out of danger. The two suspects denied the charges before senior resident magistrate Cosmas Maundu. The prosecutor requested the court for five more days to conclude investigations.Â  The magistrate granted the request. Meanwhile, the court on Monday granted a police request to complete investigations involving 12 Somali aliens and a driver who were arrested on Saturday. The vehicle ferrying the aliens, a Toyota Land Cruiser, was intercepted by police at the Tana Bridge barrier. It was fitted with a number plate GKB 390 C. Garissa subcounty police boss Joseph Muriuki said on Saturday that a search of NTSA records established the vehicle belonged to Garissa county, registration number KCT 620Z. The prosecutor said the extra days will help police arrest aliens in Garissa and beyond. Edited by A.N
