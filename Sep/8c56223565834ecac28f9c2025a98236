Jepchirchir set out on a ravaging pace over the 16.5-lap course in Prague's Letna Park, passing 10 kilometres in 30:32. "I was thinking to run maybe 1:04:50, but I'm so happy," Jepchirchir said. This is Jepchirchir's second world record over the distance.  She clocked 1:05:06 in a mixed race in Ras Al Khaimah in 2017. The race was being organised by Prague-based firm RunCzech in partnership with Adidas with an eye on the world record. In an interview, Jepchirchir said she is ready to break the world record, conditions allowing, and to restore her glory in the 21km distance. The special event took place at Letna Park in Prague, where athletes will compete on an oval course around the park, covering 21.0975km which is roughly 16.5 laps. “Since I was informed about the event last month and immediately embarked on serious training and I hope to get good results,” she said. Jepchirchir said she will also use the race to gauge her strength after many months of waiting due to coronavirus. RunCzech  invited 35 top distance runners for the event. Jephirchir broke Florence Kiplagat’s world record of 66:69 in 2017 at Ras Al Khaimah (RAK) Half Marathon, setting a new mark of 65:66. However, the record did not last for long before the reigning New York City Marathon winner Joyciline Jepkosgei brought it down to 64:51.
