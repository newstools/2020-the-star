Classic 105 presenter Maina Kageni has told critics to stop criticising gospel singer Guardian Angel for dating a 50-year-old woman. Guardian Angel, 24, and Esther Musila have publicly displayed their affection by rocking matching outfits and even working out together. Musila is a mother of three children aged between 22 and 29.  But Maina has told them to "leave his [Guardian's] love life alone and let love win." He concluded by saying "there I said it". Guardian Angel says he is proud of himself as “love wins”. Some of his fans think it is okay to stay where you feel loved, but others feel he should be dating someone in his age bracket. In a post on Instagram, the Hadithi hitmaker shared a quote that read, “Sometimes the most difficult sacrifice is to abandon the comfortable mediocrity of who we are and embrace the beautiful fear of what we’re meant to be.” Guardian Angel thanked Maina for being positive about his relationship. "Ah!!!!! Me I love you guys!!!! Have a great, blessed, warm day!!!!"
