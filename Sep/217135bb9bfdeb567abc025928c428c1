Deputy President William Ruto has demanded total respect to President Uhuru Kenyatta from his allies. Ruto’s words come hours after the arrest of Umurua Dikiir legislator Johanna Ng’eno over a slur attack to the Head of State. The DP said on Monday evening through his Twitter account that “no amount of anger justifies the use of offensive insulting language” to the president. “Unsavoury words against mothers and Head of State is a NO, NO. No amount of anger justifies the use of offensive insulting language,” Ruto said. The second man in command added that where else there might be disagreement over some issues, there exist decent ways to communicate. He said leaders should exercise restraint and avoid insults and bad language against other Kenyans. The remarks appear to contradict the move taken by his close ally Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi. Sudi defended the move taken by Ng’eno and that the president has sidelined his deputy after ushering in ODM leader Raila Odinga. Kapseret MP had added that Ruto has been disrespected and ‘cornered’ in the government which he took part in forming. Sudi said that it is true that the president has sidelined his deputy even after helping him to win the top seat twice. “I want to tell the president that we do not owe you anything. We voted for you three times, in 2013 and twice n 2017… this country belongs to all Kenyans,” irritated Sudi said. He added that “You have betrayed and treated William Ruto as somebody who does not deserve anything. He appears cornered as you decide every move.” Ng'eno was arrested on Monday by Police officers in Transmara East over his slur language to Mama Ngina. During the Sunday event, Ng'eno hit out at President Uhuru Kenyatta for the wrangles in Jubilee Party. He told the President to work with DP William Ruto "or go home". "You are not Kenya and Kenya is nor Kenyatta's or Mama Ngina's land. This land belongs to 47 million Kenyans, you cannot run it as you wish," the legislator said.
