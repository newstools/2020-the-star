A number of political leaders are taking a wrong trajectory, spewing words that can easily incite communities to violence. Callously, some of these leaders are abusing each other in public, hurling unprintable insults at other leaders. They are beating drums of war and this is totally unacceptable. Kenya has witnessed firsthand what political incitement can lead to. Memories of the 2007-08 post-election violence are still fresh. We witnessed killings, uprooting of thousands of innocent people from their homes and destruction of property, all because of incitement by the political class. It took the intervention of the international community to restore sanity. This was a very painful period that we should not have to live through again. That is why leaders should exercise caution and restraint. They should be very careful with what they say in public and what they post on social media. The police and the National Cohesion and Integration Commission should deal ruthlessly with anyone who incites the public. We should not give anyone a chance to destabilise the peace Kenyans enjoy.
