Ali Mohammed, alias Masauti, says aggressiveness has made him one of the biggest artistes in Kenya today. Speaking in an interview with Massawe Japanni on Tuesday, the Mombasa-based artiste said the fact that he moved to Nairobi also opened more opportunities for him. "As an artiste, it is important to spread your music all over. So for me, I decided to move from the Coast and come to Nairobi as there are many media platforms," he said. Masauti acknowledges that comedian Jalang'o held his hand and supported him. "Jalas is more than a manager to me," he said. "Niliwasumbua sana kabla wanishike mkono." The fast-rising star is just fresh from releasing a new jam, 'Burudani', and it's currently trending on YouTube with over 130,000 views.
