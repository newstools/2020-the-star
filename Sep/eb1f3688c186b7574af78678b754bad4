 Kenya Pipeline should expedite the installation of a leak detection system on the Sh48 billion Mombasa- Nairobi line, the Senate Energy Commitee has said. Chairman Ephraim Maina said KPC should treat the mater as urgent. “We thank God we have not had much leakage ever since the line started to be used. We must therefore expedite the process as we pray that we do not have a disaster in the meantime,” he added. Petroleum Cabinet Secretary John Munyes, told the committee  procurement will commence upon approval of the budget. “We are hoping to have a leak detection system by end of next year,” Munyes added. KPC managing director Macharia Irungu however said it might take longer to install the system because of procurement procedures. “It takes about 60 to 90 days to get through the procurement process,” he explained. The 20-inch pipeline was designed without any leak detection systems. It began operation in July 2018 and runs for 450km parallel the 40-year old line. Rogue staff colluding with fuel cartels sometimes steal fuel from the depots and then register them as leakages. Last year KPC lost 551,000 litres valiued at Sh63 million  following a leak on its Line 1 at Kiboko in Makueni county.
