A couple was on Tuesday charged with subjecting their six-year-old child to a cruel act by scalding him with hot a knife. The two were accused of assaulting the child in Umoja III, Nairobi, on September 2. The couple appeared in a Makadara court. The court heard that the two caused serious bodily harm on the boy. In a photo seen by the Star, the child is seen with swollen eyes and injuries on his back and chest. The two denied the charges before Makadara senior resident magistrate Lewis Gatheru. The investigating officer told the court that the child is still nursing wounds at Mama Lucy Kibaki Hospital. The mother pleaded with court to free her so as she can go and look after her one-year-old child. “Your honoUr, since my arrest I don’t know where my one-year-old child is. I need to go and look for him,” she said. The court was informed that the baby was handed over to the Children’s Department in Kayole. Gatheru ordered for a report of the two children before determining the couple's bail. They will be detained at Buruburu police station until September 21, when the matter will be mentioned.
