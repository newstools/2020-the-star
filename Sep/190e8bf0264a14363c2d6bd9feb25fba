After reclaiming the world half marathon record, Peres Jepchirchir has now shifted her focus to lowering her marathon personal best. Jepchirchir, who broke the 21km on Saturday at the RunCzech in Prague, Czech Republic in a 1-6 Kenyan sweep, said she will now works towards dipping under 2:17, more than six minutes off her current 2:23:53 best. “I have done more in half marathons and my focus will now be on the full marathon. I am not saying that I will be out of half marathons but I want to do something special in a full marathon,” said Jepchirchir. Jepchirchir (65:34), who has previously held the 21km mark before being dethroned by compatriot Joyciline Jepkosgei, was almost two minutes clear of compatriot Brenda Jepleting (67:07), Dorcas Kimeli (67:14), Edith Chelimo (67:16), Sheila Chepkurui (67:31) and Vibian Chepkirui (67:37). “I want to run 2:17 in marathon to ensure my good progress in road running. That will make me a better runner,” she said. Jepchirchir said the newly-launched Adidas racing shoe, Adidas Adizero Adios Pro was significant in her new record. “The shoe is so good and light when running on tarmac. It protects an athlete from heavy punch. It is one of the best in the world,” said Jepchirchir. The RunCzech title was her second world record over the distance having clocked 65:06 in a mixed Ras Al Khaimah (RAK) half marathon in 2017 which stood for two months before Jepkosgei struck. Meanwhile, it was not all rosy in the men's race as national cross country champion Kibiwott Kandie failed the break the 58:30 mark, clocking 58:37 ahead of compatriot Philemon Kiplimo (59:56), Benson Kipruto (60:06), Amos Kurgat Kibiwott (60:20) and Felix Kipkoech (60:40) in another Kenyan top-five sweep.
