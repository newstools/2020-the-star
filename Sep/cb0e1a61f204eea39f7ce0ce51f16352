The Vihiga Culture, Sports and Gender department has allocated Sh4 million to set up cultural centres for Bunyore and Tiriki communities. Deputy Governor Patrick Saisi said construction will begin once the county assembly approves a supplementary budget. Saisi, who doubles as the Culture CEC, said the centres will help the two communities celebrate and preserve their ways of life. "We have already done for the Maragoli community at Maragoli hills and the Tiriki community in Shiru. The two buildings are done. What remains is equipping them," he said. A supplementary budget of Sh.2 million will be used to equip them. "Apart from being our historical centres in the county, they will help our future generations to learn of their culture," Saisi said. He said the four centres will also generate revenue in tourism cash. Saisi urged the Tiriki community not to take their children to the hospital for circumcision as that will erode their culture. "Our circumcision is not just cutting off that foreskin.Â We have training and teachings the children go through as a transition from childhood to manhood," he said.
