South Mugirango MP Silvanus Osoro has been told to respect Kisii Governor James Ongwae. Kisii Township MCA Kefa Mogaka on Sunday blamed Osoro for linking Kisii county’s top leaders to graft, saying he is overstepping his mandate. He said Osoro was elected to pass laws, oversight the Executive and represent his electorate at the national level and challenged the lawmaker to leave the oversight role in the county to MCAs. The MCA said the MP has been linking Ongwae’s government to corruption without evidence to support his claims, terming the claims unfortunate and a witch-hunt. “Osoro is neither an auditor nor an accountant in the county to claim that funds have been embezzled. He should leave it to relevant government agencies to investigate,” Mogaka said He claimed that the legislator was being used by some politicians to tarnish the governor’s image and his government. Mogaka noted that even MCAs cannot know whether funds have been stolen or not, adding they are not professionals and do not handle the county’s funds. “I urge the MP to consult MCAs from his constituency to brief him on how the county is run instead of engaging in endless blackmail,” he said. He said Osoro, an ally of Deputy President William Ruto, was fond of attacking leaders in the county and asked him to stop and focus on serving his constituents. Mogaka said the government delayed releasing funds to counties after senators disagreed on the formula for sharing revenue and a consensus was reached only last week. “The county government received funds to buy sanitiser and masks to fight Covid-19. No development funds have been sent to counties for the last three months because of the Senate stalemate. It is now that the devolved units are going to receive funds,” the MCA said.
