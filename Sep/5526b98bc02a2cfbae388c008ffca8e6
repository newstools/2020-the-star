Three GSU officers who were involved in an incident of false arrest have been released on cash bail pending directions from the ODPP. The officers are said to have posed as DCI detectives and arrested the wrong person. The three; Gideon Sumare, Kelvin Omerikwa and Shallan Ooro who are police constables based at Ruiru GSU Camp could not be arraigned as the victim sought to withdraw the charges. Via Twitter on Tuesday, director George Kinoti said the three officers while pretending to be DCI detectives pounced on the victim as he parked his car outside his residence in Nyayo high Rise. This was before forcing him into the private Toyota Land cruiser they were using and which belongs to the civilian suspect; Nelson Mukura. " Instructions from the fourth suspect (Sechere) to the officers was to arrest a land dealer who had allegedly defrauded his female friend Sh 800,000 but ended up mistaking him for someone else," Kinoti said. The victim was then forced to give Sh200,000 to secure his release but managed to raise Sh115,000 which upon investigations was found to have been sent to a number linked to police constable Sumare. The officer was also found in possession of the Simcard used. " A complete file with the preferred charges was today forwarded to the ODPP for perusal but the suspects could not be arraigned as the ODPP was further issued with an affidavit sworn by the victim seeking to withdraw the charges," Kinoti said. Kinoti said the fate of the officers will be determined once the ODPP peruses their file.
