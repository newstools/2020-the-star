Content creator Abel Mutua says he did not have a plan to have a white wedding. Speaking on his YouTube channel, Abel said he had dated Judy for seven years and wanted to marry her. "In August 2015, my wife and I were on the bypass going home after visiting Phillip Karanja's home," he said. "Then I thought to myself, I have been with this babe for a while now. We should just actualise this relationship once and for all." He says he proposed to her in a car, asking her if she would live with him forever. "The answer was a resounding yes because we have been together for seven years," he said. Abel says he did not have much time and money as he was jobless then. Going to the Attorney General's office was the perfect plan for him as it would cost less. "We agreed the wedding day would be on her birthday, November 21st, which was three months away," he said. "When it comes to weddings, three months is a very short time, so we didn't plan to have something big coz guys take a year-plus in planning. So we agreed we would go to the AG. So I knew that will not take up much financially." Judy influenced Abel to have a small ceremony in church after the wedding. "Next thing, she said from 20 to 100 people. Then she wanted a lineup that is not so packed," he said. They ended up having a fully fledged white wedding, which he ended up putting all his savings into.
