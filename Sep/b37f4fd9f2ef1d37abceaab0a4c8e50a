A group of farmers in Kinangop, Nyandarua county are selling their livestock and crops to buy electricity transformers. With the transformers, they believe they can finally be connected to electricity after living in darkness for over 50 years. Community leader Charles Kimotho said the region has high potential for food production but it had been sidelined for years. Kimotho told of their frustrations as they moved from one government office to the other to seek power connection without success. “We have met senior government officers including those from KPLC but our pleas have been ignored and hence the fundraising,” he said on Monday. He said Nyandarua county had for years been marginalised, missing out on state appointments and capital projects hence the high levels of poverty. “We have heard about the Last Mile project which has not assisted us and over 300 families in this area have continued to live in darkness,” he said. Gabriel Kiarie said that every election year, politicians tour the area with promises of electricity connection. He added that they had been forced to source for drinking water from the nearby Aberdares Forest. “The governor, our MP, woman rep and senator have forgotten us, leading to more suffering despite paying taxes like other Kenyans,” he said. Hannah Wambui wondered whom they had wronged, adding that lack of electricity had affected education standards. She said that they had been forced to use paraffin to light their houses as their neighbours enjoyed electricity. “Even the nearby schools do not have electricity yet the government has claimed to have connected all learning institutions to power,” she said. A senior manager from KPLC said that the Covid-19 pandemic had affected their plans to connect all rural areas with electricity. “We are back on the drawing board after the pandemic and under the Last Mile project, this village and others will definitely benefit,” he said.
