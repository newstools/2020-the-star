When a heavy rain descends on the CBD, the whole city feels it. Traffic stands still and puddles get deceptively deep. It is at this moment that the Traffic police have a difficult time controlling a snarl-up as motorists blatantly flout rules. Any object an unsuspecting pedestrian is carrying quickly becomes a makeshift umbrella, and actual umbrellas quickly become hazards themselves, catching the wind or flipping inside out. Hawkers take advantage of the situation and before you know it they start selling umbrellas at inflated prices — it’s a double tragedy for commuters. Buses and matatus, too, are not left behind. This is when the operators double fares. The best of these photos make you feel caught up in a downpour. All they need to make you feel truly soaked.
