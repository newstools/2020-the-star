Deputy President William Ruto on Wednesday claimed that the 'corruption brokers' end is near. "The corruption consultants, brokers and conmen, some bankrupt in 2013, are now billionaires after looting while scapegoating William Ruto," he said. "Their overgrown Impunity is shamelessly making them steal even from the sick in a pandemic." Via Twitter, Ruto who did not name names said their end was nigh. "Nowhere to hide. No more scapegoating," he added. Ruto seemed to be responding to Jubilee vice chairman David Murathe who censured him on Tuesday night during an interview on live television. Murathe said the DP has been haunted by several graft allegations, and this does not give him the necessary credentials to inherit the presidency. “Look at the scandals, the Weston Hotel land, the Ruai public land....when all these things follow you and you shamelessly walk around while you are number two, what will you do when you become number one?” Murathe said. His statement came even as he was linked to a man at the centre of the Kemsa tender scandal. Murathe acknowledged knowing the man - William Gachoka - linked to Kilig Ltd, which was allegedly awarded a tender to supply Kemsa with 450,000 personal protective kits. However, he said, "I have absolutely nothing to do with Kilig..." Last week, the Deputy President  said Jubilee party is not functioning well because of 'busy bodies' who have no idea about the party's philosophy. "The party has been hijacked by busy bodies and con men and brokers like Murathe and company," he said during an interview. Ruto said he was working to solve the issues facing Jubilee but he was ready to consider other options.
