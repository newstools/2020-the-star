Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to consider giving more Cabinet Secretary positions to ODM. Governor Sonko said it is about time ODM leader Raila Odinga is accorded more recognition through Cabinet appointments. “We want to see a genuine handshake where ODM is recognised and given more positions in government,” he said in Seme, Kisumu county. He spoke during the burial of footballer Kevin Oliech, a brother to veteran and former Harambee Stars striker Dennis Oliech. Before the burial, Sonko had called on the Lake region residents to rally behind the handshake, which he said will determine the next government. Sonko said the region stands to benefit more by fully supporting Uhuru and Raila. “I know many youths here in Kisumu have no jobs. We will ensure that the government that is coming, the handshake government, addresses this issue, " he said. On Covid-19 funds theft, the governor called on DPP Noordin Haji  not to spare Cabinet secretaries mentioned in the case. He said there is a need for comprehensive investigations and subsequent prosecution of senior government officers irrespective of their social status. “Cabinet secretaries who misuse billions of shillings meant for Kenyans should be charged and kicked out of government,” he said. “It is unfortunate that we have people who can misuse public funds at a time when Kenyans are suffering.” His sentiments were echoed by Embakasi East MP Babu Owino, who called on the DPP and DCI officers to fast-track investigations over the matter. “This is a serious matter and we want justice to be done to the people of this country without further delay,” he said.
