Primoz Roglic was at a loss to explain his meltdown after he surrendered the Tour de France overall lead in the final time trial to fellow Slovenian Tadej Pogacar on Saturday. The 30-year-old was the overwhelming favourite for the title going into the 36.2-km solo effort against the clock between Lure and La Planche des Belles Filles but nothing went to plan. Roglic started the day with a 57-second lead in the general classification but lost time to Pogacar on the flat section and imploded on the 5.9-km climb at an average gradient of 8.5%. His compatriot claimed a monumental victory in the time trial to finish 59 seconds ahead going into yesterday’s final stage, the traditional procession into Paris where only the final sprint on the Champs Elysees is contested. Roglic’s face turned white and his new yellow time trial helmet looked too small as his sweaty hair stuck out, almost giving an air of embarrassment to the whole scene. “I had not the best day and Tadej was just a lot, a lot better, in a different world,” Roglic told a news conference. “Tadej deserves the win, congratulations to him. I just gave everything I had. For sure I’m disappointed about the result but on the other side I can be proud of that second place.” The Vuelta champion, who was backed for three weeks by the most formidable team on the Tour, apologised to his Jumbo-Visma team mates for not delivering.
