Three people were killed in a grisly road accident along the Kisumu-Nairobi Highway involving a trailer and a saloon car. One of the deceased is a 10-year-old boy who died on the spot while one passenger from the trailer died while undergoing treatment. According to the Nyanza region Traffic Boss Gladys Ogonda, the trailer might have lost control before ramming into the saloon car in the Sunday night accident. She said two other occupants of the saloon car were rushed to Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital and are undergoing treatment. The traffic boss further said that the driver of the trailer escaped and is still being looked for by the police. "We are going to visit them today at the hospital to see how they are doing and if their relatives are around," she said.
