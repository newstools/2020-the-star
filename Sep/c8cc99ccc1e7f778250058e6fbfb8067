Three suspected al Shabaab militants died after they were blown up by their own bomb device in Garissa, near the Kenyan border with Somalia, according to police reports. While the incident happened on Thursday evening, information and confirmations from authorities became available on Friday. Police reports say an Improvised Explosive Devise (IED) exploded while being assembled by the militants at Fafi area killing three on the spot and injuring four. A source confirmed the incident, saying the militants “revealed their own hide out.” “We combed the forest and entire area throughout the night after it become apparent that they might have a mission that failed,” the source told the Star on the phone on Friday. While information on where the injured were being attended to wasn’t clear immediately, other reports say a vehicle was dispatched from the militants base in Somalia and picked them. Police visited the scene and collected other items recovered from the scene for further investigations. The incident happens barely two months after the militants launched an attack Yumbis Border Police camp. Three militants were killed in the night attack that also left three officers injured. At the time, it was said the group that attacked the police camp was ‘huge' and it took a multi-agency ground and air security team to repulse them. Attacks linked with terror group have claimed many civilian and police lives in Northern Kenya, where the situation has been made worse by mistrust and ethnic animosity among the pastoral clans.
