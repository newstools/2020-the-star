Anti-Terror Police Unit detectives are following two terror suspects believed to be hiding in Kwale county, police sources have said. The suspects, one from Kwale and another from Likoni, Mombasa county are being trailed for arrest and prosecution. “They are among a group who came back to the country a while ago but have been trying to recruit others while at home,” a police source said. Coast regional DCI boss Washington Njiiru said reports on the search for the two were true as “the area has many suspects”. Detectives are yet to net Kassim Nassoro Shauti, a terror suspect who escaped a raid on Monday when his accomplice Juma Athman Mwengo was killed. It is feared Nassoro, who escaped through a hole in his house, may have already crossed to Somalia. In the last few months, the state has heightened the war on terror, with many suspects being arrested or gunned down in night raids. In one incident, a family in Chaani, Changamwe subcounty, is in agony after their son was abducted by unknown people late last month. Men dressed in police uniform paraded all men at the Swahili house and asked them to identify themselves. Reports from sources say the missing man may have been radicalised at a madrassa in Msambweni and Malindi. Three of his colleagues have already been arrested. Kwale has suffered abductions and killings linked to terrorism, but a demonstration to mark International Day of the Victims of Enforced Disappearance attracted a few residents last Sunday. While releasing names of nine suspected terror financiers, Interior CS Fred Matiang'i said Wednesday that “the enemy is progressively planting operatives among the civilians strategically to advance his agenda through recruitment and radicalisation to violent extremism and terrorism.” Edited by Henry Makori
