Kenya Rugby Union (KRU) have named a three-man Covid-19 management committee to oversee the resumption of the game. Dr James Ondiege will head the committee and will be assisted by acting Chief executive officer-cum-director of rugby, Thomas Odundo and director in charge of fixtures, Hillary Itela. Ondiege is a medical doctor by profession and has handled medical requests for both the Kenya Simbas and Chipu team travelling for various international assignments in the last couple of years. KRU chairman Oduor Gangla said the union met all the clubs last week to update them on the proposals and recommendations shared with the Ministry of Sports recently in regard to return to action. "We have updated our clubs on the proposals we shared with the government and hopefully,  in the next one  or two weeks,  the Ministry of Sports should be able to give the sports fraternity the way forward on the resumption,” added Gangla. The government last month released guidelines for the return to play with the first phase being dedicated to medical and athletes’ tests. This is to be followed by individual training for seven days and small groups training for a week. The third phase will see collective training. Gangla raised a red flag over the cost testing, which ranges between  Sh8,000 and Sh10,000 per person. He said the private tests costs were very prohibitive considering they have to be done twice a month. “We have not quantified the cost implications so far. But, testing is certainly very expensive and we would hope that the government can reduce the cost of tests. Athletes should get a deal similar to what was offered to the hospitality industry. One test at Sh8,000 to Sh10,000 is out of reach for most Kenyans,” said Gangla.
