The Mombasa government has partnered with the national government and Amref to train health workers on Covid-19 infection prevention and control. The training, which will be carried out in 10 counties, targets to reach 400 participants from every county. The counties targeted are Mombasa, Kwale, Nairobi, Meru, Embu, Kisii, Migori, Homa Bay, Siaya and Kakamega because they are the most affected. Head of Public Health department Susan Mutua said the training is aimed at bringing in something new that will help the country fight the pandemic. She said as much as health workers are protected, they have been hard hit by the pandemic and by Wednesday, 905 medics had tested positive for the virus. “I want to congratulate the county boss and health officials for the good work because Mombasa is the first county to flatten the curve,” Mutua said. She urged the health workers to act as gatekeepers to curb the spread of the virus. Mombasa Health chief officer Pauline Odinga urged health workers to share the information from the training to help others in the community. “As a department, we are here to give full support because we need to own our responsibility, work together and be a good example to others,” Odinga said. Amref's Martin Muchangi urged the health workers to use digital platforms to reach out to the communities.
