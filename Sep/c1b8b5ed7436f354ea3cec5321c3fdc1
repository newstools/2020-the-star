Investigations against controversial Nairobi crime buster Rashid Ahmed are yet to be concluded because a critical witness in the probe is in Germany, Ipoa has said. The Independent Police Oversight Authority on Monday said the probe into the conduct of the officer is impeded by the absence of the witness, making the file incomplete. The officer, based at Pangani police station, has been the subject of agitation by activists and media reports. Critics allege he is responsible for harassing, brutalising and gunning down youths suspected to be violent thugs in the informal settlements, especially Mathare, Dandora and their neighbourhoods. Ipoa has been investigating complaints against the officer including murder, shootings, harassment, assault resulting to serious injuries, robbery, inhuman treatment and sexual assault. Activist Wilfred Olal, who heads the Dandora Social Justice Centre, had told the Star earlier that the officer has close to 33 cases of murder filed at Ipoa against him. The authority had in July said it had concluded investigations and forwarded the file to DPP Noordin Haji. Haji, in turn, reverted the file to the authority highlighting areas to be filled to make the case watertight with reasonable prospects of conviction. "The witness is out of the country and may be out of our reach to conclude the matter," chairperson Anne Makori told a webinar with journalists. The apparent hopelessness at the authority suggesting that the probe had hit a dead end spells doom to many families who believe their loved ones met their death or injury at the hands of the crime buster. The authority also called for the enhancement of the powers of OCSs and OCDPs by giving them budgetary allocations to take care of the infrastructural needs of their stations. This, it said, would ensure expanded holding cells and hygiene at the stations in the face coronavirus. Edited by R.Wamochie
