Churchill Show comedian Othuol Othuol, real name Ben Morris, has suffered a relapse in his ongoing struggles with tuberculosis. In July, Othuol was discharged from Kenyatta National Hospital to continue recovering from home. Speaking to Word Is back then, Laugh Industry’s Ken Waudo said Othuol would still be attending physical hospital sessions every three days for about three months. "So ideally he’s still hospitalised but nursing from home. So he still needs our support and prayers as much as never before," he said. Waudo further said Othuol has been having TB complications for quite some time, and he has been in and out of hospitals for treatment. "When he fainted at home, he was rushed to Kitengela Hospital, where he was treated until he was conscious, then he was referred to Kenyatta National Hospital," he said. On Monday evening, Othuol sent out a distress message to his family, friends and fellow comedians. The message sent to Waudo read in part, "Hi, hope this finds you well. I want to thank you for the support you have offered me. Meanwhile, sijapona and I will be going back to Kenyatta Hospital for a 2nd MRI." The first MRI scan indicated he has an abnormal infection in the brain. Waudo said, "The medics told us they could not confirm if it's a tumour or not." The comedian is admitted at Shalom Hospital in Machakos county. His message goes on: "As at now the growth imenishika, ulimi umefura hata. I am not able to either eat or talk. I am pleading with you for any assistance to enable me get treatment. Thanks and God bless."
