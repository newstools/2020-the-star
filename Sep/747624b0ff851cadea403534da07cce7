Some young people in Teso North who took Uwezo Fund loans have failed to repay, MP Oku Kaunya has said. Kaunya said the poor repayment of the loans is limiting access to the money by other youth groups in the constituency. "The groups that initially received the loans thought that the money would be given for free. They quickly formed groups, took the money, and they have refused to repay,” the MP said in Amagoro on Tuesday. Kaunya urged the youths to become proactive and repay their loans. On Monday, 21 youth groups received part of the Sh4.47 million which the MP gave out as Uwezo loans in the constituency. Other beneficiaries were 40 women groups and two groups of persons living with disabilities. The MP said the delay in the disbursement of the money, which had not been given out since 2017 was as a result of the Uwezo Fund Board resolution that the loans would be given out after each group had repaid at least half of the amount they had received. Western Region Youth Affairs coordinator Timothy Kajwang’ said women and groups formed by persons living with disabilities generally performed well in repayment compared to young people. “From the outside, you might think that the youth groups are fewer compared to those of women. But as an insider, the youth have no problem with the absorption of the money. The problem they have is repayment. If you look at the trend, women and persons living with disabilities are more loyal and cooperative,” Kajwang’ said. Edited by A.N
