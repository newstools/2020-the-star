With two years remaining until the general elections, the political pool is getting crowded. This offers a great opportunity for Kenyans to begin to evaluate their leaders. As Kenyans begin to reflect on the gains made in post-Independent Kenya, we need to delve more into the quality of our leaders and Kenya's transformational value 60 years down the line. It is time for serious reflections and critical questions on the management of affairs of our great country, rather than holding our peace and passing the responsibility to the next generation to ask the same questions we are asking today while still languishing in abject poverty. Recently, Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua officially launched his 2022 presidential bid, promising a 'reboot' moment and a fresh start for Kenyans, with a pledge of five million jobs in his first three years in office. But as Kenyans of goodwill, we need to ask ourselves what his candidature really means to the ordinary folk. The two-term governor has vowed to pay great attention and priority to Kenyaâ€™s infrastructure by building roads and highways in every constituency to spur economic growth. Presiding over recovery and a fresh beginning would likely be a necessity the centerpiece of his presidency, which will be accompanied by a refined economic plan. Healthcare remains a top priority for him. As the coronavirus crisis continues to unfold with deep-seated corruption schemes coming to light, he has looked for ways and works closely with the Senate Ad Hoc Committee on Covid-19 to help formulate recommendations rooted in advice from healthcare and economics experts. It is time for Kenya to usher in a new dispensation, a new era, a new period of better leadership and life. We need a new way of thinking, doing things and a new type of leaders.
