Ken receives an emergency call from his parents back in the village that they need sh.6,000 urgently. This puts him between a rock and a hard place because it is mid-month. He has no cash on him and he quickly makes calls to his four friends, asking ask for a bail out. He even promises a refund with interest if necessary at the end of the month. One of his friends states he is dead broke while another states says that he is skint, having spent the last of his surplus on his wife who suddenly fell ill. Luckily, James has some sh.2,000 to spare and John can give sh.3,000 and this almost sorts out Ken's problem. He then gets the balance from his uncle who probably may not want it back because this is a family matter. The reality is that over 70% of Kenyans have found themselves in such a situation.
