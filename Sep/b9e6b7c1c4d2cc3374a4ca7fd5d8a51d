Posta Rangers are on the verge of securing the services of Gor Mahia forward Dennis Oalo. The club's head coach Sammy "Pamzo' Omollo said they have been chasing the forward for long and was hopeful of landing him ahead of the new season. Oalo, who joined Gor in July last year from National Super League side Nairobi Stima,Â  was starved of playing time, thanks to the competition from Nicholas Kipkirui, Juma Balinya and Gislein Yikpe who were all preferred ahead of him. "Negotiations between us and the player are at an advanced stage and we are hoping we will agree on everything and complete the deal. I am counting on the player to boost my striking force," he said Pamzo, who confirmed the arrival of Tom Onyango and Salim Hamisi from Chemelil Sugar and Western Stima respectively, said he was seeking to add two more players before the transfer window closes. "This time round, we are not doing massive recruitment as we have retained most of our players. We are only replacing the five who have left as well as strengthen the weak areas," added the former Kenyan international. At the same time, Pamzo hinted on the looming good times for playing unit as their bosses were gearing to clear the outstanding salary arrears. The players and members of the technical bench have gone without pay from March.
