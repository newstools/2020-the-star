A woman in Nairobi has pleaded guilty to mistreating an eight-year-old girl for failing to wash utensils. The girl had been left in Winfred Nyawira Munyari's custody. She beat her up and inflicted injuries on her face, neck and cheeks using a wire. She was arraigned before Kibera senior resident magistrate Renee Kitagwa. Munyari committed the offence on August 12 along Ngiria Road in Riruta. She dragged the girl outside the house and neighbours came to her rescue.Â  By then she had sustained injuries and multiple scratches. She also had old scars all over her body. Kitagwa directed that the matter be mentioned on Wednesday for further directions.
