No Kenyan died from Covid-19 on Tuesday, the death toll remaining at 577. The Health ministry said 27 patients were in intensive care unit in different facilities in the country. Sixteen were on supplementary oxygen and 11 on ventilators. The number of recoveries surpassed 20,000 after 318 more patients were discharged. Health CAS Rashid Aman said that 263 were discharged from home-based care while 55 were released from health facilities. Some 20,211 people have recovered from the virus. The ministry, however, admitted challenges in contact tracing. The problem has been compounded by the fact that the exercise falls on county governments, it said. “There has been a challenge in contact tracing especially in specific localities in some of the hotspots like Nairobi county,” the CAS said. “As the numbers started growing in the country, and you begin to pick up more and more positive cases, equally the network of contacts becomes almost an exponential number and this poses challenges in terms of being able to follow up and identify and trace and test each and every contact.” However, 114 more people tested positive for the country from a sample size of 1,682, bringing the total caseload to 34,315. The new cases were aged between one year and 85 years, comprising 93 men and 21 women. Only one was a foreigner. Mombasa overtook Nairobi to record the highest number of cases after registering 17 new infections. Nairobi followed with 16 new cases and Garissa third with 15. Kiambu and Kitui had 14 cases each, Busia 12, Taita Taveta eight, Uasin Gishu six, Nyeri five, Migori three, Machakos two while Embu and Kisumu recorded one case each. Nairobi, however, leads in the cumulative number of positive cases, accounting for 57 per cent of all the confirmed cases with 19,494. Kiambu follows with 2,524 cases, accounting for 7.3 per cent. Mombasa comes third with 2,387 cases (6.8 per cent), followed by Kajiado with 1,878 cases, accounting for 5.4 per cent of the total cases. “Elgeyo Marakwet and West Pokot are the least affected, with both counties recording six cases each,” the CAS said. Seventeen counties have recorded between 101 and 1,000 cases with the majority (21) recording between 11 and 100 cases. The ministry warned Kenyans on the risks of smoking, noting that the habit reduces lung capacity and increases the severity of respiratory diseases. According to the CAS, smoking and the social nature of many forms of tobacco use present risks of person-to-person transmission of respiratory viruses including SARS-CoV-2 that causes Covid-19. “All forms of tobacco are harmful and there is no safe level of exposure to tobacco. Often, users of these forms of tobacco do not understand or appreciate their health dangers.” Edited by Henry Makorin
