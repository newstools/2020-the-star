Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria has called on Kenyans to take the coronavirus disease seriously after testing positive. "I really hope that beyond all the debate around Covid-19, all and sundry will not forget that coronavirus is real," he said. Kuria said the worst thing Kenya can do is to lower its guard. "And above all let us remember our gallant front line workers- Not just doctors and nurses, but subordinate staff who put their lives in the line of danger to give care to coronavirus patients," he said. "If you are in a hospital bed- Like myself for the last 27 days here at Karen Hospital you witness first hand the amount of sacrifice they make amid very difficult circumstances. " He said that one learns to focus more on the virus and the front line workers. "...and less on side shows. We shall overcome Covid-19," he added. Earlier, Health Director General Patrick Amoth said theÂ curve has shown proof of early reduction of new confirmed Covid-19 cases. On the state of positive cases reported in the country, Amoth said that it is true that the positivity rate for Covid-19 has declined. "But all the preventive and surveillance measures are supposed to continually be enhanced to sustain the gains made," he said. He added that strict adherence to the curfew is one of the measures which has yielded great results and led to reduced transmission of the virus. This is in combination with other infection prevention measures such as wearing masks, keeping social and physical distance and washing hands.
