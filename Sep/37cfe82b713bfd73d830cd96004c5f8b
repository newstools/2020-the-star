The new leadership of the East Africa Church of God should not ruin the legacy of their departed leader Archbishop Byrum Makokha, Bumula MP Mwambu Mabonga has said. Mabonga urged the leaders to unite and build on the work Makokha did for 50 years and serve the faithful. He said at Ibubi Church of God on Sunday that Makokha led the church for five decades without wrangles emerging. The lawmaker urged the faithful to give Makokha a decent send-off by fostering unity. “Everywhere there are challenges in leadership. The archbishop had his challenges but for the 50 years he was on the throne we saw the church doing well,” Mabonga said. The MP's remarks came a day after differences emerged in the leadership following the controversial hiring of a firm to develop a multi-million property in Nairobi a week after Makokha's death. “For those going to take over the leadership of this church, I'm appealing to you to make sure the church remains united,” he said. Mabonga urged deputy archbishop James Opunde and director for guidance and counselling Benson Andebe to bring the faithful together. Sources say worshippers have begun aligning themselves in groups supporting  Opunde and another for Andebe. Nominated ANC lawmaker Godfrey Osotsi told journalists to not dwell only on Makokha's failures. “We have our own failures in life and we must admit that; so that should not be our stepping stone to tarnish Archbishop Byrum Makokha,” Osotsi said.
