@robertomollo3 Homa Bay residents have not been able to file cases in court after the Judiciary's digital system developed technical hitches. For the last week, many residents have failed to file cases in Homa Bay and Mbita courts. The Judiciary developed the Case Tracking System recently for filing cases online. The system works in a manner that all details of a new case are entered in the digital system to generate an invoice. Upon payment of a fee using the invoice, a case number is generated and the case is considered filed. But residents feel they are denied justice.  They include human rights activist Evans Oloo who could not file a case in which he wanted to challenge the Ministry of Education over the reopening of learning institutions. This results from the fact that some schools were used as Covid-19 quarantine centres. “Many other residents and I have visited Homa Bay court many times to file our cases but we have not succeeded,” Oloo said. The residents want the Judiciary to get an alternative way to file cases or get a robust system that cannot develop problems to stop the anomaly. Some of Judiciary officials who spoke to the Star in confidence said the problem occurred after the online filing system developed technical hitches in Nairobi. “The digital system is controlled from Nairobi. We are talking to our bosses in Nairobi to rectify the anomaly,” an officer said. Edited by R.Wamochie
