ODM party leader Raila Odinga has mourned the death of former Information assistant minister Elisha Godana, who passed away on Thursday evening. The former minister died after a short illness. Via Twitter on  Friday, Raila said the passing on of Godana marks an end of a long and truly illustrious career marked by persistent quest for change. "My sincere condolences to his family and the people of Marsabit whom he served with dedication from Independence to date," he said. "His was a life well lived for Kenya." Treasury CS Ukur Yatani also mourned Godana. "My condolences to the family, friends and Marsabit community following the passing on of the former Member of Parliament for Marsabit North ," he said. Between 1974 and 1979, Godana served as the MP for Marsabit North and was later recruited into former President Daniel Moi's  Cabinet as the Assistant Minister for Information and Broadcasting. Prior to Kenya gaining its Independence, he served as a provincial administrative clerical officer at the Marsabit Detention Camp during the late 50s and early 60s. There, he became a popular figure among Mau Mau detainees who were confined there as he would help dispatch letters to their loved ones. Godana, who was born in 1937 in Marsabit, became the first elected Member of Parliament for Rendille (Marsabit) in 1963.
