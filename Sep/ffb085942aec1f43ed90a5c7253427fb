A Bungoma county assembly committee has said those seeking to kick Governor Wycliffe Wangamati out of office 'are just doing business'. The Bungoma county assembly Public Administration and ICT committee members said that the evidence given by two petitioners - Nyukuri Barasa of Torch Africa and Moses Lukoye - was pedestrian and was full of hearsay. The team said the evidence was not watertight to warrant kicking the governor out of office. Nominated MCA Luke Opwora presented the committee report to the assembly on September 2. Committee chairman Okumu Majimbo and majority leader Joseph Nyongesa said they threw out the petition because it lacked merit. Speaking in Bungoma town, Majimbo said petitioners Barasa and  Lukoye did not present enough reason to warrant an impeachment motion. The petitioners had accused Wangamati of corruption, illegal creation of unnecessary offices and gross violation of the public procurement law. They also accused him of gross misconduct by concentrating more on political party issues. “They were just after doing business with the county government. They wanted to make money,” Majimbo said. The Khalaba MCA said the evidences the petitioners presented was a mere waste of time. His Musikoma ward counterpart George Makari said the petitioners should provide watertight evidence. The committee returned the petition to the petitioners for them to take another step. Wangamati is now free to carry on with his development projects without any difficulty after the MCAs threw out the impeachment report. Edited by A.N
