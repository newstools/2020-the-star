With schools closed and children at home, parents have been urged to spend more time with their young ones and connect with them. Coast Association for Persons with Disability (CPWD) chief executive Hamisa Zaja said parents bonding with their children could avert issues like teenage pregnancies. “This is the best opportunity to sit with your children to learn and understand them better than before,” she said. Zaja said that the closure of learning institutions is for the safety of learners during the pandemic. She spoke during the marking of the Islamic New Year according to the Islamic Hijra calendar at Noor orphanage in Likoni constituency, Mombasa. More than 100 orphans at the centre were given mentorship talks while girls received sanitary towels. Zaja called on elected leaders to spearhead a campaign to stop early pregnancies at orphanages and rescue centres. The CPWD boss reminded girls to borrow a leaf from her, adding that there is always light at the end of the tunnel. She is living testimony, being a person living with disability, she said. Zaja said she was able to complete her education despite being disadvantaged. She resolved to use her profile to be a role model for girls. Edited by R.Wamochie
