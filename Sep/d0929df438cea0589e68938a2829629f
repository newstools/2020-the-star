Plea taking for businessman Chris Obure and Robert Ouko Bodo has been deferred to Monday. The two have been linked to the murder of car dealer Kevin Omwenga in his Galana Suites apartment two weeks ago. The suspects were initially presented before Kibera Magistrate Derrick Kuto on Friday morning. Omwenga was laid to rest at his Kisii home last week. The suspects' lawyers sought anticipatory bail, which was set aside after they were taken to Milimani law courts.. The two were presented at Milimani law courts, where Justice James Wakiaga virtually directed the prosecution to make sure the suspects are taken for mental assessment before Monday. The prosecution had sought to have them held for seven more days, but the judge declined. Prosecutor Allan Mogere had previously told the court that preliminary investigations showed that Omwenga, 28, was shot in his bedroom with a firearm belonging to Obure. At the time of the shooting, the victim was in the company of his brother Wycliffe Omwenga, 28, Bodo and two other men and a woman, according to police reports. Wycliffe, who was first to respond to the sound of gunfire, found his brother lying on his back with blood oozing from his chest. He was rushed to Nairobi Women's Hospital Adams branch where he was pronounced dead on arrival, a police report filed at Kilimani police station indicates. CCTV footage showed Omwenga leaving the apartment at 9.39pm and returning an hour later with a woman, Bodo following him a few moments later. Obure is a licensed firearm holder while Bodo is not.
