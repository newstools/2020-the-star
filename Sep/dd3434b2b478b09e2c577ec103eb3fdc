Gospel singer and former Recapp group member Manolo is set to launch a Vlog, 'No Grey with Manolo'. Speaking to Word Is, he said the Vlog will be highlighting some challenges faced by the youths. "I will be shedding light on some grey areas in a young Christian life." Ahead of the launch, he has released 'Faith Anthem', a song that invokes an Abraham-like faith in the Almighty God. "The chorus says it all, that if God says it, then it is done," he said. Manolo is popular among the Kenyan urban youth, especially fans of gospel music. He began his music career in 2012 as the lead member of Recapp, an urban gospel group.
