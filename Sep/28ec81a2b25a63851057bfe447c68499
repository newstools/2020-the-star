The Court of Appeal has declined to suspend he hearing of an appeal by former City Hall chief finance officer Jimmy Kiamba challenging a ruling that he should pay the government Sh317 million. The court also declined to suspend the hearing of another appeal by Kiamba and his wife, Tracy Mbinya, to stop the anti-graft agency from investigating his source of income. Kiamba wanted both appeals stayed pending the determination of a case before the Supreme Court in which the DPP and the EACC are challenging a decision of a lower court requiring them to notify suspects prior to investigating their bank accounts. The former finance officer, through lawyer Tom Ojienda, urged the court to find that there was no need to proceed with the hearing of the appeal because it raised issues pending in the Supreme Court. Justices Martha Koome,  Kathurima M’Inoti and Sankale ole Kantai said it was in the interest of justice and of all parties that the two appeals be heard and determined without further delay. “The appeals involve allegations of corruption and theft of public resources which are matters of great public importance and interest. Furthermore, we are satisfied that this court is capable of determining the issues of interpretation and application of the Constitution raised in the appeal,” they ruled. The judges said there was no compelling reason to exercise their discretion to stay the hearing of both appeals. "We direct that the two appeals be re-listed for hearing before any bench of the court on a date convenient to all the parties," they said. In July last year, anti-corruption court judge Hedwig Ong’undi ordered Kiamba to pay the government Sh317 million for unexplained assets. Ong’undi said the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission established on a balance of probability that the cash deposits, which kiamba tried to explain through his revenue collection, constituted unexplained assets and should be forfeited to the state.
