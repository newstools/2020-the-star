The Mandera government has gone against the Council of Governors directive to shut down operations following the protracted revenue-sharing stalemate in the Senate. Governor Ali Roba on Thursday said in a statement that he wants operations to continue uninterrupted. According to the statement, Roba said he is opposed to the ‘war’ with the Senate. “Mandera county is not shutting down any services. We will offer services to our people and all our staff are on duty. We are hurting due to the cash crisis, but we are and will stretch ourselves offering services until such a time that we are unable to proceed,” the statement read. “The Mandera county government will advertise with Nation Media Group contrary to the CoG's orders. We will advertise with Standard Group, Radio Africa, Royal Media Services and Mediamax, among other local FM stations.” The county chief has further promised to honour all summonses and cooperate with the Senate to find ways of bettering devolution. “Governor Roba is of the view that the current Senate is much better than the previous one. A comprehensive signed formal statement will follow in due course.” Roba's resolution is likely to rub the CoG the wrong way. CoG chairman Wycliffe Oparanya said in a statement on Wednesday the shutdown had been occasioned by lack of resources after senators failed to agree on the revenue-sharing formula. “Since the Senate has not been able to unlock the stalemate on the flow of funds, it is not clear when this impasse will be resolved,” Oparanya said. Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana and his West Pokot counterpart John Lonyangapuo have defended Oparanya, saying it was unfair for senators to launch personal attacks on the Kakamega governor over the directive. The duo spoke on KTN News interview Thursday morning. They said county government staff have been offering services for the last three months without pay and it is only wise that they rest until the money is disbursed.
