It is now almost three weeks since the Senate formed a committee to look into the counties revenue sharing formula. So far, it seems little progress has been made to resolve the impasse that is threatening to kill service delivery in the counties. Some counties have been forced to take up commercial loans so they can continue operating. Meanwhile, thousands of county employees are going without salaries while suppliers have been left seeking loans to bridge the income gaps and sustain their families. Now that the Senate team has handed its report to the House leadership, senators must move with speed and resolve this matter. In addition, the Senate must come up with a legal framework to protect counties from such impasses in the future. Kenyans adopted devolution as a means of ensuring that resources are no longer centralised. There is, therefore, no devolution without resources. The Senate must rise to the occasion, put aside its political differences and resolve this issue. Quote of the Day: “The problems we face, did not come down from the heavens.
