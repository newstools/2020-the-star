Residents of Karagita estate in Naivasha were Tuesday shocked to find a man brutally murdered and the body locked in his house. It’s suspected that the man who lived with two friends was murdered elsewhere before the mutilated body was dumped in his house. When police moved in, they found that all the occupants of the residential compound and the two people who were living with the man had fled from the area. Area chief Hassan Guyo said the residents were not sure of what transpired, although it was clear that the man had been murdered elsewhere. He said that the body had deep cuts on the back and the head inflicted by a sharp object. “There is a trickle of blood from the gate and the door was forcibly opened from the outside and the deceased left to bleed to death,” he said. Guyo added that police were seeking a man and a woman who lived with the man. Meanwhile, residents of Mithuri estate in Naivasha and along the Nairobi-Nakuru highway have called on Kenha to erect speed bumps in the area to address rising cases of fatal accidents. A man was hit and killed by a motorist on Monday evening while crossing the highway on his way home. This brought to five the number of people from the estate who have been killed by cars along the highway since the year began. According to James Kabono from Naivasha Safety Group, the estate along the highway is highly populated with many workers crossing the busy road in the evening. In the latest incident, the man had bought some personal effects and was crossing the road when he was hit by a car, he said. “Just like other trading centres along the highway, we are calling on Kenha to erect speed bumps to arrest the rising number of accidents,” he said. Naivasha OCPD Samuel Waweru confirmed both cases, saying that the bodies had been collected and inquest files opened. Edited by Henry Makori
