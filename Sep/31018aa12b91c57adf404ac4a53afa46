The order to move the Kenya Meat Commission from the Ministry of Agriculture's Livestock Department to the Ministry of Defence continues to arouse varying reactions from Kenyans. The internal memo from Agriculture CS Peter Munya to the livestock PS Harry Kimtai directed the transfer of ministerial responsibility of the KMC to the Ministry of Defence. "Following the transfer of Ministerial responsibility of Kenya Meat Commission to the Ministry of Defence by the President, you are directed to facilitate a seamless transfer of KMC to the Ministry of Defence,” the memo dated September 7 read. Weighing into the changes, LSK president Nelson Havi said on Wednesday through his Twitter account that the order violated the Constitution. “The transfer of Kenya Meat Commission to Ministry of Defence by President Uhuru Kenyatta is yet another egregious violation of the Constitution aggravating his abuse of State power,” Havi said. Havi said that the order should be ‘disregarded by Agriculture CS and his PS’ failing which they will be held personally liable. In the memo, Munya further directed the PS to ensure coordination of the entire exercise with the National Treasury and transfer the associated budgets to the next scheduled Supplementary Budget. Speaking to the Star on Wednesday, Kimtai said one of the biggest challenges that KMC has been facing is lack of market and the move will go a long way in giving solution to this. “The Kenya Defence Force and the military will form one of our Buy Kenya, Build Kenya strategy where KMC will supply meat to the armed forces. The reorganization will help in the management and ease of things,” he said. Kimtai assured Kenyans that this is an executive order which guides smooth running of the government-owned meat processor and the whole operation is ongoing and the Ministry of Agriculture is still working closely with KMC.
