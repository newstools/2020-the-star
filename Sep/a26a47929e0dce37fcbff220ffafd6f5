Embu Agricultural Show of Kenya (ASK) branch chairman John Mukundi has declared interest in the governorship to provide what he terms proper leadership. Mukundi who is the proprietor of Achievers College lamented that Embu county has for many years trailed its neighbours economically, politically and in many other aspects due to lack of proper leadership. He said despite being rich in natural, human and other resources Embu lags behind Kirinyaga, Tharaka Nithi and Machakos. It has a shortage of development-conscious leaders who can carry out proper strategic plans, effectively use available resources and successfully lobby for financial and political assistance. Mukundi, a pastor with Reiners' Church, said Embu has a lot of agricultural potential, which to date has never been exhaustively tapped. Semi-arid Mbeere subcounty if provided with enough water can provide enough food for the county and for export, he said. He said several big rivers including River Tana pass through the county and that most of the Seven Forks hydroelectricity dams are in the county, from which irrigation water can be drawn. “I am disappointed to see local leaders have been unable to source for funds or fight for construction of mega dams for irrigation or tapping water from the existing rivers and dams for irrigation yet our neighbours have in the past had mega dams constructed by the national government,” Mukundi said. He said high license fees and other charges have been impacting negatively on the growth of business in Embu. Edited by Henry Makori
