Nairobi City Stars have completed the signing of Kariobangi Sharks defensive midfielder Sven Yidah. Yidah becomes the sixth signing for the big spending City Stars ahead of their return to the Kenya Premier League next season. He signed a two-year contract. He is the second player to join the senior team rank  after striker Erick Ombija who joined from Gor Mahia.  The club had earlier signed youngsters Rowland Makati from Vapor Sports, Timothy Ouma from Laiser Hill Academy, Ronney Kola Oyaro from Kenya School of Government (KSG) and keeper Elvis Ochieng Ochoro from Hakati Sportiff—all roped in as developmental players. Speaking after his unveiling at City Stars offices on Monday, Sven, a Kenya U23 player said: “I am happy to join Nairobi City Stars. They have an ambitious project and I am eager to play a part in making it a success.” He added: “I will also be joining my former teammates (Ebrima) Sanneh, Shittu (Salim Abdalla) and Wycliffe (Otieno) who also played a huge role in convincing me to be part of this project. I promise work hard and to be full committed every day and any day.” Team coordinator, Samson Otieno said: “His defensive acumen were a great attraction to us and he was our number choice. We are glad he has taken his position ahead of a long list of interested players. The experience he carries from Kariobangi Sharks will be of great value to City Stars. I welcome him on board.” Yidah, who has 97 Kenyan Premier League (KPL) appearances with Sharks from the 2017 season, will don significant jersey number 18 at City Stars – same as the one he held at Sharks. Number 18 denotes his birth date as well as that of his daughter, and its the jersey number that was owned by club legend Arthur Museve from the 2006/7 season all through to his retirement at the close of the 2018/19 season.
