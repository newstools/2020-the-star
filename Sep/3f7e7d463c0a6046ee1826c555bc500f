Yersmin Sayed, popularly known as Maria for her role in the local drama series, has started a CSR initiative. This came after she was named the Indomie brand ambassador on Saturday during Jiamini CSR in Kibra. Her initiative aims to empower young girls across the country. Over the weekend, Maria donated foodstuffs to over 400 women from the area. â€œI am happy and grateful about my first CSR. I am from Kibra and that's the reason I went back to give back," she said. "We donated foodstuffs and sanitary towels to over 400 women and young girls in Kibra. It was all about sharing hope and encouraging the girls to believe in themselves through the Jiamini initiative." Adding, "I would like to thank everyone who has been part of this, ensuring we touch girls lives in the slums and also believing in me as their brand ambassador."
