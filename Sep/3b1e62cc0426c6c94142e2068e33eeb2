Kabras head coach Mzingaye Nyathi and his assistant Felix Reyon are expected in the country this Saturday. The duo, who were appointed in July and August respectively, are expected to meet the squad next week before embarking on plans for the 2020-2021 season. Kabras chairman,Phillip Jalango, said strategy and tactical meetings will be held by the incoming coaches to chart away forward for the season ahead, once the Ministry of Sports gives the green-light for return to play. “We want to lay a foundation and start planning for the season. We need to have detailed analysis by of the team and let the new technical team familiarise themselves with the players and other members of staff,” added Jalango. Jalango added that the players have been training individually for the past couple of months to keep themselves fit. He exuded confidence that his charges will be competitive once the season starts with the core of the squad still intact. “The vast majority of the players who did duty last season are available and the hunger and desire to win is still within the team. We hope to do better than last season,” added Jalango. Key players for the Sugarmillers include internationals George Nyambua, Dan Sikuta, Asman Mugerwa, Hillary Odhiambo, Max Adaka while Brian Tanga, Felix Ayange ande Nick Barasa. On his appointment last month, Nyathi said he hopes to tweak the team’s tactical approach once the season starts. “The first target is to build on the great standards the club has built in the last five seasons culminating Kenya Cup crown in 2016 and Enterprise Cup title last year,” noted Nyathi. The Kakamega-based side have, however, lost the last three Kenya Cup finals to KCB and the Zimbabwean tactician will be tasked with ending the bankers’ monopoly of the league title.
