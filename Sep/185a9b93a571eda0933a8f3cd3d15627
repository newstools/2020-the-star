The Teachers Service Commission has dismissed as fake news reports that it has cancelled the ongoing recruitment exercise. The circulated fake notice in social media platforms purports that the commission had postponed the exercise due to ICT technical problems which caused the loss of applicants’ data. It had also claimed that TSC will later announce dates of reapplications and interviews. Dismissing the claims, the commission said that it has not cancelled the ongoing recruitment of teachers. “We wish to advise applicants and the general public to be vigilant of individuals and social media accounts that specialize in spreading fake news,” TSC said. The commission had announced on September 1, that it was recruiting more than 5,000 teachers to fill vacancies in both primary and secondary public schools. The teachers to be recruited will serve on permanent and pensionable terms of service. Qualified applicants had until September 14, 2020, to submit their applications through the commission’s online website. TSC said they are seeking to recruit 4,000 secondary school teaching posts and the qualification includes being a Kenyan citizen, have at least a diploma in education, and must be a registered teacher with the Teachers Service Commission. The commission is also seeking to promote and deploy 1,000 public primary teachers and applicants must be a Kenyan citizen, must be a holder of a PI certificate, and must be a registered teacher with the Teachers Service Commission.
