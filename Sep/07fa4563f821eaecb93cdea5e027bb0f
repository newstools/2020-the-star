Kenya Airways CEO and chief human resource officer risk a six-month civil jail after being found guilty of contempt for recruiting 800 workers against a court order. Kenya Aviation Workers Union sued KQ management for contempt, accusing it of recruiting staff on short contracts and less pay against a court order. In a ruling by Justice Hellen Wasilwa on September 16, the court found that Kenya Airways CEO Allan Kilavuka and chief human resource officer Everlyn Munyoki were in contempt for ignoring her orders issued on February 26. “It is, therefore, my finding that the respondents have breached the orders of this court by employing assistant supplies officers at terms less favourable than those granted to employees on permanent and pensionable terms,” Justice Wasilwa ruled. Wasilwa added that she found the duo guilty and liable to punishment accordingly. Kawu claimed that KQ hired a number of workers outsourced from firms such as Carrier Directions Limited, Insights Management Limited and African Cargo Handling Limited against a court order issued in December last year. “Despite being served and having knowledge of an order of this court issued on December 6, 2019, the respondent (KQ) through its officers are deliberately disobeying this court order,” Kawu said in its petition. The union now wants Kilavuka and Munyoki committed to civil jail for contempt of court. The union argued it had evidence showing KQ directly recruited employees at lower pay compared to that of other employees doing similar jobs at the airline. KQ had been issued with a court order to not hire Kawu members on short-term contracts and at a lesser pay than that enjoyed by permanent employees until a court case about the 2014 collective bargaining agreement was heard and concluded. KQ has been battling court cases by Kawu and Kenya Airline Pilots Association on hiring and firing procedures. Both unions have been citing the prevailing CBAs.  Edited by EKibii
