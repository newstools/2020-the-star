A section of church leaders has denounced the recent verbal attacks against the President and Deputy President by some leaders. The religious leaders from different church denominations especially criticised insulting remarks directed towards former first lady Mama Ngina Kenyatta. "We wish to condemn in the strongest terms possible the irresponsible and unfortunate remarks made by a cross-section of political leaders directed to our President. In particular, we were concerned by the insults directed on the founding Mother of the Nation," the leaders said during a press conference at the Deliverance Church Lang'ata on Friday. The religious leaders were referring to Emurua Dikirr MP Johana Ng'eno who was on September 7 arrested over his remarks on the President's mother. "We equally condemn the remarks made by some of the political leaders against the Deputy President." Ng'eno who was released on bail. He had been charged with hate speech. They clergy warned that leaders are no longer settling their political differences in an acceptable manner and instead resolve to incite the public while protecting their own agitations. Environment CS Keriako Tobiko last week blasted Ruto, calling him a â€˜mere' clerk. "This kind of behaviour can easily erode the gains that have been made so far and has serious Social, Political and Spiritual ramifications in the country," they said. "We call upon all our leaders to restrain themselves and exercise a high level of sobriety while articulating issues, having in mind the consequences that follow careless and reckless utterances." They urged leaders to concentrate on aiding Kenyans to cope with effects of Covid-19 pandemic. "We call upon the President to initiate a reconciliation strategy that will restore unity in the Government and calm the country from the anxiety that has resulted from the seeming conflict in the presidency," they said.
