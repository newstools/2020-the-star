Three container clinics will be opened in Mombasa to complement Beyond Zero clinic services, Public Health chief officer Pauline Odinga has said. The clinics have already been moved to Mtongwe, Mwakirunge and Shika Adabu, Odinga said. They come complete with family planning, outpatient, ante-natal care and immunisation, dressing, emergency and counselling services. However, complicated cases are referred to hospitals. The self-contained units were bought by the National Government. Odinga, who spoke during the launch of Infection, Prevention Control in Behaviour Change of Covid-19 training in Mombasa, said the clinics will start operation after the installation of basements. The Mwakirunge clinic will substitute the one at Vikwatani, which is being upgraded to replace the Technical University of Mombasa quarantine centre. Odinga said the three clinics will be manned by National Government employees. The construction of the basements is being undertaken by the National Youth Service. “I got a communication from National Youth Service that they will start the installation of basement work in two weeks’ time. We will thereafter do the official launch,” she said. Meanwhile, the Beyond Zero clinic services, which were closed due to fear that healthcare workers might contract Covid-19, will be restored when the county Health department resumes outreach services. The clinic was used rotationally in sub-counties for outreach services. It will be given a master facility list code and assigned  staff. “The clinic is not functioning due to the pandemic but it will be back when we start our outreach services,” Odinga announced. The facility gets drugs directly from Kemsa.   - mwaniki fm
