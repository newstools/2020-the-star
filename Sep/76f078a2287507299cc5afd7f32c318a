Tharaka Nithi Governor Muthomi Njuki has been charged with conspiracy to commit an offence of corruption of over Sh34 million alongside 20 others. Muthomi denied the charges on Tuesday before Chief Magistrate Douglas Ogoti. The governor was also charged with another count of conflict of interest in a tender worth Sh34 million. The county boss will spend another night in police custody ahead of Wednesday's bail ruling. The prosecution did not oppose bail but told the court to grant stringent measures. Muthomi surrendered and presented himself to the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission headquarters on Monday. DPP Noordin Haji had last week ordered the prosecution of the governor and other county officials over a Sh34.9 million tender awarded irregularly. The tender was for the supply, installation and commissioning of a solid waste incinerator. The DPP on Friday said seven companies, many of which were associated with Njuki, put in bids for the tender. Westomaxx, which submitted fraudulent documents, won the tender.
