Embu teachers have objected to the government’s plan to reopen schools earlier than January as previously communicated. They want the country to be declared Covid-19 free before schools can be reopened. Kenya National Union of Teachers’ Embu executive secretary Josphat Kathumi said schools are not prepared for reopening. Kathumi said it will be almost impossible for learners, especially in primary schools, to adhere to the strict regulations the government has set to contain the virus. Reopening the institutions before the spread of the virus is curbed could lead to mass infections, he said. Kathumi said keeping social distance, wearing of masks, use of a toilet by not more than 15 female learners or 20 male ones cannot be achieved. Younger learners, especially, cannot avoid playing and mingling with each other, he said. He said the government had promised construction of more classes to enable social distancing, but none has been built. In some schools in Embu, up to 70 pupils sit in one class, he said. Kathumi said learners will be unable to concentrate due to fear and stigma. Parents will also be stressed about the safety of their children. The unionist asked Education CS George Magoha to go by his earlier declaration that the school calendar is wasted. The government should thereafter put extra efforts in fighting the coronavirus so that schools can open unconditionally next year. Kathuma also asked Magoha to seek advice from the parents and other stakeholders on the ground. They know better than officers in Nairobi, he said. He said parents are just as eager for their children to resume learning but they are concerned about their health and safety. On Monday, the Education Ministry said teachers should prepare to reopen schools next month. The Teachers Service Commission has already asked the tutors to report back by Monday next week to prepare the schools.
