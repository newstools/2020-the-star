The government has rehabilitated a road in Maragua town that has been in a sorry state for close to a decade. Residents said the poor state of the road hurt the economy of the town and made it unconducive for business. Many businesses closed down as most people relocated and matatus kept off the town due to the huge potholes. Three banks also closed shop, causing loss of jobs. On Tuesday, residents praised the government, saying the new road has given the town a facelift. They said the road project that covers about 10km from Nginda village to Maragua town will ease transportation. “Matatus dropped us off at the entrance of the town and we had to get boda bodas to get our goods into Maragua town,” Esther Murigi, a trader in Maragua market, said. Maragua town, which is about a kilometre from the Kenol-Murang’a road, has for years been grappling with a slow economy. But with the new road, residents hope that the economy will be resuscitated. Murigi said many politicians used the road to campaign and forgot to lobby for its construction after they were voted in. “We thank the government for remembering us because we have suffered for a long time,” Murigi said. John Maina Mwangi, a boda boda rider, said the state of the road made their work nightmarish and that they often suffered injuries after falling as they evaded potholes. He expressed confidence that his earnings will improve. Ichagaki MCA Charles Mwangi said the road will restore the lost glory of Maragua town. “The banking institutions that had closed down will now return and the economy will become vibrant,” he said.
