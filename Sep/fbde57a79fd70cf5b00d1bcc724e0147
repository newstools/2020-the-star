The World Bank has given Kirinyaga county an additional Sh71.2 million for the second phase in the upgrade of Kerugoya/Kutus Municipality. This comes after the county government successfully implemented the first phase of the upgrade programme. The first phase also received Sh71.2 million. The improvements are being implemented under the Kenya Urban Support Programme (KUSP), which is a collaboration between the county government and the World Bank. The projects that have been undertaken in Kerugoya/Kutus Municipality under the programme include construction of car parks, improvement of town streets and non-motorable ways as well as improvement of the drainage system. The first phase of the KUSP programme involved construction of Kutus parking spaces, construction of Kerugoya Fresh Produce Market, building a daycare centre and a storage unit at Kaitheri Apparel Factory in Kerugoya. The fresh produce market is accommodating 1,200 traders. Governor Anne Waiguru said phase one of the programme is already complete. The second phase involves construction of car parks adjacent to Kerugoya County and Referral Hospital, upgrading of selected streets and non-motorable ways to bitumen standards as well as improving the drainage system in Kerugoya town. It also involves landscaping of both sides of the highway from Baricho junction to Cooperative Bank and beautification of Kerugoya County Referral Hospital. Market sheds are also being constructed to accommodate traders who have been selling along the streets. Governor Waiguru said the second phase is expected to be completed in six months. Waiguru noted that besides benefiting residents and creating about 1,000 jobs, the upgrade will also improve revenue collection. Kutus/Kerugoya Municipality was among the seven out of 59 municipalities across the country which met the World Bankâ€™s minimum KUSP grant conditions hence qualifying for subsequent funding.
