Politics of betrayal, horse trading and mere lust for the state largesse has been our staple for as long as we can imagine. But the open pretension that a party can be in government as well as opposition is a new low that politics of the stomach is serving us. ODM cut its teeth as a party that spoke the language of the oppressed. For that, it won quite a number of citizens' support. Some died supporting it but now many feel let down. It's thus not coincidental that the masses are trooping to embrace the people they feel largely represent their aspirations as well as champion their causes. It will not matter how those enjoying state power feel about those who have decided to stand with the people in their hour of need. That is the new reality that those crafting succession schemes will have to grapple with. It is also on this score that ODM is fast losing its public face resulting in its current flip flop on matters of national importance. The party, for the record, has been far from forthright in its public pronouncements and deeds. First,Â  at the initiation of the handshake, which birthed the current cooperation between the party and the Jubilee Party, for umpteenth times told the country their interest was only to unite the country, not succession politics. But after spending taxpayers' money on a task force whose benefit only the two knew and wanted, more money was to be spent on a repeat exercise they conveniently called validation. Nobody opposed the first document. They today take stands that are diametrically opposed to the will of their supporters- all in the name of saving their union. To cap it all, their double speak on corruption is baffling. Only those who are opposed to their stands are hauled in court. They will today sanitise a suspect only to come out guns blazing and nail their opponent the next moment. Economic and political analyst
