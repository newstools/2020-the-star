Igembe South MP John Paul Mwirigi has condemned land grabbing in his constituency which he says has denied the government space for development projects. Mwirigi said despite a huge chunk of money being allocated for construction of government institutions, there has been no land. Mwirigi cited the Kenya Medical Training College in Maua, Huduma centre, Maua high court, and a university, among institutions without proper and enough land. Mwirigi, who spoke on Saturday when issuing more than 1,600 Interim licences to riders at Maua Stadium, blamed individuals and government officials aiding the grabbing. “President Uhuru Kenyatta gave us registry for the high court but it took so long to take off for lack of land. I am happy it is now complete. We are demanding a land for Huduma Centre but it seems hard," he said. "I remember how difficult it was to start a KMTC at Nyambene. We must reclaim all public land so that our youths can get jobs. We won’t allow rich individuals to continue sitting in any government land." The legislator castigated leaders opposing development initiatives in his constituency saying they are enemies of the people. Mwirigi called on Meru leaders to unite and end their differences and tackle the bedevilling issues amicably. “We must have one voice as we gear towards 2022 so we get full benefits in representation. We want to know what we are to get as a community when the next government is formed. Igembe alone is looked down on in government appointments," he said. Edited by R.Wamochie
