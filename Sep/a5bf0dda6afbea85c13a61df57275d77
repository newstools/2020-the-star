Kenya Harlequin have appointed Belgian Antoine Plasman as head coach. Plasman has signed a two-year contract and replaces Dominique Habimana, whose contract was not renewed after guiding the Ngong Road outfit to eighth place finish, missing out on the playoffs. Sources close to Quins, however, noted that the club had sought the services of South African Samuel Mofokeng as coach but the tactician declined due to family pressure and the Covid-19 pandemic. He opted to stay with the Sharks’ franchise in Durban, South Africa. Others who had shown interest in the job included former Kenya Simbas, KCB and Blak Blad coach Michael ‘Tank’ Otieno, former Strathmore Leos and Mean machine coach John Mbai and former Kenya Sevens and Homeboyz tactician Paul Murunga. Plasman will be tasked with ensuring the former Kenya Cup champions are back in the playoff contention once the new season starts as well as reviving the Quins Academy which was vibrant a decade ago. He has extensive experience in developing young players as the head coach of the Under-18 and Under-20 Belgium national teams. Between 2017 and 2020, the Belgian rugby level 2 coach was head coach of Boitsfort Rugby Club in Brussels. Kenya Harlequins chairman, Michael Wanjala, was delighted with the appointment. “This is an exciting moment for the club and we know he will transform our structure and operations going forward as we hope to strive to do better this coming season,” added Wanjala. He said they will announce the rest of the technical bench to compliment the arrival of Plasman. “We will announce those positions very soon and I am confident we will get the right people for the job,” added Wanjala. Wanjala expressed confidence that the season ahead will be fruitful for Quins. “We have a good squad of young and players. Last year we did not have a good pre-season but this time around, we will start our preparations early once we get the green-light to resume play from the Ministry of Sports,” added Wanjala.
