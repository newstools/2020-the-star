MPs have urged incoming East Africa Church of God leaders to unite. ANC nominated MP Godfrey Ososti said at Ibubi the church leaders should be prayerful and carry on the legacy of their departed leader Archbishop Byrum Makokha. Bumula MP Mwambu Mabonga added, “The only good thing we can do is to unite the church across East Africa.” This is after it emerged that some opposing camps have started mushrooming within the church. A source told the Star that the incoming archbishop will need to reconstitute the general assembly council and the committee to accommodate other regions like Rift Valley, Coast, Nairobi, Central and Tanzania, Uganda and Congo.
