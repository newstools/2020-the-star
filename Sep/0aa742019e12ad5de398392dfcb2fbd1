A picture of Machakos governor Alfred Mutua eating chapati while wearing a mask has attracted social media criticism. In a picture shared on Twitter, Mutua was seen sharing a chapati with a man at a restaurant that seemed to be JAVA. The two wearing their masks divided a chapati. In front of them was a soda and a plate of chicken. But people seated around then were not wearing masks. From all indications, they had started eating when the picture was taken. "I have been addressing the youth in their street lingo “Sheng” and have videos in Sheng about shunning tribalism and also recently, calling on them not be spectators in the political arena," Mutua twitted. Here are some of the reactions from Kenyans. On Wednesday, Mutua hit out at ANC party leader Musalia Mudavadi for plagiarism. Mutua accused Mudavadi of copying his campaign ideas targeting youth ahead of the 2022 general election. Mutua said in the last one year, with his supporters he has noticed that every time he goes to the public with an idea, a concept and even part of his manifesto, a few days or weeks later, Mudavadi comes out and says the same things or attempts to replicate what he has done. "This has been going on for long enough. It has reached such high levels that when I strategise with my team, we joke that we have to be 'hush-hush' or Mudavadi and other leaders will copy us," Mutua said
