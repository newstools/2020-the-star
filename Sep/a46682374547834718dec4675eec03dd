Former Vice President Kalonzo Musyoka's Wiper Party has announced an aggressive rebranding plan that will culminate into a name change. Kalonzo on Monday said his party will also change its colours to make it more acceptable among Kenyans. "We have taken the initiative to rebrand Wiper including the name and even the colour," Kalonzo said. "Many people have complained about why we are calling ourselves a body part of a vehicle." He was speaking when he launched the Wiper digital registration portal at the party's headquarters. The portal according to Kalonzo should net over one million registered Wiper members within three months. The Wiper leader also hit at ODM leader Raila Odinga and Deputy President William Ruto accusing them of endangering the lives of Kenyans through early 2022 campaigns. "Some of our competitors have hit the road. If there is any spike of covid-19 in Athi-River, Kitengela, Taita Taveta the we know who to blame," he said.
