The country’s year-on-year inflation hit an all-time low in September dropping to 4.20 per cent compared to 4.36 per cent in August 2020. This is the lowest figure recorded since September last year when it hit 3.83 per cent. The Consumer Price Index (CPI), which measures the percentage change in the price of a basket of goods and services consumed by households, stood at 108.57 in September which is almost the same level as August. The month on month food and non-alcoholic drinks’ index rose by 0.15 per cent, while the year on year food inflation increased by 5.18 per cent. This was mainly attributed to increase in prices of peas, oranges, irish potatoes and cabbages by 13.69, 3.82, 2.74 and 1.72 per cent, respectively. A kilo of peas increased in price from Sh128.45 in August to Sh146.04 in September.

The housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuel’s index dropped by 0.005 per cent in September. This was mainly attributed to a drop in cost of cooking gas and kerosene, by 1.29 per cent and 0.60 per cent, respectively. On the other hand, the price of electricity for 200 KWh, increased by 0.66 per cent. The transport index decreased by 0.01 per cent over the same period, mainly due to a drop in the pump prices of diesel, which outweighed the 1.40 per cent increase in petrol prices.
