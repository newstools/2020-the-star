Many Kenyans seem to have gotten the review of burial and wedding attendees all wrong. Health CAS Rashid Aman said on Tuesday that many Kenyans had called the ministry to seek clarification about President Uhuru Kenyatta's national address where he announced an increase in the allowed numbers during gatherings to 100. Aman clarified that the president only referred to wedding ceremonies and funeral services. In his address to the nation last week, Uhuru reviewed the number of people allowed to attend weddings from 15 to 100. He added that all attendees must abide by the Covid-19 protocols as directed by the Ministry of Health. "Therefore, where people more than 100 or so gather and they fall outside of these two groups, it's still prohibited," Aman said during Covid-19 briefing. Director of Public Health Francis Kuria said, "The president was very clear. He did not lift restrictions to any social gatherings. So the answer to those who are calling the ministry repeatedly is no." He said at least 500 inquiry calls were received on Tuesday morning alone. The government suspended all social gatherings in Match including political rallies concerts and live shows, meetings and conferences, sporting activities and all other organized or spontaneous outdoor events. Church services were also suspended but later allowed to resume under strict guidelines. The president has allowed a maximum of 100 participants per service which he advised should last not more than 90 minutes.
