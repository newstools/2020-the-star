Kenyan socialite Vera Sidika seems to have officially left the singles' club. Sidika on Wednesday announced that she said 'yes' to a proposal by her musician boyfriend Fredrick Mtinda popularly known as Brown Mauzo. Via her Instagram page, the curvaceous businesswoman said her engagement "is the best pre-birthday gift ever." "Sweethearts, your girl got engaged on September 24," Sidika announced. She said being engaged is like a dream she had not seen coming. "If someone told me I'd be engaged in 2020 I wouldn't have believed it, and just like that, like a dream, I'm engaged," she said. Brown Mauzo on the other hand stated that he is lucky to have such a beautiful woman in his life, expressing his unending love for Vera. "You walk into my life, unexpectedly and I found myself falling deeper and deeper in love with the person you are, happy birthday, fianceÃÅ," Mauzo said. He added, "Sometimes, when I think about you I cannot stop thinking about our future too. "I was right about you all the time. Sweet, loving, caring, and responsible lady. All I ever dreamed of. So on your birthday, I want you to have the things that will make you happy. I will support you all the way. Have a wonderful birthday, honey. I love you ‚ù§Ô∏èüòò @queenveebosset," Brown Mauzo posted. A few weeks ago, Vera denied claims she is dating Nigerian rapper Burna Boy. Rumours of the two dating started early this year after Vera Sidika visited Los Angeles, California. She shared photos of the expensive city, staying not in a hotel but one of the mansions in Hollywood Hills' leafy suburbs. She then shared photos and videos on her Instagram as she tested her ability with a firearm. Hours later, Burna Boy shared images at the same location, testing his abilities, too. This led to many speculating the two might have been together.
