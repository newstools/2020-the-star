Tanzanian singers Lulu Diva, Belle 9 and Bonge La Nyau were involved in a road accident on Monday morning on their way to Dar es Salaam. The three were from a show in Iringa. "We met the accident along Chalize. We were being driven, we didn't drive ourselves," Lulu Diva told a Tanzanian entertainment website "I don't know what the cause was because when the accident happened, I was asleep. I suddenly saw the car had lost direction." Belle 9 said, "I remember being taken out of the car, that's the only part that I remember. We started our journey last night [Sunday]. My friend, who is the owner of the car, was the one driving us. The driver is well. "I thank God I am recovering because I was the one who was in a bad condition"
