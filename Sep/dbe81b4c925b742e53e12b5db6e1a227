Rising star Doreen Mumbua has released the visuals to her third single Skiza, a song about two lovers in a long-distance relationship. She wrote the song three years ago. "The song is about a lover who is expressing her feelings to her significant other who is miles away and assuring them that they can make the relationship work despite the distance," Mumbua said. She said music has always been part of her life but it was only after college that she fully ventured into it. She started by doing background vocals for artists as well as voice-overs. Early this year she released Karibia, a song about a woman who is not afraid of calling out her lover. Skiza is her third official release. The song is now officially out on YouTube and other digital music platforms.
