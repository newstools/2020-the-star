Amani National Congress (ANC) leader Musalia Mudavadi on Sunday stormed Kakamega town and declared that he is done with supporting other presidential candidates. Mudavadi who traversed the streets in Kakamega town addressed crowds that gathered and demanded to be addressed. He said during stopovers in Kakamega town that he was ready to face off with ODM leader Raila Odinga, DP William Ruto and others for the top job in 2022. "I have supported retired presidents Mwai Kibaki and the late Daniel Moi, I have supported Raila Odinga and current President Uhuru Kenyatta and I'm done supporting others, " Mudavadi said. "I am telling those eying the presidency in 2022 to prepare because I'm preparing and we'll meet on the ballot because I am in the race " he added. Mudavadi seemed to dispel speculations that he will team up with Ruto in 2022. ANC leader was accompanied by senator Cleophas Malala, MPs Ayub Savula (Lugari) and Titus Khamala (Lurambi), and a host of MCAs. The leaders attended a church service at Maraba ACK church in Kakamega Municipality. Savula told Ruto and Raila to keep off from western region as it was under key and lock for Mudavadi. Malala said that some unnamed personalities were threatening him after rejoining Mudavadi after months of rebellion. Mudavadi added that all those willing to work with him should be ready to support him. He also criticised the glamour for constitutional review terming the drive suspect and not people-centered. "As your selves why no one talks about amending the constitution immediately after the elections. Construction is not for politicians but all Kenyans," he said. Mudavadi asked his supporters to allow him to visit other regions to network with other leaders ahead of 2022 race.
