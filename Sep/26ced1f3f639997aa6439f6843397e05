A man has surrendered to police in Kagan in Rangwe after stabbing a retired teacher whom he accused of having an affair with his wife. The suspect presented himself at Ndiru police station on Sunday evening after allegedly stabbing Richard Nyigilo, 61, three times on the neck and stomach. The incident happened in Ndiru market in Kagan West in front of the public. Local leaders led by Rangwe MP Lillian Gogo called on police to control incidences of insecurity. Witnesses said the suspect confronted the tutor who was traveling on a motorcycle. He had reportedly been trailing Nyigilo for a while. The duo had earlier disagreed over a woman who was first married to the suspect but later moved in with the retired teacher. Nyigilo was pronounced dead upon arrival at Ndiru Health Centre. Whe the suspect presented himself to police, he was carrying a knife and was in bloodstained clothes, and said he committed the murder. Speaking to journalists on Monday, Rangwe police commander Jane Sang said the suspect has been transferred to Rangwe station. “The suspect has been detained as investigations go on. He will be arraigned when investigations are complete,” Sang said. The incident comes barely a month after the son of the deceased, Felix Nyigilo, was stabbed and killed by unknown assailants within the same area. Gogo raised concerns over incidences of crime within Ndiru. “We appeal for the police to investigate and ensure culprits are apprehended,” she said. She claimed there is a group of armed men who intimidate residents. “I am concerned about the safety of my constituents. We will not sit back and watch people suffer in hands of a few criminals,” the legislator said. Edited by R.Wamochie
