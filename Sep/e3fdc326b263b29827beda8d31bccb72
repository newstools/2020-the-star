ANC  leader Musalia Mudavadi is the best candidate to rally behind for the top seat in 2022, a veteran Ford Kenya politician has said. Gabriel Andeche said Mudavadi's vast experience in economic matters and administration puts him at a better position to steer Kenya's economy. "Currently, Kenya's economy is hurting and we need leaders who can stabilise it the way former President Mwai Kibaki did," Andeche said. The politician was among the  founders of Ford Kenya. He said the Jubilee administration has done more harm to the economy than former President Daniel Moi’s regime. He was addressing the press at his home in West Bunyore, Emuhaya subcounty on Tuesday. He said the lack of unity in the community has thrown it in limbo over the presidency. "If we can't vote for our own son, we will never see the leadership of this country," he said. The 2022 election is the only chance for Mudavadi to clinch the presidency, "hence if we fail to clinch that position, we should forget about it and subject ourselves to slavery", he added. He said the political alignment in the region is for the big fish who have selfish interests. Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli should have a firm stand on Luhya community presidential plans, Andeche said. "Eugene Wamalwa [Devolution CS] and [Kakamega Governor Wycliffe] Oparanya should stop confusing the Luhya people and rally behind Mudavadi," he said. Andeche lauded Ford Kenya boss Moses Wetang'ula for supporting Mudavadi, saying that should be the way forward for the community. He said Luhya people should borrow a leaf from Nyanza and Central by uniting as a bloc to strengthen their political power. Edited by R.Wamochie
