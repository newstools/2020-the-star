West Kenya Sugar Factory has bought 18 tractors to improve cane delivery within Kakamega and Bungoma counties. While unveiling the heavy machinery at the Misikhu weigh bridge in Bungoma county, West Kenya chairman Jaswant Rai said the investment was to optimise cane productivity for growth of the factory. Sugar cane harvesting from plantations and transportation to West Kenya factory has sometimes faced difficulties during bulk production coupled with the bad state of the roads in the region. The New Holland tractors will be based at Naitiri unit in Bungoma county. Company head of human resource and administration Duncan Abwao said acquisition of the tractors was motivated by the needs of farmers. West Kenya pays Sh3,700 per ton of cane to farmers contracted by the private sugar firm. “These tractors are going to enhance our production because in the sugar industry the earlier you move the product from the farm to the plant the better,” Abwao said. The new tractors bring the total of the company's fleet to 127. The company intends to move sugar cane from cutting to crushing within 24 to 30 hours to maximise quality. Edited by Henry Makori
