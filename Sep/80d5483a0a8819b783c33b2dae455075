Ushuru FC’s head coach James Omondi is determined to take the Taxmen back to where he strongly feels they belong—the Kenyan Premier League. Ushuru were relegated to the National Super League in November 2016 after Sofapaka demolished Thika United 5-1 to survive on the final day of the KPL season, where Tusker FC were officially crowned champions. Sofapaka desperately needed a win over Thika while hoping that Ushuru would lose away to Posta Rangers and that’s exactly what happened as the taxmen lost 3-1 to see their three-year stint in top flight come to an end. Omondi says it’s now time for them to reclaim their stake on the big stage and has been setting up the team for a major revival. “Definitely Ushuru is a big team to play in the NSL. We are preparing for a top slot, and why not, I have the capacity to do it,” says Otieno. He said he has already recruited 10 new players to bolster his squad ahead of the new season. Hem however, declined give details on his new recruits, promising to unveil them in the next few days. He further said he had observed some gaping weaknesses last season that curtailed their quest for promotion to the top tier but he’ll be seeking to rectify all that this time round. “With NSL, one must be organised defensively and of course be more creative.” Still, he is convinced they stood a good chance for promotion if the league hadn’t been cancelled. “We picked up a bit late last season. I’m sure if the league was to be completed, we would have gotten a slot to the top tier. Omondi says he can’t be so sure about the future of the team in the league but hopes he’ll get the much needed support from the right quarters. “NSL is unpredictable. What counts to me is genuine early preparation and quality support from the management.” Omondi has been overseeing the activities of the Taxmen since July, 2019 when Ken Kenyatta was axed following a string of disappointing results.
