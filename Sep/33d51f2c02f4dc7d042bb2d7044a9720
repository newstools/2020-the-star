An assault case against Wajir East MP Rashid Kassim Amin has been adjourned to November 3 after one of the key witnesses failed to turn up in court. The state counsel told court that Homa Bay Woman Representative Gladys Wanga who is a witness in the case is bereaved and could not attend court to give her evidence. “One of our witnesses in the case has not appeared in court today because she is bereaved. We pray for another date”, the prosecution told court. Magistrate Martha Nanzushi adjourned the case and directed the matter to be heard on November 3. In the case, Kassim is accused of assaulting Wajir Woman Representative Fatima Gedi Ali at Parliament Buildings in Nairobi. The court heard that at around mid-morning at Parliament parking lot, Amin willfully and unlawfully assaulted Gedi and injured her. Kassim reportedly accosted the female lawmaker and engaged her in a heated discussion before the alleged attack. The incident allegedly happened in the presence of other legislators and security officers who were manning Parliament ahead of Treasury CS Henry Rotich’s unveiling of the Sh3.02 trillion 2019-20 budget. Kassim demanded to know why Gedi, who is a member of the Budget and Appropriations Committee, failed to allocate money to his constituency during a recent visit by the budget team. Gedi has already testified in the matter. Kassim denied the charges and he is out on a cash bail of Sh50,000. Edited by Henry Makori
