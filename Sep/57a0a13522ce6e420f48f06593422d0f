Mijikenda Kaya elders want the national government to investigate drug trafficking in Kwale county. Residents, especially border occupants, have been complaining about drug smuggling activities at the borders in Vanga which they say are out of control. Led by chairman Abdallah Mnyenze, they said drugs and substance abuse have strongly contributed to the deteriorating living standards of many youths. “Young people have no future because drugs are destroying their lives day and night,” he said. Kwale has more than 3,500 drug addicts, according to the Teens Watch Rehabilitation Centre. The elders said the number of drug addicts is worrying and is a threat to the future. They said energetic youth expected to be the future live in the streets. The chairman added that the situation has promoted moral decadence and increased criminal activities. The Kaya elders said drug dealers conduct the business freely under security watch. Mnyenze termed it unfortunate that most drug users are arrested while the barons are left to thrive. They said the government should intensify the war and salvage the coastal strip. Police should hunt down the tycoons running drug businesses to effectively eradicate the vice, they said. “We want action to be taken against those who import drugs and sell to our children but it is sad that the real perpetrators are protected,” Mnyenze said. Peddlers are suspected to use the Kenya-Tanzania border in Lunga Lunga to sneak in drugs. A resident who sought anonymity for fear for his life said three fibre boats operate along the seashores of Jimbo and Jasini believed to be shipping drugs between Kenya and Tanzania. Makueni nominated Senator Sylvia Mweni said the House ad hoc committee received complaints from various agencies and will push the government to permanently address the drug issue at the Coast.
