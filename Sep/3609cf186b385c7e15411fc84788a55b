Nakuru Town East MP David Gikaria was on Monday afternoon arrested in connection with chaos earlier in the day which saw matatu operators clash with police officers as they forcibly tried to return to the CBD. The operators decried the deplorable conditions in the three termini where they were redistributed. Gikaria was taken to Nakuru Central Police Station. Rift Valley Regional Commissioner George Natembeya confirmed the arrest was linked to the chaos. Matatu operators were met by an armed contingent of police officers who lobbed tear gas canisters and shot in the air to disperse them. Unfazed, the matatu operators pelted the officers with stones bringing business at the town to a standstill. The protestors lit bonfires and barricaded roads to protest the continued lockout of the CBD. This is the third time the operators are holding demonstrations to protest the move to lock them out of the CBD. They issued a notice to strike on Monday which prompted Governor Lee Kinyanjui to respond. In a statement that was posted on his Facebook page, Governor Lee Kinyanjui urged the public transport vehicle operators to be patient as his administration was in the process of building a new modern stage with amenities. "The County Government of Nakuru has good intentions whose full implementation will lead to an expanded modern and vibrant town," read the statement. He said the county government was procuring a contractor to start the building of a modern transport centre that will include all amenities. "We are aware of plans by a section of public transport operators to demonstrate in Nakuru town over the relocation of stages outside the CBD," he said. Kinyanjui said the decision to be hurried and uncalled for. He maintained that his administration considered the transport sector to be a critical enabler in unlocking the development of the economy. The operators were relocated outside town the onset of Covid-19 in Kenya ostensibly to avoid congestion.
