The family of a Tharaka Nithi man who was hit by a motorist has disputed claims by the Meru Teaching and Referral Hospital that he died of Covid-19 complications Peter Gitonga, 27, was hit by a car from behind at Maua town in Chuka a fortnight ago. The driver escaped but police impounded the car. His uncle Dennis Muchangi said they brought him to hospital after the accident and that he had internal bleeding. Muchangi said they took him to the county hospital and wanted to book him in ICU but it was not available He said they wanted to transfer him to Nanyuki where ICU was available but he died. “We were shocked to be told that samples were taken and he died from Covid-19-related complications,” Muchangi said. He said they have been barred from taking the body from the Meru hospital and were told a postmortem will not be conducted on the body. They say there is no attempt by the hospital to bury the body according to Health ministry guidelines and that none of his contacts were traced. “We were told the Covid-19 bags are not available in the hospital and we were told to buy from outside. We wondered where we will buy,” Muchangi said. Gitonga's aunt Mary Kambura said police insisted a postmortem must be done but the hospital insists otherwise. Edited by R.Wamochie
