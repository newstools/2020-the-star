Gospel singer Ilagosa says his mission is to minister the word of God through his music. Speaking to Word Is, Ilagosa said people have been calling him, saying his music inspires them. "I am prophet Ilagosa and I aim to preach the word of God through my music," he said. The 'Sala Zangu' hitmaker had it rough when he started singing. "Gospel music was not paying and I felt like I could quit music. But because of the purpose I have with my music, I did not." His advice to gospel artistes is that they should take music as a ministry and not for fame or money. "As a gospel artiste, you need to focus on the calling, which is Jesus Christ," he said.
