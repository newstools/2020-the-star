Social activist Adelle Onyango has been selected as one of the media personalities to represent Kenya at a 24-hour livestream event on International Podcast Day. Adelle will give her presentation at 7 am via https://internationalpodcastday.com/live/ Speaking to Word Is, Adelle said her presentation will focus on her experience in podcasting. "I will also be looking at how podcasting has given Kenyans agency over their stories," she said. "I have also prepared a video that showcases some local podcasters as well as developments that will position them on the continental stage." Talking about what this opportunity means for her journey as a podcaster, Adelle said it is so validating that she is a year and a half into podcasting. "My podcast has grown to the point of being recognised globally," she said. "It makes all the hard work so valid. Since I launched my podcast, I have put out an episode every week that has added more voices to the African narrative. "The podcast has a large audience in Kenya and I also do get a lot of feedback from USA, UK, Ghana, Rwanda, Uganda and Tanzania. This is growth that I truly appreciate and I am very proud of."
