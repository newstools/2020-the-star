Nurses have called off their planned strike that was to begin on Thursday. Kenya National Union of Nurses secretary general Seth Panyako on Wednesday said this is to allow more time for negotiations. The suspension is for a further 21 days and will lapse on October 1. Last month, the union had threatened to call a strike, saying health workers had not been paid their July salary. Panyako wrote to the County Public Service Boards, saying the union has advised all its branch officials to lead members in taking part in the salary parade. The letter, dated August 4, was copied to Labour CS and all KNUN branch secretaries. “By copy of this notice, the union branch official is authorised to seek and take collective action with other affected trade unions.” Nurses accused the government of turning a blind eye to their grievances. Nurses were demanding a risk allowance of Sh20,000, saying they are three times more susceptible to nosocomial infections than any other health worker.
