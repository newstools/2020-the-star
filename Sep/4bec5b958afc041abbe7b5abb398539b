 The construction of an asphalt plant along Kangundo Road is scheduled for completion in December to provide material for upgrading and recarpeting of city roads. The plant is expected to produce 2,400 tonnes of asphalt per day, enough to recarpet 3kms. “The production of asphalt will ensure the repair and tarmacking of roads even in the outskirts of the city," Nairobi Metropolitan Services director of transport, roads and public works Michael Ochieng said during a tour of the plant on Saturday. Asphalt is a mixture of dark bituminous pitch with sand or gravel used for surfacing and flooring roads. Currently, the city relies on asphalt from a plant along Nanyuki Road. This plant produces only between 150 and 300 tonnes of asphalt per day. Ochieng said the Kangundo Road plant will ensure sufficient supply of asphalt for recarpeting roads in the ongoing rehabilitation of the city streets. “Apart from making the county self-sufficient in its construction works, the plant will also offer numerous job opportunities,” he said. The National Government, through the NMS has rolled out an elaborate plan to improve city roads. Last month, it announced plans to upgrade 408km of roads in the informal settlements of Kibra, Mukuru kwa Njenga, Mathare, Dagoretti, Dandora, Githurai, Korogocho/Ngomongo, Kasarani, and Roysambu. The works will be undertaken by the Kenya Urban Roads Authority. Since its establishment on March 18, the NMS has rehabilitated several roads in the Central Business District and in subcounties. Kirinyaga Road has been recarpeted with an asphalt concrete overlay.
