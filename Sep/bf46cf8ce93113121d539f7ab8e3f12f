Deputy President William Ruto has asked politicians to avoid intimidating their rivals as they try to gain support from citizens. The DP spoke when he met a group of leaders from Kisii County led by Deputy Governor Joash Maangi on Monday at his Karen home. South Mogirango MP Sylvanus Osoro and several MCAs from Kisii also attended the meeting. “Our engagement with Kenyans should be based on a development track record and a deliberate plan to create jobs, boost food production, and the revival of the economy. Political support cannot be achieved through threats, coercion, and intimidation but through persuasion,” Ruto said. Ruto’s remarks come amid the dragging Third Revenue Basis formula debate before the Senate which has led to threats from the county governments. The Council of Governor's chair Wycliffe Oparanya had given a two-week ultimatum to resolve the stalemate on the third basis for revenue-sharing, failing which, a petition could be filed to dissolve the House. ODM leader Raila Odinga over the weekend asked senators to look at the interests of their counties and pass the formula fronted by the Commission for Revenue Allocation. Kakamega Senator Cleophas Malala is among the senators who are opposing the debate, saying that it will be disadvantage marginalised counties. Malala had said that no kind of intimidation will make him change his stand regarding the formula. The Building Bridges Initiative debate is also expected to resume after a long break occasioned by the coronavirus.
