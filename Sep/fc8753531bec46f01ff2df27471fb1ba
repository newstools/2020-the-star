A former Senator has criticised the Senate for taking too long to agree on the third basis for revenue-sharing formula and putting the counties in a financial crunch. Lenny Kivuti, the first  Embu senator under the 2010 Constitution, said the legislators should not have taken three months to come to an agreement to avoid punishing counties since the work of the Senate is to ensure the welfare of the devolved units. The senators approved the formula last week but the counties will have to wait a little longer to get the funds. Kivuti, who spoke to the Star by phone, welcomed the formula as all the counties will gain compared with the rejected one in which the "marginalised" ones would have lost close to Sh20 billion. The Embu governor aspirant did not spare counties for failing to collect enough own-source revenue and depending almost entirely on the national government. But Kamau Nyutu, who lost his bid for Mbeere South parliamentary seat in 2017  dismissed the approved formula as first aid to a seriously ill patient. He argued that the formula is not the panacea for lack of development and poor services that most people face at the grassroots. Kamau said development should be devolved and felt at the village level. He said even though the President pledged to increase the sharable revenue to counties by over Sh50 billion in the next financial year, this will not help much as people are yearning for the one-man, one-vote, one-shilling formula.
