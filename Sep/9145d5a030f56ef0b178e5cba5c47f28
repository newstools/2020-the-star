The award-winning Coffee roasting company, Tomoca Coffee Kenya Ltd has opened its doors to the Kenyan market. The first Tomoca Coffee shop is situated at The Two Rivers Mall, Nairobi, becoming the first in Africa. “This is the first venture for Tomoca within Africa. We chose Kenya as our first gateway for Africa-based expansion due to many benefits Kenya provides to the private sector in terms of investment incentive and other critical aspects that are needed for startup businesses to flourish,” says Wondewossen Meshasha – CGOO- Chief Global Operations Officer. Famed for the authentic coffee experience, Tomoca prides itself on the art of marrying Ethiopian Coffee with the Italian technique. Some of their drinks include the Macchiato, Sprice and Cravate Coffee. Tomoca coffee prides itself on being a pioneer for change and disrupting the status quo based on the origin of coffee and the ripple effect it had from domestic use to commercialisation. Tomoca plans to create beverage blends with Kenyan, Rwandese, and Ethiopian coffee. If you are in the store early enough, you get to watch the master roaster freshly roast and package coffee beans and smell the coffee.
