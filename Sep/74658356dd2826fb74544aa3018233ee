Agriculture CS Peter Munya has hinted at running for Meru governor again in 2022. Munya was the first Meru county boss in 2013. He lost to Kiraitu Murungi in 2017 after one term. The CS has been making inroads in the county in preparation for 2022. His fierce critic in the last general election, EALA legislator Mpuru Aburi, has turned into his closest ally. On Saturday, Munya met tea farmers in Shaba Stadium in Nkubu, South Imenti constituency, before he met coffee farmers in Githongo and later in Kariene, Central Imenti. On Sunday, he met coffee farmers at the New KPCU factory in Meru town, North Imenti. Munya is from the Tigania subtribe while Kiraitu is from Imenti, who are the majority and overwhelmingly voted for Kiraitu, hence Munya's visits might be viewed as a strategy to woo Imenti. Tea and coffee are mainly grown in Imenti. Munya said when it is about to rain, the clouds gather, using the analogy to meaning how people are tired of Kiraitu leadership and will throw him out in 2022. However, Kiraitu's chief of staff Gideon Kimathi said the governor will not be duped into engaging in early election campaigns. He said Kiraitu is concentrating on delivering on his pledges. “Those who are mudslinging the governor are doing it for their own political interests and want to distract him,” Kimathi said.
