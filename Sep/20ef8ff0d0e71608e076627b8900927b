The Law Society of Kenya has moved to court seeking to stop the consolidatiom of funds and assets of three state agencies into a single network. In a petition filed in court on Tuesday, LSK is challenging the consolidation of Kenya Railways Corporation, Kenya Pipeline Corporation and Kenya Port Authority. LSK argues that the Executive order that integrated the operations of the three state firms was made without any statutory. "The framework agreement was signed without public participation contrary to the Constitution," it argued. The legal agency further argues that the President cannot restructure or assign functions of state corporations that are under the function and ambit of the Public Service Commission. According to court papers, the creation of the Kenya Transport and Logistics Network through the impugned Executive is an absolute illegality. President Uhuru Kenyatta in August issued an Executive Order establishing the Kenya Transport and Logistics Network -KTLN. The order was to give way for a framework for the management, coordination and integration of public port, railway and pipeline services. The three agencies were to be brought together under the coordination of the Industrial and Commercial Development Corporation (ICDC).
