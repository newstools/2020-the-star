 Defending champions Mumbai Indians will play last year’s finalists Chennai Super Kings in the opening match of the Indian Premier League. The delayed competition will be played across the UAE, with Dubai, Sharjah and Abu Dhabi hosting the matches. The 56-game tournament begins on September 19, with the final taking place on November 10. Mumbai won a record fourth IPL title with a one-run victory over Chennai in May 2019. The IPL, which usually takes place between March and May, has been delayed because of the coronavirus pandemic. Many of England’s World Cup-winning team will be playing in the competition, including captain Eoin Morgan, opener Jonny Bairstow, fast bowler Jofra Archer and wicketkeeper Jos Buttler.
