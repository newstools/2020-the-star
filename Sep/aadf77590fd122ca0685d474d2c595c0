Kenya’s paraplegic driver Nikhil Sachania is a beneficiary of FIA disability grant. This enabled him to fine-tune his hand-controlled Mitsubishi Evolution 10 ahead of next year’s WRC Safari Rally event. The reigning three-time Kenyan SPV champion has already fitted the certified safety fuel tank on his car as part of the grant. Sachania, who leads the Kenya National Rally Championship ‘SPV’ Class and Division 1 logs is now racing against time to acquire ‘Certificate of Adoption’ eligibility after visiting FIA delegates recommended further upgrades. His car was recently inspected by FIA delegates Natacha Di Sivuliu and Josef Halter. “There are some modifications that were required for the hand controls, which the two FIA officials recommended. The modifications were to ensure the hand controls are attached securely to the car and work smoothly. We have also changed the rear differential of the car as we were having issues with it throughout last season.” Nikhil revealed that his SPV will be upgraded in phases well in time for Safari Rally next year. “The car is still being worked on and should be ready in a few weeks. I hope to test the car soon to make sure the new parts are working as planned. We are currently focusing on preparing the car to have it ready for the WRC. When the FIA delegates came to assess the car, they pin pointed a few areas that needed to conform with their safety standards and homologation.” Sachania was hoping to make his WRC Safari debut in July 2020 but his dream was postponed due to the current Covid-19 pandemi .
