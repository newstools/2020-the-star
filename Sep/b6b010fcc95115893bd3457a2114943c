AFC  Leopards hope to undergo their pre-season  in Eldoret and Kakamega when the suspension on contact sports is lifted by government. According to the club's chairman, Dan Shikanda, the conditions in the western region are perfect for pre-season. "We are already planning on how to kick off the season as we seek to start the season on a high note," he noted. “At the moment, we are finalising negotiations with our main targets, who we hope to unveil soon. Thereafter, we will roll out other programs for the club as we seek to improve our performance," he noted. He added: “We have our entire playing unit intact apart from two players Christopher Orchum and Vincent Oburu, who left for other clubs. This is good for  continuity as the players understand each and we expect them to settle in faster." He appealed to AFC fans to continue registration to enable the club improve their numbers. Former Ingwe striker said he is pleased with the opening of Nyayo Stadium, which has always been their home ground. "We will now be able to cut on costs because we have previously been forced top play outside Nairobi," he added.  Shikanda also remained optimistic of the Ingwe challenging for titles with the addition of few acquisitions to ensure depth in the team.
