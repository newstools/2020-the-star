Singer Harmonize had an embarrassing moment while performing over the weekend at the Mkapa Stadium in Tanzania, where Yanga football club was releasing their players for the 2020-21 season. Harmonize made a grand entrance, arriving by ziplining. But it was not all well, as the singer fell and was helped by people. The singer,Â tired from the entrance, did not perform as expected as he was short of breath. This comes a week after Diamond performed at the same stadium, when he also made a grand entrance using a helicopter. Harmonize took to social media to write, "Please don't try this at home." Diamond's fan commented that his protege had fallen, "Kuna kijana wako kaanguka huku, nafikiri amesahau mazoezi ya WCB...!" Diamond then replied by asking people not to laugh at Harmonize. "Ajali Kazini, inatokea wakati mwingine, Msimcheke, Muombeeni, ndio uungwana."
