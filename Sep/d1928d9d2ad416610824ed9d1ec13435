 Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli has dismissed claims he is part of a scheme to cut ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi to size and elbow him out of Luhyia politics. Atwoli said Mudavadi remains the Luhya spokesperson after he took the role in 2016. "Since we installed Musalia Mudavadi at Bukhungu stadium as the Luhya spokesperson, we have not replaced him neither are there plans to do so. Mudavadi you are our son. We can't sire you, nurture you and kill you at the same time," Atwoli said. He said they are only politically strengthening the ANC boss to face the tough life of Kenyan politics. "What has been happening was just political planning and strategising for our community," he added. Atwoli spoke at KIMA mission of East Africa Church of God during the funeral service for archbishop Byrum Makokha. He said a meeting in August with other leaders at his Kajiado home was not meant to plan against Mudavadi. The Cotu secretary general urged Mudavadi to invite him to his new home in Karen for a blessing as he represents the Luhya elders. Speaking at the same event, Mudavadi asked Atwoli to endorse his presidential bid. "Atwoli, if we play with you in the same team, I'm 100 per cent sure we shall win this tournament. I won't let you walk alone and I will not allow you to let me walk alone in this journey," Mudavadi said. He urged leaders to shun divisive politics, advising that they should not take the country back where it was in 2007. More than 1,000 people were killed following a disputed election. "We should not be so forgetful that 1,400 people died because of divisive politics," he said. He urged leaders to stand in solidarity with each other to ensure the 2022 election is peaceful. Devolution Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa said it's not time to focus on political positions but see how the region can grow economically. "We need to position ourselves up there and to achieve that we must work together as a team with one common goal," Eugene said.
