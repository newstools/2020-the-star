At least 9,650 Turkana households hit by the desert locust infestation will receive a boost to their livelihoods in an economic recovery programme. The programme by the county government and the United Nations FAO will help with crops and livestock. Farmers and herders will be trained in disaster management through barazas and radio broadcasts. County executive for Agriculture and the Pastoral Economy Philip Aemun said the programme will ease double shocks of desert locusts and Covid-19. The danger of locust infestation is not yet over, he said. More than 1,800 farmers will receive certified crop seeds, help to establish kitchen gardens and receive training in nutrition. â€œThe limited ground surveillance and capacity had earlier enabled the county and development partners to control the locust invasion when it was first reported," Aemun said. He called for greater resource mobilisation to combat locusts and a coordinated approach to mitigate future disasters. FAO's head of the Lodwar field office Dan Irura said pastoralists will receive 5,000 bags of range cubes. Mass deworming of livestock will be carried out as well as control of fleas, lice and other external parasites. He said 5,000 one-month-old improved species of indigenous chickens will be distributed. (Edited by V. Graham)
