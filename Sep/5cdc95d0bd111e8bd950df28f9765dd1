The National Celebrations Committee has come up with an initiative to record the national anthem and the East African Community anthem virtually. The target is to have all Kenyan musicians around the globe participate in this patriotic exercise as a way of promoting our nationhood and regional integration. The virtual recording will be aired during the forthcoming Mashujaa Day celebrations on October 20, a day set aside to remember and celebrate our Kenyan heroes and heroines. One is required to upload the recorded clip to anthemsubmission@ppmc.go.ke or WhatsApp through 0773 282800. This should be accompanied by your full names, instrument, name of the orchestra/group you belong to if any, and your location, on or before September 15.
