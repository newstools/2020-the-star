Ruth Matete says she has lost many 'fake relationships' during her grieving period. On her Instagram page, she has been sharing moments of how she is overcoming the grief. She says sometimes the storm in your life has nothing to do with you but has everything to do with those around you. "We are living in days where to find real people isn’t easy. Too many fake relationships and associations," she wrote. While it is easy for many to say you are their best friend, covenant brother or sister, spiritual son or daughter, or spiritual dad or mum, the only thing that tests this claim is a storm, she said. "Don’t cry too much when in the storm. Don’t beat yourself so hard when the storm comes. Don’t run out of the storms of life. It’s not always about you, it’s about those around you," she wrote. "Greatness is something that comes with a great price; it takes too much to rise. Pain, betrayal, loneliness, isolation, rejection, such that to rise and go down again is an unbearable experience. "So let the storm sweep the fake things and relationships before you rise to greatness." She said when God is about to lift you and entrust you with greatness, He will start by cleaning your surroundings by exposing what you don’t need on your next level. "So rejoice because in your storm, there’s a seed of greatness and elevation," she wrote. Ruth has been ministering to her followers through worship sessions live on her social media handles.
