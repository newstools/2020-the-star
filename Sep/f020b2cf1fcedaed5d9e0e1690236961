From tomorrow all county services will be paralysed across the country after the senators failed to pass the revenue sharing formula. In a statement on Wednesday, CoG chairman Wycliffe Oparanya said county health facilities will not permit any new inpatient admissions. "They will only provide minimal outpatient services," he said. Oparanya said all non-essential services have been hereby suspended and county employees have been advised to proceed on leave for two weeks. "In the meantime, the council will continue to push for the speedy release of county funds," he said. Oparanya said county staff, including frontline health workers, have not been paid for three months. He said that 47 devolved units are suffering and the only way to end their pain is for the National Treasury to release funds for running operations. The Senate for the 10th time failed to reach a consensus on the best formula to share revenue among counties. This was even after President Uhuru Kenyatta personally intervened and promised to add Sh50 billion in the next financial year to cushion counties that were losing money. Uhuru induced a section of aggrieved senators who had vehemently opposed the controversial formula, causing a standoff and untold suffering in the counties. "We have agreed to take the offer. But we have tasked the 12-member committee that has been working on this, to come up with the best formula taking into account the Sh50 billion," Laikipia Senator John Kinyua said. Kinyua's assertions were shared by his Makueni counterpart Mutula Kilonzo. "The committee will sit and harmonise the new figures. No county should lose," Mutula told the Star moments after an informal meeting (Kamukunji) of the leadership and members ended. Senatorsâ€™ indecisiveness has hurt service delivery in the 47 devolved units, which plunged them into a cash crisis.
