Only seven counties have met the minimum 300-bed requirement to isolate Covid-19 patients. A report from the Ministry of Health on technical assistance to county governments for mitigation of Covid-19 pandemic shows that only nine counties had a total of 250 beds and above. Nairobi led the pack with 1,085 followed by Mombasa (404), Machakos (371), Makueni (312), Garissa (310), Mandera (307) and Kakamega (301). Following closely were Kilifi (271) and Kisii (250). The report, which was submitted to the Senate Ad Hoc Committee on Covid-19 Situation in Kenya, further noted that only 28 per cent of counties have a bed capacity over 200. The report documented findings collaboratively assessed by the Technical Assistance Teams from the Health ministry and the county representatives as at August 6. “Several counties have ongoing construction works to increase their health infrastructure to meet the minimum requirements within the short term (30 days) and medium to long term (90 days),” it said. Lamu had the least number of beds at 13 followed by Bungoma (22), Kajiado (24), Samburu (27) and Tana River (37). Nairobi had the highest number of ICU beds at 66, followed by Murang’a (36). Kisii and Tharaka Nithi had 15 ICU beds each. On June 7, President Uhuru Kenyatta directed all counties to set up at least a 300-bed isolation in readiness to deal with the surging number of Covid-19 cases in the country. The President spoke as he gave the 47 counties a Sh5 billion conditional grant to be used specifically to increase their healthcare capacity by building the necessary infrastructure to enable them to cope with the pandemic. He noted that most counties were ill-prepared to deal with the pandemic. At the time, that Siaya county had a 10-bed isolation facility, nine of which were then occupied. In Busia, all the 34 beds at the county’s isolation facility had been occupied. Siaya currently has 51 isolation beds and no ICU bed, nor does Busia with 194 isolation beds. The assessment teams visited and uploaded reports for 45 of the 47 counties. Data for Trans Nzoia and Elgeyo Marakwet will be included in the subsequent report. The teams said the total number of functional beds assessed is 7,723 beds, comprising 7,411 isolation beds and 312 ICU beds. The report noted that there were additional isolation beds in non-health facilities. “An additional bed capacity of 4,015 isolation beds were identified to supplement health facility isolation beds. Together with the health facility isolation and ICU beds, this would cumulatively avail 11, 738,” the report added. Out of 263 facilities visited, 64 per cent were level 4 and above, which comprise specialised facilities selected to handle Covid-19 isolation cases. All the facilities were assessed for adherence to ministry’s guidelines of which 45 per cent fell in the good to high’ category — reflecting high levels of functional infrastructure, service capacity and capabilities in line with required standards. “In contrast, 47 per cent fell in the low to fair category, revealing gaps and challenges in standards” the report added. For laboratory testing services, 65 per cent of the facilities assessed had general lab services. However, 54 per cent did not have adequate lab supplies for the pandemic. “The lack of fully equipped lab services, timely testing and reliable transportation, including long turnaround times for sample collection and results is seen as a weak link in management of the pandemic,” the report added.
