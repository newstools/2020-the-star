Police in Gilgil have rescued a nine-year-old boy who had been kidnapped and held hostage for over five hours by his uncle, who demanded a ransom from the family. During the Sunday evening incident in Diatomite village, the suspect in his mid-20s demanded Sh11,000 from the family, failing which he would kill the boy. The family sought help from the police, leading to the arrest of the man near St Mary's Hospital along the Nairobi-Nakuru highway. Gilgil police boss John Onditi confirmed the arrest and said the minor was in good health and had been reunited with his family. “Our officers managed to catch up with the suspect along the highway as he sought a matatu to flee from the area. He will be arraigned in court to face various charges,” he said. Miriam Njoki, a sister to the suspect, said the brother had on various occasions antagonised the family before the latest incident. She said the suspect attacked their father, forcing the older sister to intervene and the matter was reported to the local police. “This angered my brother who promised to revenge and he did this by kidnapping the boy, whom he held hostage for over five hours. But we are happy this is over,” she said.
