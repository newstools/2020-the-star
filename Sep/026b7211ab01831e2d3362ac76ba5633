Citizen TV anchor Lilian Muli doesn't understand why some parents set up social media accounts for their children. Lilian shared her thoughts on a social media post. "Also I wonder when we open Instagram accounts for our babies have we given them an option to grow up and decide whether they want a public life? Smh,” she wrote. Responding to the post, Akothee said she regrets opening an Instagram page for her son. "I am regretting why I opened accounts for my kids, now my son wants his password he is 12 years now, he doesn't know the people following him, some are mean some are real, trust me it's wrong," she wrote. Celebrity parents who have opened social media pages for their children include Diana Marua and Bahati, comedian Njugush, Terence Creative and Milly Chebby and Betty Kyallo. Speaking to Word Is, DJ Mo said parents should be allowed to raise their children the way they deem fit. The Instagram accounts of DJ Mo and his wife Size 8's two children have thousands of followers. "People should let others be. If my children will grow and feel like they don't want to be on social media, they will delete the account but for now, let me do what I want to do with my children," he said. But some celebrity parents keep their children away from the limelight. Recently, singer Kambua said in an interview that she is very protective of her son because society is insensitive. In her post, Lilian told people to stop declaring their love via social media, especially if the significant other is not on that platform. "Privacy is power! Why are you professing your Love to your person if they aren’t on IG (Instagram)? Just tell them in person."
