Football star Victor Wanyama to sue a socialite after she claimed they had sexual relations. In the Instagram video that has since gone viral, the lady Shakilla claims that she had sex with over 15 Kenyan celebrities and Wanyama was among them. But Wanyama swiftly dismissed the claims saying it is an attempt to scandalise his good name and reputation. In a statement on Tuesday, Wanyama called out social media guru Xtian Dela who was interviewing Shakilla, accusing him of publishing the disparaging content based on 'accusatory statements.' “I’m prepared to go to great lengths to protect my good name and character, consequently and with the blessing of my management team, I have instructed my legal team to pursue all legal remedies available to me and to which I have the unreserved right to seek,” he added. The footballer said the allegations are a total fabrication and a figment of the maker’s imagination at best. “I have worked long and hard to build my character and standing in society. Such malicious, scandalizing and false assertions about my name and character are unacceptable to me," he said.
