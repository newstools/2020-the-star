Ulinzi Stars will be boosted by the return to the team by three key players. Head coach Benjamin Nyangweso is already planning his squad for the 2020/21 campaign and will have a major boost with the return to the team of defenders Omar Mbongi and George Omondi as well as midfielder Kelvin Thairu. Mbongi is set to return to the team after eight months out on official duty, having been redeployed by his unit in January 2020, which saw him miss the second part of the 2019/20 season. The season was disrupted in March due to Covid-19 and the defender will not have missed a lot by the time he returns. Experienced in the Premier League and with national team caps under his belt, Mbongi will be a key addition to the squad particularly with his versatility. The soldiers had the best defence in the league and alongside Tusker, they had the least losses. To have Mbongi join the group will massively boost the team’s existing defensive capabilities and he will not be the only one returning. Omondi, who was not part of the team for the second half of the 2019/20 season, will be back for his third season as an Ulinzi Stars’ player. He is fresh from the Recruits Training School, where he spent eight months. Omondi will troop back along with Thairu, who was also at the RTS. Thairu joined the team at the start of last season from Mount Kenya United and at mid-season left for military training. He will add options to coach Nyangweso’s click of creative midfielders in the new season.
