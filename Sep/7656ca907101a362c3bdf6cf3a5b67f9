The Shikusa Borstal Institution has received Sh1 million computers from Safaricom to boost learners' digital skills. The donation is part of the Safaricom Foundation's Technical and Vocational Education Training (TVET) programme launched in March this year. Safaricom Foundation on Saturday handed over 30 internet enabled computers to the leadership of the institute in Kakamega. The donation is aimed at enhancing students' ICT literacy and research skills as they look to reintegrate into society. Shikusa Borstal Institution is a corrective training centre that caters for boys in conflict with the law between the ages of 15-17 years. The institution has a population of 300 learners. "The vocational skills these students have learned so far will add value to the communities they come from," Safaricom CEO Peter Ndegwa said. He said computer literacy and digital skills are critical to their future if they are to reintegrate successfully into society. "This is why Safaricom Foundation has equipped their ICT centre with 30 computers," he added. The foundation has made a similar donation to Shimo La Tewa Borstal Institute in Mombasa. Edited by A.N
