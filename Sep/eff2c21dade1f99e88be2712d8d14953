Governors have shut down operations in counties over lack of funds. Council of Governors chairman Wycliffe Oparanya said they took the decision because of the ongoing stalemate over the division of revenue bill. The immediate and most visible impact of a shutdown is in the government’s day-to-day operations. County employees have been working without pay and with the shutdown, no services will be rendered. A government shutdown pauses programmes and operations, only for them to eventually start again, and that has costs. Engaging in political duels at the expense of Kenyans is not an effective way of addressing our nation’s challenges. It delays tough decisions and has real costs for the economy and all Kenyans. Instead of governing by crisis, lawmakers should work together to resolve outstanding differences so innocent Kenyans do not suffer unnecessarily. As a long-term solution, the National Assembly should pass a law that allows counties to continue receiving at least half of their funds in case senators cannot agree on how to divide revenue.
