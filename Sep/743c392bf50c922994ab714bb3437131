The High Court has directed the Director of Public Prosecutions to supply the family of the late Yassin Moyo with all documentation it intends to rely on during the murder trial. The directive came after the victim's lawyer Demus Kiprono told the court that the DPP and Ipoa have not supplied them with any material that forms part of the case. The case had been listed for mention on Thursday to confirm compliance. The accused Duncan Ndiema represented by Lawyer Danstan Omari and Anita Madaki was present for the virtual mention. The Deputy Registrar Jane Kamau said the matter be fixed for another date before the trial Judge for purposes of fixing a hearing date for the trial. Ndiema was this year charged with murdering the 13-year-old boy in Shauri Moyo. He is out on a Sh1 million cash bail with a condition he does not interfere with the witnesses lined up to testify against him. Ndiema was in uniform when he committed the crime. He also had an Israeli pistol serial number 44338354 loaded with 10 rounds of ammunition. The 13-year-old was shot on the balcony of his family home in Huruma on March 27 -the first day of the 7pm curfew to contain the coronavirus.
