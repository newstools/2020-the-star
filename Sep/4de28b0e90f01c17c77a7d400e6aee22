Education CS George Magoha and his Health counterpart Mutahi Kagwe have asked the court to dismiss a case by a parent seeking to have schools reopened. The two on Tuesday said that the unplanned reopening of schools will undermine the containment measures already put in place. They were objecting to a case filed by Joseph Aura, a father to three children. Aura said in-person learning is the best for children rather than virtual or any other method. He sought to have all schools reopened from September this year for the next academic term. However, Magoha said the application lacks merit and should be dismissed. He argues that some of the issues raised by the parent have already been tried by another court when the LSK filed a case challenging the curfew hours, among other issues. Aura in his documents had acknowledged that he is aware of the existence of the Covid-19 education response committee. The committee is working in tandem with both CSs to come up with the 'Guidelines on Health and safety protocols for reopening of basic education institutions amid Covid-19'. The guidelines provide for social distancing protocols, hygiene and sanitation protocols among others. Both CSs say that the coming up of such guidelines is a clear indication that they are working conscientiously to ensure that schools reopen.
