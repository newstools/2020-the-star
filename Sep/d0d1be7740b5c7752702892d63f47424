A family’s long wait for justice came to a fruitful end after a man who defiled their eight-year-old daughter in Kibos, Kisumu county was sentenced to life in jail. Winnam senior principal magistrate Hezron Nyaberi sentenced Ken Sitati Simiyu who was accused of accosting the Standard 5 girl while she visited her friend. After defiling the girl, he threatened her not to tell her mother. The charge sheet says that on August 20, 2018 in Kibos village, Kisumu East subcounty, Simiyu defiled the girl who was aged eight. Her birth certificate showed she was born on March 9, 2010. Simiyu denied the charges on August 23, 2018 and was remanded in custody. Magistrate Nyaberi observed that the child’s testimony showed that she was penetrated by the accused in the house. A day later, she was spotted walking in difficulty. She later told her aunt what had happened. The girl told the court that Simiyu threatened to kill her should she report the incident. She had visited her friend between 12pm and 3pm when the accused defiled her. The mother confronted Simiyu who was the main suspect and reported the matter to police leading to his arrest the same day. A medical examination report by Brenda Juma at Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital showed the girl had been defiled. Justin Leah, Elizabeth Ashibala, the child and her mother testified in the case. "Having satisfactorily examined the minor, I am satisfied that the findings are true. She understands the nature of the proceedings and is telling the truth," magistrate Nyaberi ruled. "Submission by the defence that this is a case of circumstantial evidence and the court is urged to consider the alibi raised by the accused is not correct. This is a case in which a complainant knows her penetrator very well and it will be unintelligible to form a contrary opinion. Thus, the defence of alibi has no basis and is hereby dismissed. The upshot is that I find the accused culpable." Edited by Henry Makori
