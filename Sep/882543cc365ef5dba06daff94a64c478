Police in Homa Bay have been granted three more days to detain a man charged with killing a retired teacher in Kagan, Rangwe constituency. James Nyanjwa, 42, was arraigned before Homa Bay senior resident magistrate Joy Wesonga on Tuesday morning.  The court allowed Directorate of Criminal Investigations officers more time to conclude investigations before Nyanjwa can take a plea. During the period, he will also undergo a mental examination. A postmortem on the body of Richard Nyigilo, 61, will be conducted. The court heard that the police had not completed recording statements. The attack happened in Ndiru trading centre. Police had asked for one week to detain the accused but the magistrate ordered his re-arraignment on Friday. In an affidavit signed by investigating officer Perminus Murithi, the court was told that Nyanjwa stabbed the victim before surrendering to the police. Nyanjwa is said to have confronted the deceased, who was travelling on a motorcycle. He had been trailing him for a while. The two had earlier disagreed over a woman who was married to the accused but later moved in with the deceased. Nyigilo bled excessively after being stabbed and was pronounced dead upon his arrival at Ndiru health centre. The accused turned himself in with a knife in his hand. His clothes were also blood-stained. Speaking to journalists, Rangwe police commander Jane Sang said the accused was transferred to Rangwe station. She said Nyanjwa informed police officers that he had committed murder. “The suspect has been detained as investigations go on. He will be arraigned when the investigations are complete,” Sang said. The incident comes barely a month after Felix Nyigilo, son of the deceased, was also stabbed and killed by unknown assailants within the same area.
