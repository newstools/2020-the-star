Beryl Owawa believes her little boy was stolen within minutes from the compound of their rented house in Ndhiwa, Homa Bay county. She says the kidnapping was planned. That was almost four years ago. Sam Ivan Oruko was a year and nine months old. He wasn't able to speak or express himself. On December 27, 2016, Ivan was outside playing with his friends and his mother was inside preparing food. In a few minutes, when she called to him, Ivan was gone. The family has almost given up. It was common for Ivan to play with the rest of the children in the compound. But he'd never gone missing without a trace. The family did the usual. They reported to Ndhiwa police station and were given OB number 23/27/12/2016. They enlisted extended family, friends and neighbours in the search. Desperate, the family resorted to religious diviners and what Owawa calls "pseudo-witches". The occult and the supposed supernatural didn't help. “We have just left it in the hands of God,” a frustrated and resigned Owawa told the Star. When everything failed, she bore another child. So was the little boy kidnapped, did he just wander off, is he safe, maybe in a children's home? “I strongly believe this thing [Ivan's disappearance] was planned because it happened in less than 10 minutes. My child was stolen,” his mother said. Owawa has lost hope the police will trace their son. "Nothing good has come from the police. They gave us the OB number and then no efforts have been made since. It's frustrating." (Edited by V. Graham)
