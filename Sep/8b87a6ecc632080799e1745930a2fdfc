The Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) on Thursday recorded the highest turnover in the year posting a 583 per cent increase to Sh3.76 billion. This is up from Sh550 million recorded in the previous trading session. The positive performance was driven by growing foreign investors demand for listed equities in the Kenyan market. The number of shares traded increased to 123.6 million up from 17 million shares traded the previous day. The value of shares bought by foreign investor settled at Sh 3.4 billion, a 572 per cent increase from the value traded on Wednesday. “We traded a total volume of 3.752 billion, a recent record high,” chairman Kiprono Kittony announced. The impressive performance comes on the back of improving performance in the equities market evidenced by an 11.3 per cent growth in equities turnover - year to date to Sh116 billion from Sh 104 billion recorded over a similar period last year. Equally, the bond market has continued to depict resilience recording a turnover of Sh495 billion, despite being a 5.7 per cent drop compared to a similar period last year, with the Covid-19 pandemic being a major hurdle in the markets globally. The strong performance is despite the country’s three negative sovereign ratings by global rating agencies in 2020. NSE chief executive Geoffrey Odundo said: “Today’s performance is a testament of improving investor sentiments as listed securities in our market continue to show impressive recovery”.
