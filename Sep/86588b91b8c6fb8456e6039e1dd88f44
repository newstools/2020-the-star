ODM party leader Raila Odinga has asked senators to support the proposed CRA formula to resolve the current stalemate. Raila admitted that the new formula had some faults but he met with the CRA commissioners who resolved to make some corrections to it. "I had in-depth discussions with CRA officials and to reduce the endless disagreements we agreed to make some changes to the suggested one, " he said. The amendments are supposed to be ready within three months. Raila said the rectifications will avert similar problems in the commencement of the next financial year. Meanwhile, he proposed counties to use the previous cash sharing formula to disburse money to counties. Raila said the disputed share is about Sh316 billion, the same amount as the last financial year. "It's better we use the old system to share the funds because there is no additional money but we approve the new one while amendments are made in it before being put on use, " he said. He said according to what was discussed with CRA, the formula will be ready before the next financial year which would have solved a lot of problems. Currently, the proposed cash sharing formula has brewed debate causing division among leaders. Raila said some leaders are politicizing the formula to cause sluggish delivery of government services. He spoke on Friday, at Jacaranda hotel when he met Kwale ODM leaders in Ukunda.
