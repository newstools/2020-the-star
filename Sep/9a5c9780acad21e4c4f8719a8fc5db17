A labour court has suspended a Gazette notice which declared that Noah Wekesa's  tenure as chairperson of the Strategic Food Reserve Oversight board lapsed last year.O Justice Maureen Onyango also suspended the revocation of the appointment of  Abass Mohammed, Lucas Chepkitony, Susan Mukiri and Gerald Musira as members of the board. The orders were granted after activist Okiya Omtatah told the court that Treasury CS Ukur Yatani's true intentions to revoke the appointments were malicious and erroneous and that the claim that Wekesa's tenure lapsed in October last year was intended to unlawfully bring to a halt the operations of the oversight board and the fund. The notice he said was issued to advance corrupt purposes of the maize importation cartels. "Their removal exposes to plunder the Sh10.3 billion held in the accounts of the fund," he said. Omtatah accused Yatani of making a false declaration that Wekesa’s tenure lapsed last year yet he has until 2022. According to court documents, the members were appointed for the first term to the funds oversight board with effect from August 1, 2015. In May 2019 they were reappointed for their second and final term . The appointments are due to end on May 5, 2022. The revocation of the appointment of the members and declaration that the tenure of Wekesa had lapsed were made through notice 4134 of June 2020. The activist says Yatani does not have the powers to dismiss the members of the board without stating the grounds for removal. “The purported revocation without giving the members a chance to be heard  is contrary to the law," he said.
