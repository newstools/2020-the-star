A 28-year-old man suspected of killing his father together with his mother and sister on Saturday evening surrendered himself to the police. Sospeter Kinyanjui, who has been on the run since the incident on September 8 at their home in Barnabas area, Nakuru, surrendered after four days. Sospeter is suspected to have killed his father Charles Thairu, assisted by his mother, brother and sister, who are already in police custody. After interrogation, he accompanied detectives to his hideout where several exhibits suspected to have been used in the gruesome murder of their father were recovered. Directorate of Criminal Investigations through their social media pages said the arrest of the nuclear family members was effected after detectives found inconsistencies in the circumstances leading to the death of the 59-year-old man. The deceased was found bleeding inside his car, which was parked outside the gate to his home. However, DCI said there were blood stains in one of the bedrooms, which someone had attempted to clean. The slain man's wife, 48, his son, 23 and daughter 24, told investigators that they found their father unconscious and rushed him to Mediheal Hospital where he was pronounced dead on arrival. The three were immediately arrested for interrogations, but Sospeter, the prime suspect and eldest, could not be found. Upon his surrender and interrogations, detectives proceeded to Ndimu Ndege area within Bahati sub-county in Nakuru where the suspect disposed off the murder weapons and burned his bloodstained clothes. Several exhibits were recovered including two metal rods, a bloodstained iron file, remains of burnt clothes, several syringes and a cash savings tin. The suspect was booked in cells as further investigations continue. DCI said they are finalising the investigations before they bring up charges against the suspects.
