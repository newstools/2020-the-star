The national women's volleyball team Malkia Strikers could be headed for a bumper harvest ahead of the much awaited return to action as betting firm, Playabet is seeking to partner with them The firm,moments after launching its operations early this week, said they had been entangled in negotiations with top management of team with an aim of striking a deal which will see them benefit financially. The firm's head of communications, Bernice Kariuki, said they settled for Paul Bitok's charges due to their success which she noted deserved to be appreciated. She said most of the book-markers are inclined towards football and the big clubs but they were keen to fatten the Malkia purses going forward. “Negotiations between us and the team are at an advanced stage. Many companies are interested in partnering with football but we had a handful of reasons to go for the Kenyan queens. First,  the girls are awesome, and have been representing the country without  much fanfare and support unlike their male counterparts from other disciplines.The deal will not only boost the team but inspire younger girls who  look up to female sports stars as role model,"she said Besides partnering with the Malkia Strikers who have already qualified for the rescheduled 2020 Olympics,the firm reiterated its commitment to lift the standards of grass root sports. Kariuki noted that a large chunk of talent at that level lacked support—a key ingredient needed to enable them punch their way to stardom. "As a way of giving back to the society, we will aim to support and work with grassroots teams and offer young talent a chance to grow and become shining lights in Kenyan Sports.The program is set to kickoff after the government gives the way forward as far as resumption of sports is concerned and we are likely to begin in Rift Valley," she added With the much fancied English Premier League 2020-2021 season set to begin this weekend, Playabet will unveil some of the products punters will enjoy.  They include weekly jackpots, virtuals sports league, monthly jackpots as well as full pre-match and live betting sportsbook
