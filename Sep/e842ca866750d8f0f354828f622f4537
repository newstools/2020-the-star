The national government will revive fish farming in the counties, Livestock and Fisheries CAS Jebii Kilimo has said. Revival of the sub-sector under the Economic Stimulus Programme was started 15 years ago but collapsed. Kilimo said the state will provide required inputs to fish farmers. She spoke in Meru town on Monday where she gave out fish farming supplies to farmers. She said they will be given pond liners to start afresh. The farmers will be given e-vouchers so that they don’t lack inputs. “They will be getting 70 per cent from government and they cater for 30 per cent,” she said. The CAS said there is a shortage of fish in the country for nutritional security. “Kenyans have been complaining about fish imports from China but we do not have enough. If we have enough there will be no place for them to bring their fish here,” Kilimo said. Fisheries PS Micheni Ntiba said the Economic Stimulus Package was started with Sh1 billion and covered 226 districts which are now subcounties. He said close to Sh1 billion will go to each county under the programme that will create jobs for many Kenyans. He said Meru produced 163 tonnes of fish this year and targets 300 tonnes next year. “We want to lift farmers from subsistence to commercial farming by having quality fingerlings, food for fish and other materials,” he said.
