Meanwhile, doctors have issued a two weeks nationwide strike notice to the government over failure to address their grievances. The doctors, under the umbrella of the Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union, have been been in talks for the past two weeks but threatened to go on strike should there be no amicable agreement in a fortnight. "Six months into the pandemic the government is yet to fulfill its pledge on provision of comprehensive medical insurance and compensation for those who have lost their lives in the line of duty," KMPDU secretary general Chibanzi Mwachonda said on Monday. "On the contrary, the incentive of an enhanced Covid-19 allowance has been withdrawn with no commitment or indication of its payment despite the increased risk that all healthcare workers continue to face."
