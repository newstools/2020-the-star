Citizen TV's Lillian Muli says she is the one who pursues men, instead of them going after her. Speaking to Billy Miya and Mbaruk Mwalimu about the worst pickup line she has ever had, the mother of two said she could not answer because she is the one who does the chasing. "Honestly, I can’t answer that because mimi huwa sikatiwi, mimi ndio the other way round,” she said. During the interview, Lilian was asked to say what she regrets doing after taking alcohol, to which she said it's losing her temper. "What I have ever regretted kama nimekunywa drink ya wazee, maybe just losing my temper kiasi ambacho hakistahili."
