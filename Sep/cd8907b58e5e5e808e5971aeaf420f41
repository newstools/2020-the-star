We as ODM need to find our way back to basics, the Orange party Raila Odinga's son has said in a tweet that has caused wide criticism. "... we’re not just about private jets and slay queens whilst abusing rival politicians, we have a development agenda clearly outlined in our manifesto," Raila Jr said. He added: "Let’s focus on service delivery, democratic space, protecting private citizen rights..." But former National Super Alliance CEO Norman Magaya asked Raila Junior to stop acting smart. "... In war, those who seek to sound politically correct seldom last. Stop seeking to sound the sober one in the midst of war! Attacking party cadres to look good is a new low from you. Come on," he said. Raila's aide Silas Jakakimba said the tweet and its opening line sound like those tabloid stories that begin, 'Ten things you didn't know about XYZ'... Ironically, Mombasa Governor Hasan Joho who is also the ODM Deputy Party Leader and Suna East MP Junet Mohamed in July flew to Dubai in a private jet to visit a recovering Raila. The former prime minister left the country in June for the United Arab Emirates where he underwent a minor surgical operation on his back. Last weekend, while Raila was on a tour to Mombasa, Joho heavily criticised Deputy President William Ruto. "It is absurd for the deputy president to claim to represent the poor. Which hustler flies across the country with fleets of cars and helicopters," Joho posed, pointing out that Ruto had opted for early campaigns. He accused the DP of being behind politicians accused of hate-mongering.
