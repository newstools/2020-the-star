Gender CAS Rachael Shebesh on Wednesday said chiefs are not playing their part in the fight against female genital mutilation. She warned that tough action would be taken against chiefs who support the harmful practice. “Chiefs are the eyes of the government on the ground. They have no choice but to ensure the practice is done away with. We know some of you are into these retrogressive cultural practices,” Shebesh told chiefs and their assistants in Garissa. The CAS said they are going round the country to fulfil President Uhuru Kenyatta’s policy on eradication and prohibition of FGM by 2022. She spoke in Garissa during a meeting with the Anti-FGM Board. The programme is aimed at engaging local administrators, FGM survivors, and religious, political and opinion leaders. Ijara MP Sophia Abdinoor outlined some sections of the new policy that outlaws female genital cutting by medical personnel. “I was a core sponsor of some of the recommendations that went into the policy document and later to the formation of the Anti-FGM Board. We won’t rest until the practice is wiped out,” she said. Speaking on behalf of religious leaders, Garissa branch Supkem treasurer Hassan Abdi said they support any policy by the government on fighting female genital mutilation. Survivor Makah Kassim narrated her painful journey since she underwent the cut. “Imagine someone cutting a part of your body with no medication,” she said. Kassim said childbirth was torturous for her. Edited by A.N
