The government has completed the construction of three new boreholes at the Baricho water supply at a cost of Sh2.5 billion. The project is part of a multibillion-shilling investment going on in the Coast region to boost water supply. Water CAS Andrew Tuimur said on Wednesday the three boreholes have the capacity to supply 90,000 cubic metres of water per day. Speaking after touring Baricho waterworks, he said the project was initiated by the National Water Harvesting and Storage Authority in 2012, before it was taken over by the Coast Water Works Development Agency. The CAS also said a Sh15 million irrigation project in Chakama and another Sh120 million in Malindi South are in the pipeline. Tuimur further said they will ensure there is adequate water in learning institutions ahead of schools reopening.Â He was accompanied by CDA chairman Mustafa Iddi and other senior parastatal heads. The group will also visit Kwale county.
