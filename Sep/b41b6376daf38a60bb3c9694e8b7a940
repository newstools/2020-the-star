Actress Nadia Queen is working on a drama series featuring Prezzo, Shaniqwa and Nick Big Fish. The short series revolves around family drama and friendships. Speaking to Word Is, Nadia's manager Faisal Mufti said there is more than meets the eye. Faisal promised Kenyans to expect more from Nadia and her team. He said Nadia is working hard to turn the film industry around. "The recent episode titled 'Prezzo finds his sister a boyfriend' is hilarious in all ways," he said. "What makes the mini-series entertaining is the fusion of known celebrities and some of the best actors. They bring out unique and fresh content that has not been seen before." Nadia will also be featuring an upcoming Bollywood film in Mombasa called 'Love'. Her projects include helping the poor and assisting other content creators to rise to become better in their craft.
