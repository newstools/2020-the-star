A Kisumu court has acquitted four out of nine Homa Bay MCAs accused of assaulting speaker Elizabeth Ayoo in 2018. Kisumu senior resident magistrate Winfrida Onkunya on Thursday acquitted Dan Were, Julius Gaya, Paul Ongoro and Godfrey Anyango, after Ayoo withdrew the case. The four MCAs thanked the speaker for withdrawing the case. “We decided to forgive, bury our hatchets, and move on for the sake of our families,” Ayoo said. The other five accused- Evans Dada, Walter Were, Philemon Onyango, Peter Ojwang, and Paul Adika - were ready to proceed with the case. Ojwang's lawyer James Mwamu said the prosecution had not laid a proper ground for withdrawing the case. The case will be heard on December 15. Edited by A.N
