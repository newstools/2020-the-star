Deputy President William Ruto has warned leaders against politics of hatred and negative ethnicity. Speaking to a delegation of leaders from Nyandarua county at his Karen home, the DP challenged leaders to avoid propagating hatred.  The Nyandarua leaders were led by MPs Faith Gitau and Michael Muchira. “Leaders should not allow politics of hate, division, and ethnicity in our country. Instead, we need to embrace and encourage politics anchored on ideologies, policies, and issues that will unite and transform Kenya, and better the lives of the people,” Ruto said. The DP, who has been meeting political and religious leaders from across the country, said Kenyans will not listen to politics of hatred. Ruto had earlier hosted leaders from Meru, Narok and Kajiado at his Karen home. On Thursday, Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen accused Environment CS Keriako Tobiko of promoting nepotism and disrespecting the DP. Tobiko had said that it is too early to engage in politics of succession. The CS had also said that efforts of early campaigns can be put to better use. “The President is in charge of this government and we have two years left. This effort of early campaigns and receiving delegations can be put to better use," Tobiko said.
