Archbishop Emeritus Linus Okok, 68, is dead. He had been hospitalised following an accident. ODM leader Raila Odinga on Sunday mourned his passing, eulogising him as a true example of faith with deeds. "His death is a big blow to the Catholic Church, our country and the people of Homa Bay who continued to rely on him for guidance on both spiritual and earthly needs. May Almighty God accept his soul," he tweeted. Okok was ordained a priest in 1980. He was appointed the Bishop of Homa Bay in 1993 and ordained two months later. Okok resigned in February 2002.
