On Wednesday, the Office of the Attorney General in Nairobi County officially moved the venue for civil marriages to Nairobi Primary School. The CAS State Law Office Winnie Guchu presided the event where couples were seen enjoying the serene environment of the school. The registration process will be done online and the interviews will be conducted at the Attorney General's office. Thereafter, the couples will be given a specific date to do their wedding at Nairobi Primary and will be allowed to tag along only two witnesses for their civil marriage. "Due to coronavirus pandemic the registration will still be conducted online but the interview will be done at the office and later on the marriage will be conducted at Nairobi primary," Guchu said.
