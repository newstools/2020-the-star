The government has set aside Sh1.9 billion for making specialised desks for all primary and secondary schools in the country. Education Cabinet Secretary George Magoha said the government has come up with a design for the desks to be made in all counties. Speaking after inspecting Pwani University in Kilifi to assess the preparedness of the institution to reopen in line with the Covid-19 protocols, he said they have already developed a prototype of the desks. "All the 47 county commissioners have already been called to Nairobi to take the the prototype to be replicated at the subcounty level," he said. Magoha said the government was doing its best to ensure schools comply with the Ministry of Health guidelines and protocols. He clarified that the reopening of schools, universities colleges, and tertiary institutions shall be in January 2021. "The governmentâ€™s position on the reopening of schools, middle-level colleges, and universities has not changed. When the government closed down the schools after the first case of Covid-19 was reported it was announced that the reopening of the schools would be January 2021," he said. The CS, however, said the reopening would depend on how the virus would behave and the ability of the schools to comply with the protocols. He took issue with the media for allegedly misquoting him on the matter. He said the media has been misrepresenting his statements over the reopening, "portraying me like a fool in the public eyes". A bitter Magoha said the media has made him look like somebody who did not go to school by saying different things each day. Edited by R.Wamochie
