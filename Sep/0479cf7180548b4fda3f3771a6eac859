Embakasi East MP Paul Ongili alias Babu Owino has named his two goats after President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga. The two goats were gifted to him by a delegation from the Maasai Community for the good work he has been doing in regards to tutoring students online during this coronavirus season. "I want to take this opportunity to thank the Maasai community for honouring me with two fertile goats because of the online Education lessons I have been offering to our children," he said via Twitter on Tuesday. "I named the goats Uhuru and Raila to honour the leaders for promoting peace and tranquillity in this country." With learners forced to stay at home, the MP seized the moment in May and started online classes for secondary school candidates preparing for their national exams. Hundreds have been following his classes on social media pages and the First Class Honors Actuarial Science Graduate promises to continue helping the candidates in their revision for as long as the normal learning remains suspended. However, some saw this as a way of 'redeeming' himself after he was charged with the attempted murder of Felix Odhiambo, commonly known as DJ Evolve, at B-club on January 17. Babu was also charged with behaving in a disorderly manner while carrying a firearm. The MP is said to have become disorderly while carrying a pistol and firing one round of ammunition while intending to shoot at the DJ. Babu denied all the charges preferred against him.
