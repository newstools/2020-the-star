Gem MP Elisha Odhiambo has dismissed Chief Justice David Maraga’s advisory to the President to dissolve Parliament. Odhiambo said the Chief Justice has nothing tangible at the moment to support his advisory when the ultimate decision lies on the President. Odhiambo on Tuesday asked Maraga to stop looking for cheap publicity. He told the Star that the dissolution of Parliament is the prerogative of the President and the Constitution does not give any timelines. “The President can decide to make the decision Maraga is pushing in August 2022 when the country will be due to the General Election because at the moment the country is not ready for any election,” Odhiambo said. The MP wondered what exactly informed Maraga’s decision bearing in mind that the country is still struggling with the Covid-19 pandemic. Maraga advised President Uhuru Kenyatta to dissolve Parliament for failing to enact legislation required to implement the two-thirds gender rule. “I know Maraga is exiting and any Chief Justice wants to leave a track record of having followed the Constitution to the letter but some decisions need consultation,” Odhiambo said. “Does the country have the required resources to conduct elections at the moment? Is the IEBC well-constituted to run a general election? Those are the questions we should be asking ourselves before thinking of dissolving Parliament,” the MP said. In an advisory dated September 21, Maraga said he was responding following six petitions seeking his advice on the matter. The petitions are based on the fact that despite four court orders compelling Parliament to enact the legislation, the House has failed, refused or neglected to do so. Edited by Henry Makori
