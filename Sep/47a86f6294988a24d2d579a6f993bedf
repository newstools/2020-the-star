Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) has launched a mobile phone application that simplifies access to its various services. KRA M-Service App is meant to ease tax transactions and compliance taxpayers. The authority said in a statement on Thursday that the app enables taxpayers to access services offered such as taxpayer registration and verification, filing of returns and payment of tax. "The system will widen taxpayer reach, increase revenue collection and enhance tax compliance by making the tax payment process more convenient. It will also reduce the cost of compliance by removing intermediaries," KRA said. "Through the App, taxpayers are now able to easily register, pay and file tax returns for Monthly Rental Income (MRI) and for Turnover Tax (TOT) obligations. Taxpayers are also able to register for Personal Identification Number (PIN), both Kenyan and Alien citizenship as well as perform checks on PIN, Payment Registration Number (PRN), Tax Compliance Certificate (TCC) and confirm the identity of KRA staff." Taxpayers with smart mobile phones can access the app by downloading and installing it from Google Play Store. "Users with no PIN will be required to first register while those already with PINs can register on the app then login in and choose the particular services they require." According to the authority, at least 37,000 taxpayers have already downloaded the App which is also meant to enhance remote operations while addressing the informal and micro-enterprise sector through e-commerce and m-commerce transactions.
