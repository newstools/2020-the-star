Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua entered the 2022 presidential race because many Kenyans want him to be president, Maendeleo Chap Chap secretary-general Stephen Kilonzo has said. Kilonzo said during visits to all corners of the country, many people asked Mutua to run so that he can manage the county as he has Machakos. “I have been in  Mutua’s entourage to many parts of Kenya including and not limited to Kisii, Moyale, Isiolo, Kwale, Kapenguria, Kwale, Kitale, Busia, Malindi, Mombasa. The outstanding thing from all these visits is the plea from locals for him to run for the presidency,” Kilonzo said. He told journalists in his home in Kitui county that Mutua was merely listening to the voice of the people. “I call on Kitui people not to denounce a prophet in their midst. He is a sellable visionary leader and someone we should give credence for his previous record. We should back his bid both in kind and in material,” Kilonzo said. He said that MCC has become a powerful political outfit capable of carrying out a powerful campaign blitz to popularise its presidential candidate in all parts of Kenya. “As a young party during the 2017 polls we had 1,008 candidates but we are now stronger and will have candidates for all elective seats across Kenya,” he said. Earlier on Friday, Kilonzo announced that he will take a second stab at the Kitui senatorial seat in 2022. He spoke in Kitui town when he donated fuel to over 300 boda boda operators in Kitui town. “I was responding to the plight of our boda bodas who are facing hard times due to coronavirus. I, therefore, decided to give them a small token of fuel to keep them running,” he told reporters.
