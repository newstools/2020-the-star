Personal branding expert Hannah Muchuki has described comedian Churchill (Daniel Ndambuki) as a brand that represents a mentor. Through a video on Instagram, Hannah also termed him a brand Kenya ambassador who speaks up for Kenya in all his international interviews. "Churchill is not just good for jokes and laughs, he is much more than that. He is a brand that says to me, 'I am your teacher, I am your mentor and I love that,'" she said. "You can see how enthusiastic he is when he supports courses that affect humanity and from his jokes, you can see he loves Kenya." In her book, 'Flaunt your Genius', she dedicates an entire chapter to Churchill the brand, breaking down what lessons one can pick from it. Churchill has mentored hundreds of young people and even helped them earn a living.
