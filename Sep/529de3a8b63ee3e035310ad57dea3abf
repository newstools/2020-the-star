Online comedian Brendah Jons, aka Mama Plesdent Kingston, has opened up about her falling-out with Digitone Agency. The talent management company is owned by video director Jibril Blessing. In an interview with Carolina Hot Edition, Brendah said she walked out of the agency due to personal and financial reasons. The comedian said Digitone could not account for her earnings. She said the company left her broke and on the verge of falling into depression. "I am currently working solo. I had worked with that management for some time and then due to money issues, personal issues I had to walk out," Brendah said. "There was no accountability of where the money was going and I was living like a broke artist, so I felt I couldn’t do it anymore." She said the agency owes her around Sh400,000, which she decided to let go of after a lot of push and pull. "It was back and forth, lawyers involved, all that…Ikafika tu place it was too dramatic I just had to walk out and let it go. A lot of money, Sh400,000," she said. Brendah said even though it was a difficult experience, she took it as a learning step. "As much as it was very painful, and got me into almost going into depression, it was a lesson learnt for me." She said comedian Njugush encouraged her to move on. When Word Is reached out to J Blessing, he declined to comment on the issue but gave us the management's numbers.
