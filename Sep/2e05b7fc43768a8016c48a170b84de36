Kanu politics in West Pokot county has taken an ugly twist after two members recorded statements about alleged death threats from Governor John Lonyangapuo. Two Kanu members — assembly speaker Catherine Mukenyang and nominated MCA Elijah Kaseuseu — recorded statements. “We are now living in fear we don’t know what might happen to our lives,” Mukenyang told the press on Thursday. She said that Lonyangapuo had threatened her four times in the Pokot language. Governor Lonyangapuo, an ally of Deputy President William Ruto, dismissed the allegations, terming them lies and politics. “The top Kanu leadership is out to frustrate and sabotage my government through the county assembly. The two should resign if they are unable to carry out their duties,” he said. Kanu secretary general Nick Salat has said Lonyangapuo is disloyal to the party headed by Baringo Senator Gideon Moi. Ruto and Moi are rivals in Rift Valley. Mukenyang recorded a statement at the Kileleshwa police station last week. Kaseusu recorded a statement on Thursday at Kapenguria police station. Mukenyang dismissed allegations that she was among the masterminds of the expulsion of four female Kanu MCAs. Kaseuseu said the governor turned against him after they differed about politics. The four Kanu MCAs, allies of the governor, were expelled by the party on September 2 for failing to pay their monthly fees, failure to adhere to the Kanu loyalty pledge, the code of conduct and inability to defend and promote the party in the county assembly. Kanu expelled Grace Rengei, Jackline Ripoo, Nancy Chombir and Josephine Chepurum. (Edited by V. Graham)
