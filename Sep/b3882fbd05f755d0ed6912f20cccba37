Residents of Athi River have raised concern over the pathetic condition in which an elderly woman lives at Slota estate in Machakos county. They said the 74-year-old was hungry and sick and needs food and proper medication. Helida Onyango Otieno lives in mabati shack erected for her along a sewerage line in Athi River, Mavoko subcounty. She had been living in a makeshift polythene structure for years before well-wishers came to her rescue. According to Otieno’s old generation ID seen by the Star, she was born in Gem Gombe village in North Gem location, Siaya district, in 1947. Residents called on Siaya Governor Cornel Rasanga and Gem MP Elisha Odhiambo to help return the woman to her rural home in Siaya and link her with her relatives. “We as her fellow women and well-wishers decided to contribute resources to construct this structure after we realised some men were raping her especially during the night inside the polythene shack she lived in. It was also cold since she was being rained on whenever there was a downpour,” Linet Achieng' said. Achieng' said the woman who survives by rummaging through garbage heaps for recyclables has no known relative and has lived in Athi River for decades. “I came to Athi River in 2011 and found her here. We are told she worked at a farm in Kwa Mang’eli estate within the town in early 2000 while younger and energetic,”  Achieng’ told reporters on Tuesday. She said the woman lived a pathetic life and depended on a few well-wishers who occasionally gave her food. Nobody was consistent in checking on her. Otieno locked herself inside her shack and refused to open it when the residents visited her. She said she would only allow individuals known to her and if they promised to give her food or money to buy cigarettes. The residents said area officials and political leaders were aware of the woman’s plight but had ignored her. Edited by Henry Makori
