A robbery suspect was gunned down in Mwembe Tayari in Mombasa on Sunday night. Police said the young man identified as Salim Abdallah alias ‘Pava’ defied orders to surrender when he and two accomplices were cornered at around 11pm. “He has been giving people sleepless nights and he is known by residents. If you go there and talk to people, they will tell you about the young man,” Urban police boss Eliud Monari said. Police were responding to a tip-off from the public that he had been seen with a panga in the area. Three mobile phones believed to have been stolen from residents were recovered from the suspect. A few days ago, the youngster in his 20s branded by security agencies as notorious is said to have slashed a resident and stole a mobile phone and money from him. Police arrested a suspect as Pava went into hiding. Police are looking for the two who escaped. Mombasa, Kenya’s second largest city and a tourist destination, had been infiltrated by knife-wielding gangsters before authorities launched a crackdown against them. The crackdown resulted in the killing of  youthful gangsters, occasionally prompting an outcry from human rights groups. Edited by EKibii
