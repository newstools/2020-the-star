Deputy President William Ruto has said that the country will not go to violence because of politics as was witnessed in 2007. Speaking to hundreds of people in Kisii on Thursday, Ruto said some politicians were using threats and intimidation to suggest there could be violence in 2022. “Kenyans will not fight each other over elections, the fools are no longer available…this country will be peaceful and we know that no one will be forced to do against his/her wish,” he said. He continued “I want to assure Kenyans, that as long as I am the deputy president, there will be no violence in Kenya again over politics. The DP said that Kenyans are alert and knowledgeable enough to desist from politics of violence. His remarks come two days after ODM leader Raila Odinga asked Ruto’s allies not to take the country back to the dark days. “We have gone to war in 1992, 1997 and 2007 and nobody should try to take this country to war again because of politics,” Raila said at a press conference at his Capitol Hill office. He went on: “We believe that this country deserves peace and unity now more than ever, war cries and beating drums of war will not work.” While Raila did not directly mention Ruto, his key ally who spoke after him was blunt. “Deputy President Ruto must stop threatening people with violence. He should not think he has the monopoly over violence,” said Suna East MP Junet Mohamed, a Raila confidant. Emurua Dikir MP Johanna Ng’eno and Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi launched scathing attacks on the Kenyatta family, including ex-First Lady Mama Ngina Kenyatta, triggering a political storm. In a telling statement of all-out war in Jubilee, Uhuru’s cousin Beth Mugo linked Ruto to the attacks, saying as the duo’s political captain, he has failed to come out to condemn his lieutenants.
