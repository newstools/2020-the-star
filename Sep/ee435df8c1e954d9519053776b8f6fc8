Three police officers attached to DP William Ruto were on Thursday grilled over their role in Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi's escape when police wanted to arrest him last week. Investigators wanted to inquire what business the guards had when police officers arrived to arrest him. Sudi had evaded arrest for 48 hours and the State intends to charge him with five counts of hate speech over Mama Ngina Kenyatta slur, assaulting a police officer, offensive conduct, resisting arrest and being in illegal possession of a firearm. The officers are attached to the presidential escort unit which guards the president and his deputy. According to the Standard, preliminary reports indicate the officers had escorted the DP to his residence, where they handed him over to the GSU officers guarding his Sugoi residence. The three then left Ruto's home to join Sudi at his home. When the police who wanted to arrest Sudi arrived, found the three within the compound. It was after the police officers gained entry that it emerged one of the members of the elite unite was armed with a Jericho pistol loaded with 15 bullets while his colleague had a Ceska pistol and 30 bullets, the Standard noted. Sudi has appealed his incarceration before the High Court in Nakuru. Through a matter that has since been certified urgent, the MP asked the High Court to release him on reasonable bail terms. Justice Joel Ngugi ordered Sudiâ€™s lawyers to immediately serve the Directorate of Public Prosecutions with the application documents and return to court on Friday at 10.00 am. On Wednesday, a Magistrates Court ruled that Sudi will remain in police custody for another seven days. Sudi had already spent two days behind bars at the Nakuru Central police station pending a bail application ruling.
