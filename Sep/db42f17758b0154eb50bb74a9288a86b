Nairobi City Stars striker David Amuyunzu is ready to test himself against the country’s top defenders when the Kenyan Premier League kicks off after the restrictions to curb the spread of coronavirus are finally lifted. Amuyunzu emerged as Nairobi City Stars top scorer with 17 goals in the four seasons the club featured in the second tier National Super League (NSL). “Well I can say it’s a day-to-day progress that I challenge myself to be better than yesterday. So hopefully, I keep my name more on the score sheets and keep raising City Stars flag high,” remarked Agesa on the club’s official portal. In their first season in the NSL in 2017, Agesa scored seven goals that included the only NSL hat-trick by City Stars in the 4-1 win over FC Talanta at Camp Toyoyo. The hat-trick followed his first ever brace in City Stars colours two weeks earlier that delivered a 2-1 win over Isibania FC at the same venue. He added one more the next season before departing for a stint in Asia. Upon his return months later, he added three goals in the shortened and transitional 2018/19 season and another six that helped the team gain promotion in the corona-disrupted 2019/20 season to tally up his NSL strikes to 17. With 17 NSL goals for City Stars, Agesa is ahead of Gambian Ebrima Sanneh and Ugandan Sande Katumba who both scored 15 goals over two NSL seasons. Ezekiel Odera and Peter Mwangi Wainaina are the next best NSL scorers for City Stars with 14 and 10 goals. With City Stars now back for the 2020/21 Premier League season, Agesa will be seeking his maiden top-flight goal, and more. “Yes, I feel I am ready and more hungry for the KPL challeng,” he said. Davies has 10 Premier League appearances all gained while on a short-term loan at Thika United in the 2018 season. The speedy forward with plaited hair committed to two more years with Sanjin Alagic’s charges and will be angling for more premiership games and goals in the upcoming season.
