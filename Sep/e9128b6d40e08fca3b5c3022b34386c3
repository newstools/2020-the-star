Migori is different from other Luo Nyanza counties. Okoth Obado won the governor race in the 2013 election on the PDP ticket. The people of Migori were able to test the waters to see whether they can sail on their own. They realised that one can win an election without necessarily being in ODM. In 2017, during ODM nominations, Obado won with an overwhelming majority but the party attempted to delay giving him the certificate. ODM then realised that would not help as Obado would beat them at their own game. So Migori presents a very delicate situation to the party. The likelihood of Obado influencing how residents will vote in the 2022 governor race is high. Whoever he will throw his weight behind is likely to trounce the ODM candidate. ODM's handling of his impeachment has worsened the situation. The impeachment will attract sympathy for Obado. Those who might have been thinking that Obado is a bad person will look at how he is treating and think otherwise. The situation in Migori is sensitive and ODM is in trouble in the county. If they go ahead and impeach Obado, they will have started on the wrong footing. Those supporting the party decision have argued that they are defending what ODM stands for, with no ill motive. But impeaching him will free Obado to traverse the county and campaign for his preferred successor. They will be setting him free to hammer them seriously without any attachment or respect for the party. This is why you can see there some sort of split among officials over the matter but generally, ODM appears to be determined to kick out the governor. There is no way ODM will come out stronger after impeaching Obado. The former aspirant for Kuria West constituency spoke to the Star.
