Kenya Morans play-maker Eric Mutoro believes the national team will make it to the Fiba AfroBasket qualifiers in Dakar, Senegal in November if they prepare well. He said they are prepared for the show and as a team, they have been in touch through zoom forum since cessation of sports events. “We can’t wait to resume camp and prepare physically. I believe if we prepare well, there is nothing impossible,” he said. The indefatigable Ulinzi Warriors’ guard, who is one of the country’s key players, said when Kenya went to Bamako, Mali, last year, their opponents did not know what to expect from the national side. “Kenya went to Bamako tournament as the underdogs and therefore people were not expecting the team to do well. We used that to our advantage, went out there and put on a show to remember,” he observed. “We beat teams without them knowing we were heading to the finals. Another thing that really helped us achieve what we did was our team spirit and cohesion.” Mutoro, who impressed in his first assignment in Kampala, Uganda during last year’s Zone Five qualifiers for Afro-Can is being taunted by coach Cliff Owuor as one of the key players in the upcoming championships. “His positive attitude and effort is amazing. He energises the team on offensive with the runs and three point shots,” noted Owuor. He added: “In the defence, he puts pressure and gives us steals that have always changed the course of the game.” Owuor has plans to bring home at least six players who are based in the diaspora to bolster the team’s chances for a return to AfroBasket since 1993. Kenya will face hosts Senegal, Angola and Mozambique in the two phase qualifiers. The top three teams will progress to next year’s Afro-Basket in Kigali, Rwanda.
