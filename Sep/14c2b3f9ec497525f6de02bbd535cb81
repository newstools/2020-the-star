A meeting held in Murang’a on Friday and attended by over 50 leaders from Mt Kenya did not discuss 2022 succession, Nyeri Town MP Ngunjiri Wambugu has said. “In fact, we didn’t discuss 2022 elections at all. We met to bond as a region and work over our internal divisions and come together on common issues about our region,” he wrote on his Facebook page. Wambugu termed reports in the Saturday Nation that the region resolved to field a candidate for the 2022 presidency as mischievous. He said the reports were meant to create suspicion and resistance to the idea of a Mt Kenya leaders' meeting. The MP said similar reports arose the last time the region’s leaders met to forge unity and work together for development. “That time we started with a meeting at Naivasha where we came together over 60 of us, despite our different positions on 2022. We then met with President Kenyatta in Nyeri a week later, and formed teams to focus on specific sectors,” he said. During the meeting, he said, they agreed on the need to unite the region for the sake of development. “We also agreed that our unity is meant to ensure that we work together on the development of areas common to our people in the Mt Kenya region,” he added. The legislator alleged that someone must have been unhappy about the meeting and planted the story in the media. The reports were meant to achieve set objectives and create particular perceptions and narratives, he noted. “First, it is meant to create animosity against us from our region by showing as if the region's leaders are more interested in 2022 politics than in matters development of our region.” Such reports, he said, are meant to create suspicion, distrust and resistance from those supporting the President outside the region by portraying it as greedy for power. This, he added, would be achieved by destroying any goodwill the region has with other regions. He maintained that such meetings will continue and the region will not be side-tracked.
