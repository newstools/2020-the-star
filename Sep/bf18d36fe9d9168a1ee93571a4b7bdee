Tourism CS Najib Balala has demanded the removal of a tourist camp built beside the Mara River that has been blocking the famous wildebeest crossing. According to a video that has gone viral on social media, people believed to be employees of the camp can be seen forcing the herd of wildebeest to turn back and use an alternative route. There were fears of a stampede after those people were seen chasing away the animals. “I have discussed with Narok Governor Samuel Tunai, about the camp built beside the Mara River, blocking the Wildebeest crossing. Its very disturbing and we expect the Governor to take action and have the camp removed!” Balala said. Balala added :"I have also insisted that we need a Maasai Mara National Reserve Management Plan, that will not only enhance biodiversity, but also protect our wildlife migratory corridors, from greed!" The wildebeest migration which is one of the wonders of the world is an annual event that sees over two million animals migrate from the Mara to Tanzania. Nature lovers have called it the greatest show on earth.
