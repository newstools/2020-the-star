The KenGen board of Directors has reappointed Rebecca Miano as the firm's managing director and CEO for another three years. The renewal was reached after 'rigorous evaluation process' according to the board's chairman Joshua Choge. In a public notice to shareholders dated August 31,  Choge said during "Miano’s three-year tenure at the helm of KenGen, the Company has continued on an upward growth trajectory". "...Consistently reporting good corporate financial performance despite a difficult operating environment that has affected many other businesses globally," he said. The firm realised a Sh22 billion profit from its public infrastructure  in October 2019. "That confirmed to the investor world that KenGen is a credible company to invest in whether through equity or debt financing," he said. "The Company has continued to grow in terms of assets, post impressive results and generate adequate cash flows." The company's two multi-million shilling geothermal drilling and consultancy contracts in Ethiopia has also been attributed to Miano's passionate leadership skills.
