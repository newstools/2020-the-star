Young people with prominent parents should emulate the humility of Health CS Mutahi Kagwe's son rapper Kahush, Kiss 100's Kamene and Jalango have said. Jalango said Kahush does not rub it in people’s faces that his father is prominent, unlike some people. "He is not his father’s son. His music and his dad’s politics do not mix," he said. "He is just living his life. ‘He is not like, do you know who my dad is?" Jalango was responding to Kamene Goro, who said she was impressed after she met a humble Kahush. "He is an amazing, very well disciplined young man. I was so impressed at how well mannered he is," she said. Kahush was on the spot last month for flouting the Covid rules his father preaches after being spotted at a house party. When asked, Kagwe said he is an adult.
