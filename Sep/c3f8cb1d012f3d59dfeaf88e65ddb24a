Britam has launched a 'Bake Off Challenge' after its Uganda Airlines cake mishap. "Because we did not get it right the first time. We tried baking a cake and fell flat on our faces! " the company said in a statement on Monday. "You may have seen unflattering photos of what was our attempt to celebrate Uganda Airlines’ First Anniversary circulating online." In the picture, the cake that was baked to mirror Uganda Airlines looked more of a sunken ship, or like some called it - a whale. Britam noted that even though they flopped, it is the thought that counts. "Well, we agree with a majority of you who said the cake did not do justice to this massive milestone and the occasion at hand," it said. To redeem themselves, Britam came up with 'The Great Britam Bake Off Challenge'. "We’re calling out all bakers – large and small – to take part in the design of a new cake to be presented to Uganda Airlines," they said. It noted that the best design will be funded to bake and personally present the cake to Uganda Airlines in addition to delivering a donation to a charity of their choice courtesy of Britam Uganda and Uganda Airlines. The next four bakers will also receive a contract to bake a cake for four charities within Kampala while also handing over donations. Deadline for submission is September 9 at 5pm.
