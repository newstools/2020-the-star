Going by the latest developments around the clamour to control Jubilee Party, there is no way the alliance between President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto will last until 2022. The two have certainly split. I do not see the DP remaining in government until then. Jubilee, through vice chairman David Murathe and the recent changes to Parliament leadership, has shown it is not interested in having Ruto as its presidential candidate. The party’s presidential candidate is definitely not Ruto. The Deputy President’s goal is to be president after Uhuru leaves office in 2022. Jubilee cannot sustain that ambition. Ruto no longer has any authority in Jubilee. He's even said the party has been hijacked by busybodies, conmen and brokers. Ruto knows he will not be nominated to fly the Jubilee flag. And since he will not be nominated to be the presidential candidate, Ruto has to jump ship. However, I would say the time to jump out is now rather than later. And going by the recent activities of the DP and his allies, one can see that they are getting ready to do just that. The brazen talk targeting Murathe and Jubilee secretary general Raphael Tuju is indicative of the fact that they are on their way out—and it is only a matter of time. They are talking about Jubilee Asili, but whether they will go in that direction is a matter of conjecture. I can conclude that they are certainly looking at Plan B and Jubilee is certainly not an option. The Tangatanga brigade has equally gone quiet. This can only mean they have given up on Jubilee, despite some members indicating that they are in the party to claim their rightful share. Whether they stay and for how long we cannot tell. What is clear however is that they will leave on their own volition, ostensibly after finishing whatever business they are still pursuing as recently indicated by deputy secretary general Caleb Kositany.
