Justice Jessie Lessit will on Monday next week rule on whether businessman Chris Obure and his bodyguard Robert Bodo will be granted bail. Obure was charged last week alongside Bodo for the murder of Kevin Omwenga that occurred on August 21. In his application to the court, Obure has pleaded with the court to release him on bail pending trial. In a virtual hearing before Justice Jessie Lessit, Obure says he is not a flight risk and will avail himself in court whenever he is needed. Obure appeared on the virtual court proceedings from his hospital bed at Nairobi Hospital. The defence lawyers have denied any allegations that he was in the vicinity of the alleged shooting. Lawyer Caroline Oduor for Obure told the court that her client has not shown any tendencies to interfere with witnesses as claimed by the police. Oduor also says on the morning of August 22 , Obure presented himself to the police station at 7.45 am in a bid to assist with investigations. "He has a fixed abode living in Nairobi with his family, gainfully employed with an international company," she added. However, the prosecution has strongly opposed to their release on bail arguing that he is a flight risk. The prosecution says that since Obure works for an aviation company he may flee the country. Judge Lessit will deliver the bail ruling on Monday. On Friday last week, Obure was charged with an additional charge of failing to secure his firearm. He informed the court that he was feeling unwell and Magistrate Siyianki Tobiko ordered the police to escort him to Nairobi Hospital to be seen by his family doctor. Oduor has told Justice Lessit that Obure is still undergoing treatment and will be released once his doctor allows him.
