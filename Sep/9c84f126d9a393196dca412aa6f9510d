A proper forensic audit is needed to shed light on the Managed Equipment Services scandal. One of the reasons we were not able to pin down a particular person is because it is not very clear where the money is. The National Treasury says it has given all the money to the Ministry of Health. The ministry says the money is not necessarily for the counties but for the national government. However, our understanding is that the money is a grant to the counties from the national government, and is being deducted from the devolved units at the source. We want to know where the money is and who is being paid. In Meru, for example, the theatre equipment is still in the Netherlands. It has not been delivered but Meru is paying the full complement for MES. When we went to the Netherlands, they told us they have not been paid for equipment that they have not delivered. So, where is the money for the equipment for Meru? The laboratory equipment components tender was cancelled. There was also a component for information and communication technology that was cancelled. But when it comes to charging, we are asking the counties to pay for all the components of the MES project. What exactly is it that counties are paying for? What exactly constitutes the MES project? The act of dropping of some components from the project did not amount to a corresponding decrease in the money being paid to MES. That is why we want a forensic audit. When the Attorney General appeared before us, he said he was under a lot of pressure. We need to find out from the audit where the pressure was coming from and what is it that the AG was supposed to do. It would be very easy for us to say surcharge the AG and the Health CS but this scandal is bigger than that. Only a forensic audit can give us a proper direction as to who exactly is responsible for what. The Kitui senator spoke to the Star
