Kilifi county's 10 departments are being trained to observe gender rules and to be more responsive to the needs of both sexes. The county is one of six targeted by the programme rolled out by the Federation of Women Lawyers in Kenya (Fida). Officials will be trained on how to make budgeting, planning and implementation of programmes avoid harmful practices against individuals of either gender. Fida's Ilham Isham said they want all the departments to understand that gender is not only about empowering women. She said Kilifi county has a 50:50 representation of men and women in the executive committee and about 40:60 ratio among chief officers. Oscar Nyapeda, a trainer on gender issues, said Kilifi county has made progress in ensuring gender parity at the top. He said the Judiciary was the best example of an institution where women are visible in the seniormost positions. “It's only in politics where positions are dished out to women but in other sectors, women work up the ladder,” he said. Agneta Karembo, a gender officer at the Kilifi county government, said officials who undergo the training will act as watchdogs for gender mainstreaming programmes. Felix Kalama, another Kilifi official, said in the grassroots most of the programmes engage men and leave out women. He said the problem has led to the violence against women, which will only be resolved if there was equality. ''We have to find relevant ways of how we can ensure we layout whatever we expect to the policymakers so that they can buy our ideas,'' he said. Funding for the programme is by SDG Kenya Forum, Development Initiative and the  Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Baringo, Kisumu, Kajiado  Nakuru and Kitui are the other counties to be reached.
