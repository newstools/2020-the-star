The price of diesel dropped albeit marginally new monthly prices announced Monday, quelling speculations on potential increase amid a countrywide shortage. A spot check by the Star over the weekend found that several fuel stations in the Nairobi and its environs had no stocks of diesel, with most consumers suspecting hoarding to inflate prices. An unexpected turn of events, the Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority (EPRA) announced Sh0.12 drop on a litre of diesel and Sh0.50 on a litre of kerosene. The regulator attributed the minor drop to the drop in average landed cost. The cost of imported diesel decreased by 1.02 per cent from $333.27 per cubic metre to $329.88 per cubic metre while that of kerosene decreased by 2.06 per cent from $288.01 per cubic metre to $282.09 per cubic metre. Even so, the prices of a litre of super petrol went up by Sh1.48, adding pain to motorists and commuters who are likely to suffer a hike in transport cost. The increase is a consequence of a rise in the average landed cost which went up by 2.65 per cent from $319.23 per cubic metre in July to $327.69 per cubic metre in August. A litre of super petrol is now retailing at Sh105.43 in Nairobi, diesel Sh94.51 while that of kerosene is now at Sh83.15.
