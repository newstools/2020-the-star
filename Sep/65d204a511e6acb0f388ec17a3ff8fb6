 It’s all systems go as Football Kenya Federation Electoral Board concluded a training for election officials ahead of the county elections scheduled for Saturday. The officials were taken through the Board’s expectations of a free and fair exercise, as well as the health protocols they need to enforce at the polling stations in light of the Covid-19 pandemic. “We have learnt about what is expected of us. Our expectation is that we will conduct a free, fair, credible and transparent election,” said Charles Yogo, a returning officer. The Board has sought input from the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC), who will offer technical support. “We felt it was necessary to involve IEBC who will provide technical support to our returning officers,” said Board chairperson Kentice Tikolo. “We have elections in 21 counties. There have been more aspirants subjecting themselves to the process, and in my opinion, it is a vote of confidence,” she added. Elections are set to be held in 21 counties where there is opposition. In case of a tie, repeat elections shall be held on September 22. A disputes resolution window, for any complaints that may arise from the county elections, has, in the meantime, been provided for in the electoral calendar, between September 24 and 28. The final county results shall be published on October 1.
