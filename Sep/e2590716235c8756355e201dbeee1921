Kenya Bureau of Standards (KEBS) on Wednesday seized several pieces of millet and maize flour from two brands being sold in the market without an operational permit. Kebs officials nabbed 143 pieces, 75 pieces of Achievers millet flour, and 3 sacks of Waiyaki wheat flour. Also, 34 pieces of sifted maize flour repacked without a permit were seized. The team also seized repackaged and unbranded cooking oil, 2 liters 37 pieces, 1 liter 64 pieces, and 400 ml 30 pieces at Fairvalue Supermarket. Also seized, was cooking fat 1 kg 86 pieces, 500 g 96 pieces, &and 250 g 77 pieces. In a similar operation at Chandarana Highridge, substandard extension sockets which did not meet requirements of the set standard were seized. Kenyans have been asked to be on the lookout of the substandard products, which can be confirmed by sending text below the KEBS logo to 20023. On Monday, 583 boxes of substandard cotton earbuds made of wood stem under the brand name Chico in Naivasha and Nyahururu were confiscated. The brand did not meet the specifications of Kenya Standard KS 2245 which requires cotton earbuds to be made of a polyethylene stem that does not break when bent to approximately 45º with fingers. “Wood stick earbuds are a health and safety concern as they tend to break and splinter and may therefore injure the ear canal,” Kebs MD Bernard Njiraini said. During a countrywide market surveillance, Kebs also impounded hundreds of substandard non-woven carrier bags in Nyahururu, which did not meet labelling or branding requirements as outlined in Kenya Standard KNWA 2284 - non-woven polypropylene bags specification.
