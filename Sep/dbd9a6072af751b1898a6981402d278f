 Garissa Deputy Governor Abdi Dagane on Monday said there is no leadership vacuum and the absence of Governor Ali Korane from office does not affect service delivery in the county. Korane was two weeks ago barred from office when he was released on a bond of Sh3 million over a corruption case. Korane and four others are accused  of misappropriating part of Sh233 million from the World Bank-funded Kenya Urban Support Programme “Following the recent court ruling affecting our governor and some of our colleagues and the subsequent discussions and comments it has generated, I intend to confirm the commitment of the county government to focus on nothing short of service delivery to the people of Garissa county,” Dagane said. He said there is no leadership vacuum. "Under my leadership, county executive committee members and the gallant county workforce, we shall continue to implement the governor's development agenda as provided for in Article 179 of the constitution, Section 32(2) of the County Government act and the recent court rulings,” he added. He expressed confidence that the case ‘will be concluded within the shortest time possible' and urged residents remain calm. He also appealed to the political leadership at the national and county level to enhance their oversight role. “Anyone can captain the ship when the sea is calm, but it takes grit, pragmatism and skilful leadership to wade through the rough seas. I also appeal to the national government organs in Garissa for support as we continue serving the residents of Garissa,” he said. Last week, Dagane reported to the police that he has received threats to his life. "The recent case against the leadership of our county is not unprecedented. There is no possibility of vacuum given that there exists court rulings and constitutional safeguards against this kind of circumstances and, therefore, the task of governance is not left to chance," he said in a statement on his Facebook page.
