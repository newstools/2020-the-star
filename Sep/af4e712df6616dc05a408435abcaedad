Charles Muneira Yosei  has kicked off preparations as he hopes to make the cut for 2021 World Cross Country Championships in March next year in Bathurst, Australia. Muneira, who was wrongfully included in the 5,000m despite qualifying to compete in 10,000m at the 2016 Rio Olympic Games in Brazil, said he has resumed training to ensure he keeps top form ahead of the national trials. The 24-year-old said he hopes to bounce back strongly after the coronavirus pandemic halted sports events. “It has been a while since I competed but I have resumed serious training to reclaim my spot in Team Kenya for the world cross,” said the former Africa cross country bronze medallist. Muneira said he will be discussing with his manager to see what events he can run before the world cross, which is less than six months away. “For now, I have no race in between but I will be discussing with my manager (Gianni Demadonna) to organise a race for me. It has been a while and I want to be in top form to secure a title,” said Muneira, who trains in Iten, Elgeyo Marakwet County. Born and raised in Kaptama, Mount Elgon in Bungoma County, Muneira won silver in both marathon and half marathon at the inaugural Africa Beach Games.
