Socialite Vera Sidika has relocated to Mombasa from Nairobi and moved her salon business with her. In an invite sent to Word Is, Vera said she is rebranding and becoming bigger and better. "I hereby take this opportunity to invite you to the official launch of VS Spa on September 5 from 1-8pm on 3rd Avenue, Nyali (right behind City Mall). The dress code is elegant and classy," she said. Vera's beauty parlour was previously located in Western Heights, Westlands. She launched it in June 2018. Speaking to Word Is during the launch, Vera said she was optimistic about the business and it's going to be a very successful one. In a recent interview with Standard, Vera said the cold weather had driven her off Nairobi as she developed a serious flu that threatened her health. Edited by T Jalio
