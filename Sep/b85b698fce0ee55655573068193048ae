@robertomollo3 Fishers from Karachuonyo have stayed away from Lake Victoria for almost a week as rainfall and windstorms threatened lives and destroyed fishing gear. Strong winds have destroyed boats and damaged nets in Nyapuodi, Alum, Kendu Bay town, Nyakwere and Osodo beaches. Fishers have also reported reduced catch due to the bad weather. In Kendu Bay Town, strong winds blew off the roofs of stores and destroyed rental houses used for business along the beach. Fishers estimate the value of property damaged at Sh300,000. Kendu Bay fisherman Abdala Ojunge said many nets cannot be traced and those affected have suspended activities in the lake. “Our working gears have been destroyed. Fishermen are worried over the changing weather patterns since it can cause accidents in the lake,” Ojunge said. Karachuonyo Beach Management Unit chairman Ibrahim Kasera said the bad weather is causing a huge economic setback to local fishermen and traders along the beaches. “We appeal to the disaster management department in Homa Bay to assist us get back to business. We have families to feed and other activities that need our support,” Kasera said.
