Lamu native doctors have asked the national government to allow them to help treat persons with Covid-19 in the region. They want to be involved in finding both a cure and vaccine for the disease. Lamu has at least 118 Covid-19 cases with two deaths recorded so far. Speaking in Lamu town on Wednesday, the native doctors' spokesperson Profesa Chonda said they were more than ready to use their ancient ways to treat patients suffering from the viral flu if allowed by the state. Chonda said for decades, they have been able to use special concoctions to treat ailments more stubborn and dangerous than Covid-19. He said it was unfortunate that all focus was in laboratories trying to find a cure for the disease "when the real cure lay in herbs and ancient ways of medication." The native doctors are also unhappy that the government is not revealing the identity of those infected, saying it would have been easier to reach out and treat them. “Let the government know that we are very ready to help because it’s obvious that this particular disease has defied science and research. But we know that it cannot defeat the ancient ways. All we need is a go-ahead and they will see changes,” Chonda said. Ahmed Mwalimu urged the government to also set aside funds to support them and enable them help in the war against Covid-19. “They are focusing too much on funding research. They have not tried our native ways to see how far they can help in this pandemic. If they give us a chance, we promise all this trouble will end,” Mwalimu said. Lamu elders, on the other hand, have continued to encourage people to swim daily in the Indian Ocean so as to keep coronavirus away.  Edited by R.Wamochie
