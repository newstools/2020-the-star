Narc Kenya party leader Martha Karua has criticized decision by Education CS George Magoha to only reopen medical schools for face to face learning. Nine universities were on Monday give the green light by the Commission for University Education to reopen next month for medical students after seven months of closure. Karua in a Twitter post on Tuesday noted that all students can resume if conditions are safe enough for medical students. "If medical students can be recalled then all students can be recalled!" she said. Learning institutions that have been allowed to recommence physical studies include the University of Nairobi, Kenyatta University, Moi, Egerton, Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology, Maseno University, Uzima, Kenya Methodist and MKU. According the CUE, these institutions have met health guidelines to warrant their reopening. University Education PS Simon Nabukwesi said on Friday the reopening of medical schools will act as a curtain raiser and benchmark to inform the resumption of learning activities in the country. The resumption of studies in medical schools seeks to train physicians and increase the number of hands in the fight against the coronavirus. Learning institutions were shut down mid-March to contain the spread of the coronavirus. At least five public and private universities are currently holding lectures online. All institutions have also had to welcome thousands of new students in absentia, for the first time, through virtual orientation. The admissions mark the commencement of the 2020-21 academic year. All universities are expected to hold lectures online.
