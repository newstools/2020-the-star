Former Harambee Stars' player Paul Kiongera is relishing the prospect of challenging for the Kenyan Premier League title after he joined Sofapaka. Kiongera, who won the league title while at Gor Mahia, was confirmed at ‘Batoto Ba Mungu’ on Monday evening. “We are pleased to announce we have secured the signature of forward Paul Mungai Kiongera, a former Kenya International, Simba SC, Gor Mahia and AFC Leopards forward. He joins our striking department for the next two seasons,” read a statement from Sofapaka. The club further added: “Modo, as he is commonly referred to, has put pen to paper to a two-year deal with the club. He joins us from Wazito FC and becomes our fourth signing ahead of the new season. Welcome Kiongera.” The speedy striker with a nose for scoring spectacular goals has not been at his best in recent years even moving a notch down to the National Super League to try to rediscover the kind of form that made him the hottest property in Kenyan football six years ago. “I just have to focus on doing what comes naturally to me and that is scoring goals. We have a coach (John Baraza) who understands what a striker requires in every game and with the kind of players we have, I am confident I will enjoy my time at Sofapaka,” he said. Sofapaka remain desperate to add to the league title they won on their debut season in the top flight league 11 years ago. Sofapaka have also signed Wisdom Maya and Joel Nokueou from Lion Blesse in Ghana.
