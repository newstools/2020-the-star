Teenage goalkeeping sensation Samwel Silong is targeting at least 10 clean sheets in the new season. The 19-year old made his debut last season for USIU-Mashujaa and went on to keep five clean sheets and bagged the best goalkeeper’s award. Mashujaa finished sixth in the 10-team league. Silong was part of the 2018 Team Kenya to the Africa Youth Games in Algeria that also qualified and played in the Youth Olympics in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Silong hopes to perform well at Junior Hockey World Cup in September next year before graduating to the senior team. “Keeping five clean sheets in my first campaign and being awarded speaks volumes of the potential I have. I think I have adjusted to the demands of the league. I now look forward to doubling my clean sheets but I also learnt about respecting my opponents and being a step ahead of them,” said the Bachelor of Science in Finance second year student. The Kamusinga alumnus said training with the senior national team last year boosted his confidence. He hopes to learn from his mentor, Linus Sang, the undisputed Butali Warriors first-choice stopper and a Kenya international. “I trained with the senior last year, but I never  got a chance to play. However, I am optimistic I’ll scale to the senior set up if I continue working harder. I have a mentor, a friend and a coach in Sang. Most goalkeepers are good, but Sang is outstanding.” The budding player made his debut against Butali in a 3-3 all draw in a performance he termed as his best of the season. “The game against Butali was the toughest but it was my opportunity to shine. The first leg we drew 3-3 but the defending champions won 2-0 in the reverse fixture. I punched above my weight in the six-goal thriller and that’s when my name came to the limelight. Even the Butali chairman, Kamal Sambi sent a text message to congratulate me,” said Silong.
