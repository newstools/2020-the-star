Over 200 families have been rendered homeless after a fire at the Deep Sea slums, Parklands on Wednesday. Over 150 structures and property were razed in the inferno. Witnesses claim the fire broke out after an electrical fault in one of the houses. "It is common to hear electricity faults causing fires in this slum. Most electricity connections here are illegal so we are not safe," Martha Mweru, a resident said. Having lived in the informal settlement for 10 years, James Gachuki who was rendered homeless by the fire says that electricity faults have caused annual fires in the area. "Last year, the same thing happened and we spent two weeks in the cold. We are calling on the government to come to our rescue," he says. According to investigators at the scene, the cause of the fire is yet to be established.
