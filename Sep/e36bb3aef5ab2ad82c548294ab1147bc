Jubilee Party is in a sorry state. Jubilee is not operating like a political party should at the moment. In fact, we are not operating like a ruling party should. We are in total disarray. And we blame it on ourselves, we cannot blame anyone else for the mess we are in. It is upon us, as the party leadership, to put our house in order. We hope that very soon the party will have a proper parliamentary group meeting to look at the issues besetting it. The meeting will be very critical because it will offer members an opportunity to deliberate on issues troubling us and agree on the best way to push our party forward. I have heard secretary general Raphael Tuju imply that we, as Jubilee, are busy organising our party. Actually, I don't know where we are doing it from. First of all, we have no access to the party headquarters in Pangani. The Jubilee offices have been barricaded as if they are an armoury or a military operation zone. We don't know where Tuju says we are doing that from. It is unfortunate that as the ruling party, Jubilee is in shambles and yet we are doing nothing to salvage the situation. How do you reorganise the party without involving the 174 members of Parliament, the 28 senators, the governors and the more than 800 MCAs elected on the Jubilee ticket? We really need to look into ourselves as a party and agree if we need to move forward this way or sit down and reorganise our party. That is the reason why we opened the Jubilee Asili Centre, we have nowhere to sit and discuss party issues as members of Parliament. The Jubilee headquarters has been taken over. The Jubilee House is about seven floors; the party operates on three floors while four floors are occupied by people who are foreign to Jubilee Party. We don't know who those people are yet Jubilee pays the rent for the entire building. The Jubilee deputy secretary general and Soy MP spoke to the Star
