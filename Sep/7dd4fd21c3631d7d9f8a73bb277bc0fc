Emurua Dikirr MP Johana Ng'eno has dared his party Kanu to expel him over alleged misconduct after a recent slur against the President. Ng'eno said he does not fear being subjected to a by-election since he has the full support of his people and that if indeed the Kanu party officials were serious about it, they should go ahead and dismiss him. "I am much prepared for it and they can also field their candidate to run against me,” he said. The legislator said the by-election would provide a good opportunity for his party’s chairman Gideon Moi to weigh himself ahead of the 2022 presidential election. He, however, told Gideon to get ready for embarrassment. “I have severally heard him saying he is going for the top seat in 2022 and so this is his best chance to test his influence among the electorates. He will get only 200 votes,” he said. Speaking in Bomet, Ng'eno told the BBI proponents to bring on board all leaders, saying it was sad that some are being sidelined. “We want the process to be inclusive. We cannot be taking BBI to unite the country and at the same time fighting our colleagues… We must not be seen to be dividing the county on party or tribal lines. We want all communities to be united,” he said. The vocal ally of Deputy President William Ruto was elected on a Kanu ticket in 2017. He said his support for Ruto was unequivocal and that the region they will fully support him to ascend to power in 2022. He said they will support BBI only if the interests of the Kenyans are catered to. Edited by R.Wamochie
