Gospel singer Mercy Masika says most gospel musicians have turned the industry into a business. Posting on Instagram, she wrote, "The reason much of today’s music lacks inspiration and memorability is that people have blurred the lines and turned music into too much of a business. "It takes moral courage to remain true to inspire, impact and be true to who you are called to be. And even though remaining true may sometimes take time to pay, it pays very well. There’s a confidence that comes from being true." Masika was appointed the UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador last year. "I intend to utilise my role as UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador by relying on my faith as a child of God and my commitment to support people forced to flee," she said after the appointment.
