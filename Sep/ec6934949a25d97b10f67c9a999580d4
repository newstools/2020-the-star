Laikipia Governor Ndiritu Muriithi has threatened to expose senators who tried to extort money from him in exchange for a "fair grilling" before a Senate committee. The Senate had summoned the county chief to explain the management of county resources. Muriithi said he is willing to furnish the Directorate of Criminal Investigations and the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission with affidavits implicating the senators. "Indeed, it is true that a senator approached me asking for certain considerations and I rebuffed them. They said they would give me a hard time during the grilling session but I told them to do their worst. I told them I have been around for a long time and nobody would intimidate or threaten me. They were scrutinising the 2013-14 and 2014-2015 audited accounts," Muriithi said. He told journalists in his Nanyuki town office that some MPs and senators have over the years been extorting money from governors. The governor accused some committees of summoning governors to explain queries on auditor general's reports which were not timely only to demand bribes. Muriithi said the Senate has failed Kenyans by not resolving the stalemate on the revenue sharing formula. He said the ongoing calls to change the Constitution are a ploy to abolish county governments for regional ones. Muriithi said that senators are being pushed by self-interest and some 'forces' to starve counties of resources. A similar move was orchestrated in the 1960s to abolish the then regional governments, he said. "The proponents of changing the current Constitution prefer that counties die so that we go for regional governments. In the current devolution based on counties, the Constitution guarantees us a minimum of 15 per cent of national revenue but you can see a clear effort to defeat it," Muriithi said.
