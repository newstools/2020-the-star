Vihiga Governor Wilber Ottichilo has said he will contest for a second term in office. The governor had left residents guessing about his 2022 plans as he faced a tough political period, including impeachment threats. "We are heading into a campaign period. Please welcome and listen to those who will come to you, but remember I'm still the governor and I'm also coming for a second term," Ottichilo told residents in North East ward. He commissioned the construction of maternity wing at the Elukongo health centre in Emuhaya constituency for Sh5.5 million. The county chief said his track record of development shows that he is the best governor for Vihiga people. Ottichilo said pending bills were the major blow to his administration but he is expecting to clear them by 2021-2022 financial year. “The reason my administration had this dismal development was due to pending bills that didn’t give us much time to push our development agenda,” Ottichilo said. “We are almost finishing them and once we are done we are going to have tremendous development. Even Kakamega county will not be able to catch up with our pace.” Ottichilo applauded the Bunyore community for voting him in numbers in 2017. “My government is aiming at long term projects that will leave history to many once I'm done with my leadership,” Ottichilo said. Ottichilo has commissioned a granite factory in Emuhaya, fish firm in Luanda,  EPZ in Hamisi and construction of Munoiywa road that links Vihiga and Sabatia subcounties. The governor said the granite factory will create jobs for Bunyore residents and others. Senator George Khaniri and Sabatia MP Alfred Agoi have also declared interest in the seat.
