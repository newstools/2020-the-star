Northeastern regional commissioner Nicodemus Ndalana has warned politicians against creating new informal settlements in a bid to woo voters ahead of 2022. Speaking in Mandera town on Wednesday while inspecting Kazi Mtaani programme, Ndalana said the inter-clan clashes between Murule and Garre last month were caused by politicians putting up settlements in preparation for the 2022 elections. "Only the national security advisory council is mandated to approve new settlements in the region," Ndalana said. Last month, a committee was set up to end the fighting between the two communities. The 21-member team comprising elders from the two communities, officials from the county and national governments and the cohesion commission was created following days of peace talks. The stakeholders resolved that full implementation of 2005-2008 Umul and related accords should be implemented immediately. On Kazi Mtaani programme, Ndalana said engaging the youth will protect them from radicalisation and recruitment into terror cells. Edited by A.N
