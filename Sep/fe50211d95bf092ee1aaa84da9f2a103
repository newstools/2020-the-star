  Chelsea vs Liverpool 20.09.2020 18:30 Chelsea welcome champions Liverpool to Stamford Bridge on Sunday afternoon as both clubs look to build on their opening-game wins in the Premier League. We are expecting an exciting goalfest at Stamford Bridge. While Liverpool won the title last season, Chelsea have some catching-up to do, but being on home soil, they can make a statement. Chelsea have signed new players this summer although there are concerns regarding their defence-line, who will be facing an in-form Mo Salah, who scored a hat trick in their opening match. These sides last met on July 22, when Liverpool won 5-3 on Merseyside, and we expect similar entertainment this weekend. Head to Head 22.07.20 PL Liverpool Chelsea 5 : 3 03.03.20 FAC Chelsea Liverpool 2 : 0 22.09.19 PL Chelsea Liverpool 1 : 2 14.08.19 SC Liverpool Chelsea 3 : 2 (1 : 1) 14.04.19 PL Liverpool Chelsea 2 : 0  Arsenal vs West Ham 19.09.2020 22:00 Arsenal will be looking to build on a 3-0 win over Fulham when they take on West Ham United in yet another London derby. The Hammers manager, David Moyes, began the season badly with Saturday’s 2-0 defeat by Newcastle United. Mikel Arteta is on a quest to help the Gunners bring glory days back to the Emirates Stadium. With no doubt, his men have been making progress ever since he took over the reins at the club. In their last five games in the top flight, West Ham have conceded six goals while Arsenal have enjoyed themselves at home against Moyes’ men. In the previous five meetings at the Emirates Stadium, Arsenal have scored 12 goals, and there is a high probability that they will run riot while keeping a clean sheet on Saturday evening.

The Red Devils skipped the opening round as they were given a prolonged rest due to their participation in the later stages of Europa League, while the Eagles are eighth on the log with three points. Roy Hodgson’s men haven’t fared well since football returned behind closed doors, with only a solitary victory in their last six games. Palace began the season with a 1-0 win against Southampton thanks to Wilfried Zaha’s early goal. It was an impressive result for the Eagles, who had seven players out injured, including five defenders. Their defence is likely to face an even tougher test at Old Trafford, where Palace have collected four points from their last two visits. Manchester United most recent outing was in a friendly with Aston Villa, which the Red Devils lost 1-0. The team is now on a run of two back-to-back defeats, as their previous match was the loss to Sevilla in the semi-finals of Europa League. Just two of their last five encounters resulted in over 2.5 goals. It is in the same two matches that both sides managed to hit the back of the net. The visitors, however, are expected to emerge as victors, the odds about the hosts clinching a goal for themselves won’t be completely off the cards also.
