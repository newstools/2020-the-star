A parent who filed a petition seeking to compel Education CS George Magoha to reopen schools wants the case heard in open court. The petitioner has written his request to Chief Justice David Maraga. In a letter dated September 7, Joseph Aura says on August 25, 2020, Justice James Makau certified the matter as urgent and granted conservatory orders in the motion. Through lawyer Harrison Kinyanjui, the petitioner says that his request is made so that the public interest is maintained within the expectation of the constitutional principles. “Accordingly, the resort to a virtual hearing via Zoom or similar platforms may not meet this threshold, and it is expedient and imperative that the court furthers the larger public interest in the circumstances obtaining, hence our request for a hearing in open court,” Aura adds. Last month, Aura sought court's help to compel the government to issue directions on when schools will be reopened. Lawyer Kinyanjui argued that the prolonged open-ended closure of schools from March to date without any consultations with parents and guardians “is in violation of the Basic Education Act.” He also faulted Magoha for converting schools and learning institution’s to Covid-19 quarantine facilities. The lawyer urged the court to stop the move, saying it is in violation of Section 32 of the Public Health Act. He also wants “compensation of schoolgoing children by way of damages for the psychological suffering due to the closure. Schools in Kenya were closed in March when the first case of the coronavirus was confirmed. The institutions remain closed, with no indication on when exactly they will reopen.
