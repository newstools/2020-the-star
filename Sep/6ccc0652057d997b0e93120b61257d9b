Serie A top scorer Ciro Immobile has signed a contract extension that will keep the striker at Lazio until 2025, the club said on Monday. The 30-year-old Italy international scored a record-equalling 36 goals last season, matching Gonzalo Higuain’s haul for Napoli in 2015-16, as Lazio finished fourth in the standings to qualify for the Champions League. Immobile also ended the season five goals clear of the next leading scorer, Cristiano Ronaldo of Juventus. “Ciro Immobile has renewed his contract until 2025,” the club said on Twitter. The Serie A season starts on September 19. Last season was interrupted between March and June due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Meanwhile, twice former European champions Benfica were handed a tough match away to Greek side PAOK in the draw on Monday for the Champions League third qualifying round. Red Star Belgrade, the other former champions among the 16 teams in the hat, must travel to Cyprus to play Omonia Nicosia who surprisingly knocked out Legia Warsaw in the previous round. Dynamo Kiev will host Dutch side AZ Alkmaar and Ferencvaros entertain Dinamo Zagreb. As with the previous two qualifying rounds, the ties, which will be played on September 15-16, will be held over a single leg due to the difficulties of travelling amid the Covid-19 pandemic. They must also take place without spectators. Two teams have forfeited ties and been eliminated because of positive Covid-19 tests among their squad — Slovak champions Slovan Bratislava and Kosovo champions Drita.
