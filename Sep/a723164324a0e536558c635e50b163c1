Socialite-turned businesswoman Vera Sidika has denied claims she is dating Nigerian rapper Burna Boy. Rumours of the two dating started early this year after Vera Sidika visited Los Angeles, California. She shared photos of the expensive city, staying not in a hotel but one of the mansions in Hollywood Hills' leafy suburbs. She then shared photos and videos on her Instagram as she tested her ability with a firearm. Hours later, Burna Boy shared images at the same location, testing his abilities, too. This led to many speculating the two might have been together. Fans noticed even the booth was the same and concluded the posting at different times was a choreographed move. Well, speaking to comedian Jalas on his YouTube channel, Vera said they are friends. "Rumours are that you are dating Burna Boy," Jalas said. Vera laughed out loud. "Who told you to ask that? I am not dating Burna Boy, he has a girlfriend," she said, sipping water and wiping her face. "Rumours are always rumours, they will always be there." "There is someone else who is special and I am so happy I have even added 'happy' weight. I am in a relationship and very happy." Burna Boy is said to be dating British singer Stefflon Don.
