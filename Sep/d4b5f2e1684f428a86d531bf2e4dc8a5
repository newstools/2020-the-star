President Uhuru Kenyatta has congratulated Yoshihide Suga following his election as the new Prime Minister of Japan. Suga replaces Shinzo Abe who is stepping down on health grounds. In the congratulatory message to Suga, the President conveyed his best wishes and assured the new premier of Kenya's continued solidarity with Japan. "Please accept my warm congratulations on your victory and my best wishes for your success as you take up the responsibilities and duties of your high office as the new Prime Minister of Japan. "Excellency, as you embark upon your new responsibilities, I wish to assure you and the people of Japan of the continued friendship of the Government and people of Kenya," UhuruÂ  wrote. He said he looks forward to working with the new Japanese leader on deepening the existing strong bilateral relations between Kenya and the Asian nation. At the same time, President Kenyatta bid farewell to outgoing Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. In his message to PM Abe, the President thanked the outgoing Prime Minister for the development support Kenya received from Japan during his administration. "Excellency, allow me to take this opportunity to sincerely thank you for being an astute leader as well as a dependable partner in revitalizing the Kenya-Japan relations. "Indeed with support from the Government of Japan, Kenya has achieved a reduction in energy costs and improved transport and communication as well as power connectivity and availability throughout the country," Uhuru wrote. He said through the intervention of PM Abe, Kenya secured financial support for key infrastructure projects from Japan including several roads, renewable energy projects, water as well as the ongoing Special Economic Zone in Dongo Kundu in Mombasa County among other developments. The President thanked the outgoing premier for his visit to Kenya during the TICAD VI Conference in 2016, a gesture he said marked the highest point of the strong bilateral ties between Kenya and Japan.
