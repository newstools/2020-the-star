Kitui Woman Representative Irene Kasalu has urged girls in the county to abstain from sex to reduce cases of teenage pregnancies. The county has recorded more than 1,000 cases of early pregnancies since the Covid-19 closure of schools in March, she said. “I urge young girls to say no to all sexual advances by their male counterparts for whenever intimacy goes sour, the ladies are the ones on the losing end,” Kasalu said. The MP appealed to parents to be vigilant and take good care of their children. “I was shocked to learn that our girls who are below 18 years have been impregnated. I urge our parents to keep an eye on the girls now that schools are yet to reopen,” Kasalu said. The legislator had accompanied Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka to a funeral in Maseki area of Kyuso subcounty. She said it is time parents take full responsibility for their young girls. “It is sad seeing girls drop out of schools following pre-mature sex, please train them to say no,” Kasalu said.
