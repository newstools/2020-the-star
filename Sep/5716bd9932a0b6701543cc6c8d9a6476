The Westgate terror suspects have complained of the 'harsh' prison conditions as they await sentencing over the attack that left 67 dead in 2013. In the case, Mohammed Ahmed, Liban Abdullahi and Hussein Mustafa were charged with giving support to a terrorist group. Mohammed on Friday told the court that he needs blankets because it's very cold in prison while Abdullahi complained of the bad diet asking the court to intervene. He claimed that the porridge he is given does not have sugar. "Kwa sasa nakunya uji na mkate na maziwa kidogo,niko na shida na maharagwe na skuma," he added. The third accused also complained that he cannot see well. Chief Magistrate Francis Andayi told the accused persons that the judgement was not ready and will be delivered next month. The judgement was postponed to October 5. The Magistrate directed officials of Kamiti to appear in court and explain the allegations by the accused. "None of the accused persons seems to have a serious medical issue. They appear to be well even as the third accused person says he's not able to see well. The prisoner in charge is hereby called to address those issues and file a report in court," Andayi ruled. "The report is expected to be filed in 10 days of how he has addressed the complainants raised by the accused persons."
