A section of members of the National Assembly Security Committee want Deputy President William Ruto to personally apologise to President Uhuru Kenyatta and his family over attacks on the head of state by his allies. The six members, led by chairman and Kiambaa MP Paul Koinange, on Tuesday said that while Ruto has condemned the attacks by MPs Oscar Sudi and Johana Ng'eno, it is not enough. The other MPs are: Peter Kaluma (Homa Bay Town), Roza Buyu (Kisumu), Benard Mulu (Kitui Central), Wavinya Washira (Mwea) and Edward Kaunya (Teso North). According to the group, Sudi and Ng'eno are Ruto's mouthpiece and thus the DP should personally apologise to the first family. "We are glad that our Deputy President William Ruto has condemned the remarks made by Oscar Sudi. But that is not enough because the two MPs are believed by the general public to have been mere mouthpieces," Koinange said. He added, "DP Ruto should apologise to the President, his family and the entire nation in person and not through Twitter." The MPs condemned the attack on the President, saying that it was not only against African culture but also the worst form of disrespect. They called on the NCIC to be watchful and tame leaders who are beating the drums of war ahead of the 2022 polls. "Even if Sudi does not respect the president, he should at least respect the President's family, most all his mother. Mama Ngina Kenyatta is not only a senior citizen by age but also the founding mother and First Lady of Kenya," Koinange said. "We would like to alert NCIC and all relevant agencies of government that war drums have started beating. The war drums will only grow louder and may risk the stability of the nation as we approach the General Election if not immediately contained," he said. The chairman called on the commission to move with speed against Sudi and Ng'eno and all the other leaders engaging in hate speech and endangering cohesion of the nation.
