The CAS disputed claims of a second wave of the pandemic in the country due to the high number of deaths reported. "There is no second wave in the country.The day that situation will become emergence, rest assured the Cabinet Secretary will be here telling you that indeed now we are in the second wave," she said. "A second wave is a technical issue. Defining a second wave will require collaboration and consult with WHO for us to say Kenya is now on it's second wave."
