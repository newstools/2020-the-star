Migori police are holding an ex-chief who allegedly burnt his aunt’s house in revenge after his three-year-old daughter was allegedly defiled by her uncle, a minor. The man from Uriri subcounty came home on Saturday to find his daughter had been defiled by her 14-year-old uncle, his cousin, police said. “When he came home he found that his cousin had defiled his daughter and gone into hiding. It happened an hour earlier," neighbour Jared Alila said. Alila said after taking his daughter to a hospital and reporting the crime, the father went drinking before going to the suspect's house. He torched the house of the suspect's aunt, a single-room mud-walled structure, the neigbour said. Nobody was injured. Subcounty police commander Peter Njoroge said when police arrived at the scene, they found the family had already dragged out the suspect and the angry ex-chief was seated in the compound. “He was at the scene and was still drunk when he was arrested by police. The suspected defiler was also arrested,” he said. The police boss said both suspects are being held at thei police station. He said the suspected defiler will face charges and the girl's father will face arson charges. “We are still investigating both cases. The victim was discharged from hospital," Njoroge said. He said the police are on alert as the family may escalate tension over the defilement and fire. (Edited by V. Graham)
