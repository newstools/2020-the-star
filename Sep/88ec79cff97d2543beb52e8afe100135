Shujaa and Kenya Lionesses will benefit from the World Rugby’s Sh250 million investment to help them prepare for the Olympic Games next year. Each union that had qualified a team to the Tokyo 2020 games is  supposed to apply for funding towards rugby sevens squad training camps, competition and technical, sports science and medical programmes. According to World Rugby, the funding comes as collaborative contingency for the HSBC World Rugby Sevens Series 2021 and  the delivery of the remaining 2021 men’s and women series events. The governing body also announced that the World Sevens Series events in Hamilton and Sydney earlier slated for January next year will not take place due to the Covid-19 pandemic. “The decisions were taken in line with relevant government and international public health authority advice with the health and well-being of the rugby community and the wider public as top priority,” the statement said in part. WR revealed that the planning for the Olympic repechage final qualification event in the first half of 2021 is ongoing. With 21 out of 24 teams already qualified for the Olympics, the remaining two women and one men’s spot will be determined in the final qualification round.
