A court in Nairobi has quashed the conviction and sentencing of a defilement suspect after a magistrate in Tigania failed to allow him to recall witnesses after the charge sheet was amended. Delivering his ruling on August 20, Justice David Majanja ruled that the trial court failed to give the appellant a chance to recall the child and witnesses who had testified either to give evidence afresh or to be cross-examined. Silas Mwangi alias Kiamwangi Araya was initially charged with two counts of defilement and attempted defilement on May, 24, 2017. The trial court heard that on the day of the alleged offence in Tigania East subcounty within Meru, Mwangi defiled two children aged seven and four years. But after the testimony adduced in court by three witnesses the charge sheet was amended. On August, 14, 2018 Tigania senior resident magistrate G Sogomo found Mwangi guilty and sentenced him to 30 years imprisonment to run concurrently on both counts. The two complainants had testified how they were having lunch with other children when Mwangi arrived and chased away the other children. He then ordered the two children to accompany him to his house where he forced them into his bed and defiled them one after the other. Mwangi threatened to beat them up if they did not comply. A  boda boda rider saved the two children from the attacker. The boda boda operator passed by Mwangi’s house and heard the children crying and calling for help. He tried opening the door but it was locked from inside. He then kicked the door open and Mwangi came out with a machete and chased him away. Mwangi denied the charges and said that the two children were stealing bananas from his farm, and when he went to speak to them they fled.
