Taita Taveta county is expected to resume collecting levies and taxes imposed on agricultural goods entering its markets. Trade executive Vumi Ringo said a three-month waiver given to cushion traders from the effects of Covid-19 has expired. She told traders in Voi that the taxes collected will ensure proper service delivery. They include produce cess to be levied on all tradable agricultural commodities and market levies. “The government is out to ensure that no trader is oppressed. We intend to use the levies to improve services in the department,” she said. Hundreds of traders depend on the sale of vegetables, cereals and other agricultural products across the county. Governor Granton Samboja waived the taxes in June to ease the economic burden placed on small scale traders and farmers. Finance and Economic Planning executive Andrew Kubo said plans are underway to improve roads while ensuring sanitation and security is reinforced in markets. He proposed a post-Covid-19 recovery stimulus package targeting the traders. “I urge all market committees to consult so we can advance the execution of this proposal,” Kubo said on Monday. Meanwhile, Deputy Governor Majala Mlagui reaffirmed the government’s commitment to empowering women groups to boost the county’s economy. Speaking separately in Mwatate, Mlagui urged women to adopt craft economy, especially basketry. She said weaving is a strong tradition that has great opportunities, especially with the internationally recognised Taita Basket Intellectual Property Mark. “Understanding market trends, clientele preferences and digital online marketing in addition to the traditional basics of basket weaving will create highly marketable products,” she said.
