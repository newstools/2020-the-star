Residents said they endured frequent power outages before but for the past three weeks, the blackout has become a huge concern. Sadiki Ali Shughuli said the situation has jeopardised security in the area. He said an acute water shortage has has been experienced as a result of the blackout. “Our lives are at stake because we fear for diseases knowing that we consume water from untreated streams and wells,” he said. Shughuli said electricity-pumped boreholes are no longer functioning due to lack of power. The residents said a big percentage of business activities have been paralysed after incurring losses. They said storage foods like cold drinks, meat, vegetable and many more can’t be sold. Services like welding, photocopy and printing have stalled, too. Saidi Mnyeto said they have sought help from the respective offices without success.

We can’t continue to suffer like this yet we have a government,” he said. Ali Weko said mosques and churches services have been highly interrupted by the power problems.
