A former senior insurance manager has been sentenced to three years in jail without the option of a fine after being convicted of stealing over Sh62 million from his employer. While sentencing Lincolin Kivuti Njeru, Milimani Chief Magistrate Francis Andayi said the former assistant general manager with Insurance Company East Africa (ICEA) stole the money as opposed to his defence which said that “it was an investment loss.” At the same time, the magistrate rejected a probation report which sought to have the accused be given a non-custodial sentence. Andayi said that huge money was lost and only Sh10 million was recovered. The convict was sentenced to three years on each count adding to a total of nine years but the sentence will run concurrently.
