A man charged with possession of wildlife trophy was unlucky on Monday when he camped at the court gate with flour like substance, which he splashed on a magistrate’s car so that he could adjourn his case. The substance was reportedly ‘juju’ (witchcraft) Unfortunately, however, — so to say – the suspect splashed it on the wrong magistrate! We would not be able to know if that was the reason, but his case was not adjourned. Instead, when his sentencing came up, he was slapped with a 12-year jail term. "Your honour, I am not ready to proceed. Give me14 days to prepare," he told the magistrate. In a rejoinder, the magistrate told him that the ruling was ready and gave him time to mitigate. In his mitigation he said his wife was sickly, and that he is the breadwinner and a family man. Well, that, too, didn’t help. *** A suspect engaged a magistrate in Nairobi in a hearing date battle this week. "Please push it further. I received my witness statements some 10 minutes ago. Push it even to next year," she told a Kibera Magistrate. "Unfortunately, we cannot push it to next year. We must hear it this year and again, I expected you to request for a near date so that you can move out of prison?" the magistrate posed.. "But by then I will have gotten out of the prison," she responded. The magistrate directed the case to proceed on October 22. *** Well one gets to hear interesting stuff in court, some surprising. A 16-year-old boy was arraigned in a Kibera court for allegedly robbing a DCI officer his Oppo phone. Normally, you’d expect a detective to be armed but ironically, the minor is accused of using a kitchen knife to steal from the cop. The phone valued at Sh30,000. The minor is said to have snatched the said phone from the officer’s hands who shouted for help. We are waiting to see how the case goes on October 22.
