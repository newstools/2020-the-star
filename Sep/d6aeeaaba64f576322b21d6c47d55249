A Congolese man is the third suspect in Kevin Omwenga's murder. Yatha Josue was arraigned before Magistrate Sinkiyian Tobiko on Thursday as police sought seven days to detain him in connection with the murder. It is alleged that his phone - a Samsung A10 - which was recovered by the police was used to communicate with the suspects during and after the offence. However, the court declined to detain him and instead ordered him to deposit a Sh100,000 cash bail. Tobiko ordered him to avail himself before the investigating officer whenever required until the conclusion of the probe against him.The court ruled that there were no compelling reasons to detain Josue. His lawyer Samson Nyaberi had opposed to client being detained. Eariler, it emerged Galana Suites, where Omwenga stayed, and the vehicles he owned were fully paid for by Glo Jet company associated with Businessman Chris Obure. In an affidavit to oppose Obure's bail, police said investigations and evidence have shown that the businessman and the deceased knew each other even though he denied it. "Investigations and documentary evidence have shown that although Obure had denied having any business or a strong relationship with the deceased, there is strong evidence that Omwenga's apartment and vehicles he claimed to own were fully paid for by Glo Jet a company that Obure has leadership authority in," the affidavit reads. It is further alleged that Obure is a team leader with aspects of leadership at Glo Jet International and has his offices at Senteu Plaza where police believe he exercises full decision making responsibility. Sgt Bashir Boya said they believe that Obure and his bodyguard Robert Bodo acted jointly in the murder of Kevin Omwenga. Boya says the fact that Obure allowed his bodyguard Bodo to access his firearm in a safe clearly indicates that they were in a joint endeavour to have his gun used in the shooting that led to Omwenga's death.
