More than 4,800 homesteads across Mwingi West subcounty in Kitui are set to receive electricity by 2021. The move was geared by many complaints in the constituency where most transformers had failed without replacement and other areas had not received connections at all. MP Charles Nguna presented the concerns to the National Assembly and the government through the Energy ministry promised Sh400 million to enable electricity connection across Mwingi West. “We have witnessed blackouts and they take years before they are fixed,” Nguna said. He stated that he will prioritise connectivity in primary and secondary schools to ensure learning is made easier even at night. Kenya Power Northeastern regional manager David Mutito who had accompanied the MP on a fact-finding mission confirmed that the concerns were factual. “We have witnessed that most market centres in Mwingi West have no electricity while other areas totally lack connectivity,” Mutito said. The manager said the complaints will soon be addressed. “In areas where transformers have failed, the issues will be addressed in the course of two weeks but in areas where there is no connectivity at all, it might take a bit of time,” he said. The leaders spoke at Masaani during a tour to nine market centres across the subcounty which have not received electricity to date. The visit brought some excitement among members of the public in Masaani who were hopeful they will soon have electricity. “If our market centre had electricity, some of us would be self-employed as we would start welding jobs, cybercafé jobs among other small business to improve our livelihoods during this harsh economic time,” Musee Mutia, a youth, said.
