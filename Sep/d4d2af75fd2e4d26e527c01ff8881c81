The 'Kiss on the Road' campaign with Kamene Goro and Jalang'o on Thursday was awarding three winners with a shopping voucher of Sh20,000 from Naivas supermarkets. They also awarded over 30 fans and customers with vouchers worth Sh5,000 each at three Naivas branches inÂ  Mountain View, Buruburu and Airport View. One of the three lucky winners was Stacy who said she would be shopping for her mum as she has always supported her. "I decided to nominate my mother because she has been there for me and been very supportive and I hope she will be proud and happy," Stacy said. Her sister who accompanied her added that it has been an uphill task to raise her two siblings, especially with the COVID-19 situation. "I am sure she will appreciate and she deserves it. Thank you, KissFM." Mila, nominated by her boyfriend, said she was asleep when Kiss FM called. "I was surprised and I didn't even believe it. I am so excited he picked me among all his friends and I am very thankful. I am expecting to have fun and shop today with Kamene and Jalas." Mwago Julius nominated his mother saying she deserves nothing but the best. "I hope it will make her feel appreciated and it will make her happy because she deserves it," Mwago said. "Kisses of Kindness" started at Naivas Mountain View where Kamene and Jalas engaged the Naivas crew in the Jerusalema challenge. The first winner shopped there.
