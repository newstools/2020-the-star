Kenya Rugby Union has advertised the National Under-20 head coach position. To qualify, one must be Kenyan resident with a minimum of four years experience as a coach at club level or at a school side with an outstanding success record. World Rugby Level 2 coaching certification in either sevens or 15â€™s rugby will be a distinct advantage. Applications can be submitted to the KRU chief executive officer by October 10. Applicants are also required to attach all world rugby certifications and CV with a well articulated coaching philosophy. The responsibilities of the successful coach will include handling the U-20 squad and managing performance programme to ensure the selected players are best equipped to compete and perform in international assignments. His other roles see him coordinate overall game strategy, technical approach and supervise the training programs. Kenya Simbas head coach Paul Odera has been handling the junior side for the past three seasons. He was in charge of the team during the World Junior Trophy in Brazil last year after winning the African qualifier by beating Namibia 21-18. Odera was to lead the team this year to the Africa Under-20 event but the championship was cancelled due to the outbreak of the Covid 19 pandemic. Previous coaches, who have handled the team before include former Kenya sevens international Mitch Ocholla and former Homeboyz tactician Paul Murunga.
