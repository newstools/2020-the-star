More than 200 sacked employees of Tuskys Eldoret supermarket demonstrated on the Eldoret-Uganda highway on Wednesday, demanding two months' back wages. They said they were being wrongfully terminated, called in the night and told to collect termination letters. They claimed low-wage workers are secretly being hired to replace them. They waved placards and blew whistles, saying they would protest until they are paid. "We want our money, we will demonstrate for the entire week until we are paid our dues," one demonstrator said. One placard read, "Obey court orders since July. We demand justice. Stop unlawful redundancies and terminations of over 200 employees." Fred  Magatia said they want their two months' salary, adding that paying rent has become difficult. He said sales used to be very high and management has no reason to send them home without their dues. "We  worked honestly for the 10 years but right now we heard they are employing other people secretly while we continue to suffer," Magatia said. He said lack of money has ruined some marriages and sometimes children are forced to go to bed hungry. Fred Chirchir told the press they were called at night and told to collect their termination letters. He said some former employees had been given post-dated cheques that they doubt will be honoured. Last week, the struggling retailer received the first tranche of the Sh2 billion capital injection from an undisclosed Mauritius-based fund, giving hope to the cash-strapped family business. The retailer is under pressure to clear supplier debt and pay salary arrears, while some managers are leaving. Chief Executive Dan Githua says the disbursement of more than Sh500 million will cover immediate working capital requirements including partial settlements to staff, suppliers and landlords, among others. Tuskys has blamed its financial troubles on Covid-19 and containment measures such as travel restrictions and curfew. (Edited by V. Graham)
