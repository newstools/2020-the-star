ODM leader Raila Odinga on Wednesday reiterated that the push for referendum change is still on course and the changes are inevitable. Addressing a public rally at Mghange Nyika, Raila said the reforms are meant to streamline the system of governance through the Building Bridges Initive (BBI). "Some people thought that we had given up, we are back from half time and reggae is officially back. BBI is unstoppable," Raila said. He is in the county for a two-day tour. Raila was accompanied by Taita Taveta Governor Granton Samboja,Deputy Governor Majala Mlagui, Voi MP Johnes Mlolwa among other leaders. He is expected to address public rally in Bura Mission and Mghange Nyika before attending a private meeting with county leaders at Samboja's Mwakishimba home. He said those opposing the BBI report have personal interests, further accusing them of hater mongering. "Some quarters are already afraid of the coming wave of change. They are the same politicians spreading hate, tribal and divisive politics," Raila added. His statement comes following the arrest of Emurua Dikirr MP Johanna Ng'eno who was charged over divisive comments he made against President Uhuru Kenyatta and his family over the weekend. His Kapsaret counterpart on Wednesday said he would not apologise for strong comments he made against the President, insisting he had done nothing wrong. Raila further asked the Ethics and Anti-corruption Corruption Commission ( EACC) to prosecute leaders accused of graft. Samboja in his address said his administration will closely work with the national government to implement development projects. He urged residents to support the BBI report.
