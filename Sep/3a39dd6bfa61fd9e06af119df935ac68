The country was treated to a disturbing show on September 13 when a woman gave birth at the gate of Pumwani Maternity Hospital. So uninviting was the incident that the Nairobi Metropolitan Services made a public apology, and pledged to erect a raft of ambitious measures to tame a recurrence of such inhuman occurrence. It is a relief that despite the traumatic experience, mother and child are both doing well. That said, it is inexcusable that Kenyans still face such harsh routes before they access medical care, seven years into the Jubilee regime. This is a government that rode on the platform of accessible and affordable medical care to all in its campaigns. Two years after the launch of the Universal Health Coverage pilot in 2018, it is shameful that our healthcare actors have to engage in industrial action for their basic issues to be addressed. The Pumwani incident offers two critical lessons. First, it should stimulate a special discourse between national and county governments on the running of healthcare facilities. It is time the two governments left politics out of their relations, teamed up and worked in unison for the seamless flow of services to the people.
