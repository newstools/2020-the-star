Athletics Kenya is seeking to popularise Mountain Running in the country. AK’s Mountain Running coordinator, Peter Angwenyi, said the athletics governing body will train officials and coaches in a bid to strengthen mountain running presence in the country. “We are also planning to sensitise athletes across the country on mountain running activities,” added Angwenyi, who is also the AK Nyanza South region chairman and a former AK national public relations officer. He said AK is lining up a series of Mountain Running events next year as part of the preparations for World Mountain Running and World Long Distance Mountain Running Championships. “We want to have about five events which will be in the AK calendar,  culminating in national trials for the World Mountain Running and World Long Distance Mountain Running Championships,” Angwenyi added. The 2020 World Mountain Running and the World Long Distance Mountain Running championships earlier scheduled for November 13 and 14 were cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic. Angwenyi regretted the decision but said safety of all those involved in the event comes first. He said Kenya had already entered a preliminary team of 24 for the events. “We were ready for the event but because of the coronavirus pandemic, the event has been cancelled,” he said. Angwenyi asked athletes to continue training for upcoming Mountain Running events. “We are likely to have a local event in Longonot in November once AK  approves the date,” Angwenyi said. At the same time, Angwenyi added that the second edition of the Meru County Mountain Running Championship will be held on February 20 next year.
