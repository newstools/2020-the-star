A ferocious war of words has broken out within the Jubilee government. On one hand, the Jubilee vice chairman David Murathe has been pressing William Ruto to resign as Deputy President and has accused him of corruption over the Weston Hotel and Ruai land. Now Ruto is accusing bankrupt Jubilee 'consultants' of having become billionaires since 2013. Ruto alleges that the Kemsa scandal demonstrates rottenness in Jubilee when he has been forced to the fringes of the administration. This debate is not healthy. It is exaggerated and distorted. While there may be wrongdoing, on both sides, it is being blown out of proportion to seek electoral advantage before the 2022 election. Kenya cannot afford to have the governing party discredit itself with internal mudslinging for the next two years. Jubilee still has much work to do and not much will happen if party leaders are just obsessed with destroying each other. President Uhuru Kenyatta should stop his party members washing their dirty linen in public. He should stop the infighting and get the party to focus on government until six months before the election. Then let the politicians say whatever they want.
