Environment CS Keriako Tobiko will on Saturday preside over the World Clean Up day at the City Park. The day is an annual event celebrated every third Saturday of September and is aimed at combating global solid waste problem including marine debris. Nairobi Metropolitan Service DG Mohammed Badi, Governor Mike Sonko, Environment PS Dr Chris Kiptoo, CAS Mohammed Elmi, Nema board chair John Konchellah and Nema DG Mamo Mamo are expected to preside over the event. The event comes a few months after City Park was wrestled from the management of the Nairobi County and placed under Kenya Forest Service. On August 1 President Uhuru Kenyatta announced a national clean up campaign to boost the country’s environmental conservation efforts. The President said the campaign dubbed ‘Cleaning Up Kenya Campaign’ shall be led by cadres of the National Government Administration Officers. “The Campaign shall be anchored on the National Government Administration Officers at the local level who shall work together with the local communities and with stakeholders both within and outside of Government to enhance environmental restoration, conservation and management,” the President said. The Head of State pointed out that the campaign fits within the ongoing ‘Kazi Mtaani Programme’ and shall complement the efforts being made towards the improvement of environmental and sanitation conditions at the grassroots level. “Within the Cleaning Up Kenya Campaign, Chiefs are encouraged to proactively involve vulnerable members of their local communities and marginalized groups such as Women, Youth and Persons Living with Disabilities,” he said. President Kenyatta spoke during the launch of the Michuki Memorial Park in Nairobi County. The Park is named in honour of the late former Minister John Michuki who played a key role in the clean up of Nairobi River and its environs during his tenure as the Minister for Environment.
