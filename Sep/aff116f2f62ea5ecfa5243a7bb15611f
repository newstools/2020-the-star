Former Nairobi Stima captain Joseph Shikokoti could be headed for a second stint at Ushuru after agreeing personal terms with the club. The towering defender and his Stima team-mates were served with a shocker after their employer terminated their contracts last month, thanks to the exit of their shirt sponsor Kenya Power and Lighting Company, rendering them free agents. However ,despite having a number of offers from top flight clubs,the former Tusker man is likely to remain in the National Super League where he has been for the last four years now. The experienced defender revealed that he had agreed everything with Ushuru who are already deemed as favourites for promotion in the new season and is anticipating to be handed the contract in the coming weeks. "I have agreed personal terms with Ushuru whom we have been in talks with for some time now.I am likely to sign the contract next week or the subsequent one," said the former Harambee Stars defender. Besides pursuing Shikokoti,the taxmen are understood be to be pursuing the duo of Shela Mandela and Levian Ochieng who were also in Stima's books last season. Mandela, a former FC Talanta player was Shikokoti's partner at the heart of Stima's defence while Ochieng was the first choice left back.
