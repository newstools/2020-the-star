Kikwetu Festival, Kenya’s first socially distanced outdoor concert, will be held at the Carnivore on October 1-4. The theme is 'The Drive-In Experience'. Attendees will drive into the venue and enjoy the music either from inside their cars or in private viewing areas that are two meters apart. The festival aims to lead the revival of the cultural, entertainment and event industry, which took a hit from the coronavirus pandemic. It also aims to increase visibility and accessibility of live Kenyan music, develop skills and opportunities for those in the music industry, and strengthen networking for artists. Event organisers said, "This is the first socially distanced show of its kind and the first to be backed by the government. We are happy to be leading the way and, it’s a huge plus for Kenyan music and the industry at large."
