"We have called the Health Ministry and Kemsa and now we are in counties to investigate how the funds were utilised and in what ways," vice chairman Joshua Kutuny told the media on Friday in Kisumu. Committee members have also visited Eldoret and Mombasa on fact-finding missions. The committee consulted leaders, obtained documentation and visited the Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital. Kutuny said Kisumu has been allocated more than Sh160 million to fight the virus and lawmakers want to know exactly how the funds were spent and where. "We are happy they have given us documents and told us the total amount already spent and where. As a committee we will confirm if this is the case as presented in the documents," Kutuny said. He assured residents the committee will conduct a thorough investigation and "will stand firm and truthful" during the process.
