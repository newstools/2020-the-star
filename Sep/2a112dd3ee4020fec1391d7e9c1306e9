Kenyan champions Gor Mahia yesterday rubbished reports, suggesting that they were seeking a new coach to succeed Steven Polack. Gor have in the recent days been rumoured to be preparing to bring on board a new tactician ahead of the new season. However, the club's new treasurer Dolfina Odhiambo said Polack is still in charge and there are no plans to hire a new gaffer yet. Gor's management was said to have began perusing through profiles of coaches who had applied for the job from Thursday last week. Additionally, the club was reported to have sidelined Polack in signing new players with his assistant Patrick Odhiambo and team manager Jolawi Obondo offering technical advice and recommendations to the management. Gor have so far unveiled 11 players who include four foreigners from the time the transfer window opened and are expected to be bring in at least three more. Efforts to reach Polack who won three coach of the month awards last season were futile. Polack joined the club last year to succeed Hassan Oktay who left unceremoniously after the 2018-2019 season came to an end. "The office no intention to hire a new coach. Polack has not tendered a letter indicating that he has resigned neither has the management laid him off his duties. He and his assistant were fully involved in the player transfer and we are looking forward to the new season. If at all the management will need a new coach, we may not advertise the job since there were a host of applications last year, " she said.
