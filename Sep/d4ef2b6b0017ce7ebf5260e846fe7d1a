Nyamira county staff have lamented the decision to delay their August salaries. The county government said they will have to wait a little longer. In a circular, county secretary James Ntabo blamed their predicament on the delay by the National Treasury to release funds. “This is to bring to your attention that the Department of Finance and economic planning shall not be able to process and pay the August 2020 staff salaries in time. This has been caused by the delay in the disbursement of funds from the National Treasury to the county governments, hence affecting operations in the counties,” Ntabo said. “We know this will cause delays in paying the county government workers. We, therefore, request patience and understanding from Nyamira county employees.” But employees who spoke to the Star on condition of anonymity said the delay will hurt them as most of them are already struggling during this coronavirus crisis. "We will be affected by the delay of salaries for the month. We have bills that we are supposed to take care of. The effects of the delayed payments will have a great impact on all of us,” said one employee in the company of his colleagues. The county government has promised to do everything possible to address the challenges affecting service delivery, especially delayed salaries.
