Kapseret MP, Oscar Sudi on Friday promised the High Court in Nakuru that he will not utter any inciting words before investigations into his case are over. He spoke when he appeared before Justice Joel Ngugi for the inter parte hearing of his review application. Sudi wants the decision to hold him at the Nakuru Central Police Station for a further seven days reviewed. The MP who has been in custody since last Sunday will know his fate this afternoon when Ngugi will deliver a ruling on his revision application. Sudi moved to the higher court on Thursday to contest his seven-day detention at the Nakuru Police Station. He asked Justice Ngugi to release him on reasonable bail terms. Friday's defense team led by Lawyer Nelson Havi said there were no grounds to further hold their client. He urged the court to release him on a free bond. The prosecution on the other hand maintained that Sudi has a great influence 'on the ground' and would interfere with investigations. It urged the High Court to impose tough conditions in the event he is released on bond specifically barring him from issuing an inciting statement. The lower court ordered Sudi's detention until next week Wednesday on grounds that his custody would ensure public order, peace and security. However, in his application before the High Court, Sudi said his detention was unconstitutional and a denial of his fundamental rights to liberty and fair hearing. Sudi said by the lower court finding that his utterances amounted to hate speech that triggered demonstrations, it assumed him guilty even before he was charged.
