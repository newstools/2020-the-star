The Migori county assembly on Tuesday deferred tabling of Governor Okoth Obado’s impeachment motion over "anxiety on flouting of Covid 19 rules". On Tuesday, tension was high in Migori county assembly as a contingent of armed police officers and vehicles manned the premises and surrounding area. “There was anxiety so I saw it better to push it. The Covid-19 regulations in the assembly were also not followed,” Boaz Okoth, the Migori speaker, said. The only business conducted was reopening the assembly, which had been on recess since August 6 and a speech from speaker. The assembly will resume on Wednesday morning, and it is still not clear if Obado’s ouster motion will be inthe agenda. Okoth said the motion was not tabled on Tuesday, and it was not clear when it will be brought to the House. “The motion will not come today, that is a process. We believe the heavy contingent of police officers and media in the assembly is because they have been misled from Nairobi,” Okoth said. There was tension among MCAs as they both struggled to enter the chamber despite the social distance rules placed to curb spread of Covid 19. Some MCAs and members of the press were forced to sit in the assembly cafeteria to follow the live proceeding, which an anti-climaxed in five minutes.
