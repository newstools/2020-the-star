@robertomollo3 Two judges will be deployed to Homa Bay to handle environment and employment disputes, Chief Justice David Maraga has said. The Labour Court will serve residents from Homa Bay, Nyamira, Migori and Kisii who currently have to travel to Kisumu for such services. Homa Bay residents currently travel to Migori for environment and land matters. “Two judges will be posted here to handle cases on employment and labour relations, and another one will hear cases on land and environment. We’re going to do it as soon as possible,” Maraga said in Oyugis on Friday. He did not commit to whether the judges will be based at the Oyugis or Homa Bay law courts. Maraga said he had heard residents' requests on the establishment of the two courts, which are crucial for the administration of justice. Maraga was accompanied to open new Oyugis law courts buildings by Kasipul MP Ong’ondo Were, Registrar of Judiciary Anne Amadi, Homa Bay-based High Court judge Joseph Karanja and county commissioner Moses Lilan. MP Were urged the Judiciary to upgrade Oyugis magistrate’s court to a high court to enhance the administration of justice. He called on the Judicial Service Commission to recruit more magistrates for the court. “Currently, we have only two magistrates in Oyugis court, yet the court serves people from Kasipul, Kabondo Kasipul and Karachuonyo constituencies. More magistrates would be of great help to residents,” Were said. The MP urged the Judiciary to upgrade the mobile court in Kendu Bay town to decongest Oyugis court. “Upgrading the mobile court will reduce the backlog of cases in Oyugis town,” the MP added.
