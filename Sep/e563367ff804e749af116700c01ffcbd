Limuru MP Peter Mwathi has backed Education CS George Magoha's mixed signals about when the schools will be reopened following closure to contain the coronavirus. Mwathi said the CS was keen on ensuring the government and the stakeholders are well prepared to ensure the coronavirus does not spread among learners. "Do not treat him [Magoha] so harshly. It is only that he hopes this disease will be controlled," the MP said. Mwathi called upon leaders and education stakeholders to ensure schools' hygiene standards have been improved to assure parents that their children will be safe. He said some schools require additional classrooms, desks, tanks, handwashing bays for each class and at the toilets among other needs. "We must ensure that our schools are as safe as our homes are to stop the coronavirus from spreading. As we listen to the government, let us also participate even with ideas," he said. Mwathi applauded universities and colleges for adopting virtual learning so that students may cover the syllabus. He said that early last week, he issued Sh3.5 million in bursaries to university and college students. "Others who will be asked by their higher learning institutions to learn virtually will be considered for bursaries," he promised. The lawmaker also asked leaders not to call meetings to drive their own agenda, since the government has not given a green light that the coronavirus has been eradicated in this country. "It is very unfortunate that it is leaders who are the ones who are calling for meetings contrary to Health CS Mutahi Kagwe and President Uhuru Kenyatta's instructions not to hold public gatherings," Mwathi said. The MP asked the government to use teargas and disperse such gatherings. However, locals have asked President Uhuru to issue new instructions and ensure they have been followed so as to ensure the Covid-19 disease is controlled.
