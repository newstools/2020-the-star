Go and insult your mothers and leave mine alone, President Uhuru Kenyatta said on Thursday as he hit back at politicians who attacked former First Lady Mama Ngina Kenyatta. "I am on my way to inspect a road down here... We are building a road that will connect Nairobi... go through Kiambu... then Murang'a and up to Nyeri... I told you that I am only interested in work...," he said. "Even if I am young, I have no problem going home as long as people see the work that I have done. These fools who are going around throwing insults, tell them to go insult their mothers and leave mine alone..." Uhuru who was speaking in his Kikuyu dialect said leaders must work on the unity and peace of the country. ".. I will not allow myself to speak in anger as I just want Kenyans to stay together in peace," he said on Wednesday evening in Ruaka. "The country will stay forever but we as people will one day not exist." This comes after Emurua Dikirir MP Johanna Ngâ€™eno and Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi were recorded uttering unsavoury remarks against President Uhuru Kenyatta. Ng'eno was later arrested on Monday evening by police officers over claims of incitement. "You are not Kenya and Kenya is nor Kenyatta's or Mama Ngina's land. This land belongs to 47 million Kenyans, you cannot run it as you wish," Ng'eno said. Later, MP Oscar Sudi also condemned the war against his ally and Deputy President William Ruto, saying that the country does not belong to the Kenyattas. A section of Kenyan leaders called upon their counterparts to refrain from insults and abusive language irrespective of their political affiliation ahead of the 2022 elections.
