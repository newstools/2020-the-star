A Parliamentary committee on Thursday approved the nomination of Anne Nderitu as the Registrar of Political Parties. Nderitu had been holding the position in an acting capacity since 2018 when she took over from Lucy Ndung'u who was moved to the Commission on Administrative Justice. The Departmental Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs Committee also approved Ali Abdullahi, Florence Tabu as the assistant Registrar. The Committee chaired by Kigano Muturi however rejected the nomination of Wilson Mohochi who was also nominated to the position of assistant Registrar. The report was tabled by committee chairman on Thursday morning. President Uhuru Kenyatta nominated Nderitu to take up the job on September 8. Before taking up the registrar job in an acting capacity, Nderitu was theÂ head of voter registration at the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC). Recruitment for a registrar, which started in May, had been challenged in court by a Jubilee Party official citing failure to adhere to principles of fair administrative action. The petitioners wanted the courts to stop Parliament and the Public Service Commission (PSC) from conducting the selection. They argued that the recruitment is in breach of the Constitution because the law was changed 'illegally' in 2016 to incorporate PSC.
