Rapper and Def Jam Africa signee Cassper Nyovest has released his fourth studio album after a two-year hiatus, 'Any Minute Now' (AMN). The album title was propelled mostly by the anticipated birth of the Maftown rapperâ€™s first child. The 21-track album features the likes of American R&B crooner Anthony Hamilton, Kwaito legend Zola and Samthing Soweto. "This album is everything to me," Nyovest said. "I have worked with the best of artistes, they each brought their magic to it. "Zola is an iconic artiste. I looked up to him as a young boy growing up in the North West. Little did I know I would share the same studio and make magic with him. "The biggest prize is my family, I am going to be a father and that is a huge blessing. I look forward to it."
