Fida Kenya has called on the national government, Council of Governors, Nairobi Metropolitan Services, Ministry of Health and Council of Governors to address problems in the delivery of maternal healthcare. On Wednesday, Fida made a solidarity march at Freedom Corner, Uhuru Park in support of womenâ€™s maternal health as well as the CJ 's advisory on Parliament's dissolution. Fida said the government should look into maternal health care by implementing and enforcing the Ministry of Health's Maternal Care Standards, which protect women's rights and health. They asked for adequately equipping lower-level facilities to handle all cases relating to maternal health that they were designed to handle and reduce the number of cases they refer either due to shortage of skilled providers or essential equipment. They also addressed ethical codes that provide sanctions for all violent and discriminatory practices against women and ensure that these provisions are widely publicized and are punishable by law The availability of equipment necessary to maintain hygienic conditions are available and that hygiene standard is strictly enforced is another issue that Fida wants to be addressed. Here are photos from Fida's solidarity march; On Monday, Chief Justice David Maraga advised President Uhuru Kenyatta to dissolve Parliament for failing to enact legislation required to implement the two-thirds gender rule. Maraga saidthat the two-third gender rule is the acronym for the constitutional imperative which prohibits any form of discrimination in the appointment and elective positions in the country on the basis of one's gender. "Women and men have the right to equal treatment, including the right to equal opportunities in political, economic, cultural, and social spheres."
