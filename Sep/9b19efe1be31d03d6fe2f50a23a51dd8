Two governors have called for joint investments at the border of Kisumu-Nandi counties to end perennial conflicts. Governors Anyang' Nyong’o of Kisumu and Nandi's Stephen Sang  said on Thursday that development of shared infrastructure would help unite communities living along the border. They spoke during the National Cohesion and Integration Commission (NCIC) consultative peace meeting at Acacia hotel in Kisumu. Nyong'o said roads, markets, schools, and other social amenities will help bring communities together. “It is my appeal to the national government to consider swift development of such projects along our borders,” he said. The Kisumu county chief noted that conflict is an abnormality that requires collective responsibility. He cited the current conflict between Kisumu and Kericho counties at the Sondu market over revenue collection due to boundary disputes. "We have a problem at Sondu and we have engaged the national government through county commissioners of the two counties. We believe a permanent solution will be found," he said. Sang said the revitalisation of sugar mills such as Miwani, Muhoroni, and Chemelil will create opportunities for communities at the border. “When these factories are operational and more productive these young people will not be idle,” he added. Sang further rooted for increased allocation to counties to enable them to undertake joint investments at the border and fund peace initiatives to help unite the nation. NCIC commissioners Philip Okundi and Sam Kona, who attended the meeting, said the commission is working with other peace stakeholders towards peace-building initiatives along the Nandi-Kakamega, Kisumu-Nandi, Kisumu-Kericho borders. Also present were Keeping Alive Societies Hope (KASH) executive director Tom Abol and delegations from Family Health International, who are implementing partners to NCIC activities across in Kisumu, Nandi, and Kakamega counties.
