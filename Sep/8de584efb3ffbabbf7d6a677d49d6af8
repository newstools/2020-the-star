DPP Noordin Haji has given his approval for the arrest and prosecution of Emurua Dikirr MP Johana Ngeno for uttering statements intended to stir up ethnic animosity. In a statement on Tuesday, Haji said the MP made utterances over the weekend stirring ethnic hatred amongst different communities residing within Trans Mara. "The MP uttered words which were threatening, abusive and insulting words and intended or were likely to stir up ethnic animosity," he said. Haji said he was satisfied that there was sufficient evidence to initiate the prosecution. "It is in the public interest to prefer criminal charges against the suspect as his actions may open old wounds and incite the different communities against each other," he said. "ODPP takes seriously the actions of contravening the law by leaders more so in areas susceptible to ethnic violence." He advised all Kenyans to resist and report any attempts to breach Kenya's peaceful co-existence. The vocal legislator was arrested on Monday at his Mogondo home shortly before 4.30pm. Ng'eno was arrested over the remarks he made on Sunday at Murkan that the police say were meant to incite communities. When his constituents got wind that the law enforcers were looking for him, they stormed his home and guarded him. At one point, the police officers had to shoot in the air to try and disperse the crowd, but the group stayed put. The MP's supporters then escorted him from his home to Emurua Dikirr police station about six kilometres away. During the Sunday event, Ng'eno hit out at President Uhuru Kenyatta for the wrangles in Jubilee Party. He told the President to work with DP William Ruto "or go home".
