Businessman and music producer Tedd Josiah says his mum taught him how to love a woman. In a rare picture of his mother, Tedd introduced her to the world, appreciating her and other young mothers. "This is the lady responsible for bringing me into this world. My mama is amazingly strong, I love her to bits," he wrote. "Being her eldest child and her having me when she was still very young just meant she had to learn to be a mother with me. More so sheâ€™s been my example of how a woman should be loved and how a woman should love." Tedd is raising his daughter and he says his mother's guidance has helped him. "So all you young moms out there, please remember this picture cause when your son or daughter turns 50, you will still look this beautiful."
