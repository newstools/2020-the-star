Development is a gradual process and counties should be given time to implement their plans, Vihiga Deputy Governor Patrick Saisi has said. He said most of the devolved units were in a bad state, forcing first-time governors to start from scratch at the advent of devolution. "The devolved units in urban areas stood a better chance than those in remote areas," Saisi said. He said Vihiga was disadvantaged being sandwiched between the former Nyanza and Western provinces that had amassed resources from the national government. In an interview with the Star in his office, Saisi applauded his boss Governor Wilber Ottichilo, citing his development record, which he said will earn him a second term in 2022. Saisi said the governor had done tremendously well in education. "Ottichilo has done 115 ECDE classrooms in all 25 wards," he said. "He has supported vocational training in all wards and he has even waived fee for learners." Ottichillo's scholarships programme for bright learners from vulnerable families had also earned him praise, he said. The deputy governor said the health sector had also done well by improving services cross the county. "We have a CT scan, cardiac unit, ICU unit and we are soon coming up with an oxygen plant that will see us run our emergency services without bothering neighbouring counties," Saisi said. He said universal healthcare services were being improved at the grassroots. "The Sh1.7 billion water project has cut across the county. It will be one of the major projects," he said.
