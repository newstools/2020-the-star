Suspended Thirdway Alliance party leader Ekuru Aukot has been restricted from accessing the party offices. The Political Parties Disputes Tribunal gave an order on Tuesday barring Aukot, his servant, agents, or employees from accessing or entering the party's offices pending the hearing and determination of this application and suit. Aukot was suspended on August 26 over allegations of financial impropriety and lack of transparency to party members. A section of Thirdway Alliance National Executive Committee (NEC) suspended Aukot on August 26,  following a meeting held at the party's headquarters. The party had sought a prohibitory injunction from the Political Parties Disputes Tribunal proscribing Aukot, his servants from accessing the office or dealing in any manner with the members of  NEC. The Certificate of Agency from the party filed on August 31 demanded that Aukot be barred until the party Disciplinary Committee made its ruling on September 4. Deputy Director of the Political Parties Disputes Tribunal granted the party their wishes, giving Aukot and interested parties seven days to file their complaints. The tribunal will hold a virtual meeting with the concerned parties on September 9 to confirm compliance. Aukot had been accused of assaulting his deputy Dr. Angela Mwikalio using crude words which were later published by online bloggers. He was also accused of defying a court order in a children's case, hence violating Chapter Six of the Constitution of Kenya. But defending his suspension, Aukot blamed proponents of Building Bridges Initiative for the upheaval in his party. The former presidential candidate said his troubles started when he relaunched the Punguza Mzigo Kenya. Aukot said he was a victim of his latest initiative since it was a threat to BBI being pushed by President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM chief Raila Odinga.
