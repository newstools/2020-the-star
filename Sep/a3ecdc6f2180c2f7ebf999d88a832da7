NTV's 'The Wicked Edition' host Dr King'ori says he was kicked out of his home by his father after he refused to work at a construction site, where he was earning Sh17,000. In an interview on Churchill Show, King'ori narrated how he was brought up in a humble background and that he endured nights of hunger as his mother would sometimes come home empty-handed. He started his career in the acting industry after high school. "After secondary school, I innocently asked my mother about college and she responded, 'where is the money?" he said. "My mother was earning Sh5,000 then, and I remember she was over the moon because it had been increased to Sh5,600." His parents hooked him up with a road construction job that was expected to earn him as much as Sh17,000 per month, but he showed up to work for a week and quit. "They wanted me to dig trenches on roads where I would make between Sh12,000 and Sh17,000. With that kind of money at the time, I would have been a 'tycoon'," he said. "I had started acting in set books. I could not fit in. I quit that job and I was told 'You can't stay here, go fix your life out there.'" He credits Larry Madowo for supporting his dream. "When I was asked to do a pilot, Larry told me to do the concept as a segment on 'The Trend'Â first and see how people take it," he said. "People accepted and loved it, and here we are."
