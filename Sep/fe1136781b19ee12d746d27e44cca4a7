The Director of Public Prosecutions has lined up 20 witnesses to testify against Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko in a Sh10 million graft case. The DPP amended the charge sheet and introduced a new count of abuse of office in the matter in which Sonko is accused of demanding Sh10 million bribe from Web Tribe Ltd through ROG Security Limited. The governor allegedly committed the offence in January last year. He will be pleading afresh on Monday next week. Sonko allegedly demanded the cash as an inducement to facilitate payments to Web Tribe Limited by Nairobi City government. Others to be charged are ROG Security Limited and its director Antony Otieno Ombok alias Jamal. Prosecution counsel James Kihara said some of the witnesses are protected but are all within the country. Each will have four hours to testify. Kihara also told the court that they will not be offering any plea bargaining as they are ready to proceed with the case. Anti-corruption court magistrate Douglas Ogoti ruled that the case will be heard on a day-to-day basis and no application or adjournments will be entertained. He also directed that the statements from the protected witnesses be supplied to the defence team led by Cecil Miller and George Kithy before hearing begins. "Prosecution is further directed to supply a schedule of chronology in which they will call their witnesses and in case there is need to use electronic gadgets, parties to inform court prior to the hearing," Ogoti said. The case will proceed on Monday next week.
