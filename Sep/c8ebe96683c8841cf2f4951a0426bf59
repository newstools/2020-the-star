The Anti-FGM Board recently mobilised scholars and Islamic and Christian religious leaders to address FGM among communities, which is supported on cultural and religious grounds. They took a stand against the practice. The event took place at KICD Nairobi and in attendance was Inter Religious Council of Kenya chairman Rev Father Joseph Mutie. The Anti-Female Genital Mutilation Board is a semi autonomous government agency established in December 2013, following the enactment of the prohibition of FGM act, 2011.
