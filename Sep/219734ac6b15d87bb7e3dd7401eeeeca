Three men were on Friday charged with attempting to extort an alcohol company director Sh500,000 with threats of exposing his alleged tax evasion. John Ojode Odhiambo, Joel Omino and Otieno Atanga were charged before Kibera senior principal magistrate Philip Mutua where they denied the charges. They are accused of threatening Francis Kiriiro, the director of Patialla Distillers contrary to Section 300 (i) of the Penal Code. They allegedly told Kiriiro that they could stop investigations of his company by a Kenya Revenue Authority official. The charge sheet says that they committed the offence on August 28 at a petrol station at Airport View along Mombasa road in Nairobi.Â The three were charged with the second count of conspiracy to defraud. Joel Amino and Erick Otieno Atanga were also charged with another count of impersonating Kenya Revenue Authority officials. The charge sheet says Amino committed the offence on August 27 while Atanga committed the offence on August 28. Rixon Shikuku, an advocate for the three accused persons, said they had cooperated with the investigators and were not a flight risk. He asked the court to release their property that was not part of the exhibit for the prosecution case. Mutua granted them a Sh300,000 bond or Sh100,000 bail, with a surety of the same amount. The case will be mentioned on September 17.
