The National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA) has suspended the driving license of a bus driver seen recklessly driving in a viral video. The driver who was an Umoinner Sacco bus was captured on camera by fellow motorist overlapping at high speed on a bridge. In the video shared by Bodaboda Association of Kenya, the bus is seen speeding off on the pedestrian lane as some passengers cheered on. The rogue driver fortunately swerved away from some pedestrians and a motorcycle which was packed by the roadside. The vehicle was identified as Class Limited  KCW 047A. Following the report and Kenyans on Twitter calling for action, the matter was picked up by NTSA launching immediate investigation into the incident. The Authority later reported that the driver was found, his vehicle impounded and a prohibition order issued. The vehicle will also be subjected to a compliance inspection. "The DL and PSV License of the driver have been suspended for a period of six months. He will be required to undergo driver re-test for the Authority to ascertain his competencies before the licenses are reinstated," NTSA said. The Authority further urged the public to continue supporting in weeding out rogue drivers who endanger the lives of road users. This comes as Kenyans continue to perish in road accidents across the country. Just two days ago, two people died on the spot including a KTN editor after their vehicles collided along Kajiado-Namanga road. The accident occurred when a Toyota Probox collided with a truck driven by a Burundian national at about 6:30pm. “The driver of the Probox tried to avoid hitting an on-coming trailer ferrying timber headed to Kajiado town . The Probox hit the front right side of the truck which made it swerve off the road,” Central Sub-County police commander Daudi Lornyokwe told the Star.
