Deputy President William Ruto is back at the Jubilee Party headquarters. The visit on Wednesday afternoon comes shortly after  secretary general Raphael Tuju announced the party would not field a candidate in the Msambweni by-election. Tuju said with Jubilee's  recent cooperation with ODM, it saw it fit not to field a candidate. He also said the country faces serious issues currently following CJ David Maraga's call for the dissolution of Parliament for failing to legislate laws to implement the gender rule. "The country has very serious constitutional matters to deal with that will require sobriety and reaching across the political divides in order to navigate our beloved country across some of these challenges," Tuju said. Ruto on Tuesday evening paid an impromptu visit to Jubilee Party headquarters in Pangani, Nairobi, a day after Maraga told President Uhuru Kenyatta to dissolve Parliament. However, the DP cut a lonely figure as none of the party’s top brass was at hand to receive him. His visit sparked speculation the DP wanted to check the state of preparedness should the President heed Maraga's advisory, which could trigger countrywide parliamentary by-elections. Ruto's deputy director of communications Emmanuel Talam dismissed the speculation saying he was there to check on the "progress of the party". "He went there in his capacity as the deputy party leader. He has an office there," Talam told the Star on the phone. The absence of all senior party officials was the clearest signal that Ruto remains an outsider in an outfit where he is deputy leader. Tuju on Tuesday told the Star the DP arrived at the headquarters after he had left but said he will enquire if the DP needed something that required his attention. “I have just been made aware that he visited. I am going to find out if there was anything he wanted that requires my attention,” Tuju said.
