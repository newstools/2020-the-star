ODM leader Raila Odinga on Monday evening met with Kakamega Senator Cleophas Malala. The two were seen taking pictures at Raila's Capital Hill office in Nairobi. "Held discussions with Senator Cleophas Malala of Kakamega this afternoon focusing on the Revenue Sharing stalemate and BBI," Raila posted. This was after the two clashed on Sunday over the revenue sharing formula. Raila hit out at Malala for rejecting the third generation county revenue allocation formula. The ODM Party leader questioned whether Malala was elected to represent the people of Kakamega after rejecting the revenue sharing formula. "If you are elected as an MP or a Senator, you are supposed to represent the people, the formula has been tabled in the Senate, but you say you do not want to deny funds to people from other counties, are you really elected by the people of Kakamega? "If there is a Senator that is having their county getting more funds but they reject the formula, it's not that they love people from other counties, there is a question mark," Raila said. But Malala said nothing will force him to change his stand. Last week, the senator  visited KRA offices to seek explanation as to why his accounts were frozen, where he met KRA commissioners. After a lengthy meeting, Malala said that the authority established that he had no debt that could cause his accounts to be frozen. “We have a group of lobbyists who are moving around the town trying to coerce and intimidate senators to have them vote in a specific way,” Malala said. He continued that “I will not be intimidated and I will maintain my stand on the Third Generation Formula, the stand that champions for a WIN-WIN formula and a WIN-WIN situation for our counties,” Malala said. Malala has asked those behind the intimidation to respect the democracy of the legislators and their decisions.
