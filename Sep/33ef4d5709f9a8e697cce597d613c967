The Health Non-governmental Organizations Network (HENNET), an umbrella of health civil society organisations has launched a project to ensure social accountability. Dubbed 'Strengthening Public Accountability and Integrated Systems'(SPAIS), the project aims at uplifting citizen engagement and participation to ensure efficient service delivery. SPAIS will also seek to increase knowledge on citizen accountability and enhance evidence on the use of funds on continuity of health services amidst of Covid-19 pandemic. The meeting was attended by stakeholders from diverse health organisations and media . Gregory Mihanga, a health official from the Nairobi Metropolitan Service, said NMS is in full support of the project to ensure accountability, efficiency and participation in service delivery. “Some of our roles include promotion of healthcare, ambulance services, regulation of veterinary services, centuries, funeral parlours and cremation to mention just but a few," he added. HENNET chief executive Dr Mercy Onsando condemned corruption at the Ministry of Health over looting of billions allocated for management of Covid-19. This comes even as the Ethics and Anti-corruption Commission probes the Kenya Medical Supplies Authority and the Ministry of Health officials over the scandal. So far, Kemsa boss Jonah Manjari has been suspended by the agency’s board to pave way for investigations. According to reports, some Kemsa suppliers were neither pre-qualified, nor their business history known in the country. There have been questions regarding the expenditure of Covid-19 emergency funds, largely those sourced from international donors and the World Bank. The PS Susan Mochache has been put on the spot over a suspect letter she wrote directing embattled Kemsa to procure Covid-19 supplies from specific firms. Edited by EKibii
