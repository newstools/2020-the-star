The Senate leadership is currently meeting the 12-member committee that was formed to strike a deal on the contentious revenue sharing formula among counties. The meeting comes ahead of a sitting in the afternoon where the senators will be attempting for the tenth time to debate and approve the formula. The lawmakers are resuming plenary sittings this afternoon after a month-long recess . According to sources in the committee, the leadership headed by speaker Kenneth Lusaka is trying to convince the divided committee to support a disputed formula that cuts allocation to 18 counties by Sh17 billion. The leadership, however, according to the sources, wants the formula suspended by two years 'to minimise loses' The proposal to suspend the implementation of the proposed formula by two years was fronted by Majority Chief Whip Irungu Kang'ata. "They are trying to convince us to support the formula that will see Mandera lose Sh1.2 billion and other counties lose a lot of money. But we are still negotiating," a senator, who is a member of the 12-member team said . "The leadership says that all counties will for the next two years get the same amount as the one they received last year. They say this will minimise loses and then after that the new formula will kick in." The team, chaired by senators Moses Wetangula (Bungoma) and Johnson Sakaja (Nairobi) presented two reports to the leadership after its members failed to agree on the best formula. The Star has established that after the leadership meeting, the resolution will be presented to all the senators in a Kamkunji ahead of the afternoon session. The Senators have failed in nine sittings to pass the formula that will determine how the counties shared the national cake.
