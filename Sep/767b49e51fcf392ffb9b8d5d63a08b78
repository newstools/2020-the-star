Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi now alleges that police officers have been sent to his house in his constituency. The MP said through his Twitter account on Thursday evening two motor vehicles belonging to police were parked at his gate. He added that two lorries ferrying police officers were patrolling at Kapseret shopping centre. This comes hours before his scheduled press address arranged for Friday. "I will be holding a peace meeting tomorrow outside Silverline restaurant, Eldoret Town at 11.00 a.m. Come one, come all," Sudi had said. The MP has been on the headlines for his speech against President Uhuru Kenyatta and his family including Mama Ngina Kenyatta. Sudi has refused to apologise over his remarks which drew countrywide condemnation with leaders accusing him of uttering inciting and abusive remarks against the president’s family. He termed all those condemning him over the remarks as "conmen and looters". While issuing the remarks that caused the outcry, the MP dared the police to go arrest him at his home. Sudi's home is located near the Kapseret center along the Eldoret-Kisumu road. President Kenyatta came out on Wednesday evening during a tour of projects in Ruaka, telling those insulting his mother to go and insult their own mothers and leave his alone. “Go and insult your mother and leave mine alone”, Uhuru said. Sudi lashed out at Uhuru in a widely circulated clip on social media after the arrest of Emur Dikir MP Johanna Ngen'o. Ng'eno was charged before a Nakuru court over remarks which also targeted the President and his mother. The two MPs said Kenya does not belong to Mama Ngina Kenyatta and accused Uhuru of frustrating Deputy President William Ruto.
