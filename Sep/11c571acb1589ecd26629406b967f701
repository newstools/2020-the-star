Deputy President William Ruto said on Thursday he is ready to face the 'system'. Speaking at two separate functions in Kisii, the DP said no amount of intimidation would derail his political goal. The DP further said state agencies should not be used to intimidate his supporters. He said the country has entered a dangerous phase, where some leaders in government use threats to gag those supporting him. "This country we call Kenya belongs to all of us. Nobody has the monopoly to chest-thump and cajole other leaders because they support me," Ruto said. He told security agencies to keep off politics if they are to remain neutral and true to the mandate. "It is unfortunate that today some leaders are engaging security agencies to do their dirty work," Ruto said. Ruto said time for chaos is over and those beating war drums are 'committing a political sin'. "Every Kenyan knows what to do. Let nobody deceive you that there is going to be violence. There shall be no violence." Ruto said he fought long and hard with President Uhuru Kenyatta to secure victory for Jubilee. "You saw me here campaigning vigorously for Jubilee and we won. Hii vitu mnasikia ni upuzi tu [what you hear is nonsense]," Ruto told residents in Kisii town. On Thursday afternoon, Ruto landed in KisiiÂ to a rapturous welcome from his supporters despite earlier protests by ODM youths. MPs Alfa Miruka (Bomachoge Chache), Vincent Kemosi (West Mugirango, Nyamira), Sylivanus Osoro (South Mugirango) and John Kiarie (Dagoreti South) were present. Deputy Governor Joash Maangi assured the DP of the community's support.
