The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commissioned questioned 52 public officers who were alleged to have benefited from the Kemsa scandal, Attorney General Paul Kihara has said. The AG said that the commission reached out to 52 persons of interest in the scandal who wrote statements. Kihara, who was making his remarks on Monday during the national Covid conference, said that the Director of Public Prosecutions has already received the report regarding the 52. “The DPP is currently reviewing the material and will at a certain stage in the near future decides on whether or not prosecutions will proceed,” Kihara said. He said the EACC applied a two-phase approach to the case, the first being questioning the public officers mentioned in the saga. In the second phase, the AG said the commission probed and is still following up about 70 companies that were alleged to have supplied to the agency. The Attorney General said that it is unfortunate that there are people who are working day and night to take the advantage of the pandemic to make money. President Uhuru Kenyatta had given the commission 21 days to expedite investigations into the alleged theft of funds at Kemsa. "Given the public interest the relevant agencies should expedite investigations and conclude the same within 21 days," he said. "All persons found to be culpable from the ongoing investigations on Covid funds should be brought to book notwithstanding their social status or political affiliations." Kemsa has been in the spotlight after it emerged that officials dished out tenders to mysterious entities under the cover of the Covid-19 pandemic.
