Safaricom has trolled out all its M-PESA services on the *334# menu. The move targets non-smartphone users by consolidating all M-PESA services in a single, easy to use menu with more flexibility than the current SIM toolkit menu. The new menu displays the receiver’s name and one can only advance after confirming the transaction. “We have embarked on a strategy to simplify our range of products and services for our customers and to provide them with an even better experience. M-PESA on *334# is our first solution as part of the ongoing strategy and it refines how our customers interact with the service,” said Peter Ndegwa, CEO, Safaricom. To use the service, customers will dial *334# upon which they will be presented with a choice of the different M-PESA services including “Send Money”, “Loans and Savings” or “Lipa Na M-PESA”. As with other USSD menus, customers will key in the number selecting the service such as “5” for Lipa Na M-PESA. M-PESA on *334# brings together all services that have previously being offered through different USSDs saving customers from having to remember the different numbers. Within the Lipa Na M-PESA menu, customers can directly select PayBill and Till Numbers for Banks, Government and County Government Services, and Transport services including the SGR and long-distance buses. Once a customer selects any of the options, they will be presented with a list of services they can then pay through Lipa Na M-PESA. Customers can also use the Lipa Na M-PESA option to pay to personal numbers for select businesses. Other options now available on M-PESA on *334# include M-PESA Global which empowers customers to send and receive money across the world.
