Garissa Deputy Governor Dagane Abdi has reported to the police that he has received threats to his life. Though he did not mention who has been threatening him, a statement on his Facebook page insinuated that it was related to the case facing Governor Ali Korane. "The recent case against the leadership of our County is not unprecedented. There is no possibility of vacuum given that there exist court rulings and constitutional safeguards against this kind of circumstances and therefore the task of governance is not left to chance," Abdi said. He said that the police had assured him that they would investigated the matter to it logical conclusion. "We have lived in Kenya long enough to take threat to life lightly. I understand that these times can be stressful and upsetting for the people of Garisa county. However, I appeal for calm and not give excuses to hate and deceit," Abdi said. With Korane barred from accessing his office, the spotlight on how to manage the county government is now on Deputy Governor Abdi Dagane. Speaking to the Star on phone earlier this week, Abdi said that he would be consulting before he makes an announcement. There are reports that this consultations are where the death threats have cropped up from. Dagane, who was until his entry into politics a banker and a teacher, is from the Abdalla clan in Ijara, the southern part of Garissa. Dagane's relationship with his boss was at one point icy after he accused the county chief of sidelining him in the management of the county. However, the elders intervened and they mended fences.
