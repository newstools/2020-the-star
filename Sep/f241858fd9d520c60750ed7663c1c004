Eldonets have signed up six players ahead of the new season following their promotion into the Kenya Basketball Federation (KBF) league last season. Those who have joined the club are Humphrey Lesile, Anthony Mukhebi, Dennis Omache, Philip Omondi, Alvin Mulupi and Collins Wekesa. Head coach Maurice Ouma said the players were mainly drawn from universities with a few from clubs. He said the main reason of beefing up the squad is to ensure they make remarkable improvement in the league next season. “Our target is to ensure we finish among the top clubs next season,” he said after unveiling the players in Eldoret. Leslie and Omondi were signed from the Eldoret Polytechnic, Omache (Kisii University) and Mulupi (Egerton). Wekesa used to play for Nairobi City Thunder while  Mukhebi has just relocated to Eldoret from Nairobi.  Wekesa was part of the team that defeated Eldonets in their maiden appearance at the top tier basketball league play-offs. After winning at home in the three-tier match, Thunder won two at their backyard to eliminate Eldonets. Eldonets also have a Ladies team that currently features in the Division One League after they were eliminated in the playoffs. “I have a strong working team and that is why we managed to reach the finals on our debut in the top tier,” added Ouma. The team trains at Uasin Gishu High courts.
