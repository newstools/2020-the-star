ODM leader Raila Odinga on Tuesday received a delegation of a section of Maasai leaders from Kajiado county to deliberate on development. Raila urged the leaders support the war on corruption to ensure resources from the government do not end up in the pockets of individuals. “I used this meeting to assure the marginalised communities including the Maa that President and myself have their interests in mind in all the consultations that we hold.” Raila added, “We are keen to ensure that each part of the country and each community has its interest taken care of, whether it is through revenue sharing formula or appointment and general developments.” ODM chief asked the delegates to stand for a united country and to tell off those who are after war and issuing threats. "This country has known bad times before because of politics. We have gone to war in 1992, 1997, and 2007. Nobody should try to take this country again to war because of politics.” The team was led by former Kajiado Governor David Nkedianye, Kajiado East MP Peris Tobiko, former Nairobi County Assembly Speaker Alex ole Magelo among others. His comments come barely two weeks after Deputy President hosted a section of leaders from the same county. Environment CS Keriako Tobiko had earlier criticized DP for carrying out early campaigns after a delegation visited his residence in Karen. Tobiko told Ruto to respect the President and engage in development.
