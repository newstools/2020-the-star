Armed thugs shot and killed a man in bar in Kathonzweni town, Makueni county, on Tuesday night. The thugs escaped with Sh28,000 from the bar attendant and robbed patrons of unknown amounts of money and phones. Kathonzweni subcounty police commander said the two who were armed with a pistol posed as patrons before the 10pm attack at Laviva Lounge bar. “They ordered every one to lie down but the victim defied. The 28-year-old was shot on the chest in a confrontation when he demanded to know who they were,” Nthiga told The Star on Wednesday morning. He said the thugs ransacked everywhere before they demanded cash from the bar attendant who gave them Sh28,000 believed to have been the day’s sales. They left behind a motor cycle helmet. When police officers arrived at the scene, they found the man lying on the floor and rushed him to Makueni county hospital where he was confirmed dead. The body was taken to a private morgue. “We have called in scene of crime officers who are investigating the incident,” Nthiga said. The incident happens a day after President Uhuru Kenyatta opened bars that had been closed since April to slow down the spread of Covid-19.
