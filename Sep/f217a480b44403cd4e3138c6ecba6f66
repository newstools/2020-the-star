Two police officers have been arrested pending murder charges over the death of a Naivasha man while in custody, the Independent Policing Oversight Authority has said. In a statement on Tuesday, Ipoa said the two Administration Police officers - Wilson Irungu and George Otieno Nyaoke - have been found to have a case to answer over the mysterious incident. According to Authority, the deceased, David Wachira Kamauwas, was reportedly arrested in April 2019 by officers from Malewa AP Camp for allegedly stealing livestock. His death was reported after a night in police custody. This prompted investigations by Ipoa to establish the circumstances under which the man met his death. "Investigations established that the deceased suffered grievous injuries while in police custody that proved fatal. He was pronounced dead at JM Kariuki Referral hospital in Olkalou," IPOA Chairperson Anne Makori said. "On conclusion of the investigations, IPOA made recommendations to the ODPP to charge two suspect officers with murder. On August 11, 2020, the ODPP concurred with IPOA recommendations." The officers were arrested last week and have since been taken for mental assessment in preparation for arraigning at the High Court in Naivasha. This comes barely six months after another prisoner died mysteriously while in custody. Josphat Mbugua Kinoti, 49, died on March 23, 2020, shortly after he was taken to Meru Level 5 Hospital for treatment. The Director of Public Prosecutions withdrew charges against the deceased who was defilement suspect. He was accused of defiling a minor on January 5, 2019, in Kaaga location.
