Police have arrested eight people suspected of lynching a robbery suspect in Kinangop, Nyandarua county, last month. The eight are incidentally from two families and neighbours of the late John Mwangi Ndeleva. They were arrested in Ndothua village. The eight were part of a mob that allegedly raided Ndeleva's home, beat him up, then locked him up in his house and set it ablaze. This followed a series of cattle rustling cases in the area, with accusing fingers pointed at Ndeleva. A senior police officer who declined to be named confirmed the arrest, adding that they were seeking more suspects. “We have arrested eight suspects who will be charged with murder and we are seeking others who were involved in the attack,” the officer said. An elder from the village, Simon Karanja, said more than 100 residents raided the home and first kicked out the wife and children before attacking and lynching Ndeleva as his shaken family watched from a distance in fear. “The suspect had been accused of a series of robberies but the case has turned against the accusers, with eight of them in police cells,” he said. Elsewhere in Naivasha, the body of a missing carpenter was found hanging from his one-room house after a three-day search. The 22-year-old had been missing since Saturday before his neighbours in Kabati estate were attracted by a foul smell from the house. Naivasha OCPD Samuel Waweru confirmed the case, adding that the body had been collected and taken to a local mortuary. “At the moment, no one knows the motive behind the suicide but the body has been identified and an inquest file opened,” he said.
