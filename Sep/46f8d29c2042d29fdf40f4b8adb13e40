'Cheche', Diamond Platnumz’s hit collabo with his signee Zuchu, has been pulled down from YouTube following a copyright strike by a person identified as Tony Anthony. "Video unavailable. This video is no longer available due to a copyright claim by Tony Anthony,” a message from YouTube read. 'Cheche' was trending at number one in Kenya and Tanzania and had garnered over 2.5 million views within five days of being released. This comes barely a week after Tanasha Donna threw shade at Zuchu, claiming she copied the lyrics from her song 'Ride' ft Khaligraph Jones. Tanasha’s manager Jamal Gaddafi also shared the same video, saying the original idea will always last longer than a copied one. Fans also noticed the similarity in the Spanish used in Tanasha’s song and the intro in 'Cheche'.
