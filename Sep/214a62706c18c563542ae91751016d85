Six counties - Machakos, Kitui, Meru, Nyeri, Kajiado and Busia - are on the Health ministry's radar over a rise in Covid-19 cases. While infections in counties previously marked as hotspots are on a downward trend, there is a rise in the six counties. On Tuesday, Health Chief Administrative Secretary Rashid Aman said Kitui recorded the highest number of new cases at 54 out of the 151 reported. Nairobi, which has been leading in the number of new infections  was second at 23. The total number of cases in the country rose to was 35,356 as of yesterday. “What we are saying is that while the overall curve may be showing progress in a downward trend, when that curve is dismantled into counties, you will see  there are some counties where numbers are rising,” Aman said. Uasin Gishu had 11 cases, Kiambu, Garissa and Migori nine cases each, Kisii seven, Trans Nzoia six, Narok four and Kericho three. Mombasa, Busia, Taita Taveta, Machakos and Kilifi had two cases each and Laikipia, Bomet, Nakuru, Meru, Nandarua and Kajiado one each. The new cases were from 2,552 samples tested in a day. The total number of tests conducted so far is 479,697. The 151 new cases are aged between three and 74 years. For the first time, the number of females was higher than male at 77. On a positive note, 173 more people recovered - 107 from home-based care and 66 discharged from hospitals. No death was reported during Tuesday's briefing. “The ministry continues to support the counties based on the disease burden in those places, building capacity and geographical location,” head of Special Programmes Kepha Ombacho said.
