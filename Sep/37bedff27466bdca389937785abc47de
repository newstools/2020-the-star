The love for tea is stereotyped among some people from certain regions but we can bet that they canâ€™t beat a certain comical Rift Valley lawmaker on it. The man takes his good time when it comes to taking the beverage, and for sure can make many trips to satiate his appetite. The man recently did a count of over 10 trips to the urn just to quench his thirst. And while on it, he never appeared bothered that someone was counting. Corridors overheard his colleague taunting him that he should ask for a big mug to cut short his trips A rant by a youthful politician towards a senior member of the House left many wondering what the old man did to deserve the treatment meted on him by the first-term legislator. The young MP took a swipe at his senior during a meeting with Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe and Transport ministry officials on Covid-19 donations. The legislator even went to the extent of directing the senior lawmaker on where he was to sit during the session. It took the intervention of the session chairperson to have the young man stay off attacks targeted at the senior. What exactly are Members of Parliament always busy chasing in town? Well, this is the question a House leader asked after a chunk of members were notably absent from a key forum to better the management of legislative affairs. The leader appeared not amused that a paltry 30 members stayed to the end of the meeting of about 88 lawmakers. His major concern was that the lot that left him at the meeting comprised of persons for whom the very meeting was convened. The lot was to be oriented on new roles they recently took in the ranks and file of House leadership.
