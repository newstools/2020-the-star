The Lenana School has been handed a Sh140 million dam to solve perennial water problems and help it grow its own food. For residents living near the school, a 63m3 elevated water tank will supply irrigation water to the farmers to boost food security in the area. Housing and Urban Development PS Charles Hinga handed over the dam to Lenana School on Wednesday. He said the class B nine-metre high dam will boost urban agriculture in the school and the community through drip irrigation. The dam has been constructed with a 2.1-kilometre external sewer line to improve hygiene and sanitation to both the school and the local community. "The Lenana dam will provide a reliable water source for irrigation as the project aims to harness stormwater for demonstrative urban agriculture," Hinga said. Further, the high dam whose capacity is approximately 163.4 million litres will be used to demonstrate drip technology for urban crop production. It is expected to reduce serious stream pollution within the Lenana School community and adjacent areas. The dam is part of the Integrated Urban Water Management demonstrated projects within the Nairobi Metropolitan Area. They are aimed at providing sustainable water services to urban dwellers. The Ministry of Transport built the dam with partial funding from the World Bank. "It is important to note that the World Bank assisted our government in the water sector, particularly in regard to increasing and improving Nairobi water supply," Hinga said. The project will also help carry out simulation and training for the school management on disaster response.
