The High Court has directed the Director of Public Prosecutions to supply the family of the late Yassin Moyo with all documentation it intends to rely on during the murder trial. The directive came after the victim's lawyer Demas Kiprono told the court that the DPP and the Independent Policing Oversight Authority (Ipoa) had not supplied them with any material that forms part of the case. The case had been listed for mention to confirm compliance. The accused, Duncan Ndiema, represented by lawyers Danstan Omari and Anita Masaki, was present for the virtual mention. The High Court deputy registrar Jane Kamau said the matter be fixed for mention on a later date to be communicated to parties with purposes of fixing a hearing date. Ndiema was this year charged with murdering the 13-year-old boy in Shauri Moyo. He is out on Sh1 million bail with a condition that he does not interfere with the witnesses lined up to testify against him. Ndiema was in uniform when he committed the crime. He had an Israeli pistol serial number 44338354 loaded with 10 rounds of ammunition. Ipoa in an affidavit  said the bullet head recovered from the body of Moyo matched the Israeli pistol held by the officer. Edited by Henry Makori
