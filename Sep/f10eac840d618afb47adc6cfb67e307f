A boda boda rider who sold a motorbike after he defaulted on loan repayment without informing the creditor will know his fate at the end of the month when he will be sentenced. Jotham Shamala Ekombe on Tuesday admitted receiving Sh75,000 from Livingstone Anyange Kanga on July 29 by pretending he was in a position to sell a motorcycle to him. The transaction happened in Dagoretti. Kibera senior principal magistrate Charles Mwaniki remanded him in custody awaiting a probation report on October 26 before sentencing him. Ekombe sold the bike to Kanga knowing he had defaulted on repaying a loan he obtained to buy the item. The creditor traced the bike to Kanga and recovered it. Kanga reported the matter to the police and Ekombe was arrested.  - mwaniki fm
