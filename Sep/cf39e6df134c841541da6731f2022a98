Mercedes Benz has today launched two new models of Mercedes Benz GLB compact SUV suitable for offroading and the heavy Nairobi traffic. The GLB 200 will retail at Sh8.57 million while the GLB 250 4matic will go for Sh10 million albeit with identical perks for all customers. “The new models are a combination of a saloon car and SUV. It is ideally suited to the sort of tasks most families carry out on a daily basis or simply to enjoy out of town weekends and holidays,” said Matt Olivier, Director of Business Development, DT Dobie during the launch at the firm's showroom along Uhuru Highway. The models are the first compact vehicle from Mercedes to offer a third seat row on request with two additional individual seats. GLB 250 is a four-wheel drive with a fuel capacity of 2.0 litre whereas GLB 200 is a two-wheel drive with a 1322cc petrol engine. Mercedes’ entry into the SUV market represents the latest scramble for a growing demand for SUVs in the country. A report by Kenya Motor Industry Association in 2019 reveals that Kenyans bought approximately 1,200 new SUVs between January and September 2019. The German automaker is renowned for luxury cars that are only suited to well tarmacked roads. Its entry into the SUV market represents a shift from this business model and pits it against Japanese automakers, such as Nissan, Toyota, Suzuki, Isuzu and Honda that have dominated the SUV market in the country.
