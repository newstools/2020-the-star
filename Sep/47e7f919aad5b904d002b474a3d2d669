Controversial singer Muigai wa Njoroge has called out Murang'a and Kiambu woman representatives for what he says is hypocrisy. This has drawn a sharp response from the Murang'a politician, who told him to wear a skirt or pick on his own gender. Through a video shared on Facebook and YouTube, Muigai addressed the raging debate about mothers, saying all women should be accorded the same respect. Murang’a woman representative Sabina Chege had led women in protests over remarks by Emurua Dikkir MP Johanna Ng’eno and Kapseret's Oscar Sudi. The duo dragged President Uhuru Kenyatta's mother into their criticisms of his rule. However, Muigai faulted the use of other people's mothers in political fights. "What I have witnessed from some politicians is shameful," he said. "Bribing our mothers with Sh200 to engage them in political wars is total disrespect. The war is for politicians and not for our mothers." Muigai also addressed the issue of women at Kariobangi being homeless. He said whoever put them in that situation, bearing in mind Covid-19 and the cold season, showed they have no respect for women. He said no female politician demonstrated or threatened to undress. "Gikomba fires have been happening and I have not seen them (Sabina Chege, Gathoni wa Muchomba or even (Laikipia's) Cate Waruguru) demonstrating," he said. "Let not our parents be misused while fighting for politicians. Let our parents stay home peacefully." Word Is reached out to Sabina Chege, who said some men always find it easy to attack women. "Let him deal with his fellow men or put on a skirt then I will engage him as my peer," she said. "Are we the only ones who spoke? And why do men find it easy to attack women instead of engaging men?" Edited by T Jalio
