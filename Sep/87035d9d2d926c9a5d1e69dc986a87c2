Media personality Chiki Kuruka has announced that she has officially exited one of the radio stations in Nairobi. Chiki, who is Sauti Sol's Bien Aime's wife, said that leaving the radio station was not an easy decision to make, but she is excited by what's happening in the world right now. “It's with heavy emotions that I can now announce my decision to leave @vybezradioke. It was NOT an easy decision to make. In such a short period of time, I have fallen in love with the listeners and with the team. However, I am SO excited by what's happening in the world right now," she said. Chiki, who is also known to be an exceptional dancer said she is passionate about bridging the gap between Caribbean music and African music so that it can be more of a global force. "I am passionate about what I see as the future, where all black people collaborate, exchange, and make money together. I love the growth of digital, and the idea that this little thing called your phone can be almost an entire media house," she said. However, Chiki has not stated the main reason why she left the radio station or if she has other plans after the exit. "I am not going to announce what's coming next just yet, because I need to SLEEP and take a little break. But when I announce, you will hopefully understand why I had to make this difficult move, and why the future is SO bright. Thank you for blessing me with your ears!” Chiki explained. Before coming to Kenya, Chiki worked in the music industry in the UK six years ago and got the opportunity to even work with Ghanaian artiste Fuse ODG who was a big artiste and his music was being played in many countries.
