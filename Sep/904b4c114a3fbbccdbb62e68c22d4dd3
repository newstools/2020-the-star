Kiss FM's Chito Ndhlovu has a new series, 'Things Not To Hide From Your Partner', on Instagram for those in relationships and marriages. Speaking to Word Is, Chito said the reason he started this series is because so many people in relationships keep a lot of secrets from their partners. "I have a thing on Instagram called #AskChito, where people come to me for guidance in their lives, especially relationships," he said. "So a lot of people have been asking if they can tell their partners secrets they have been keeping. "So I decided to make general videos in that regard because of the many questions I keep getting about it." He aims to help those struggling in relationships because they want what they see in movies yet that is not the reality.
