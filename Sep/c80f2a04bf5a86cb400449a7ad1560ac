Joseph Kori, murder suspect turned state witness, features in Samidoh's latest song Mumbi. Kori was arrested alongside his mistress Judy Wangui and car dealer Michael Mathenge in connection with the murder of his wife Mary Wambui. He was later released unconditionally and turned state witness. The case is ongoing. Mumbi is about a forgotten way of life. In one stanza, Samidoh laments that Mumbi used to be conservative but has turned into an alcoholic. "I miss the days you would cook like my mum, but now you drink more than my father. I miss when you did not know about makeup...You are now lost because of the term fashion," he sings. The song was released on Tuesday and is trending on YouTube with more than 100,000 views.
