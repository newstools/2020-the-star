‘Cyclists' lives matters’ was the theme Saturday morning as cyclists from different parts of the country held a peaceful demonstration in memory of Caleb Omwoyo, who died after hitting an suddenly stopped bus on Wednesday. The protest attracted hundreds of cyclists, who cycled from Jevanjee Gardens in CBD to Safari Park on Thika Road, where Caleb, 22, met his death. Speaking during the protest, cyclist Peter Dawa said, “Cycling is a mode of transport like any other, it doesn’t mean I am poor. Let's embrace and respect every road user. I call upon the NTSA to introduce safe cycling lanes on our roads to encourage cycling in the country.”
