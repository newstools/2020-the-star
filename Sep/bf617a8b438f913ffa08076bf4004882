Jubilee deputy secretary general Caleb Kositany has termed 'satanic', the alleged profiling of the Kalenjin community. This came shortly after the party secretary general Raphael Tuju had said there was a group of "intellectual dwarfs" who were spoiling the name of the community. Tuju had said the community was highly represented in President Uhuru Kenyatta's Cabinet, mentioning four CSs, whom he said were sober and were doing the work they were appointed to do. He spoke during an interview with Citizen TV on Tuesday night. Tuju then went ahead to hit out at Kapsaret MP Oscar Sudi and Emurua Dikirr's Johanna Ng'eno who had uttered insults at President Uhuru Kenyatta and former First Lady Mama Ngina Kenyatta. Kositany also condemned Sudi's and Ng'eno's utterances, saying they spoke ont their own behalf. Earlier, Tuju said he spoke on phone with Deputy President William Ruto about his allies utterances. “I called Deputy President this afternoon and we had a discussion on it and I did make my position very clear that because some of the things are being done using his name,” Tuju said. Tuju said Ruto's defence that he had spoken out against the legislators' action on Twitter did not fly, adding Kenyans would not be satisfied with tweets. He went on to say that Ruto also mentioned how he had been targeted by Jubilee Party vice chairman David Murathe, who had linked him to the Kemsa saga as well as painting him as a corrupt individual unworthy of holding the country's top seat. "The issue of Mama Ngina cannot be compared to that of Murathe... she is nobody's peer," Tuju said. He added that the issue of Murathe's utterances would be addressed.
