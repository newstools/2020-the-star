A member of the National Cohesion and Integration Commission has advised politicians to hold peaceful campaigns or face the wrath of the law. Commissioner Dorcas Kedogo warned against hateful utterances by some lawmakers that could bring problems in the country. Speaking at Wazivi Pentecostal Church at Lugaga wa Muluma ward in Vihiga subcounty, Kedogo said the commission would not allow reckless politicians to ruin Kenya. "As a commission, we won't give room for that anyway," she said. "For any wrong and careless utterances we shall be at your neck and you will face the full force of the law as an individual making those reckless statements." She said the NCIC is currently working with the DCI and other law enforcement agencies to ensure all lawmakers abide by the law. "You have seen Johana Ng'eno and Oscar Sudi behind the bars and that's the way we are moving, with no excuses," she said. Kedogo said Kenya rumbles every time elections are near, with some leaders profiling communities. She urged Kenyans not to allow the political class to mislead them. "We urge the political class countrywide to conduct their activities peacefully," Kedogo warned. Edited by Henry Makori
