Media personality Jeff Koinange is mourning his elder brother David Waiganjo Mbiyu, who passed away at the weekend. In a heartbreaking Instagram post, Jeff described Waiganjo as a friend. "Still trying to come to terms with the fact that you are no longer with us, my big brother and my Friend," he wrote. "Yours was a gentle soul with a heart of gold! You will be sorely missed and this pain will not go away anytime soon. We loved you but God loved you more, Father Abraham! Till we meet again." David, son of former cabinet minister Mbiyu Koinange, passed away in a road accident. He was driving to his farm in Mau-Narok from Nakuru town when his car rolled.
