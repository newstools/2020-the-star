Traders who have encroached on public land at Ngarariga village in Limuru constituency will be moved to allow the tarmacking of the road to Ngarariga Level 4 Hospital. Residents have welcomed the tarmacking of the 3.5km road and asked the government not to change the design to favour the encroachers. They say traders abandoned Ngarariga trading centre to start businesses at near Ngarariga stage along the Nairobi-Nakuru highway. "Owing to the bad status of our road, shops, butcheries and hotels were nearly all closed. Traders also abandoned our open-air market," Emmanuel Gathecha said. Gathecha said if the road is tarmacked, then traders will start grabbing spaces since accessibility will be easier. He spoke at Ngarariga shopping centre when residents met nominated MCA Susan Njeri. Njeri said the road will improve access to the 270-bed hospital which was commissioned by first lady Margret Kenyatta two years ago. She said the road was being done by the Department of Planning and Urban Development. "The road will stretch from the Nairobi-Nakuru highway up to the hospital. The hospital neighbours a police post, our chiefs office and the trading centre which has a market," she said. She added, "We know and expect that trade will improve all over sudden. The road will have an impact," she said. The nominated MCA also asked local investors to improve the shops' infrastructure including building modern houses since investors will start flocking looking for spaces to operate from.
