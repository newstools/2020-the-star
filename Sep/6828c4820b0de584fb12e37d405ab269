The Laikipia county government has published its third annual Statistical Abstract report to improve public finance management and services. It shows Laikipia's County Gross Product (GCP) increased from Sh89 billion in 2018 to Sh98 billion in 2019, before the Covid-19 pandemic. It was praised by the African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM). APRM is a voluntary arrangement amongst African states to systematically assess and review governance at head of state and poor level to promote political stability, accelerated regional and continental economic integration, economic growth and sustainable development. APRM director Peter Kimemia said on Tuesday the 2020 report will help the county develop the County Peer Review Mechanism (CPRM) to improve governance. He said the CPRM will provide a platform for governors to share experience and explore ways of tackling problems in service delivery. "CPRM is a voluntary governance self-assessment to help all governors partner in reducing poverty by creating jobs and raising household income," Kimemia said. He spoke at Governor Ndiritu Muriithi's offices during a workshop on CPRM. CPRM also aims to enhance citizen participation in governance and development and curb misappropriation of public funds. The Laikipia Statistical Abstract was released by Muriithi's administration in collaboration with the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics. (Edited by V. Graham)
