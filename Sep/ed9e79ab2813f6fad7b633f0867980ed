The prices are inclusive of eight per cent VAT in line with the provisions of the Finance Act 2018 and the Tax Laws. The authority said that the changes in this monthâ€™s prices are as a consequence of the average landed cost of imported Super Petrol increasing by 2.65 per cent from 319.23 US Dollars per cubic meter in July to 327.69 US Dollars in August. The new prices will be effected from September 15 to October 14.

Petrol and diesel prices had increased by Sh11.38 and Sh17.30, respectively, in the latest review. Kerosene, used mainly by households for cooking and lighting, had gone up by Sh2.98. EPRA had also refuted claims that a previous error in computing fuel prices led to an increase in pump prices in its last review. There were claims that EPRA under covered VAT tax on super petrol, diesel and kerosene for the June 15 to July 14 cycle, which had to be corrected in the latest pricing review (July-August). It was said to have led to an increase in prices where petrol prices rose by Sh11.38 to sell at the current rate of Sh100.48 per litre in Nairobi while a litre of diesel went up by Sh17.30 to retail at Sh91.87.
