The government on Thursday destroyed over Sh10 million worth of contraband food in Mombasa. The 5,857 cartons of spaghetti and over 6,200 kilograms of rice were impounded in October 2018 in Mombasa by a multi-agency team of DCI detectives and officers from Kenya Bureau of Standards (KEBS) and Kenya Revenue Authority. The 5,857 cartons of spaghetti and over 6,200 kilograms of rice were impounded in October 2018. "The contraband foodstuffs were destroyed in a legal procedure supervised by Coast region officials," the directorate said. This follows the rise in concerns by Kenyans over the quality of food sold in the country. In February, police officers impounded more than 10 tonnes of contraband wheat that were to be sold to unsuspecting Kenyans for consumption in Uasin Gishu. The rotten wheat had been put out to dry in the open next to the National Cereals and Produce Board stores. The suspects were planning to mix it with some good wheat before taking it to the market. Speaking during the crackdown, Health Services executive Everlyne Rotich said that the county government will not entertain people engaging in unscrupulous business, warning that they will be arrested and prosecuted.
