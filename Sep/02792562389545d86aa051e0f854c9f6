Suba North MP Millie Odhiambo has warned Deputy President William Ruto's allies against using her as an example while defending their attacks on President Uhuru Kenyatta. The lawmaker said she would deal with the lot, adding the issues the country faced during her time cannot be compared to ‘people who have just been pinched’. Millie said she would defend the President against such attacks, adding that should the perpetrators continue, she will attack them too.“I want to warn those who have found new ways of using me as an example to abuse the President thinking it is fair for them to do so.” “Let them be brave. If you are pinched, you don’t start abusing the President and his mother in tow.” “I am here to defend the President…stop abusing the President using my name or else I will move from abusing the President to abusing you,” Millie said. She spoke in regards to the verbal slur against the first family by MPs Oscar Sudi (Kapseret) and his Emurua Dikirr counterpart Johanna Ng’eno.
