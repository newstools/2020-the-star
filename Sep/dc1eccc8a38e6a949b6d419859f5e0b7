Healthcare workers can now book tickets get up to 50 per cent off in Business and Economy class, Kenya Airways has said. The national carrier said that the move is to celebrate the Kenya's medical heroes with an exclusive offer. The healthcare workers can book tickets by Sep 30, 2020 to over 20 destinations. For one to be eligible, you must be a front-line health worker with a Health Worker ID which must be shown at the time of purchase and at check-in. You should have a scan of the ID to be sent to the Contact Centre for telephone purchases. The airline noted that up to two free changes are permitted. "Cancellations or refunds before departure permitted free of charge, not permitted after departure," the airline said. For example a flight from JKIA to Mombasa's Moi International is Sh9,670 on economy class. If you are a health worker, you will only pay Sh4,835. From Kisumu to Nairobi the case Sh9,715, health workers will pay  Sh4,857. This comes after Kenya Airways net loss for the six months ended June 2020 widened by 67.3 percent to Sh14.33 billion on account of Covid-19 disruptions that led to the grounding of flights. The national carrier said last week that the passenger numbers dropped by 55.5 percent to 1.1 million in contrast with 2.4 million over the same period last year, hurting revenues. Kenya resumed its domestic and international flights from July. This was after President Uhuru Kenyatta announced that domestic flights will resume on July 15 while international flights will resume on August 1. This will be in strict conformity with all applicable guidelines and protocols from both the Ministry of Health and civil aviation authorities. Uhuru noted that additional requirements applicable at the ports of departure, arrival or transit must be adhered to. In March, the government suspended all international flights in and out of the country.
