Gachanja Kiai learnt and eked a living from the art of words. Whenever he bumped into his friends, he always had a funny story to tell or a joke to crack. Kiai had a way with words. The teacher of literature at Kenyatta University for over three decades died on September 4. He was 60 years old. He was buried on Thursday, September 17, at Nyaribo, Kiganjo in Nyeri county in a ceremony attended by ANC party leader Musalia Mudavadi. Kiai was also a part-time lecturer on gender, literature and history at United States International University since 1995. He is survived by his wife Patricia Wasike, also a lecturer at the University of Nairobi, and four children Wakonyo Ayeko, Nawekulo Wanjugu, Kiai Lusweti and Wambui Ssamanya. His friend Jane Kambuni said whenever they met, Kiai would say something amusing. According to his students, Kiai often said that he believed that he taught literature “because of its beauty as a pathway to the higher knowledge of man commonly called emotions.” “As an, art literature humanises us and as a craft, it cultivates the emotional being at the core of our 'beingness' as humans.” Kiai's students remembered his consummate lectures and philosophy on the decolonial ideologies of Ngugi wa Thiong'o, Okot p'Bitek, a Ugandan poet,  Taban Lo Liyong, a South Sudanese poet, Wole Soyinka of Nigeria as well as Keorapetse Kgositsile of South Africa. Like his brothers Maina Kiai and Mugambi Kiai who are prominent human rights activists in Kenya, the lecturer was a champion of social justice and Pan-Africanism. He was an activist in the lecture halls, using literature as his placard, inciting his students to champion social justice in their fields. His literary philosophy was grounded on Black aesthetics, and he taught books by African authors to espouse their beauty and Pan-Africanism. His colleagues eulogised him as a great champion of African culture and dignity.
