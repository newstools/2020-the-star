Mandera Governor Ali Roba on Thursday suffered a blow after the county assembly committee on appointments declined to vet three CECs, citing a court order. This vetting was halted after former Trade executive Abdiaziz Hussein on August 7 obtained an order from the Employment and Labour Relations Court, stopping the exercise. Hussein was among three executives who were sacked by Roba in February. Others who were fired with Hussein were Johora Abdi (Livestock) and Gender's Shamsa Mohammed. Roba's nominees who were to replace the three are Adan Dagane Hamud (Trade), Nadhifa Ahmed (Gender) and Rahma Abdow (Livestock). Speaker Adan Khalif said on Thursday that after deliberations and wide consultations on the issue, the committee resolved to shelve the vetting drive until the case is heard and determined. “I am in receipt of a court order dated August 7, 2020, issued by the Employment and Labour Relations Court in Nairobi, stopping the ongoing process of vetting and approval of the CEC nominees,”  the letter copied to the chairman committee on appointments read. The letter indicated that members of the public and the nominees will be notified in case the court matter is conclusively resolved. Roba has never commented on the issue since it was taken to court. He has, however, urged residents to hold public servants into account and demand services. Roba said he is keen to deliver the promises he made to residents, warning that he will not hesitate to 'crack the whip if need be'. “Each one of you, be it a CEC, a chief officer, a director or even a cleaner has his job cut out. You know what is required of you at all time. You should remain professional and adhere to set standards,” Roba said. Edited by A.N
