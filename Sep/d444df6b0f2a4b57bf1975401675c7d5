Amnesty International Kenya chairperson on Tuesday failed to take plea after the prosecution failed to approve the charges, saying they failed to meet the threshold. Renee Ngamau was arraigned at Kibera law court after she was arrested and locked up Kilimani police station and later released on a Sh5,000 bail. Ngamau had mobilised Jamhuri residents to protest against a notorious land grabber who is said to have taken over a playground. Police accused her of inciting the residents. "We shall advice the parties at the end of the day but so far, the charges did not meet the required threshold," Kibera senior prosecutor Geoffrey Obiri told the Star. Ngamau was accompanied by lawyer Nelson Havi. "Plea taking did not go on as ODPP had not approved the charge against Ren√©e Ngamau. The prosecutor approved extension of the cash bail until 23rd September, 2020 to give ODPP time to study the file and give directions," Havi said.
