The National Cohesion and Integration Commission has expressed its concern over the recent utterances made by Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi. NCIC implored on all Kenyans to exercise restraint and tolerance as the relevant agencies are looking into the matter. "The Commission is concerned with the utterances that have caused intolerance among a section of Kenyans," NCIC said on Tuesday. Sudi on Monday came out guns blazing to defend his Emurua Dikiir counterpart Johanna Ng’eno following his arrest. Police officers in Transmara East arrested Ng'eno over incitement which he made over the weekend regarding President Uhuru Kenyatta and his family. Agreeing with Ng’eno, Sudi said that it is true that the President has sidelined his deputy even after helping him to win the top seat twice. “I want to tell the president that we do not owe you anything. We voted for you three times, in 2013 and twice n 2017… this country belongs to all Kenyans,” irritated Sudi said. He added that, “You have betrayed and treated William Ruto as somebody who does not deserve anything. He appears cornered as you decide every move.” His utterances have since been condemned by leaders including DP William Ruto. Ruto demanded total respect to President Uhuru Kenyatta from his allies. “...no amount of anger justifies the use of offensive insulting language” to the president. Unsavoury words against mothers and Head of State is a NO, NO. No amount of anger justifies the use of offensive insulting language,” Ruto tweeted on Monday.
