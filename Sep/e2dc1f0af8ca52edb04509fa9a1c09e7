DCI detectives on Thursday arrested a fraud suspect at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport. The suspect identified as Innocent Oundo Sillingi was nabbed while trying to flee to Dubai. According to the Directorate of Criminal Investigations, the suspect was involved in swindling Kenyans of their money amounting to over Sh10 million. "Acting as a director of Project Capital solutions, Sillingi obtained over Sh10 million by falsely pretending he would arrange for letters of credit, discounting of documents facility for suppliers and credit funding programme," the DCI said. "Further, the suspect claimed he would also finance the supply of both the project and working capital under certain terms and conditions. He will be charged accordingly." Via Twitter, the directorate said the suspect had been given a stop order by DCI Headquarters on February 24 which he ignored. The suspect is currently in lawful custody pending arraignment and fraud charges. This comes barely two months after another fraud suspect was arrested in Nyali, Mombasa county. The suspect, alleged to be a notorious fraudster in the area, was nabbed while in his hideout at Beach Road apartments in Nyali. "The 34-year-old suspect is accused of defrauding several individuals cash totaling to more than 11 million shillings. Fahmi is in custody awaiting arraignment," the DCI said in a Twitter post.
