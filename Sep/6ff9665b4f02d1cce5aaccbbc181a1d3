High Court judge John Onyiego has directed DCIO Kilimani to investigate medical reports presented by one of the convicts in the Sh283 million cemetery case. This follows after the DPP told the court that documents produced by Mary Ngethe from Lancet claiming she has been sick could have been forged. The DPP said Ngethe's name does not appear anywhere in Lancet's system as she had earlier alleged. "We received documents from Lancet confirming that lab tests on Ngethe did not emanate from them," the prosecution said. "As such Mary ought to be investigated for committing an offence of perjury and uttering a false document." Ngethe had presented medical reports from Lancet claiming she has been sick. This forced the Judge to delay delivery of the cemetery scam judgement on four occasions. Onyiego, in ordering the investigations, said he has considered the lab report from Lancet dated July 2 this year. He said DCIO kilimani should investigate the issue to confirm whether the document was forged and necessary action be taken afterwards. He also said DPP should follow up the matter. Ngethe, the late John Gakuo and former Permanent Secretary Sammy Kirui were sentenced to three years in jail each and fined Sh1 million each over the cemetery scam. Gakuo passed away last year. Aggrieved with the magistrate's finding, Kirui, Ngethe and Musee appealed at the High Court.
