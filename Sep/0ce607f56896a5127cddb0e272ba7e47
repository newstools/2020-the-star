Deputy President William Ruto's latest move to donate, among other items, wheelbarrows to youths and women groups continues to arouse debate. On Tuesday, the DP met more than 70 youth and women groups from Nairobi during an empowerment event at his Karen home. Ruto gave out a number of items to youths and women, including wheelbarrows saying that it will help them in their daily activities trying to meet their needs. The DP’s action has been criticized by a number of his critics, saying that it will have little impact on the beneficiaries. Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana has, however, defended Ruto, saying that he is using the opportunity to link up with youths. “I don't think Ruto's main agenda is to dish out wheelbarrows etc. He is trying to bond with youth. You see the Wheel Barrow game? Politics of Symbolism,” Kibwana said. Ruto had earlier defended his action, saying that there is a need to change Kenya’s political conversation from power to empowerment and positions to the creation of jobs. The DP said that the insults from his critics will not stop him from reaching out to the youths who need his help. Ruto said that the country can no longer be divided by politicians based on tribes. Recently, the governor joined Ruto during the installation service of Bishop Rev.Joshua Nzau Kimuyu at the African Inland Church in Ziwani, Nairobi. The governor has also expressed his interests for the presidential seat come 2022, which Ruto is also eyeing.
