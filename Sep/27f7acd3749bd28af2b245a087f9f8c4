Isiolo youths in the government-funded Kazi Mtaani programme have opened a savings scheme so they can survive after the project ends. The youths, who earn Sh5,050 each after 11 working days, formed the Next Generation Mfinyanzi Youth Group and contribute at least Sh700 each every time they are paid. The poject started in late April and ends in mid-December. More than 278,000 young men and women are involved; most come from informal settlements. Chairman Boniface Muhuha said at least 17 youths have enrolled in the group that  will allow members to benefit from government funding, such as the Youth Enterprise Development Fund and the Uwezo Fund. They must first list with the Registrar of Societies. “Apart from savings, the group will do table banking. The members also plan to give back to society through projects such as donating sanitary towels to poor girls," Muhuha said. He said through the group the youths will continue positive work, reducing their chances of getting into drugs, illicit sex and crime. Group member Kabale Gollo said most youths end up using their little pay on alcohol and miraa, which is likely to leave them with little or no savngs once the programme ends. The youths urged others in Kazi Mtaani join the group or form similar savings groups. The groups will enable them to save, pool resources and create employment opportunities for themselves. Group patron Warima Mugi said the youths had taken the most appropriate step towards self-reliance. She said they now need to come up with business plans and good proposals enabling them to access more funding and get employment opportunities. There's no shortcut to wealth, she said.
