 A Kiambu court has denied bail to a 60-year-old man who is accused of masquerading as an advocate of the High Court. Kiambu chief magistrate Patricia Gichohi made the ruling in a case in which Ethan Kamau Njagi has been charged with obtaining money from 11 litigants while acting as a lawyer. Njagi denied the 11 counts and his lawyer Kevin Seda pleaded with the court to consider the 60-year-old as vulnerable who might easily contract the Covid-19 virus while in custody. Njagi was charged that between November 2019 and August 2020, in various courts, with intent to defraud, he presented himself as an advocate of the High Court trading as EK Njagi & Company Advocates. Count two stated that between November 2019 and August 2020, within Nairobi and Kiambu counties with intent to defraud, he obtained Sh1.3 million from Stephen Kinuthia by falsely pretending he was an advocate and would represent him in a land matter at Milimani law courts. According to count three, he unlawfully obtained Sh500,000 from Fredrick Njenga purporting he could represent him in a succession case at Kikuyu law courts. In count four, he obtained Sh400,000 from Simon Kamau pretending he could represent him in a land matter at Milimani law courts. Between August 2018 and August 2020 he unlawfully obtained Sh150,000 from Justus Malunda. Njagi allegedly obtained Sh70,000 shillings from Samuel Machira Mugai and Sh45,000 from Julius Ndiritu Kabochi. He also made an application for a registration document purporting to be a genuine document from Ministry of Lands. Njagi was charged with fraudulently uttering a false document and made a court order purporting it to be genuine. He allegedly uttered a forged court order to Fredrick Gichuhi Njenga. Prosecutor Christine Mbevi opposed bail saying the accused was a serial offender and continued to commit more offences while out on bond on similar charges . The matter will be heard on November 12.
