After recovering from an injury that saw him miss out the entire season, Kenya Under-20 international Vincent ‘Crucial’ Wasambo now has to contend with searching for another team after he was deemed surplus to requirement by the Kariobangi Sharks hierarchy. “I am not at Sharks at the moment but I am in contact with several sides but I am yet to make a decision,” said the winger. Wasambo had started imposing himself in William Muluya’s team until the ankle injury forced him to sit out for the whole of last year. Now having fully recovered, the youngster can’t wait to get back to competitive action. “I thank Sharks’ for standing with me throughout my treatment. I am now back strong on my feet and I have resumed training as I wait for my next move,” he remarked. Sharks, according to club captain Eric Juma, are back in training at Utalii. “We have returned to training and everyone is focused on getting ready for the new campaign,” Juma disclosed. Sharks lost midfield enforcer Sven Yidah to Nairobi City Stars and the club are yet to reveal their new acquisitions.
