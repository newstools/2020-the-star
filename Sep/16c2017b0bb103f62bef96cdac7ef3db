Senate Speaker Kenneth Lusaka has called for unity among leaders from Western Kenya so the region can develop faster. Lusaka said leaders have over the years been working at cross-purposes with each other based on their different political affiliations. He said failure to unite has made the area lag behind in development matters. “If we put aside our partisan considerations, then finding solutions to the problems and challenges facing the ordinary citizen at the grassroots will be much easier,”  Lusaka said. Lusaka spoke at the funeral service for Beatrice Chepkurui in Tambolol Village in Kaptama, Mt Elgon Constituency on Saturday. Mama Beatrice, a retired teacher was a long-time principal of Kibuk Girls High School. Dr Margaret Makelo, speaker Lusaka’s wife was among her former students. Western Kenya is sharply divided among leaders that support President Uhuru Kenyatta and his handshake partner and ODM leader Raila Odinga on one hand, and those that support Deputy President William Ruto on the other. In Lusaka's Bungoma county, Governor Wycliffe Wangamati and Kanduyi MP Wafula Wamunyinyi are in the Uhuru- Raila camp. However, MPs Didmus Barasa (Kimilili), Dan Wanyama (Webuye West) and Fred Kapondi (Mt Elgon) — all from Jubilee — are allies of DP Ruto. Also in Tangatanga is Bumula MP Mwambu Mabonga, who was elected as an independent. But Lusaka said the difference in political affiliation should not be the reason for them not working together for the common good voters. Area MP Kapondi, Senator Moses Wetangula, his Trans-Nzoia counterpart Michael Mbito were among the leaders present at the funeral.
