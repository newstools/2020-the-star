Ayiecho Olweny Kisumu ODM County Chairman has said Deputy President William Ruto is welcomed to visit the region. However, Olweny warned him against insulting their party leader Raila Odinga while in the lakeside city. Olweny noted that the DP in most of his events has always insulted Raila and this should not be witnessed within the region. Speaking in Kisumu on Friday accompanied by other party officials, the leaders said they are not scared by Ruto's visit. He also told those willing not to attend his event while in Kisumu should not but those who attend should maintain peace. "If he brings goodies, take them but that does not mean that everyone who attends that function is his supporter" "This is Raila's stronghold and will remain to be so no matter how many visits the DP makes to the region".
