On Saturday morning, hundreds of cyclists held a peaceful ride from CBD to Safari Park along Thika road. The protest was in memory of the 22-years-old cyclist Caleb Omwoyo who died after hitting an instantly stopped bus from Kenya Mpya Sacco on Wednesday. The cyclists carrying charts with different messages protested of reckless driving habits, especially passenger service vehicles. They called upon the Government to introduce a cycling lane in public roads and the need of every motorist to embrace respect for every road user.
