The Directorate of Criminal Investigations wants Kakamega Senator Cleophas Malala charged with giving wrong information about an alleged plot to assassinate him. DCI boss George Kinoti appeared before a joint committee of the Senate on Wednesday and said allegations by Malala were "untrue, malicious and ill-intended". Appearing before the Justice and Legal Affairs Committee and the Security Committee, Kinoti said the morale and reputation of DCI officers had been injured. He added that Malala should have verified and established the authenticity of such information before giving it to the committee. Kinoti further said Malala's lawyers, who authored the information should apologise in both print and electronic media. He added that Eaton Hotel in Thika, where officers were accused of meeting to plan the assassination, does not exist. Kinoti also told the committee the executive lounge at DCI headquarters where officers were accused of meeting does not exist Kinoti appeared before the joint committee together with Inspector General of Police Hillary Mutyambai. In August, Malalah alleged his life was in danger following his stand on the revenue sharing formula. Despite his county standing to gain, the senator stood with losing counties which rejected the formula. The Senate Deputy Minority leader alleged that ‘an assassination secret squad’ was formed to eliminate him. He wrote to Interior CS Fred Matiang'i, Mutyambai and Kinoti to beef up his security and investigate the squad. The vocal lawmaker also wrote to Senate Speaker Kenneth Lusaka over what he termed as real and credible threats to ‘harm, injure, eliminate or assassinate me.’ “I now request your office to take immediate action to enhance the security detail assigned to me, including additional security provided immediately to my family and my residences in Kakamega and Nairobi,” Malala said.
