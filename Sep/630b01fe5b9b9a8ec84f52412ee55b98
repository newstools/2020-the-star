It has emerged that new Nairobi City Stars midfielder Sven Yidah passed on an opportunity to sign a contract extension with Kariobangi Sharks after his deal ended. Yidah surprisingly exited William Muluya’s side to join the promoted City Stars 10 days ago.  “Sven was a very good player for us during the time he was here but for some reason, he did not renew his contract. But that is his decision and I can only wish well in his career,” remarked Sharķs’ vice captain Patila Omoto. Sven’s departure following the exit of experienced shot-stopper John Oyemba has called into question the on field ambition of the club. For the last two years, the club has lost nearly half of their first team squad with Duke Abuya, Sydney Lokale and Ochieng Ovella all departing albeit for greener pastures outside the country. Club chairman, Robert Maoga, has consistently maintained that it is the club’s policy to nurture players with a view of selling them on for profit even at the expense of challenging for honours on the domestic front. Despite the uncertainty surrounding football following Sport CS Amina Mohamed stance that contact sports remain frozen due to health concerns from the coronavirus scourge, Sharks are among teams that have resumed training at their Utalii grounds facilities.
