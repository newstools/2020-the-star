A man charged with possessing 11 rolls of bhang on Wednesday admitted attempting to grievously harm his neighbour. Thomas Joseph Mboya admitted before Kibera senior principal magistrate Derrick Kuto that he attempted to hurt Hawkins Mganga with a kitchen knife at Fort Jesus on August 24. The two are neighbours. Prosecutor Charles Mwangi said Mboya entered Mganga's house intending to commit the offence. However, the complainant blocked him. Mboya said he was remorseful and asked for forgiveness. Kuto directed that a probation report be brought in court on September 18 before his sentencing.
