After DP William Ruto's Kisii tour, his allies say they have taken control of Kisii and Nyamira counties. Speaking in Nyamira town, Ruto's supporters led by Bernard Mogaka said the DP's frequent tours of the region are cementing his popularity ahead of the 2022 presidential contest. “We have taken over the politics of the region and the future is bright, it is about time that we came out and supported the DP's vision for this country," Mogaka said. The DP was in Kisii county on Thursday to raise funds for traders and boda boda operator, among others, in Nyanchwa and Nyamarambe areas in South Mugirango. Clashes between Ruto's supporters and backers of his rivals erupted before the DP arrived on Thursday. Succession politics took centre stage and Ruto warned his challengers to stop using the police to intimidate supporters and instead face him squarely in 2022 “Our country is not short of fools. We need a clear way to run our institutions. Those who think they are fit to battle it out with me should avoid using police forces and intimidation. They should face me at the ballot when the time comes," the DP said. “We are not afraid of any intimidation or threats in our presidential campaign," trader Haron Maina in Nyamira town said. "It is time to break the monopoly by a certain group from some communities who  think they own the presidency,” he said. The DP is wooing the Gusii region, which has been dominated by ODM leader Raila Odinga. (Edited by V. Graham)
