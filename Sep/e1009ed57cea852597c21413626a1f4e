Limuru MP Peter Mwathi has asked the government to offer artisan courses to Kazi Mtaani beneficiaries. He said the courses will support the youths since Kazi Mtaani is scheduled to run for only six months. "We appreciate what our President Uhuru Kenyatta has done. The beneficiaries would be idle in the villages, estates and at home. However, when this programmeÂ  ends, the beneficiaries might be left stranded," the MP said. Mwathi said he visited Housing PS Charles Hinga and they discussed the issue at length. "I'm now asking him to take the matter into consideration, since we do not want to be left with idle people in the villages," the MP said on Friday. Mwathi recommended evening lessons after the workers have done their assignment for the day. The youths work from 8am to 4pm. The lawmaker also urged the government to set aside funds to support beneficiaries start businesses when the initiative comes to an end. "We can have a fund for these people. It can be channelled through constituency offices just like CDF or Uwezo Fund," he said. He spoke at Limuru Model Primary School when he met 75 people who have been selected to receive Uwezo Fund cash.
