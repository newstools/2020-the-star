A company owned by President Uhuru Kenyatta's niece Ziwala Limited has demanded and apology and retraction from NTV for the Covid millionaires story. Ziwala Limited, which is owned by Samantha Ngina Muthama and June Nduta Kinyua, got a Sh84 million contract to supply 120,000 pieces of KN95 face masks at the price of Sh700 a piece. On Monday, Ziwala Limited  said the exposé titled ‘Covid 19 millionaires: corruption and Covid-19 moving at the same pace’ contains unfounded allegations against it. The exposé was aired on NTV Kenya. It mainly talked about how  Kemsa had awarded contracts to supply Covid-19 items. In the demand letter, the company explains that any right-thinking Kenyan who has watched that documentary will imagine that Ziwala stole public funds. “We are instructed that the said defamatory statement is not only misleading, false and malicious but it is also deliberately crafted to injure our client and its directors’ reputation without any factual or legal basis whatsoever,” read the letter in part. The company now wants the media house to retract each and every allegation made against it and publish an unconditional apology. They also want the documentary to be expunged from the media house's website, YouTube page and all other social media platforms including comments. And once all that is done, the company wants the media house to accept liability so that they can agree on damages or any other appropriate remedy. It further threatens legal action in the event the media house fails to do as demanded.
