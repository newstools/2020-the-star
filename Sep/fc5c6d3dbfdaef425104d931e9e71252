Forget masks and social distancing to prevent the spread of Covid-19. That appeared to be the attitude of politicians and supporters on Thursday when Deputy President William Ruto paid a visit to Kisii. Observations, backed by photographs, showed most politicians who attended the function did not wear masks or observe social distancing. That included the Deputy President. Leaders including the DP mingled freely with the crowds in Kisii town and Nyamarambe in South Mugirango. Large crowds turned out and a good number of people did not bother to wear face masks, violating directives issued by the Health ministry to fight the Covid-19 pandemic. Health CAS Rashid Aman has been saying politicians are holding rallies that attract huge crowds - an ideal situation for mass transmission of the airborne virus. The Health ministry has warned politiians against violating Covid-19 protocols. Despite the ministry's directive against shaking hands, there were plenty of handshakes. During the two separate rallies on Thursday, no politician urged people to adhere to health protocols. Those present included Kisii Deputy Governor Joash Maangi, MPs Alfah Miruka (Bomachaoge Chache), Silvanus Osoro (South Mugirango), Innocent Kemosi (West Mugirango) and  John Kiarie (Dagoretti South). The DP was raising funds for women's groups and boda boda operators and to campaign for the presidency in 2022. Speaker after speaker condemned those behind the Kemsa Covid-19 supplies scandal. While not wearing masks, they encouraged everyone to take personal responsibility in fighting the pandemic. Ruto expressed optimism the 'Hustler' team will form the next government and address the country's problems. (Edited by V. Graham)
