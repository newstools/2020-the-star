Kiss FM's Chito Ndhlovu revisited his past as he mourned his mother, who died 20 years ago. Speaking to Word Is, Chito said he wishes to have a normal conversation with her. "I think there is so much I would want to hear from her and ask," he said. "But, I genuinely would want to just talk with her and hear her voice once again. I would especially love to hear her sing. She had such a beautiful voice." Chito also has fond memories of her hugs. "My mum had the warmest hugs, some after whooping my behind, but many out of love. Sometimes I can feel her hug me. Sounds weird, but I can’t explain it." One thing Chito says he dearly holds to his heart and considers a special connection between them is that his mum had a gift of dreams. "She would dream about actual events that would happen and she and my dad would interpret them," he said. "Turns out I have that gift, too. My mum knew through her dreams she was about to die so she prepared herself and told my dad she didn’t want flowers at her grave. Instead, that money for flowers should be put in my education fund."
