Citizen TV's anchor Victoria Rubadiri won the 2020 BBC World News Komla Dumor Award. The award was created to honour Komla Dumor, a presenter for BBC World News, who died suddenly aged 41 in 2014. She is the second Kenyan to win it after Waihiga Mwaura. Rubadiri will begin her three-month placement at the BBC by attending a training course with the BBC Academy before joining BBC News teams across TV, radio and online. This will provide her with the opportunity to gain skills and experience across BBC News platforms. Speaking to Word Is, Rubadiri said she hopes to tell stories at a larger scale and diversify the kind of stories she tells. "I want to do more Africa-wide and global storytelling. To me that is certainly growth and would be a new challenge compared to what I have been doing in the past," she said. "It is still telling stories but in a different platform and a different format but time will tell." Rubadiri said remaining curious and wanting to ask more has helped her in the field of her career as a journalist. "I would advise journalists to always remain curious about the world around them by constantly asking questions without taking anything in wholesale," she said. She added that it is always important to understand the huge responsibility every journalist has by the virtue of holding the title 'journalist'. Rubadiri says highlighting the experiences of women who had cervical cancer through one of her stories, ‘Wombs of Sorrow’, spoke the most to her. The story ended up winning a Kuza Award from the Communications Authority. "However, a few days before that, one of the women called Rose, who I featured, had succumbed to cervical cancer," she said. "It was devastating news, but my last memory of Rose was of her championing the cause for more women to get screened for cervical cancer. She spent her last days trying to save the lives of other women. Her family has been her biggest cheerleader throughout.
