A day after skipping the national Covid-19 conference chaired by President Uhuru Kenyatta, Deputy President William Ruto was back to dishing out 'hustler' goodies to youths at his Karen residence in Nairobi. Ruto was absent during the conference in which Uhuru announced an extension of the curfew for 60 days as well as reopening of bars. Some of the DP's allies said it was hypocritical for Ruto to be invited to the national conference yet he had been locked out of other meetings. On Tuesday, the DP distributed several items, including wheelbarrows, to youths and women, and said, “Every hustle matters, creating and expanding each opportunity is a chance to make many dreams come true.” The group urged the DP to participate in a dance challenge which he did. Ruto took on the challenge in the dance before sitting on a wheelbarrow and being 'driven' a few metres. The DP said that the insults from his critics will not stop him from reaching out to the youths who need his help. Ruto said that the country can no longer be divided by politicians based on tribes. Also, Ruto said that a section of leaders has been taking the advantage of the poor Kenyans for their benefit for a long time. "You have been beneficiaries of the narrative of impunity...gone are the days when the rich used to benefit from the poor people in the society." Langata MP Nixon Korir, Reuben Kiarie (Dagoretti South), Aisha Jumwa (Malindi), Didimus Barasa (Kimilili), and nominated Senator Milicent Omanga are among the politicians who were present. Bishop Margret Wanjiru also was present, calling upon Kenyans to desist from politics of ethnicity. Kimilili MP said criticised the second round of Huduma Number, saying that some individuals in the government are planning to benefit through it.
