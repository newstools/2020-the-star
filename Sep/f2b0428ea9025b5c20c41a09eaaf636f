Rapper King Kaka has signed three artistes under Kaka Empire. The trio, whom he calls Jadi, will be singing Rnb music. Speaking to Word Is about his new signees, King Kaka said he did an online competition and the three, Ethan, Brandon and Vince, tied, so he formed the band 'Jadi'. "I am just guiding them to do what they love already," he said. The band has been consistently releasing singles since last year, with 'Sleki' being their fifth single. Their music is beautifully written, catchy and reflects the lives of typical Kenyan youth. 'Sleki' is produced by Bern Music and mastered by Jadiâ€™s own Ethan. The visuals, which tell the story of young love, are directed by CJ Pixels. It is a song about someone who is hypnotised with the love of a Nairobi girl and speaks of the confidence in the protagonist to give the best loving to their partner.. Speaking to Word Is, the trio said they have a music background. Vince started singing in church as his dad is a reverend. Brandon was raised in a musical family. "I have been a fan of Sauti Sol's music and one day, I found myself jamming to one of their songs," Brandon said. Ethan said his mother inspired him since she sings in the church choir. "Our music is all about love and passion, and so we want to spread love through music," he said.
