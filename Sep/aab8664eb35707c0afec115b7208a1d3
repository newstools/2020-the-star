Aga Khan University Hospital in Nairobi has been accredited as a centre of excellence for the management of heart attacks. It becomes the first hospital in sub-Saharan Africa and second in Africa to achieve this certification, given by the Joint Commission International, a leader in health quality standards. The certification followed a clinical care programme certification audit conducted by the JCI in August. Aga Khan received the certificate based on a review of compliance with international standards, clinical guidelines and outcomes of care. "This accreditation testifies to our commitment to provide quality patient care guided by patient safety standards and aimed at good health outcomes," the hospital said in a statement. "It is testament that even during times of unprecedented adversities such as the Covid-19 pandemic, the hospital does not deviate from its commitment to provide quality patient care." The hospital said it has adopted international standards that provide for standardisation of cardiac care and continuous evaluation of health outcomes in the management of heart attacks. The care will be provided in a patient-centred setting by engaging patients and family members regularly for feedback that will be used to improve the programme. "Joint Commission Accreditation and certification means an organisation complies with the highest standards for safety and quality of care and is committed to continually improving patient care," the facility said. It became the first hospital in the region to receive the JCI accreditation in 2013, an accreditation that is reassessed every three years. In 2018, the hospitalâ€™s laboratory was accredited by the College of American Pathologists.  Edited by R.Wamochie
