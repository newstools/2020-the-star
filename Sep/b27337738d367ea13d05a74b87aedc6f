ODM party is now seeking government protection for Migori MCAs who voted for the impeachment of governor Okoth Obado on Tuesday. In a statement on Thursday, party chairman John Mbadi said,"We urge the government to ensure the security of Migori MCs and protect them from any form of intimidation and blackmail." Mbadi noted that the party will publish names of Migori officials including MCAs and CECs with alleged involvement in diverting county funds to bribe MCAs. "Those CECS, directors, suppliers, contractors and county assembly officials are cuurently holed up in Nairobi, Kisumu and Migori. As soon as we forward those names, we will expect police to act with speed to arrest the individuals," he said. This comes as 37 out of 41 ODM MCAs resolved to impeach Obado due to his existing corruption case. Obado was on Friday arraigned alongside his four children and seven others to answer charges of graft over loss of Sh73.4 million county funds. They were released on bail with a raft of strict terms including being barred from the county office. Obado is allegedly trying to convene a cabinet meeting at his home to try to salvage his impending removal from office. He is accused of undermining his deputy Nelson Mahanga  from taking over management of the county. Mbadi noted that Obado is trying to 'twist facts and seek sympathy by trying to turn his case into a case of alleged witch hunt". The embattled governor had blogged from prison cells accusing Senator Ochilo Ayacko and other county leaders of planning his impeachment. He claims the party has no numbers to kick him out. "It is the anti-corruption court, not ODM that ruled two days ago that Obado must not step in office until the case against him is concluded," Mbadi said. "We believe the case presented before the court is serious enough to warrant the governor's removal from office."
