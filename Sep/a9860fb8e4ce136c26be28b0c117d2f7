A five-year-old-girl has died while receiving treatment at Mwangulu dispensary after being defiled by an unknown person in Lunga Lunga subcounty. The girl was reportedly defiled on Monday at Tsagulani village at around 11am. Kwale police confirmed the tragic incident. The girl was found by her parents lying unconscious outside their home in the afternoon. They rushed her for treatment before reporting the matter to Mwangulu police station. The parents had gone for work when the incident happened. Speaking on the phone the girl’s uncle, Balozi Mwabengo, said no suspect has been arrested. "It is sad that until now, we have no clue to who did the cruel act,” Mwabengo said. Between March and June, over 18 defilement cases have reported in Kwale, residents say. The family is now demanding justice for the girl. Kwale county police commander Joseph Nthenge has strongly condemned the act. The girl was to be buried on Tuesday evening even as police launch investigations.
