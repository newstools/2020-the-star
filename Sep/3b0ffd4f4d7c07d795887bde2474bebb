An audit report on the operations of three collective management organisations has been handed to the Kenya Copyright Board. Kecobo ordered a forensic audit for 2017-2019 to establish a better system of royalty management. The organisations audited are Music Copyright Society of Kenya, Performers Rights Society of Kenya and Kenya Association of Music Producers. The audit is meant to end the mismanagement of funds and ensure accountability as part of reforms in the CMOs. The report was handed to chairman Mutuma Mathiu and the board of directors on Tuesday. Kecobo executive director Edward Sigei said the audit was guided by the Copyright Act and other laws. "The same shall guide the actions of the Kecobo board of directors with regards to the implementation of the final forensic audit report," he said.
