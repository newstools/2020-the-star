World Steeplechase 3,000m steeplechase champion and record holder Beatrice Chepkoech's poor form persisted as she played second fiddle to Hyvin Kiyeng  at the ISTAFathletics meeting in Berlin on Sunday. Chepkoech, who finished sixth in Monaco in the 5,000m  last month posted 9:10.07 to place second with former world champion Kiyeng winning the event in 9:06.14. Marusa Mismas broke her own Slovenia national record in 9:20.68 to finish third with Mercy Chepkurui ninth in 9:45.70. In other races, Norway's Karsten Warholm wrote a piece of ISTAF history by breaking the 40-year-old meeting record set by 400m hurdles legend Edwin Moses. The Norwegian stormed to a 47.08 victory in the 400m Hurdles during the Continental Tour Silver meeting, the 9th fastest performance ever run. Estonia’s Rasmus Magi was second in 49.22 with David Kendziera of the US third in 50.28. Laura Muir of Great Britain took the 1,500m honours in style. She ran away from the field and holding on after the pacemaker dropped out at the 1000m mark. The Scot clocked 3:57.40— improving her own world lead and breaking the ISTAF record of 3:58.43. Behind her, fellow Briton Laura Weightman clocked a personal best of 4:00.09 while Australia’s Jessica Hull ran a 4:00.42 Oceania record to complete the podium. There was a surprise in the discus throw where Andrius Gudzius of Lithuania won with 66.72m, handing Daniel Stahl his first defeat after 15 straight victories.
