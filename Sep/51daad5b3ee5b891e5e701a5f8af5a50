Kenya lost its first male Taekwondo athlete representative at the 2008 Beijing Olympics on September 6. Dickson Wamwiri, 35, died after collapsing in his house in Waithaka, Nairobi, and was laid to rest at his home in Kikuyu on Friday last week. Family members and friends remembered Dickson for his patriotism. Nairobi Taekwondo chairperson Master Voiya Lumwach said, "Dickson was a selfless being who nurtured and mentored many talents. We will hold a tournament coming next year in honour and memory of our late hero. May his soul rest in eternal peace."
