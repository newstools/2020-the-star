Garissa governor Ali Korane's bail ruling has been pushed to 10am. Korane was accused of misappropriating part ofÂ Sh233 million from the World Bank-funded Kenya Urban Support Programme. The governor and four others have been charged with conspiracy to commit an economic crime of fraud. They have denied the charge before Chief Magistrate Douglas Ogoti . Korane has also been charged with willful failure to comply with the law relating to management of funds. The prosecution is not opposing bail but asked the court to give the accused stringent bail terms. Assistant DPP Alexander Muteti asked the court to bar the governor and the other accused from accessing their offices. Muteti says being barred from office does not amount to removal from office but it's just the Governor being denied access. But Korane's lawyer Ahmednasir Abdullahi asked the court to grant his client reasonable bail. He argues that the prosecution cannot give conditions to the release of the accused saying the court should consider the presumption of innocence of the accused persons. "There is no crime in this charge sheet. There is no charge that says money was lost or stolen. We will show in trial that there is no offense as claimed by the prosecution," he said. "It's unfortunate that there is no evidence at this stage so that we can show the court." The Chief Magistrate will make a bail ruling at 10.15 am.
