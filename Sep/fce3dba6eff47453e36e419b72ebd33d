The Education ministry should gradually reopen learning institutions, Emuhaya MP Omboko Milemba has proposed. He expressed concern that learners have overstayed at home and there is a need for them to resume learning but in a phased manner. Learning institutions were shut down in early march after the outbreak of Covid-19 in the country to curb its spread. The lawmaker said, however, that the Ministry of Health should guide the Education ministry on how the process should start. “The ministries of Health and Education should conduct proper assessment on the Covid-19 pandemic countrywide first,” Milemba said. "We can start with candidates in Class 8 and Form 4 resuming as we put measures in place. There is no need of keeping these learners at home for such a long time in the name of Covid-19." Milemba urged the Education and Health ministries to work closely to ensure learning institutions meet safety requirements before classes resume. The remarks came even as the Education ministry consults on the way forward. Milemba spoke at KIMA Mission during the funeral service for the late Archbishop Byrum Makokha who was laid to rest at his home in Ibubi village, Vihiga county. "We are not interested in issues of examinations. It’s all about the safety of our children and that's why we want clear measures on resuming activities within our institutions of learning countrywide,” he said.
