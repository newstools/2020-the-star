The Attorney General has opposed a petition filed by a city lawyer seeking to have 41 judges assume office without the President's approval. The AG says the issues raised by Adrian Kamotho in his petition have been tried by a competent court and therefore cannot be pursued further by the same parties. He also says that Kamotho's petition is bad in law as he has a similar case that is yet to be decided. In the current case, Kamotho wants the tradition of taking the oath of office before the head of state to be left out. He claims that since the judges got nominated by the Judicial Service Commission (JSC) for appointment on July 22, 2019, and the President delayed to facilitate their swearing-in, the appointments have ripened "by operation of law". The 18-page petition indicates that the President cannot legally appoint the 41 judges, having failed to do so within 14 days. He has listed the 41 appointees as interested parties in the case as well as the Chief Justice David Maraga. On February 6, a three-judge bench ruled that the delay by President Uhuru Kenyatta to appoint the 41 judges was unconstitutional. Judges Lydia Achode, Chacha Mwita and James Makau said Uhuru was constitutionally bound by the recommendations of the JSC on persons to be appointed. The court determined that the appointment of judges by the President should be immediate after the recommendations are forwarded to him by the JSC. The court further held that the reasonable time contemplated by the Constitution is 14 days from the date the recommendations are forwarded. Edited by A.N
