Police in Naivasha are investigating the death of the flower farm worker whose body was found in his house in Karagita Estate by relatives. The worker is suspected to have been poisoned in one of the bars and collapsed in his single-room house where the body was recovered on Wednesday morning. Witness Allan Kung’u said the man was last seen in one of the bars on Tuesday evening before his body was found with foam around his mouth. “From the initial investigations, it’s evident that he was poisoned but police have picked the body ahead of a postmortem,” he said. Elsewhere, a swimming expedition in a flooded pan in Naivasha ended on a sour note after one minor drowned. During the incident in Kinamba village off the Naivasha-Kirima road, two other minors were rescued in time from the pan in one of the private farms. Local leader Samuel Ngugi said the water pan had been fenced adding that the minors could have got access through the fence. He said neighbours were attracted to the scene by screams from the minors. They found the body of the three-year-old floating. “Those who arrived at the scene did their best that they could but the minor was pronounced dead on arrival at the nearby health center,” he said. Naivasha OCPD Samuel Waweru confirmed both cases adding that the bodies had been collected and taken to the area mortuary. “In both cases, we have opened inquest files and we shall conduct a postmortem on the body of the flower farm worker to determine if he was poisoned,” he said.
