A Makadara court has ordered the Independent Policing Oversight Authority to investigate the officer in charge of Embakasi police station over brutality allegations. The order followed claims by suspect Jefferns Kitemi Kiema that the OCS Moses Wanyama and other officers subjected him to beatings and threatened to kill him. “My whole body is aching. I was beaten like a dog, and they have now imposed false charges against me. They told me there is nowhere I can take them and I will not be the first one to be killed,” Kiema told senior principal magistrate Angelo Kithinji as he undressed to expose wounds on his back and neck. He has been charged with maliciously damaging the OCS's swagger cane on September 12 in Pipeline, Embakasi. He is also accused of obstructing a police officer from executing his duties. Court documents indicated that the incident occurred on Saturday at 10.30pm as Embakasi division officers were enforcing the curfew. At Pipeline, according to the documents, the officers found a car parked in the middle of the road, thus blocking their lorry. Four officers then alighted to investigate what the problem was. Kiema came out of the car, allegedly drunk and arrogant to the officers. The OCS joined the officers in questioning the accused. That was when he allegedly snatched the swagger cane and broke it. Kiema denied the charges, but admitted being out during curfew hours. He said he has been in pain and had not received treatment since his arrest. The magistrate told the Ipoa to investigate Kiema’s claims and file a report in court by September 28. “I have ordered the police internal affairs to investigate your claims. It’s most unlikely that you will find justice if the matter is handled by the same officers,” Kithinji said. Kiema was freed on Sh5,000 bail.
