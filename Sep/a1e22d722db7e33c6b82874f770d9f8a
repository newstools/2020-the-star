Wasafi signee Zuchu has addressed rumours regarding her career and new music with her boss Diamond Platnumz. Zuchu was signed by Diamond’s record label Wasafi Records this year, and she has since found herself trending for the wrong reasons. In an interview with Wasafi media, Zuchu denied rumours she is sleeping with her boss, and that it is the reason he ditched his baby mama Tanasha Donna. She said her relationship with Diamond is work-based and once outside the studio, Diamond becomes her big brother. It has never been sexual. "Ukaribu wangu na boss wangu Diamond Platnumz ni kwa ajili ya kazi, anatumia muda mwingi kunipromote," she said. "Hajawahi hata kunionyesha dalili za kunitaka, he is like a brother to me. Ni ngumu sana kucheza vile na mtu ambae unamuheshimu. Lakini nashukuru Boss Sallam SK alisaidia kunifanya niwe comfortable." Zuchu has done several songs with Diamond, including 'Cheche', which has been pulled down from YouTube due to copyright issues. Tanasha had claimed Zuchu stole her lyrics. Zuchu, however, said she did the song in Spanish not to keep up with Tanasha but rather the beat drove her into that direction. “Idea ya kuimba kihispania ilikuja baada ya kusikiliza beat la wimbo wa 'Cheche'. Sikumuiga Tanasha,” she said.
