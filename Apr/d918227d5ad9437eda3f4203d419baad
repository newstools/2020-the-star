A woman and her young son were on Monday morning found stabbed and their bodies set on fire in Karagoini village, Ndaragwa. Police initially thought the fire was an accident but realised it was arson when they found the door to the woman's bedroom locked. The partially burnt body of Margaret Wairimu, 30, was on the bed with only her underpants on. She had multiple stab wounds in the head. The body of her seven-year-old son, Jeremiah Maina, was burnt beyond recognition. He was a Grade 2 pupil at Michinda Primary School, Ndaragwa. Police said it appears he was trying to run out but found the door locked from outside. “It is clear someone killed the woman, and then set the house on fire before locking it in an attempt to cover up,” Nyandarua county police commander Gideon Ngumi said. He said no suspect had been arrested, but police were looking for Wairimu’s lover, who lived with her. Ngumi said the man was spotted by neighbours leaving the house on Sunday evening “very angry and making noise”. No murder weapon was found at the scene. The bodies were moved to Nyahururu Referral Hospital mortuary. Leshau Pondo MCA Kamau Gathungu, who visited the scene, said there was blood on the seat in Wairimu's bedroom. He said the lights were still on. Mbogo is the third young mother to be killed in Nyandarua in one month. On March 25, a killer or killers burrowed under the house of Alice Wanjiru, 23, and killed her in her bedroom at Gatumbiro, Ol Joro Orok. She was a mother of one. Last Thursday, also at Gatumbiro, Eunice Muthoni, 30, and her five-year-old daughter were killed by a killer or killers who burrowed their way into the woman's house. Another daughter aged 13 and niece aged 17 are admitted at Nakuru PGH, where they were rushed in critical condition. Police last week denied the theory that a serial killer could be targeting women.  No arrests have been made in connection with the murders. Edited by Josephine M. Mayuya
