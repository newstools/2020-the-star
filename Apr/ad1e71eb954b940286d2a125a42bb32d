The Kenya Revenue Authority has appointed Pamela Ahago as Acting Commissioner for Customs and Border Control. The statement from the authority means that Ahago will replace Kevin Safari who is facing charges over misuse of his office. Her appointment was effected on April 25 after the authority sent Safari on a three-month leave. Before her appointment, Ahago served as a Deputy Commissioner, Policy and International Affairs from July 2019. Congratulating Ahago on her appointment, KRA Commissioner General Githii Mburu has asked the staff to fully support her. Ahago is a trained negotiator with experience in regional and international negotiations and has represented KRA in regional and international negotiations on trade. She has also worked with the World Customs Organisation as head of Regional Intelligence Liaison in the formation of both the East Africa Community as well as COMESA. In March, Safari was arrested together with Kenya Ports Authority managing director Daniel Manduku. The two were arrested by the DCI after months of investigations into leased extra storage space for containers by the agency. They were detained at the DIC headquarters along Kiambu Road before being moved to Muthaiga police station. The duo was to be arraigned today to face graft charges related to the Inland Container Depot scandal. But when they were presented before the senior Principal magistrate Kennedy Cheruiyot, the judge said he was surprised because their file was not on his list.
