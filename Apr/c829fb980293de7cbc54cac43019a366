More than 1,500 vulnerable and needy people in Homa Bay have benefited from food and non-food items donated by businessman Jared Kiasa. The donation was distributed to already needy people in seven out of eight constituencies to cushion the residents from adverse impacts of Covid-19. Through his Jared Otieno Foundation, Kiasa works with local administrators and opinion leaders across the county to identify the beneficiaries, who are mostly elderly persons, and persons living with disabilities. On Friday and Saturday, he distributed rice, maize flour, sugar, cooking oil and bars of soap in Suba South, Kabondo Kasipul, Ndhiwa and Rangwe constituencies. Kiasa started the initiative after President Uhuru Kenyatta appealed to well-wishers to support the vulnerable people in the society. “Covid-19 has interfered with the economy. Elderly persons and other needy people need assistance so they don’t suffer as the government fights the virus,” Kiasa said. Speaking at Genga chief’s camp in Rangwe town, Homa Bay Youth for Change Movement headed by Chairman Ely Oyier, co-coordinator Hezron Orata and his deputy Helen Ayugi, said many elderly people suffer in silence a result of food shortage. Oyier said their objective is to ensure Homa Bay residents survive during the pandemic. “We still don’t know where Covid-19 will take us but it’s important to reach out to vulnerable persons with any support available to improve their lives,” Oyier said. Oyier and Ayugi challenged leaders in the county to come out and support the county residents. “Our journey in distribution of the relief food has made us realise that Covid-19 has negatively affected many people. This initiative is making impact on their lives,” he said. Ayugi expressed concerns on how women were suffering in the area.
