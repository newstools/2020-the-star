Lovers Amberay and Brown Mauzo have not been in communication for days, a close source has told Word Is. Last year, Brown and Amberay were seen together in public, getting cosy. And after a few weeks of denying it, they later confirmed they were lovers. Ray shared a video dancing to Mauzo’s new song featuring Jovial, 'Tujenge', and wrote on Instagram: "Just here, feeling myself. Can someone please tell brown mauzo awache makasiriko?" Last year, Brown confirmed he and Ray were an item. “Love you like a fat kid loves cake," Mauzo said. Ray responded, “Thank you for loving me, I love you more, honey.” Ray has previously dated businessman-cum-singer Syd Kenya and businessman Zaheer Jhanda. Brown Mauzo was rumoured to have dated singer Akothee after a photo of the two kissing went viral.
