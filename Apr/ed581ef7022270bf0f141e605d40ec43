There will be no curfew extension for Muslims during the month of Ramadan, President Uhuru Kenyatta has said. The President maintained that just like Christians who were forced to mark Easter celebrations at their homes, Muslims should not expect special treatment during the holy month. He, however, acknowledged the two events as very important in both Muslims and Christians’ calendars but asked for understanding saying the country is currently faced with unprecedented health challenges. “Same to what we told Christians during Easter, this year is a special year. Everyone to celebrate at home. Muslims should follow suit and know that this is a special year,” Uhuru said at State House Wednesday morning. “Let us agree that this year we will not do things normally. Easter and Ramadan are major events to both Christians and Muslims.” Muslims will start observing the holy month from Thursday (April 23) through to May 23. The President spoke when he gave a live interview to a number of local radio stations at State House on Wednesday. Muslim clerics and a section of leaders from the Coast had appealed to the government to consider extending the curfew period from 7 pm to 9 pm to allow for Iftar celebrations. Currently, there is an existing 7 pm to 5 am nationwide. President Uhuru ordered the dusk-to-dawn curfew as part of preventive measures aimed at containing the spread of the virus in the country. Two weeks ago, Christian faithful celebrated a low-key Easter with the majority following broadcasted Easter mass and services from their homes.
