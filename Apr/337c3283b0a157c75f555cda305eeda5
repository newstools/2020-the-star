A court has fined a mechanic Sh500,000 for stealing a radiator and other items worth Sh1.4 million from a bus he was repairing. If he cannot pay up, Simon Mandera will serve a one-year sentence. Kibera senior resident magistrate Renee Kitagwa said the prosecution had proved the case against him. Court documents say Mandera committed the offence between July 10 and November 12, 2018, in Madaraka Estate in Lang’ata subcounty. Other items he stole were an inter-cooler DIMS 1 turbocharger, a control box, a gear lever and a motor vehicle water pump. Complainant Jairus Muaka told the court he took the bus to the garage for repairs. "It had a problem with pressure which affected the brakes and the bus needed painting," he said. The mechanical problem was resolved but the painting was not done and items went missing. "All through this period the accused continued to play games on me in the form of plans to return the items," he said. Investigating officer F.Odhiambo from the Directorate of Criminal Investigation presented photo evidence in court. Ronald Mwangi, a mechanic at the garage, said a colleague alerted him that the accused had taken away a radiator from the bus KBY874G. Mwangi told the court that Mandera confirmed that he had taken the radiator with authority from the owner so that he could wash it. "I went and checked the vehicle and realised that apart from the radiator, the turbocharger was missing too.” Mandera denied stealing the items. He said he was told to remove the radiator and deliver it to another mechanic at the country bus station. While there, he received a call from the police accusing him of theft. He called Muaka and informed him to go for the radiator but he did not. Mandera was later arrested. Mandera said he was the breadwinner of his family and pleaded for a lenient sentence. (edited by o. owino)
