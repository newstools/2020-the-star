More than 20 people were arrested and arraigned for violating the Covid-19 health regulations in Kabarnet town on Tuesday. The suspects were found selling and buying goods in the market, walking and some hugging and talking close to each other mouth without face masks. Authorities said they also violated social distancing rules. "Our officers shall continue arresting anybody found violating the measures put by the government to control the spread of coronavirus” Baringo Central police boss Francis Gachoki said. The arrests came just three days after Baringo county leaders led by Governor Stanley Kiptis mobbed-up crowds in Kabarnet town to demand the immediate transfer of county commissioner Henry Wafula over the arrest of Bartabwa MCA Reuben Chepsongol on Saturday. Gachoki said the suspects were arrested around 10.30am. They all pleaded guilty and were fined Sh500 fine and Sh1,000 each for those found to have breached more than one regulation. Failure to pay the fine would attract 14-day imprisonment. Resident magistrate Viena Amboko the offenders shall serve a warning to those still breaking the rules put by the state to combat the spread of the coronavirus. “They will face the charges for failing to follow Covid-19 rules of wearing masks and maintaining social distance,” Amboko said. Some of the suspects said they were not aware of the health regulations had been enacted into law. “You now know you have broken the law and each of you should learn to put on a mask, it is sold at Sh50 in the market and you will keep your social contacts safe from contracting Covid-19,” the magistrate said. Meanwhile, a 68-year old man was charged in the same court for allegedly defiling a five-year-old girl. Amboko heard that Michael Chebotibin committed the offence at Katibel in Baringo North subcounty on April 4. The accused pleaded not guilty and was granted an Sh00,000 bond with a surety of similar amount. The hearing is scheduled for May 7. Edited by Peter Obuya
