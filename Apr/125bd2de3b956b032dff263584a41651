Tension gripped a Kibera court on Wednesday after a lawyer sought the release of his client on bond, saying he had shown symptoms of Covid-19. Lawyer Robert Odanga also said that Bernard Furaha had been badly assaulted by police while in custody. He presented medical documents showing that his client was unwell. Furaha is charged alongside Kevin Muligwa and Evans Ochieng with violently robbing Rahab Wanjiku Nyoro of Sh206,500 and two mobile phones, all valued at Sh234,500. They denied the charges. Odanga said, “Your honour my client has been subjected to beatings and sufferings. He also needs to be taken to a well-equipped hospital so that he can be tested for Covid-19.” But the prosecution said the accused had experienced difficulties  breathing because he was asthmatic. “From the documents, the accused person is asthmatic but not a Covid-19 suspect as alleged,” the prosecutor said. Magistrate Renee Kitagwa ordered a 30-minute break after the lawyer's claims. The magistrate also ordered Bernard to remove his shirt to ascertain the injuries at the request of lawyer Odanga. This followed the prosecution's assertion that the Kabete OCS was not aware of such assault. Odanga asked for reasonable bond terms for his client, adding that  he was not a flight risk. Kitagwa released the three on Sh200,000 bond or Sh100,000 bail with the surety in same amount. The case will be heard on July 2. Edited by A.N
