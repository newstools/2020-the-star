A cross-border manhunt has started for a Tanzanian fisherman suspected of stealing a fishing boat and equipment from a Lake Victoria beach. The 30-year-old Tanzanian is from Nyarombo village in Shirati town of Mara province in Tanzania. He has been working on Kibro beach in Muhuru Bay for some weeks now. The man is believed to have stolen the Sh350,000 items at dawn on Monday. “The owner of the 32 feet boat had prepared for a fishing expedition at 5am. The man came to the beach at dawn and sailed away,” Kibro Beach Management Unit chairman Joel Maulidi said. The boat was worth Sh90,000, while the 25 horsepower engine was worth Sh250,000. The boat owner also had Sh10,000 freshwater shrimps and small fish that were to be used as bait. “He also took away food and cooking utensils worth Sh4,000 that were to be used by fishermen in the two-day expedition,” Maulidi said. Chief Thomas Ungwe said they have already alerted police and BMU on both countries. “We are keen on ensuring he is arrested on whichever beach he lands and he should be taken to court,” Ungwe said.
