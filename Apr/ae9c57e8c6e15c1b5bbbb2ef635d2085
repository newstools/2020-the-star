Businesses and organisations are trying their best to keep the need for human interaction at a minimum to prevent the spread of coronavirus. Nutritionist Gladys Mugambi stresses the need to take precautions to minimise your direct contact with the packaging itself. These are outlined below. Avoid direct contact with delivery personnel Most of these delivery services have rolled out new features to make the delivery process much safer, with clear options for "contactless" delivery. If you're calling a local restaurant to arrange delivery, ask them upfront to keep your delivery contactless if possible. Place the delivery bag in your sink Once you get the product you ordered for, take it and put it the sink to disinfect it. You can as well remove every package in the bag and wash them or wipe them. This is because the virus stays in surfaces for more than 24 hours. Transfer your food to another clean container in your kitchen. "When the items are delivered, remove the packaging and pour the contents into a clean bowl before consumption," Mugambi says. This will enable you to avoid touching the food directly. Use a clean utensil instead. Wash your hands You will need to wash your hands for at least 20 seconds before you sit down to eat your meal. At some point, you should also wipe down your sink with a disinfecting wipe. "Wash your hands at every chance you get. I would suggest soap and water rather than sanitisers," she said. Wear gloves As a delivery person, you should wear gloves and face masks to prevent the spread of the disease. Also, since you won't be able to wash your hands immediately, wearing gloves is a good way to avoid touching contaminated surfaces while you are outside. If you're not equipped with gloves, you can use hand sanitiser to hold you over until you reach a sink.
