Health CS Mutahi Kagwe has urged medical teams to extend the quarantine period for individuals who need another 14 days if their contacts have tested positive. While briefing reporters on the coronavirus on Saturday, Kagwe also warned against social gatherings, saying they were still prohibited. "For some wild reason, there is a relaxed atmosphere for people gathering in groups. There is a government directive, against gathering anywhere. We have heard rumours of a group of over 6,000 people who intend to gather and such a gathering will not take place," he said during the briefing at Afya House in Nairobi. Kagwe said measures the government has taken to curb the spread of coronavirus, including the dusk-to-dawn curfew, were beginning to bear fruits. "The whole idea of a curfew is to create social distancing. Curfew is a way of ensuring we reduce the numbers and we are confident itâ€™s having an effect," he said. The curfew starts at 7 pm and ends at 5 am. Anyone found outside will have to answer to the authorities, Kagwe said. The government on Saturday announced four more confirmed case of coronavirus, bringing the total to 126. The four are three Kenyans and one Pakistani national. "Two of the new cases travelled from Malawi and Pakistan while the other two contracted the virus locally," Kagwe said. Their ages range from 34 and 44 years. Three of them are male.
