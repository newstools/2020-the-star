The indefinite suspension of sporting activities due to coronavirus pandemic has enabled seasoned Blazers’ striker Jacqueline Mwangi to step up her recovery from an ankle injury sustained two months ago. Mwangi, who doubles up as the national team coach, fractured her ankle eight weeks ago and missed the team’s 1-0 season narrow win in their opening match against USIU-A Spartans early last month. Mwangi was the leading scorer last season with eight goals as record-breaking Blazers won their 22nd title. She begins her rehabilitation this week though she won’t be in a hurry to return. This is the second bad injury for the former international. The shrewd forward tore her left knee meniscus 15 years ago while in the United States and spend three months on the sidelines. “Despite the negative toll the pandemic has had, for me, it has been positive as it has afforded me time to recover slowly but steadily. Sometimes you do not know how your body responds after an injury but I am optimistic that all will be well. This week will be vital as my rehab begins but I will be cautious not to rush things. The best thing is to take it slow and see how my body responds.” Mwangi chairs the African Hockey Federation Athletes’ Committee. With added responsibility, she said she will play when needed and wants the younger players at the club to step up and seize the opportunity to become better players through hard work when the league resumes.
