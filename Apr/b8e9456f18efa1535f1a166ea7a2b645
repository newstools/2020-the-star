The Kisumu government is installing three high mast floodlights in Manyatta slums at a cost of Sh5 million. They will be set up in Gonda, Magadi unit, and Kondele to improve security. Kondele MCA Joachim Oketch, alias Swagga, on Friday said the lighting project will boost security in those areas. “Those living in these areas have been complaining of being robbed. We hope the installation of the lights will boost the security of our people,” Oketch said. The project, which is fully funded by the county government, is expected to be completed in four weeks. Oketch appealed to city manager Doris Ombara to work closely with Kenya Power to ensure all streetlights are working. “We want all our streets and estates well-lit. Lights which are not working should urgently be repaired,” he added. The lights will be added to 31 others installed in various markets, schools, and estates in Kisumu. The estates which have benefited include Carwash, Obunga, Manyatta, Nyalenda, Kondele, Bandani, and Kaloleni slums. The markets include Kombewa and Akado in Seme subcounty. Others are Chemelil, Korowe, Rabuor, Huma, Daraja Mbili and Orongo, Kobura, West Kisumu, North Kisumu, and East Kolwa wards. The county hopes to improve security in open-air markets in all subcounties and support a 24-hour economy. Currently, open-air markets such as Kibuye are closed due to Covid-19. Edited by A.N
