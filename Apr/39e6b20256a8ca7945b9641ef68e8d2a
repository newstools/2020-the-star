President Uhuru Kenyatta has said the government pursue those who escape from quarantine facilities. The President said they are aware of the matter and they will be taken back to complete their quarantine period. The president was addressing a section of Swahili media houses from State House on Wednesday morning. "For those ones, those who we saw escaping. They should not think they have won. We know them and we will find them," Uhuru said. He said those who escaped are putting the lives of many Kenyans who have been following the government measures at risk. Uhuru also urged Kenyans to continue to follow the measures set by the Ministry of Health in order to curb further infections in the country. His remarks came hours after a clip went viral across social media showing several individuals scaling the wall at the KMTC quarantine facility and escaping. On Tuesday, Health CAS Mercy Mwangangi confirmed that about 50 people believed to have escaped from quarantine at KMTC in Nairobi were being pursued. They are believed to have escaped on Monday after taking advantage of the heavy rains to scale the walls. Their absence was realised on Tuesday morning when their colleagues went for breakfast. Sources said they had been overheard complaining about the high rates they were expected to pay for the 14 days they would be at the facility. The number of confirmed cases in the country is 296 and 14 fatalities. The government has tested 14,417 people since the first outbreak was confirmed in the country on March 13.
