In good news for producers and consumers, sugar production from January to March increased by nine per cent compared to the same period last year. Last year, sugar production was at 144,662 metric tonnes and it increased this year by 12, 473 metric tonnes to 157,135MT. Solomon Odera, head of the Sugar Directorate of the Agriculture and Food Authority, attributed the improvement to the increased availability of sugar cane. “The production in West Kenya and Sukari Industries was further boosted by the inclusion of processed bulk sugar imports. Mumias Sugar Company remained closed during the period under review,” he said. The March sugar report showed that sales in January-March were in tandem with sugar production. A total of 150,574 tonnes were sold in January- March compared to 144,145 tonnes sold in the same period last year, an increase of five per cent. Odera said the total sugar closing stock held by all the sugar factories at the end of March was 17,486 tonnes against 8,982 tonnes eld in March 2019. Sugar prices Odera said the factory sugar price in January was at a monthly average of Sh4,235 per 50kg bag. In  February, the average price was Sh4,294 per 50kg bag. However, the price trend reversed in March to record a mean price of Sh4,215 per 50kg bag. The mean price in March was eight per cent higher than Sh3,912 per 50kg bag in March last year, he said. He said this indicates the market is recovering from the influx of cheap sugar imports shipped in earlier. Overall, in January-March, the average factory sugar price was Sh4,248 per 50kg bag compared to Sh3,954 per 50kg bag in the same period last year, an increase of seven per cent. Retail sugar prices began the year at a monthly average of Sh110 per kg but dropped in February and March to Sh109 per kg. The sugar report indicated that local loose sugar traded at Sh100 to Sh120 per kg while imported loose sugar sold at Sh94 to 120 per kg, resulting in at a monthly average of Sh106 per kg for both local and imported sugar. Local mills’ branded sugar sold for Sh100 to Sh130 per kg, averaging Sh116 per kg. During the survey, no imported sugar brand was reported. Comparatively, branded sugar was more expensive than loose sugar. This is attributed to the packaging costs and brands superiority, Odera said. Wholesale sugar prices started the year at a monthly average of Sh4,419 per 50kg bag. The succeeding months registered price increases to end March at an average of Sh4,644 per 50 kg bag. In March 2020,  both local and imported sugar traded for Sh4,450 to Sh4,850 per 50kg bag. However, imported sugar was cheaper than local sugar by Sh58 per bag, selling at an average Sh4,601 against Sh4,659 per 50kg bag, respectively, Odera said. (Edited by V.Graham)
