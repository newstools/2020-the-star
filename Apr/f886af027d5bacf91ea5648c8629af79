Farmers can still access subsidised fertiliser from the National Cereals and Produce Board depots across the country. NCPB spokesperson Titus Maiyo told the Star on the phone on Friday that the board has a stock of 320,000 50kg bags of planting fertiliser in their stores and another 375,000 bags of assorted fertiliser. He said despite the Covid-19 pandemic, the board has opened its doors to farmers so they can access fertiliser. "We are still open for business and farmers can access any of our depots as they prepare for the planting season which is ongoing in some parts of the country,” he said. He said the subsidised planting fertiliser is retailing at between Sh1,700 and Sh1,800, while top-dressing fertiliser is selling at Sh1,500. The subsidised fertiliser was carried forward from last year. Maiyo said the NCPB is also selling fertiliser for the private sector at between Sh2,300 and Sh2,850 per 50kg bag. Early this week, some maize and wheat farmers from Uasin Gishu had expressed concern over the acute shortage of fertiliser. They also accused private dealers of hiking prices in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic and the beginning of the planting for the rainy season. But Eustace Muriuki, the chairman of the Fertiliser Association of Kenya, dismissed the claim, saying the price of a bag of fertiliser has reduced by Sh600 because of the reduction in the global market. "A bag of DAP fertiliser at the Port of Mombasa is currently selling at Sh2,200. By the time it gets to farmers in Kitale, the bag is selling at between Sh2,800 and Sh2,900 due to transport logistics,” he said. Muriuki explained that at such a time last year, a bag of DAP at the Port of Mombasa was selling for Sh2,800. This means farmers were buying the same bag at between Sh3,000 to Sh3,500.
