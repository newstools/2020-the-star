Two men were charged on Friday with conspiracy to defraud Sh3 million from a company that sent it into their Safaricom M-Pesa accounts. Edward Ombworo and Brian Mundia were charged before Kibera senior resident magistrate Renee Kitagwa in a dramatic open-air court session under a tree. The charge sheet said the accused conspired to defraud Sh3 million from Dodore  Kenya Limited along Galana  Road in Kilimani subcounty. They were charged alongside others who were not before the court. They denied the charges and asked the court for lenient bond terms. Kitagwa released them on Sh3million bond or cash bail of Sh500,000 each with the surety of the same amount with a credible contact person. The case will proceed on July 2. (Edited by V. Graham)
