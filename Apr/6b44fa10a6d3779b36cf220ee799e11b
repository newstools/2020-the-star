Police in Mombasa are questioning a Kenya Navy officer suspected of killing a clinical officer in a road accident. Ezekiel Nyairo who worked at St Thomas Maternity Hospital in Likoni was allegedly hit by the soldier's vehicle and died on the spot. He was 35. His body was taken to Coast General Hospital before it was transported for burial in Kisii on Thursday. The soldier allegedly injured two other passengers on a motorcycle. Likoni subcounty police boss Jane Munywoki said that the suspect was apprehended following the last Sunday accident. Police reports say the accident occurred at Likoni-Mtongwe road near Vijiweni at 7:30pm. Munywoki said Nyairo had alighted from a matatu and was walking to his house when he was hit and died. A witness said the suspect knocked a cow before his car ploughed into the pedestrian and two other passengers on a motorcycle. But police have denied claims that the suspect fled to the Mtongwe barracks after the incident and he was still at large. â€œHe feared being attacked by the mob but when police arrived at the scene he came back and he was arrested for questioning," Munywoki said. The boda boda rider and a passenger were taken to Diani Hospital in Likoni where they were treated and discharged. The suspect's car is in custody at the Likoni police station. (edited by o. owino)
