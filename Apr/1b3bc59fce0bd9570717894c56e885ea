@robertomollo3 Seven cows were struck dead by lightning in Ndhiwa constituency of Homa Bay county on Wednesday. Maurice Otuoma, a farmer in Kwabwai ward said he was shocked when he found all his cattle dead after a short rainfall. “We woke up to milk but we found all the cattle lying dead,” Otuoma said. He lost three cows, two bulls and two calves. Otuoma said the incident had rendered him poorer. “My family and I have been depending on the cattle for ploughing and milk but they are all dead. I don’t know where to start from,” he said. Another farmer, Moses Odondo, said lighting has struck more than 15 heads of cattle in the area since December. The farmers appealed to the government to erect lightning arrestors in the area. “Lighting arrestors are the only thing that can save this situation. Lightning is impoverishing us,” Odondo said. Wachara assistant chief Alloys Otieno said lighting was prevalent in the area. “Every rainy season, lightning must strike livestock in this area. It is a problem which should be solved,” Otieno said. The farmers asked Homa Bay government to consider helping them so they can get back to normal life. “We appeal for help from the county department of disaster management,” Odondo said.
