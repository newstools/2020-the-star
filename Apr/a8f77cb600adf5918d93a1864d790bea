All churches and mosques were ordered shut immediately Covid -19 was first reported in the country. During national events, especially funerals of prominent people, the church and mosque leaders are given the role of leading the ceremonies and praying for the nation when a pandemic like the Covid-19 hits the country. People listen more to religious leaders who wield a lot of power in convincing their faithful. Religious leaders have followers and can articulate the needs of their members which would help in the Covid-19 war.   Mombasa
