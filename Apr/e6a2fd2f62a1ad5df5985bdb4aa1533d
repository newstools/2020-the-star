Bomet Governor Hillary Barchok has said his administration will pay health workers Sh16 million in motivational allowances during the fight against the spread of the coronavirus. The Salaries and Remuneration Commission (SRC) has opposed extra payments saying counties don't have enough money. Barchok said the front-line medics in isolation centres should be inspired in their work and the only way was to reward them financially. “We value the work of our medics and we must motivate them and so with or without the approval of the SRC  we are going to give allowances to them," he said. The SRC has already written to the governors warning them against paying 'motivational' allowances to health workers, saying counties don't have enough money. Barchok said the county assembly has already set aside the funds that will go a long way in keeping medics at work as they combat the coronavirus pandemic. Speaking at Siwot Vocational Institute in Bomet East during the launch of production of face masks, the county chief called on all entitles handling Covid-19 funds to spend prudently. He warned individuals not to enrich themselves. The institute will produce 7,000 reusable face masks each day to be distributed to residents at no cost. Barchok said his administration has put in place measures to ensure all funds are well spent and accounted for. He urged the national government and other counties to be transparent in how they spend funds to fight the virus. Bomet has set aside Sh155 million for emergencies for this period, including for the purchase of foodstuffs and supplies for the less fortunate. “We have set aside funds towards combating this pandemic; foregone several development projects and sacrificed millions of shillings and we shall account for every shilling," Barchok said.
