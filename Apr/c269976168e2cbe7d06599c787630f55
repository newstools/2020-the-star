Harmonize's Caucasian girlfriend Sarah Michelotti has responded to claims she has dumped the singer. This is after they unfollowed each other on social media. In what seems like a stunt, Sarah shared a photo of Harmonize, which she captioned: "The most expensive husband of my heart. Always on point baby." A crosscheck of their respective Instagram accounts showed that neither of them was following the other as cheating claims continue to escalate. “She’s broken because she believed. He’s ok because he lied,” posted Sarah on her earlier Instastory, raising even more eyebrows. Harmonize was alleged to cheating on Sarah with Tanzanian socialite Nicole Joyce Berry, a vixen he featured in his latest jam 'Bedroom'. In a previous Instagram post, Harmonize told Nicole she was lucky he was married and for that reason, opted to stay away from her to avoid unnecessary drama. In response, the curvaceous socialite aired her disappointment on how unbothered they were, despite her effort to get their attention. Amid the controversy, Nicole Joyce Berry put out a post reminding women that they can’t buy a man’s love. “Be your man’s peace, otherwise he will go & find peace somewhere else! And ***ch please refer to “Proverbs 14:1”. I am still enjoying bedroom song lyrics in my bedroom,” she said.
