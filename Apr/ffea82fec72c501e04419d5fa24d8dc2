Those opposed to KRA's new system meant to police remittances from Value Added Tax by large taxpayers can now register their views through email. This follows a public notice by the Kenya Revenue Authority on Thursday welcoming objections of the VAT Automated Audit (VAA). "All documents in support of objections to VAT Automated Audit (VAA) Assessments for VAT returns for the period of January 2018 to May 2018 should be scanned and sent to VAAlegalservices@kra.go.ke," the authority posted on Twitter. The new system has been a source of concern among firms that collect VAT. Many have claimed the new system exaggerated the number of defaulters simply because some of them had not reconciled their accounts. Some audit firms too have expressed their concerns, noting that KRA could have failed to capture all taxpayer information when migrating them from the manual to the automated system.
