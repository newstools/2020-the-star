The hospitality industry in Kakamega has been hit hard by the coronavirus outbreak as citizens are advised to stay at home to help flatten the curve of infections. Western Hoteliers chairman Rev William Ouya said business had dropped drastically forcing most hotels to send their employees on unpaid leave. Some hotels have closed indefinitely, Ouya said. "The industry is going through a difficult time. We regret that some hotels have had to send some of their staff home on compulsory unpaid leave and pay those retained half of their pay," he told the Star on the phone. Rondo Retreat in the heart of Kakamega Forest, Wanakhatandi hotel (Bungoma), Dr Spa hotel (Bungoma) and County Comfort hotel (Bungoma) have closed. Rondo Retreat manager David Osir said the hotel targets foreign clients.  They had to send home staff after 95 per cent of the reservations were cancelled following measures to contain the spread of the virus, he said. “The government closed the border and barred international flights. We understand that the measures are for our own good." “Out of 35 staff, we are only retaining 11.” Hoteliers chairman Ouya called on the government to offer training to hotel management to handle a possible outbreak in their hotels. He also called upon Kenyans to observe the government directives including staying at home and adhering to the dusk-to-dawn curfew in the fight against the virus. Edited by R.Wamochie
