Diamond's ex Zari Hassan is busy throwing shade at slay queens who used to take photos in posh hotels that are now closed over corona pandemic. She launched an attack on slay queens for always accusing her of faking her lifestyle, yet they can't even afford to take photos in their own houses during this quarantine period. “Mahotel yange fungua, we miss some slay queens. Kwani amuruhusiwi kupiga picture kwenu. Wakitoka apo Zari anafeki maisha. See your Life. God bless you too. Me I’m already blessed,” said Zari on Instagram. The mother of five has been showing off all corners of her house in a number of photos and videos on social media at a time South Africa is in total lockdown to help curb the spread of the coronavirus.
