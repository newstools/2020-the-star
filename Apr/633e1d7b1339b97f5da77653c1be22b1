Incoming Butali Warriors captain Constance Wakhura will hope to emulate his predecessor Kennedy Nyongesa’s fighting spirit when action resumes from the current enforced break due to coronavirus. The tough-tackling defensive powerhouse observed that Nyongesa had set the standards so high by winning three league titles. Wakhura captained Strathmore University Gladiators to the 2016 title and was snapped up by the sugar millers December the same year. The drag-flicker who is also a Level One coach called for cooperation from teammates to enjoy more success. “Nyongesa has massively achieved with the team, setting up a tough challenge for his predecessor challenge but I am ready for the test ahead. It calls for responsibility, courage and determination from everyone involved. Nyongesa’s never-give-up attitude further motivates me that I too can do a marvelous job,” said the former Friends School Kamusinga and St. Anthony Kitale player. Wakhura doubles up as the national team captain, having made his international debut in 2013 during the African Cup of Nation’s tournament in Nairobi and has gone on to secure over 40 caps. He is also a referee and an umpire where he officiates in the women’s Premier League as well as the men’s Super and National leagues. Wakhura’s discipline and passion might have landed him the armband. He is always early for training to practice drag flicks. His composure and eye for goal saw him score three goals from short corners against Ghana, Egypt and Namibia during the Olympic qualifiers last year even though Kenya could only manage a fifth-place finish. At the start of this season, Butali management elevated veteran player Zack Aura to coach, a decision Wakhura says is in tandem with the objectives of the team. Aura was Wakhura’s  mentor as a teenager and will continue learning from him. “Zack is passionate about the game and whose discipline and hard work is unrivaled. I know him and together we can achieve more,” said Wakhura.
