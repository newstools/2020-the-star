Clerics in Nandi have urged the government to reopen places of worship. “Wines and spirits, barbershops and salons, select hotels, shopping malls and banks are open. Churches have more spaces than all these and should be opened to guide their followers spiritually,” the Nandi County Clergy Association said. The clergy said places of worship are capable of observing the measures put in place to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus. They said churches would provide worshippers with face masks, sanitiser and practise social distancing. Speaking in Kapsabet town, the association's secretary general Rev Michael Chirchir said the country needs prayers now more than ever. The clerics said the church plays an important role in moulding and nurturing citizens to be God-fearing and, more importantly, to pray for the nation. They said a large number of worshippers may turn to alcohol, which is sold freely. “This could be detrimental to the well-being of the country as wines and spirits continue to distribute alcohol to their customers,” Chirchir said. In a press statement signed by Rev Tedy Kisivuli (chairman) and Bishop Maurice Maamai (organising secretary), among others, the clerics said churches would observe 1.5-metre distance and allow a small number of worshippers. “Our country is faced with many challenges, most of which require spiritual interventions that churches play a key role in,” Kisivuli said. The clerics also criticised the government for putting citizens in forced quarantine if found flouting the curfew or the Covid-19 rules.  “The government is creating unnecessary tension and fear among the citizens by using force and in fact, [exposing] people to infection by mixing them in institutions,” Kisivuli said.
