Members of savings and credit cooperatives are rapidly withdrawing their savings amid the coronavirus outbreak. The Cooperative Alliance of Kenya on Wednesday said it was worried members could deplete their savings. CAK chairman Daniel Marube said affiliated members in horticulture, hospitality and aviation industries were withdrawing their savings to cater for their basic needs during the pandemic. He top managers in the sub-sectors have expressed concern over a trend of members applying for withdrawal of their savings. “This trend if not curtailed is likely to affect the liquidity levels of the societies and equally discourage the saving culture in the country,” Marube said. Already, some of the companies have urged their employees to take a pay cut while others have asked workers to take unpaid leave. Speaking at their Upper Hill offices, Marube encouraged members to spend wisely. "Focus on essential needs and borrow when it’s very necessary. We have to preserve and manage our resources to rejuvenate our activities post this Covid-19,” he said. Edited by Peter Obuya
