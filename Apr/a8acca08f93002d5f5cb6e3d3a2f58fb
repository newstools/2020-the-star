Machakos Town MP Victor Munyaka has urged farmers not to sell their produce so as to prepare for a tough time ahead if the government enforces total lockdown. “In Ukambani, we have been blessed with a good harvest to sustain us if we use it well. We were blessed with a bumper harvest last season, we should store it well for it not to get aflatoxin. It can help us during this time the country has been hit by coronavirus, ” he said. Munyaka cautioned maize farmers against exploitation by middlemen to sell their produce at a lower price this season. The legislator further said parliamentarians are looking for ways to have the government supply face masks for free.  He urged residents to follow the set guidelines by the government and asked them to avoid contact and they maintain hygiene to avoid being infected with the coronavirus. “Let us play our roles in ensuring we stop the spread of this virus.” Munyaka commended the government for updating Kenyans every day on the status of the outbreak. He said Kenyans have the most critical role in the management of the virus by observing personal hygiene and social distance. “Healthy behaviour is necessary in the wake of the global outbreak to prevent the spread of the disease,” he said. The lawmaker further argued the government to continue updating Kenyans on the Covid-19 outbreak. Edited by R.Wamochie
