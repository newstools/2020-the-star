The Kenya Covid-19 Fund has urged individuals, communities and groups donating food to notify the secretariate before doing so. In Nairobi, groups have been requested  to  notify  the  Fund  Secretariat  on  email:  secretariat@kenyacovidfund.co.ke and  on  rapid response phone numbers: 0702000055, 0702000077 or 0772429949 when planning to make donations. In a statement on Sunday, fund chairperson and KBL managing director Jane Karuku urged Kenyans to follow public health protocols to curb spread of Covid-19. She called for social distancing, wearing of face masks, washing and sanitisation of hands. This comes two days after chaos that followed a donation drive in Kibra, where residents scrambled for food donated by among others, ODM leader Raila Odinga. Residents failed to observe social distancing and many did not wear masks. Karuku said for all other counties, donors are requested to notify the County Commissioners who are working closely with the respective County Governors for coordination and support. "The notification to the Fund is to enable coordination of donations to facilitate security arrangements, alignment with the needs assessment map, health surveillance and related public guidance necessary to facilitate safe distribution of the donations," Karuku said. "A coordinated approach to the delivery of available donations is essential to avoid compromising public health and rolling back gains already made in the efforts to contain Covid-19 in Nairobi County and the Country at large."
