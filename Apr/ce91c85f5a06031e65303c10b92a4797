A former back-up singer for Congolese musician Koffi Olomide has been held in police custody over the death of his 44-year-old lover. Mwanza Ukadidi Didier, alias Cobe, was detained at the Embakasi police station as a suspect in the murder of Catherine Mwove. The DCI is investigating. Ukadidi is accused of assaulting Mwove in his Pipeline estate room on the night of April 8 after a brief quarrel. He allegedly assaulted her again on April 9 at a hotel. She sustained serious abdominal and body injuries and proceeded to her house in Syokimau. On April 12, she was found dead in her bedroom. Corporal Joseph Kibet, a DCI officer, said Mwove succumbed to injuries. "The injuries are indicative of an organised act of commission,” said Kibet in an affidavit filed at the Makadara law courts where he obtained custodial orders. On April 14, a postmortem was done at Umash Funeral Home by a government pathologist. It indicated that the woman died of internal bleeding due to "multiple injuries on the chest, head and ribs consistent with the assault.” Kibet sought 14 days to detain the suspect, pending completion of investigations. He told Makadara senior principal magistrate Angelo Kithinjii that he needed to revisit and document the crime scene, record statements and possibly arrest more suspects. Some witnesses had recorded statements. The matter was initially reported at Mlolongo police station and witnesses said Mwove complained of injuries inflicted by Ukadidi. Ukadidi said the woman went to his house with a man she had been drinking with and he later warned the man he identified as Omosh, to leave as curfew time approached but he refused. They later fought and Mwove was injured as she attempted to stop the fight. The suspect demanded that Omosh be arrested for the offence because the fight started because of his presence in his house after he refused to leave. The case will be mentioned on May 4.
