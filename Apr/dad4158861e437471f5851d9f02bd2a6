Bungoma county has started local production of face masks in an effort to protect its people from coronavirus. The masks are produced from Wekelekha Vocational Training Centre and have licence and certification from Rivatex. According to Governor Wycliffe Wangamati, the centre will produce up to 10,000 face masks per week. He said that they are cost-effective and reusable after washing and disinfecting. Wangamati added that this will address the financial challenge that they were facing with disposable ones. The masks will be distributed for free to everybody regardless of their status in the community. Edited by Frank Obonyo
