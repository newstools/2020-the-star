Daily wage earners who depend on public transport for survival in Kakamega are feeling the pinch of the ban on travel in and out of Nairobi. President Uhuru Kenyatta issued a 21-day ban on movement in and out of Nairobi, Mombasa, Kwale and Kilifi from Monday, April 6, at 7 pm to control the spread of coronavirus. Gilbert Barongo, a mechanic with Eldoret Express in Kakamega town, said he has been left without any income yet he is his family's breadwinner. “I repair buses for a living but now that they are all parked. I do not have any other source of income. I urge the government to help us to pay rent and meet our daily needs,” he said. Barongo, who earns about Sh800 a day, said he appreciates the government’s efforts to prevent the spread of coronavirus but he fears that low-income earners might die of hunger. Paul Osete, a bus cleaner, shared similar views. He said since Tuesday, he has not worked because the buses are not operational. “I have a wife and eight children who will go hungry because I have no bus to wash. My landlord is also demanding money for rent, so I am stuck,” he said. Collins Jamira, an employee of Blueline Shuttle, said more than 50 workers were sent on compulsory leave. “Our office closed and this means drivers have no jobs and passengers who had earlier booked are stranded. Although we are incurring loses, we have no choice but to support the government in the fight against Covid-19,” he said. Those most affected include drivers, conductors, touts and mechanics, who will have to look for an alternative way of making ends meet. At least until the ban is lifted. Edited by Frank Obonyo
