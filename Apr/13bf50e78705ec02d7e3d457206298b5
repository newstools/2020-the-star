The Ahero-Katito road in Kisumu county will be reopened next week after its closure a fortnight ago to allow the construction of a bridge. The Ahero-Isebania road contractors closed it at Ayweyo in Nyando subcounty. Presidency Delivery Unit director Sylvance Osele on Wednesday said the contractors promised that the work will be complete in 10 days. The road links Kisumu, Kisii, Nyamira, Homa Bay and Migori counties. Osele, who was accompanied by colleague Melkizedek Ochengo, said the contractors had assured them that by Friday next week, the work will be complete. Emphasising the importance of the road, the former Kabondo Kasipul MP said: “This is the road which people use to transport their fresh produce to various markets in the five counties.” Osele said senior government officials, including Transport CS James Macharia get daily briefings on the status of the road. He said the contractor had worked on another access road to allow motorists to pass but it became impassable following the heavy downpour. Motorists briefly used the Awasi-Katito roadbefore it also became impassable. They now use Kericho road and onwards to Sondu. The long distance has led to increased fares. The fare from Kisumu to Kisii is now Sh700 from Sh400 while Kisumu to Homa Bay passengers are charged Sh800 instead of Sh400. Those headed to Migori from Kisumu part with Sh1,000 from Sh500. “We are forced to dig deeper into our pocket. The fare is really high due to the distance the vehicles are covering,” Jane Akoth said. Akoth paid Sh800 from Kisumu to Kisii. Edited by A.N
