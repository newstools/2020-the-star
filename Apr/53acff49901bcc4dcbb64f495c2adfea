Homa Bay Governor Cyprian Awiti has asked elected leaders and residents to donate to the county's kitty to cushion people from the effects of coronavirus pandemic. Awiti said the leaders and well-wishers should make their donations to the Homa Bay Covid-19 Emergency Fund chaired by Ken Onditi. The committee has raised more than Sh6 million for the fight against coronavirus. “I urge leaders, residents and friends of Homa Bay to embrace collective responsibility in fighting the virus. Let’s donate to the kitty even foodstuff, cash and others donations to help us mitigate the impact of this disease on our people,” Awiti said. Woman Representative Gladys Wanga has set up a workshop that produces 1,000 face masks daily. MPs Peter Kaluma (Homa Bay Town) and Martin Owino (Ndhiwa) have donated sanitation facilities in their respective constituencies. Other leaders like Oyugi Magwanga (former Kasipul MP), Lake Basin Development Authority (LBDA) chairman Odoyo Owidi, Kuppet secretary-general Akelo Misori and businessman Jared Kiasa have also assisted residents. Homa Bay East MCA Juma Awuor has donated Sh100,000 to the kitty and distributed sanitation materials to residents in his ward. The resources mobilised by the committee will be used to support efforts to supply medical equipment and support vulnerable communities. Onditi said the fund has raised Sh6,064,050. The amount includes Sh2,500,500 cash. The remaining are materials including 700 bags of maize, 200 bags of rice and 319 N-95 face masks. “The committee has been making good progress and we have received a lot of goodwill and support towards our objective. We’re still appealing to our stakeholders to continue contributing,” Onditi said. Edited by P.O
