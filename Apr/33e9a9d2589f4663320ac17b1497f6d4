Kenya's Emergency Plus Medical Services (E-Plus), has launched a probe into the improper use of one of its ambulances to break curfew. A video circulated on social media showed a group of young people in an ambulance bragging how they had beat the curfew. The youngsters had a bottle of gin that they placed on the stretcher enacting a CPR process. "We wish to confirm that preliminary investigations show that on the evening of April 17, 2020, an ambulance was deployed for purposes other than the provision of pre-hospital services," E-Plus Managing Director Susan Ng'ong'a said in a statement. She added that they had taken disciplinary action against the staff who have been implicated in the incident. "We further encourage the law enforcement authorities to apply the full extent of the law and hold those culpable accountable," Ng'ong'a added. She also noted that E-Plus had further committed to undertake a review of its procedures to address any potential misuse of its ambulance services. This is the second incident where Kenyans keen to beat the curfew put in place over Covid-19 have used an ambulance.
