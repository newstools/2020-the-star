Kenya Rugby Union Championship sides Strathmore Leos and Masinde Murilo University of Science and Technology (MMUST) have welcomed KRU’s decision to reverse their decision to cancel the entire 2019/20 season. On Monday, the federation succumbed to pressure from clubs, reversed the decision, and in addition, announced that the season now remains suspended. Leos coach Louis Kisia and MMUST’s Ochieng Ahaya said the indefinite suspension of the league was the best decision. The clubs had opposed the cancellation of the league and they now want the league to go on to its logical conclusion once coronavirus is contained. “The communication from the union is definitely good news for us during these tough times. Rugby truly wins. We hope all goes well and the league resumes,” said Kisia. “Our players will continue with their home workouts as they await further communication. We have an App that we use to monitor them and send the training resources." Kisia said he is confident Leos will return to Kenya Cup once action resumes. They have been in the second tier for just a year. Ahaya said the entire MMUST fraternity was happy with the decision. “At least we can now have teams fight for a chance to qualify for Kenya Cup next season. Cancelling the entire season was wrong and we are looking forward to playing the semifinal at home once the country is declared coronavirus free,” said the veteran coach. He said his players have been training at home alone or in small groups to keep fit. “The most important thing is that they are keeping fit. Other things can be handled when the league resumes,” added Ahaya. Leos and MMUST had sealed home semifinal berths and remain favourites to be promoted to the Kenya Cup. Leos finished top of the table in the regular season with 76 points, followed by MMUST with 67.
