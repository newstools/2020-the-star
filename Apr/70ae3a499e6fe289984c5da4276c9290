Quiting smoking and drinking and adopting a healthy lifestyle will help in curbing this virus, Health CAS Rashid Aman has said. Speaking during a press briefing at Afya House on Friday, Rashid said, "Eating healthy diets, with plenty of fruits and vegetables, keeping physically active, quitting smoking, limiting or avoiding alcohol intake, and getting enough sleep are key components of a healthy lifestyle." He also said that people with respiratory disease, cancer and heart problems are more susceptible to contracting the virus. "It is important to note that people with non communicable diseases conditions such as heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, cancer, chronic respiratory disorders, among other NCDs are more susceptible to contracting Covid-19 disease," he said. He urged persons with these conditions to follow all the precautionary measures for preventing COVID 19, with discipline. In the last 24 hours, Kenya has tested 946 samples across 12 counties. This brings to 16,738 the total number of tests conducted so far. From these latest tests, 16 persons have tested positive for Covid-19. "We therefore have a total of 336 confirmed cases in the country. The 16 were picked out from among communities by our surveillance teams," Aman said.
