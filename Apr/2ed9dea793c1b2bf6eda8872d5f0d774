Security officers have mounted another roadblock along the Nairobi-Nakuru highway near Raini centre in Naivasha to block those fleeing Nairobi. Naivasha subcounty commissioner Mathioya Mbogo said some people have been using 'panya routes' before boarding matatus to Naivasha and other parts of the country. “We have been forced to introduce stiff security measures to ensure government directives are obeyed,” he said. Mbogo warned that matatu operators who will be found sneaking passengers to Naivasha from Nairobi will have their licences cancelled. He also said trucks and Probox vehicles are being used to ferry passengers to and from Nairobi. Meanwhile, the department of public health has expressed concerns over young women fleeing Nairobi to Naivasha despite government directives. In the last one week, three people including a college student were arrested and quarantined after members of the public exposed them. The student had travelled from Mombasa while a flower farm worker had sneaked to the lakeside town from Nairobi in search of a job. A senior public health in Naivasha, who did not want to be named, said they were getting calls every day over people who have come from Nairobi. “We have been forced to attend to so many cases of people fleeing Nairobi and in the last two days we have quarantined three at Naivasha Girls Secondary School,” he said.
