 A lobby group has urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to declare a lockdown to curb the spread of coronavirus. Voice of Men and Children said Kenyans' failure to observe government directives will allow the virus to spread. Group's chairman James Njenga on Saturday said people were not observing social distance as required. He said Kenyans were also not observing the required hygiene and accused bar operators of secretly selling alcohol despite an order that bars be closed. "We feel bad when so many young men and women enter a bar in the morning without washing their hands and observing social distance," Bishop Njenga said. He spoke at his office in Chunga Mali area of Rironi in Limuru. He was accompanied by the group's secretary Josphat Njagi. Njenga said bar operators are selling alcoholic drinks secretly at their homes while others are locking their customers inside their pubs. "These people will later come straight home to mingle and interact with their families without washing their hands. They will hold babies, touch everywhere and pass those viruses," the cleric said. He said only a lockdown will help control the spread of coronavirus. He said many idle youths were gathering in villages and trading centers telling stories without observing social distance. "You will find people especially men speaking in groups, others are watching a video from one phone. They will be separated only by a lockdown," Njenga said.  Editede by peter obuya
