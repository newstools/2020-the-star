Gospel artiste Ruth Matete's husband died of multiple organ failure, chief government pathologist Johansen Oduor said on Thursday. "The burns lead to multiple body organ failure, which lead to his death," the pathologist said Matete, 34, popularly known for the song ‘Eloi Eloi’, had said her husband John Apewajoye, a Nigerian, succumbed to burns he sustained in their house at Great Wall Gardens Estate in Athi River on April 11. The gospel singer, who is two months pregnant, last week confirmed the news of her Nigerian husband's death via social media. She said John died while undergoing treatment for burns at a Nairobi health facility. "My husband Beloved John Apewajoye has gone to be with the Lord ..I humbly ask for your prayers during this difficult time," she wrote on Facebook. Matete on Wednesday spent three hours at the DCI headquarters on Kiambu Road, as investigators probed the death of her husband. The 2012 Tusker Project Fame winner was interrogated by the DCI-based homicide unit.
