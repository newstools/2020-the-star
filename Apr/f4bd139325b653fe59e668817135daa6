The government has expressed dissatisfaction with the manner in which those who have recovered from coronavirus are treated when they get back into the community. Health CAS Mercy Mwangangi on Wednesday said that one of the recoveries shared what he has been going through. “As he was sharing his story with us, he has given us disturbing events regarding how he has been accepted back in the community, issues, and experiences that have not been pleasant to him and his family,” she said during the daily Covid-19 briefing. The CAS urged members of the public not to stigmatise people who have recovered from the virus to defeat the pandemic. The CAS said stigmatisation will instill fear to Kenyans and most of them will not want to be tested. “Stigmatisation will lead to few Kenyans accepting to be tested,” she said. The CAS also added that the same will affect the government’s effort in trying to flatten the curve. Mwangangi has also said that Kenyans should instead congratulate and encourage those who have recovered. “We appeal for compassion in the community, for understanding and even celebrating these people who have been able to go through such a scourge and come out and recover,” Mwangagi said. She announced that five more people have been discharged after testing negative to the virus, bring the total of recoveries to 129. In the last 24 hours, the government tested 508 samples in 14 counties, where 10 people tested positive. Mombasa had nine cases while Nairobi had one positive case, bringing the total number of positive cases in the country to 384.
