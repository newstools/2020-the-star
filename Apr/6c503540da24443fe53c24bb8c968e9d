West Pokot Governor John Lonyangapuo has called on herders who had crossed the border in search of pastures to remain there and not risk returning with coronavirus infection. Lonyangapuo said many herders are back at any time. “For now I urge you to remain where you are until things stabilise. Let's stop unnecessary movements that may risk our lives to the disease,” he said. Every year during the dry spell, herders from West Pokot cross over to Uganda and neighbouring counties in search of pasture and water. The herders usually return with the onset of rains in April. The governor has also banned charcoal and timber business in the county. He said the business involves human contact and may spread of the coronavirus. “We have banned charcoal business in this county for some time since most of the buyers come from the neighbouring counties and we don’t want to risk lives of our people,” he said. Many people have been visiting the area from other counties to buy charcoal and transport it to other regions. The governor said business will be halted for some time since they have traced buyers of the charcoal and found most buyers sell the charcoal in urban centres in other counties. “This county has not reported any case of Covid- 19 nd our emergency response team is on the higher alert to ensure that residents take required precautions,” he said. The governor asked subcounty commissioners and chiefs to ensure the business is stopped for some time. “Traders have been sneaking into the county at night and transporting timber and posts to various places," he said. Lonyangapuo asked residents to observe curfew hours and not to cross with security officers. “Let's be law-abiding citizens and follow government directives to help prevent the spread of this virus to our region,” he said. He said every subcounty hospital has isolation wards for Covid-19.to help handle cases in case they are reported. (Edited by V. Graham)
