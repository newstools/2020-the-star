Magara said the club has had a turbulent season financially and a good number of his players like Nicholas Omondi and Julius Masaba had to seek greener pastures, joining Gor Mahia and Kariobangi Sharks respectively during the mid-season transfer window. Two other players joined Posta Rangers and Coast Stima. “These players were dependable and their departure left a void we could not fill,” added Magara.

Magara said they hope to strengthen the side when the season, currently suspended due to coronavirus pandemic, resumes. “Our recruitment policy has been to sign players from the areas that surround us including Kibera, Dagoretti, Kawangware and Satellite, especially those who have just cleared their secondary school education. Our scouting has been very good,” added Magara Some of the club's dependable players include Eric Odhiambo, Peter Onduso, Daniel Omwanda and Hillary Omondi and Magara said they want to build around these players in the next coming years. “We want to build around these young  vibrant players.
