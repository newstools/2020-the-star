An Embu town rescue centre that feeds street children has stopped operations following government directive against social gathering to curb the spread of the coronavirus. The Anglican Church of Kenya (ACK) Rescue Centre has been providing lunch of githeri, rice and beans to about 140 children. Lilian Wanjiru, a worker at the centre, said the children now have to do with milk and bananas in compliance with the social distancing directive. The government ordered self-service restaurants, cafes, hotels and eateries to only provide take-away service. “Our centre has opted to give them only milk and bananas as we are not able to provide them with take away food as ordered by the government,” Wanjiru said. However, the facility intends to start cooking and packing the food in plastic containers as the children have nowhere else to go. Wanjiru spoke on Monday when Moving Mountains Kenya NGO donated food to the rescue centre to keep the lunch provisions services running. Gilbert Njeru, an official with the NGO, said they donated the food to alleviate hunger experienced by the children. He was disappointed with the government for not considering the vulnerability of children  in the wake of Covid-19. Njeru called on other well-wishers to donate to the rescue centre for it to continue sustaining the street children. The children called on the government to provide them with food and also make arrangements to house them in case of a lockdown. Child welfare officers said there are about 70 children in Embu town streets and a similar number from slums in the neighbourhood who are now finding it hard to get food. One of the street children, Hamisi Juma, said some of them eke out as porters for people leaving supermarkets with heavy shopping. This, however, is becoming scarce due to the dusk to dawn curfew and maintenance of social distancing.  Edited by E.Kibii
