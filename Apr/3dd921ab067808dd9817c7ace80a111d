Two Homa Bay police officers are among five people seized for drinking at a local bar on Monday night. The arrest came after concerned members of the public reported that the bar where the suspects were drinking operated despite the ban on bars. The national government has banned bar and night club operations in the war against the spread of coronavirus. The five, among them a bar attendant and two customers, had locked themselves in the facility as they partook of the drinks. County police commander Esther Seroney told reporters that her office was tipped-off that the five were seen entering the bar, locking the door behind them. “We got information that a group of men among them two police officers were in a locked bar, and drunk. They were arrested as investigations,” Seroney said on Tuesday. Other than illegally being in the bar, the suspects are also accused of violating the directive on social distance. “They were sitting close to each other without considering the risks of contracting or transmitting coronavirus,” she said. The suspects were held at Homa Bay police station awaiting prosecution. Edited by R.Wamochie
