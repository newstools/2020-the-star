Hundreds of masked Kirinyaga villagers swarmed the burial of a man and his daughter who were killed by his wife. Charles Murimi, 49 and Vallerie Njeri, 13, were axed to death by Naomi Wanjiku at around 3am on Friday last week. The two were buried side by side in one grave at Kioru Village, Kirinyaga West subcounty in a solemn ceremony. Security had a rough warding off crowds of villagers who had jammed the ceremony. The government has directed that funerals and other social rites should be attended by no more than 15 people to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Reverend Julius Karimi of the Anglican Church of Kenya in Karima-ini spent 30 minutes to preside over the burial. Wanjiku, aÂ Karatina Law Courts executive officer, was arrested a day later in a hideout at Karima village and taken to Baricho Police Station. A court directed she be confined there for seven days pending investigations into the incident as she awaits trial for murder. Domestic quarrels are alleged to have caused Wanjiku's actions. Neighbours told the press the family was always fighting. The neighbours said Wanjiku was initially based at the Kerugoya Law Courts and was later transferred to Ngong Law Courts in Kajiado. Murimi was a manager at a local private milk firm. Some residents said Wanjiku had shown signs of depression and the husband had become a drunk. (edited by o. owino)
