Senior police officers have been sent on terminal leave and replaced with new ones in the latest changes in the National Police Service. On Thursday, National Police Service CEO Joe Onyango confirmed to the Star that the changes were being effected. “We have the changes but I haven’t seen all the letters, the Inspector General has them,” he said. Reports indicate about 15 senior police bosses are set to retire from service in June. In the new changes, head of fingerprints at Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) Patrick Ndunda has been moved to the office of the IG and named the new head of planning and finance. Abdullahi Aden has been named new Border Patrol Unit commandant, while Gitiba Mwita is the new Security of Government Buildings boss. Those sent on terminal leave are Administration Police Training College Peter Muriithi and head of operations at Kenya Police Service Henry Barmao. Muriithi has been replaced by Musa Kakawa, while Barmao has been replaced by Geofrey Otunge. Also in the retirement lot is KPS head of logistics Joseph Kiget, among others. Wambua Kisyungu will be at the helm of Critical Infrastructure Police Unit (CIPU) as Richard Ngatia will take over from Joseph Kodi as Anti-Stock Theft Unit (ASTU) boss. Asnath Mumbu has been named new boss of the Administration Police Service band. The changes have preceded more elaborate changes in the near future.
