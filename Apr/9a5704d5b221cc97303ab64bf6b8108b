Kitui Woman Representative Irene Kasalu will use her three-month salary to fight the coronavirus in the county. The legislator, who made the announcement to reporters in Kitui town on Tuesday, said she had already expended Sh500,000 she received from the National Treasury for the anti-Covid-19 war. She also dug into her pockets to fight the pandemic. Kasalu said Sh500,000 was negligible, given that Kitui is a vast county and to adequately reach all corners massive resources were required. She said she had resorted to sacrificing her three-month salary to provide free masks to high-risk segments of the society like boda boda operators and market traders. Her office has given out 60,000 face masks in all Kitui subcounties. "This is part of our collective responsibility in ensuring that we stay safe from the Covid-19 pandemic," the Woman Rep said. The MP, who distributed 1,200 face masks to male and female inmates at Kitui Prison last weekend, urged for the decongesting of prisons as a measure to curb the spread of the coronavirus. "Our county prisons still hold large numbers of inmates, a recipe for disaster in this period of Covid-19. There is need to release petty offenders and decongest the facilities," Kasalu said. She criticised the police for "careless and arbitrary arrests" and taking Kenyans who violate curfew to quarantine centres. She said such action aggravated the spread of the virus. - mwaniki fm
