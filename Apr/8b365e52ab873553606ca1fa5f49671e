More than 600 families across seven villages in Karachuonyo constituency have been displaced by floods over the past six days. Their homes were flooded following heavy rains that continue to fall in several parts of the country. River Miriu broke its banks and spilled into a number of homes in Osodo, Kowuor Agindo, Konyango, Komenya, Kasirawa and Kobuya villages in  Wang’chieng ward of Karachuonyo in Homa Bay county. The flooding has been worsened by the backflow of Lake Victoria waters. Some families were camping at Osodo primary and secondary schools, Osodo SDA Church and at Chuowe Pentecostal Church. Others have sought safety in the homes of their relatives while some have rented houses at trading centers on safe grounds. Residents Kennedy Ochola and Willys Okeyo said the situation had exposed victims to the risk of the coronavirus. “The social distance required for containing the spread of coronavirus is not likely to be adhered to in the camps. The victims have thronged the camps because they have nowhere to go,” Ochola said. He asked the government to send humanitarian assistance. Okeyo said the floods will cause unprecedented famine after crops were destroyed. “With crops destroyed in flooded farmlands, we are going to suffer from famine in a few months,” Okeyo said. They asked the government to find a long-lasting solution to perennial flooding. Okeyo said residents should conserve the environment to minimise such disasters. “The floods are a result of environmental degradation. Let us embrace environment conservation,” he said. Homa Bay county disaster management director Eliud Onyango said they have assessed the situation and appropriate action will be taken as soon as possible. “The Homa Bay government together with the national government is laying modalities to assist the victims. We’re getting food and non-food items to be distributed to the affected families,” Onyango said.  Edited by Peter Obuya
