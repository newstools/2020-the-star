Eagle Wings’ technical bench got a huge boost when veteran Ancette Wafula agreed to work with the team this year. Team manager Nelly Odera revealed yesterday that Wafula will team up with Evelyne Kedogo to handle the premier league side. “He has agreed to work with us and being a self-supporting team, this will be a huge boost to us as we are working with a young team,” Odera said. Wafula, one of the country’s most deadly shooters guided champions Ulinzi Warriors to six national titles and was key for Thunder in last year’s race. Eagle Wings made history in 2013 in Morocco, where the became the sole Kenyan club (men or women) to make a podium finish, winning a bronze. “Because of that achievement in the women’s Africa Club Championship, we want to keep this team alive but it has not been easy,” she noted. Odera said running a self-supporting club is difficult but noted that they are determined to keep the fire burning. She appealed to sponsors to come on board and support the team. “We have a cream of young and talented players who are joining this club every year. We enjoy the opportunity to work with them,” She disclosed. Meanwhile, eight new teams have joined this year’s Nairobi Basketball Association (NBA), provincial league, officials announced.
