Comedian Njugush says there was a time he could not sleep after he did a video with his wife but some fans misinterpreted it. He was forced to make a public apology after posting a clip that many believed promoted rape. The clip, which he shot with his wife, has the comedian jokingly complaining to his wife that they need to go home together after he spent so much money on her after an outing. Speaking on his YouTube channel, Njugush said he could not concentrate. "I was trying to explain to my fans the meaning of the clip, but none seemed to understand," he said. "The following day, I was trending." He says he went to church but got nothing from the service. "I kept on logging in to check what they were saying. I mean, cyberbullying is bad," he said.
