Police have arrested a 19-year-old suspect linked to the Kibos Police post armoury robbery in Kisumu. The suspect was arrested at his Kanyakwar home. The man is also linked to another robbery from an M-Pesa shop at Daraja Mbili within the county where Sh230,00 was stolen last weekend. Through their Twitter handle, the  DCI, a woman was on March 29 accosted by a gang of five men armed with G3 rifle and robbed her of the said amount, three mobile phones and a TV set before escaping on two motorcycles. The gang also forced Judith Akumu Ambani of Kapuonja South village to send Sh30,000 through M-Pesa. DCI detectives narrowed their search and found the rifle wrapped in a sack at the suspect's home. “The said riffle was identified as having been stolen from Kibos Police post on the night of March 28 when an unknown person took advantage of the downpour," DCI tweeted. According to the DCI, the thieves broke into the armoury and stole three rifles, four magazine and about 150 rounds of ammunition. “Upon interrogation, the suspect led officers to the house of his accomplice within the same locality where other items were recovered,” the DCI said. The recovered items include three police jungle jackets and trousers, three jungle belts, three service colour belts, two berets, a police manual, a pair of military boots and a TV set. “The items were identified as having been stolen from the house of an inspector of police on March 10 while he was undertaking a course at the National Police College main campus- Kiganjo,” DCI said. The suspect has been placed in custody as detectives pursue the rest of the gang. There has been an outcry by locals of thieves taking advantage of curfew to terrorise them in Lolwe, Migosi, Carwash and  Mamboleo estates by criminals breaking into and robbing houses at night. Already the county commissioner Susan Waweru has issued a toll-free number to report cases of insecurity during the curfew.
