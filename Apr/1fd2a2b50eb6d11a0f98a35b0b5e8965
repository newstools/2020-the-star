Kakamega Woman Rep Elsie Muhanda's driver has been asked to refund Sh988,558 he earned as salary "irregularly"  from the county government. Christopher Litunda earned the money between October 1, 2017, and October 31, 2019, when he was officially working for the Parliamentary Service Commission, according to Public Service chief officer Lawrence Omuhaka. "You are, therefore, advised to refund the amount you erroneously received as salary the earliest possible, failure to which further action will be taken," Omuhaka's letter to him demanding the refund said. It is dated December 3, 2019.. Muhanda requested that Litunda be seconded to the PSC as her driver on August 22, 2017. Litunda also made his transfer request on the same date. He was released on October 10. Litunda, however, continued receiving a salary and other allowances from the county government. He was Muhanda’s official driver when she served as the Health and later trade and tourism executive. In the new turn of events, the office of clerk to the assembly has denied that Litunda is their employee. "This is to confirm that Litunda is not an employee of the national assembly. In case you require further clarification, kindly contact us," the letter signed by Serah Kioko on behalf of the assembly clerk says. It is unclear why the driver continued earning from the county government yet the Woman Rep's office received Sh700,000 monthly to pay her staff, including a driver. Litunda on Wednesday denied receiving any demand for the money from the county government. “I don’t have a copy of that letter. It was not addressed to me but only through me." Muhanda dismissed the allegations as mere propaganda. She did not, however, say who she thought was behind it. "I don't prepare the payroll. There may have been miscommunication and failure to check with the county public service board," she said by phone. Edited by R.Wamochie
