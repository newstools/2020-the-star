Last week’s treasury bills were oversubscribed as investors opted to place their money on the one-year government paper. The Central Bank of Kenya received bids worth Sh27. 04 billion against a target of Sh24 billion, 79.55 per cent of which came from the 364-day Treasury Bills. The government’s fiscal agents received bids worth Sh21.51 billion during Thursday’s auction, more than double the Sh10 billion on offer for the one-year T-bills. For the 6-month paper, investors placed bids worth Sh4.63 billion, against a target of Sh10 billion while the 3-month paper only raised Sh907.51 million against the Sh4 billion on offer. This, even as interest rates on T-bills on offer increased marginally. “Interest rates on the 182-day and 364-day Treasury bills increased marginally, while the rate on the 91-day Treasury bill decreased,” CBK said in its weekly bulletin. Over the past few weeks, investors have been leaning more towards the one-year government paper, with a wait and see attitude over the impact and uncertainty surrounding the spread of the coronavirus. The average weighted interest on the 91 – day T-bills decreased to 7.22 per cent from 7.24 per cent the previous week. The rate for the 182-day T-bills rose to 8.145 per cent compared to 8.118 per cent at the previous week’s auction while the 364 – day government paper fetched 9.049 per cent from 9.045 per cent the week before. CBK accepted the Sh27.04 billion bids received during last week’s auction.
