Drama unfolded in a Kibera court on Thursday when a woman fell before the magistrate after the charge sheet was read to her by the court clerk. Edna Buliba was arraigned alongside Sastine Wangila. She was accused of negligence that led to the theft of property worth Sh530,000 from an apartment in Dagoreti subcounty, Nairobi. The two were charged that on April 26 at Thomson apartment, Lavington, while on duty they failed to use all reasonable means to prevent a burglary. The house of Allan Moses was broken into and property worth Sh 530,000 stolen. On hearing the charge, Buliba fell to the ground before the magistrate. The session was being held outside the courtroom as a precautionary measure to prevent the spread of Covid-19. The magistrate, court attendants, police officers and suspects watched Buliba in disbelief, some thinking she had passed out. Before falling, she had told the court that she was innocent. “I did not commit the offence. My children have not seen me for a while now,” she said while tears ran down her cheeks. “Don’t cry, just explain to us," senior principal magistrate Philip Mutua told her. Mutua however granted the woman and her co-accused person on Sh100,000 bond or Sh50,000 cash bail. The prosecution requested the police officers to take her away. She slowly rose and left as advised. Mutua directed the case to proceed on May 13. Edited by Henry Makori
