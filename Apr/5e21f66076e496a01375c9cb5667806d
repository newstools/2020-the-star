A 38-year-old police officer has been arrested for allegedly raping a suspect at Kikesa patrol base in Yatta, Machakos county. The victim had been summoned to record a statement on Thursday at 10am at the patrol base, which is 20km from Yatta police station over theft allegations. She was accused of stealing her neighbour's goats. Doctors at Matuu Level 4 Hospital confirmed the woman was raped several times, the police boss said. Machakos police commander Karanja Muiruri condemned the act. Muiruri said the suspect, based in Matuu police station, is alleged to have pulled the woman into his house within the patrol base and raped her repeatedly, threatening to kill her if she raised an alarm. Karanja said the woman was rescued by another officer from the house. "The officer was arrested by Yatta police officers led by the area OCS," Karanja said. The officer has been detained at Yatta police station awaiting arraignment at Kithimani law court on Monday. "Since there are no court proceedings, we have arranged with the magistrate and the officer will be arraigned on Monday to answer to his crime," Karanja said. Karanja, however, said the act should not be used to stain the image of the National Police Service, but noted the accused must "carry his own cross". Edited by E.Kibii
