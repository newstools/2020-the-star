President Uhuru Kenyatta on Thursday evening signed into law the Supplementary Appropriation Bill, 2020. The new law paves the way for the utilization of Sh107,5 billion from the Consolidated Fund for the delivery of public services in the current Financial Year. The Bill was passed by Parliament on Wednesday and was presented to Uhuru for signing on Thursday by National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi. The MPs amended the second supplementary estimates so the government expenditure is reduced by Sh51 billion. The Treasury had wanted a Sh53 billion reduction. The National Treasury had proposed a net reduction of Sh74 billion in the current budget, being a reduction of development funding by Sh98 billion and increased recurrent expenditure by Sh24 billion. In the report approved by the National Assembly during a late-night sitting on last week, MPs increased recurrent spending to Sh31 billion, development reduced by Sh83 billion. The National Assembly has made further reallocations and reduced its budget by Sh3 billion to ring-fence resources for the fight against Covid-19. In December last year, Uhuru signed into law the second Supplementary Appropriation BillÂ  2019. This paved way for the release of Sh73.4 billion that went towards funding various government services and projects for the period ending June 30, 2020.
