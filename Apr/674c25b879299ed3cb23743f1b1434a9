If there is one thing that Covid-19 disruption has taught me, it is that there is a lot of value in shared working spaces. This is the third week that I am working from home. While it has been smooth for the most part, the lack of human connection with co-workers has been a steep curve. Holding meetings on Zoom is not the same as sitting around a table sharing ideas and making fun of each other while at it. For someone who is used to walking to a colleague's desk to discuss an idea, working from home is a huge disruptor. The key challenges with working from home in our situation are that reliable Internet connectivity is not a guarantee and unstable power supply dogs us often. Turnaround time is highly compromised when people are working from different locations, thus dealing a blow to efficiency. One other lesson is that working from home requires team leaders to understand the needs of their staff. Many people, myself included, are working from couches and dining tables which in my experience is not conducive. The other thing one needs to do is to come up with a routine similar to when working from the office. Wake up, shower and dress up as you would normally; take breaks similar to those you do at work; have meals at the same time you would if you were working from the office. But the most important thing is to keep in touch with your colleagues and check in with your supervisors regularly since you do not have the luxury of walking up to them. Edited by Henry Makori
