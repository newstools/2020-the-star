A Busia ward representative has denied being roughed up and beaten by General Service Unit officers for allegedly drinking in a bar during curfew hours. Bernard Papa (Malaba Central) said on Saturday the allegations were part of a smear campaign by his opponents to taint his image. Those spreading the allegations, he said, should invest their energies in helping the country fight Covid-19 instead. The MCA said since the curfew began he has been spending most of the time at home with his family. “We are busy fighting coronavirus and they are busy spreading falsehoods against me. You mean I do not know that bars were ordered closed? Name those spreading these claims because I want to face them,” Papa said by phone. A source who requested anonymity told the Star on Saturday that the first time MCA was roughed up by GSU officers patrolling Malaba town on Friday evening. The 8pm incident happenned at a bar known for hosting political meetings and frequented by politicians and political strategists in Teso North constituency,the source said. He said Papa was beaten and allowed to drive to his Amagoro home. The bar is owned by a former Teso North parliamentary aspirant. “He told them (the GSU) that he is the area MCA but they ignored him. He  received some canes,” the source said. A counter bar attendant is said to have locked herself in when the GSU arrived. There have been heightened police patrols in Malaba town since the curfew began. Officers from the Akichelesit GSU camp are among those deployed in the town to ensure residents of the border town are home by 7pm. Edited by Henry Makori
