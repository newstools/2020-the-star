@ppcheti Ancient boreholes in Lamu are being rehabilitated to improve water supply and boost hand-washing and hygiene in the war on coronavirus. All the boreholes and shallow wells being restored are centuries old and have been in disuse for a long time. At least 50 boreholes and shallow wells in Langoni, Jua Kali, Kibaki Grounds, Kanu, Kinooni, Manda-Okoe, Shella and Kashmir are targets of rehabilitation. Trade and Tourism executive Atwa Salim said work is ongoing on the first phase targeting 15 boreholes. Salim, who spoke in Lamu town on Wednesday, said there was a need to boost water supply because the demand is high in heightened war against the spread of Covid-19. The water will greatly benefit more than 200 traders recently relocated from the Municipal Centre to the Kibaki Grounds where there is adequate space for social distancing. The Kibaki Grounds isn’t supplied with water and traders have to pay for supplies for use even in common utilities like toilets. “The objective is to boost water supply to all people at this time when it is in such high demand. Most of the boreholes are still in good condition and all we are doing is removing the accumulated dirt to allow for clean water to collect,” Salim said. He appealed for information on the location of some of the  boreholes. Lamu Water and Sewerage Company managing director Paul Wainaina said the company will treat the water and take necessary measures to ensure its safety. “This is a time to join hands in the war against this killer virus. We shall ensure the boreholes and the water therein is safe for human consumption,” Wainaina said.  Edited by P.O
