Veteran gospel singer Reuben Kigame says he had a conversation on the possibility of bringing the late Kenny Roger to Kenya last year. "About a year ago, Jeff Koinange and I were planning before he couldn't travel anymore. It was not to be," he said on YouTube. Kigame says he grew up listening to Kenny Rogers, who greatly influenced him in doing country songs like 'Never Alone' and 'Another Country'. Rogers died peacefully at home two weeks ago at 81 years. He died from natural causes under the care of hospice and surrounded by his family. Kigame said his death is a blow to the country music world, but also a life well lived musically. "His last days, which saw him oscillate towards singing worship songs like those on his album, 'The Gift', is an indicator that Kenny was deeply in love with Jesus," the singer said. Kigame has done a cover of 'The Vows Go Unbroken', the most loved song from Kenny Rogers's collection of 1989, as a tribute to his country music legacy.
