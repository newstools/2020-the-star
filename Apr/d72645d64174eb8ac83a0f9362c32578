Parklands MCA Jayendra Malde last week gave out donations to the people of Deep Sea Slums to mitigate the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. The main purpose of the donation was to help out people whose businesses have been affected since some of them depend on daily wages from domestic and industries/companies in Westlands and Parklands. The project was planned by the MCA and his team. Other donors were Hindu Swaymsevak Sangh and East Africa Satsang Swamnirayan Temple-Nairobi.
