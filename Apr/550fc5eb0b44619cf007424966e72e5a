Kenya Sevens skipper Andrew Amonde believes the postponement of the Olympics Games in Tokyo to next year due to the coronavirus pandemic will be a blessing in disguise for Shujaa. The long-serving captain said they hope to use the duration to sort out the inconsistencies in the team this season. “We have been trying out as a lot of new players and if you carefully observe our performances in the six tournaments, it was up and down. I guess by next season, It will all be clear,” added Amonde. The KCB back-row forward had earlier hinted that this was going to be his final season in the Shujaa jersey but has had a rethink in light of the recent developments. “I thought this was going to be my final year but I want to go and compete at the Olympic Games next year and try and win a medal for the country,” noted Amonde Shujaa have had a lacklustre campaign this season bagging 35 points from six tournaments played with two Main Cup quarterfinal appearances, forcing technical director Paul Feeney to change the side several times in a bid to get a winning combination. Although the side currently lie 11th on the log, Amonde believes they should be much higher. “It’s a very different squad with old and young players coming through and getting the combination has not been right but with this pandemic break, maybe it will give us a chance to reset our targets and come back stronger in the months to come,” he added. He laughed off suggestions that the players were not well-conditioned for the rigours of the new campaign. “We had a very intense pre-season but remember some of us did not play the full season last year. The game of Sevens is ever-evolving with new tactics and plays hence that may take time for the players to adjust.” Among  those who have come in the firing line for their  poor performances have been burly forward Oscar Ouma, play maker Sammy Oliech and centre Billy Odhiambo.
