Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen has gone all out to sing after President Uhuru Kenyatta directed Sh100m for artists during the period of the Covid-19 pandemic. On Monday, Uhuru directed that the Ministry of Sports, Culture, and Heritage avail the funds help artists deal with effects of coronavirus. This, he said is to keep on entertaining Kenyans through TV, radio and the internet. Barely two days after the presidential directive, the Senate Majority Leader decided to sing to entertain his followers on Twitter. "...I have a friend who loves me.....Who truly loves me. I will testify what he did to me in the past and what He plans to do for you..." Murkomen sang. Though he sang in Kalenjin, the politician was seen enjoying the praise and worship song as he was driving. "Hakuna mahali Rais alisema mwimbaji bora, ni bora mwimbaji...!" He tweeted. Murkomen is a son of a Reverend and former Sunday school teacher Even as he continued with the song, his lawyer friends applauded him for the good work asking him to fully explore his talent in singing. @DLUDOGOLI said "... Please call the house on the hill... We don't need Sh 100million for artists. Just give Kenyans Sh 20,000/- per family per month...just for 2 months then no rent for many... Tutajipanga ...artists should contribute to this kitty." "I can see you are auditioning for the Sh200m royalties set aside for the artists," @bm_bashir said. Others include;
