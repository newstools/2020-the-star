Homa Bay security officers have put a truck driver in self-quarantine for allegedly being in contact with a Covid-19 positive person. The driver who works at Sukari Industry in Ndhiwa constituency was held by officers on suspicion that he came into contact with a person who tested positive for coronavirus in Siaya. The suspect whose name was withheld is under mandatory quarantine at a facility in Homa Bay. Homa Bay officers traced and found him at Opapo weighbridge in Rongo constituency, Migori county, while undertaking his normal duties. Speaking to journalists on Monday, county commissioner Yatich Kipkemei said the driver underwent medical tests including screening before he was taken to quarantine. “Security and health officers responded swiftly after we got information about the driver’s whereabouts. We’re still looking for other suspects,” Kipkemei said. The administrator urged residents who might have come into contact with the suspects to voluntarily reach health officers for tests and medication to avoid possible spread of the disease. He called for concerted efforts in the fight against the disease. “There is a need for all of us to cooperate in combating coronavirus. There is no harm is contracting the virus, hence suspects should boldly come out for assistance,” he added. The specimen of the driver was taken for lab testing at Kenya Medical and Research Institute in Kisumu. Homa Bay has not had any coronavirus cases since the first case was announced in Kenya last month. The county government called on residents not to panic and adhere to the laid down procedures to prevent possible spread of the virus. “Let residents keep social distance, regularly wash their hands with soap and running water to keep away the disease,” Kipkemei said. Last week, Kipkemei led in distributing alcohol-based sanitiser to boda boda riders in Homa Bay town. The more than 250 sanitation facilities were donations from the national government.
