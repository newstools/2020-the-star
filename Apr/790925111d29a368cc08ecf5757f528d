Willy Paul has thanked President Uhuru Kenyatta for the bold decision to cater to the needs of artistes. Uhuru announced a Sh200 million allocation for artistes from this month to cushion them from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. The President did not, however, mention which system will be used to distribute the funds, which are supposed to serve over 30,000 creatives. Willy regretted that the President directed the money to the same people who have been paying them peanuts. "What we want now is transparency. They should tell us how they intend to distribute the money. What system are these boards using to pay us? They should know that we have our eyes on them. And this time tutakua nao kwa hio meza tukifanya maamuzi pamoja," he said. Speaking to Word Is on Monday, rapper Frasha said they will put on notice anyone who tries to take advantage of them. "This money that has been given to cushion artistes should be used to do just that. We demand transparency on how it will be distributed and to whom it will be distributed to," he said.
