Farmers in Taveta subcounty of Taita Taveta are hoping for continued food production after the county government revived a section of River Lumi which had blocked. The 25-kilometre stretch has been desilted to allow hundreds of banana and vegetable farmers continue with food production. The project has reclaimed more than 25,000 acres under banana plantation according to Agriculture executive Davis Mwangoma. Mwangoma said desilting of the river from Maguniani to Kiongoni was also necessary to avert flooding that has often been experienced during the rainy season. He said the department was keen on increasing food production in the region, pointing out that the sector has not been spared by the effects of coronavirus. "Since this channel blocked 20 years ago, it has affected our productivity by channeling the water to our farms and roads. Most of the banana leaves have turned brown while productivity has reduced significantly," farmer Cornel Meriati said. He said the revived river channel will allow farmers to produce enough food for consumption and for sale. Bomeni ward administrator Maureen Kirigha said the project will enable farmersÂ to become self-sustaining. "The excavation of the river received tremendous support from MCAs including Chrispus Tondoo (Bomeni), Ronald Sagurani (Mahoo), Jones Maskuji (Mboghoni) and Mata's Nobert Chanzu. It is going to benefit hundreds of farmers in these areas," Kirigha said. Farmers are expected to expand their farming ahead of the completion of the multi-million banana processing and value addition plant in Taveta. The growers produce about 125,000 tonnes annually on the 2,080 acres under banana plantation. The industry will process eight tonnes in a day. Farmers are targeting to increase production to 246,000 tonnes annually to sustain the banana factory. Once completed, the industry is expected to grow the economy by Sh7 billion.
