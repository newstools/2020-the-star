@magatinews The state should include doctors in the 5,000 health workers it is to hire to fight the Covid-19, Nyanza union officials have said. Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Board Union officials said it was concerned no vacancies for doctors had been announced in the ongoing recruitment. Nyanza KMPDU secretary Lameck Omweri said there are at least 3000 jobless medicine graduates. "It unbelievable that the government can omit them from the ongoing recruitment of the additional health workers needed to battle this virus," Omweri said. He said the Ministry of Health has not hired doctors since 2016. "If this is the trend, then there should be no protests from anybody when they get poached by other countries," Omweri said. The government is relying on wrong advice in the recruitment process, he said. "There should be parity in the recruitment process of health personnel. No cadre should be left out. Each has a role to play in this crisis," Omweri said. He said the country is yet to achieve the doctor-patient ratio as recommended by the World Health Organization. Omweri also faulted the government for failing to provide adequate protective gear to medical workers who are in the frontline in tackling the coronavirus. He said it is ironical that face masks are being hawked in the streets of urban centres while only a few have been availed to doctors and nurses. "It bothers us that emphasis is being placed in touts and boda boda operators while those in the heat of the battle are not being given the necessary attention," he said.
