Kenya has reported 16 new coronavirus cases, increasing the country's total to 336, Health CAS Rashid Aman said on Friday. A total of 946 samples across 12 counties were tested in the last 24 hours. Of the new cases, 11 were in Nairobi and five in Mombasa. A total of 887 contacts are being monitored in relation to the new cases. There were five discharges, bringing to 95 the total number of recoveries. In Nairobi, the Covid-19 cases were in Dandora (5), City park (2), Eastleigh (1), Parklands (2) and Pipeline (1). Mombasaâ€™s five cases are in Kiembeni (1), Centi Kumi (1), Stadium (1), Msikiti Nuru (1) and Mulaloni (1). "This is not the time to pull back. We thank the Judiciary, through CJ Maraga for excising restraint," Aman said. The ministry has launched nutrition guidelines to combat Covid-19. It also launched a one million gardens campaign in collaboration with Nyumba Kumi to encourage Kenyans to set up kitchen gardens. The ministry continued to call to enforcement officers not to mistreat essential service and goods providers, including food transporters. Parents have been encouraged to teach their children about nutrition and work with them to set up kitchen gardens. Meanwhile, CAS Aman said the ministry is not aware of Kenya being targeted for UK trials for a Covid-19 vaccine.
