Health experts will decide whether to lift or extend the partial lockdown and restricted movement, President Uhuru Kenyatta said on Wednesday. Uhuru on April 6 ordered cessation of movement in and out of the four counties for 21 days to curb the spread of the coronavirus. On Wednesday, Mandera joined the list of partial lockdown counties. The three weeks end on Monday next week. The country was also put in under an indefinite dusk-to-dawn curfew to limit people's movement to contain the spread of the virus. Speaking during an interview with local radio stations, Uhuru said feedback on the measures taken so far will also help the government arrive at a way forward. “I cannot say today whether we will extend or lift, it depends on the results we will get,” Uhuru said. “When the time comes, we will tell Kenyans what to do based on advice from our experts.” The President ruled out the relaxation of curfew for Muslims during the month of Ramadan beginning Thursday. Some Muslim leaders have asked that the curfew be reduced so it starts at 9pm instead of 7pm to allow more prayer time. It ends at 5am. He said Muslims should not expect special treatment during the holy month but acknowledged that Ramadhan and Easter celebrations were very important events in both Muslims and Christians’ calendars. Christians were a week ago forced to pray at home to mark Easter as the government banned gatherings and stressed the need for social distancing to curb the spread of coronavirus. “Same to what we told Christians during Easter, this year is a special year. Everyone to celebrate at home. Muslims should follow suit and know that this is a special year,” Uhuru said. “Let us agree that this year we will not do things normally. Easter and Ramadan are major events to both Christians and Muslims.” Muslims will start observing the holy month from today April 23 through May 23.  Edited by P.O
