Algerian-based national team forward Ariel Okal has been receiving training tips from Moran’s captain Griffin Ligare to keep fit. Okal, who recently signed for Algerian top side Union Sportive Setif, has been training indoors due to the coronavirus pandemic. “I train three times a day. The coach sends me a programme, which I follow to the letter,” he said. He reveals considering the 3 pm to 7 am lockdown in Algeria, one can only train indoors. Okal had played four games before the league was cancelled. He says he was in safe hands and was waiting for the season to start. He keeps himself busy by watching movies and reading books. “The club has maintained a high level of professionalism in dealing with the situation and taking care of me. They make sure I do not lack anything,” he said. The Morans stand-out turned up for Ahli Sidab and Shofar in the Muddle East between 2016-18. In between, he also played for PLS Hawks of Seychelles. “The Algerian league has 20 teams with ten teams in each conference. Our team is in the ABC National 1, which is the top flight league here,” he notes. The former Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) star also applauded the role played by the Kenyan Embassy in Algeria, saying they are taking care of Kenyans well.
