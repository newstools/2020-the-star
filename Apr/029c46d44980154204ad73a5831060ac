A man was charged on Friday in a Makadara court with abducting and defiling a 17-year-old girl. Michael Okwara is said to have defiled the Form 3 student on different dates between January 16 and March 20 in Ruai area, Nairobi county. He was accused of luring the girl into marriage. The matter was reported by Nyumba Kumi officials to the children's office after they suspected that Okwara was cohabiting with an underage. She was then rescued and taken to Mama Lucy Kibaki Hospital in Kayole where she was confirmed to be 16 weeks pregnant. The girl had been living with her father after her parents separated and shared their eight children equally. She told the police that she feared going back home after spending a night with the suspect.
