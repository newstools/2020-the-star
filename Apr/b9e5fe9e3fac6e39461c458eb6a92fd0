Police in Kisumu have launched a manhunt for two brothers suspected of beating to death their father’s lover on Tuesday night. The suspects are said to have been angered by their father’s invitation of his lover to his Got Owak matrimonial home in Nyalenda when the mother was admitted to Dunga Port Florence Hospital. Mercy Akinyi Adienge, 29, succumbed to injuries sustained during the beating, according to Kisumu Central OCPD Martha Ngetich. “When I arrived home accompanied by the woman, my sons were enraged and beat her up with wooden sticks,” their father Erick Okoth said in a police report. Adienge, who was from Suba in Homa Bay, sustained serious multiple injuries. She was rushed to Kisumu County Hospital where she died while undergoing treatment. “The duo (brothers)is still at large. We will charge them with murder,” Ngetich said. The police boss said Okoth reported the incident on Wednesday. He had not informed the sons of his intention to marry another woman, Ngetich said. A neighbour who sought anonymity said Okoth, a retired teacher, has been dating the woman and wanted to make her his second wife. “She has frequently been visiting the man’s house,” the neighbour told the Star, adding that “the sons were infuriated by their father’s lack of empathy to their ailing mother". The victim's family, through a spokesperson who did not want to be named, said "there is no justification for killing her even if she went to the man’s house”. The family called for expeditious police investigations and bring the culprits to book. “All we want is justice to be served.” Edited by R.Wamochie
