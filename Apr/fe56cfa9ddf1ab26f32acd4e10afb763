Working from home is an art many are still trying to master. Boredom is the biggest challenge of working from home especially when one is living alone. Watching TV all day, sleeping and eating even when not hungry are the fruits of boredom. There is also an increase in the intake of junk food thus an increased level of lifestyle diseases. Working at home has reduced creativity levels to a great extent. This is because there are so many distractions ranging from kids, spouses, pets, etc. Truth be told, there have been increased marital conflicts since people started working from home. Some people have been sent home on unpaid leave while others have taken pay cuts. This means people are going through financial problems. Couples are also spending more time together and this may be a breeding ground for conflicts. This is because couples are learning of behaviours they knew not about their partners.
