Tenants in a building on the verge of collapsing in Huruma have until Friday evening to move out. The seven-storey building located on Mbuthia Road, Ngei 2b had initially been marked for demolition by the National Construction Authority but this was never done. According to the chairman of the area Felix Nzioka, the tenants on the ground floor of the building realised there was a problem when they tried opening their doors  on Wednesday in vain. They matter was reported to the residential leadership. Residents were told to vacate after a discussion to do so was reached by the area OCS, the area chief and the assistant together with the National Construction Authority officials. The building houses 70 tenants. Wycliffe, one of the tenants, said he owns a shop onthe ground floor and one of the doors refused to open due to the pressure exerted by the sinking building. “The person in charge of disaster management was called together with the OCS through the chief’s office. We went there yesterday and found the building had a big crack that was incrasing,” Nzioka said. "We called the building owner and he agreed the building has a problem and agreed to refund the rent plus the deposit for this month so that we can move out." The building was initially to be evacuated by noon on Friday, but was extended to give tenants adequate time to move. The officials from the inspectorate department will evaluate the building. "It is a very risky building. The building has an ‘X’ showing April 20, 2016 behind and we don’t know the reasons why. But the good thing is people have agreed to move," Nzioka said.
