Members of the Busia County Assembly have foregone their Sh8.75 million allowances to finance the anti-coronavirus war chest. The decision was informed by the urgency to combat the spread of Covid-19, which is relentlessly ruining the economy. The MCAs disclosed their resolve at a news conference after tabling a Sh100 million Supplementary Budget for 2019/2020. “What we have foregone includes sitting allowances and per diems,” Nangina Ward rep John Obwogo said on behalf of his colleagues. “The allowances will help in the purchase of face masks, gloves, soap and sanitiser for frontline health workers and county residents.” The MCAs said they were heeding President Uhuru Kenyatta’s appeal to leaders to finance the battle against the pandemic. “We have heeded to the President's directive given the nature of the pandemic that is ravaging the world,” Julius Ochou (Marachi East) said. Grace Olita (Angurai South) called on more leaders to emulate them and commit money to the war against Covid-19. Olita called on residents strictly follow health safety guidelines issued by Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe to limit the spread of the contagious disease. Ten days ago, Governor Sospeter Ojaamong said his government would commit Sh100 million towards fighting the coronavirus. Kenya had by Thursday 234 confirmed cases. Ojaamong also announced that Busia may suspend the implementation of some projects if the pandemic continues  and redirect the money to the anti-coronavirus kitty. The Supplementary Budget was presented by Budget and Appropriation Committee chairman Linus Asiba. Speaker Bernard Wamalwa allowed only 17 members into the chamber in compliance with the social distancing directive. They included nine members of the Budget and Appropriation Committee.  - mwaniki fm
