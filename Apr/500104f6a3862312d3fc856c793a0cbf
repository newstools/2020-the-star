Deputy President William Ruto has raised a storm in the ruling Jubilee Party over proposed changes to the National Management Committee. While Jubilee members have a right to free speech, their public squabbling is threatening to shift the country’s attention from Covid-19. During an international health crisis such as the coronavirus, our government and healthcare system face a fundamental test of preparedness to protect Kenyans. As reported cases of the coronavirus continue to spread in the country and around the world, Kenyans must focus their energy on fighting the virus that has killed more than 100,000 globally. Our leaders must do better and avoid debates and discussions that shift our attention to other things. Jubilee leaders have internal party organs. Both sides should use them to resolve their differences instead of dragging the whole country into the infighting. To treat the country to “usual” politicking at this time is unacceptable because we face the biggest fight in Kenya’s post-Independence existence: Our lives are on the line and the economy is under threat. President Uhuru Kenyatta should call his party members to order and focus their energy on fighting Covid-19, feeding poor Kenyans and ensuring our people follow instructions given to them.
