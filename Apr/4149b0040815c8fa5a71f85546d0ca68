Twenty-three Kyuso residents were fined Sh1,000 each for flouting the Health ministry directive to wear face masks in public places to contain the coronavirus. The residents were arrested at several trading centres and were charged at the Kyuso Law Courts on Wednesday. Before Kyuso senior resident magistrate John Aringo, all the accused persons pleaded guilty. Aringo ordered each of the accused persons released upon payment of the Sh1,000 fine. On Wednesday, Kyuso subcounty police boss Charles Machinji said his department was concerned about residents' laxity to follow the social distancing directive. “We have been watching and had given people enough time to adapt to masks and social distancing. It is worrying that the public is obstinate, despite the directives being in place to save their lives,” Machinji said. He announced that the police would conduct a random crackdown in all market centres in Kyuso to arrest those found flouting the rules. Machinji said the arrest, jailing or fining of some people violating the anti-Covid-19 directives would serve as a warning to residents. (edited by o. owino)
