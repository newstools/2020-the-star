Flooding has disrupted commerce at the Gilgil open-air market. The situation has raised fears of disease outbreak. The market, which was located in a stadium two weeks ago as part of measures to fight the spread of Covid-19, has more than 300 traders. They blame the Nakuru county government for their predicament and have vowed not to pay the daily levies until the mess is fixed. Peter Njoroge said accessing the market was a major challenge for both the traders and customers. He said they have incurred huge losses after efforts to get assistance from the county failed. “We were transferred to this stadium in a bid to stop the spread of the coronavirus but we fear we night now get cholera,” the trader said. Colleague John Kuria said the stadium had been turned into a lake and their goods are rotting. He questioned the rationale of relocating them from the town centre since their customers are now avoiding the stadium. “This place is already flooded. Access roads to are in poor condition and the toilets do not have water,” Kuria lamented. Meanwhile, the rehabilitation of roads in Naivasha's informal settlements is  in disarray due to the heavy rains. Some roads and drainage systems have been washed away by floods. Viwandani MCA Eric Gichuki said the most affected estates were County Council, Site and Kabati where the World Bank project was ongoing. He blamed poor workmanship by the contractor for the destruction of he project that had been ongoing for months. “The rains in Naivasha have left a trail of destruction and we are deeply concerned about poor workmanship on this project,” he said. Trader Simon Mwangi said the rains had disrupted transport in the town. He feared that the worst is yet to come.
