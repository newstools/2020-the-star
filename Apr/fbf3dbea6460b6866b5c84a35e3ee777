The Kakamega government has hired 183 medical staff in the last three months to improve services in public hospitals. Health executive Rachael Okumu said the county got an additional 102 health workers from the national government under the Universal Health Coverage programme, raising the number to 285. Kakamega has been allocated 53 medics in the ongoing hiring of 5, 500 additional medical staff to bolster the war on the coronavirus. Okumu on Thursday said the county hired 26 doctors, 13 clinical officers, 144 nurses and 102 health workers under the Universal Health Care programme. “Covid-19 struck when the county had already employed the health workers in different cadres in January this year to improve service delivery in public hospitals,” she said. The hiring was part of preparations for the opening of the first phase of the Sh6.2 billion referral hospital set to be commissioned in June. The 500-bed facility will be the biggest in the former Western province and is expected to revolutionise the health sector in the region and promote medical tourism. The hired health workers have been deployed to various health facilities, with the majority sent to the county general hospital. Okumu said the county is in the process of employing an additional 140 medics. “Although the medics are not enough to handle the ever-increasing number of patients, they are key to improving service delivery in our facilities,” she said. The executive said that the county had embarked on rehabilitating wards at the county general hospital to serve patients better. “Some of the wards were too old. The county is giving them a facelift as part of the programmes aimed at changing the face of the hospital,” she added. Governor Wycliffe Oparanya said the first phase of the hospital will end in June and operations will start in September. He said 3, 000 people, including 60 doctors and other specialists, will be hired by the hospital. Edited by Henry Makori
