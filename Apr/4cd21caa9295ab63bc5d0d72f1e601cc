Burly Nairobi City Stars striker Davis Agesa is confident that the National Super League log leaders will be promoted to the Kenya Premier League next season. Agesa warned KPL top guns to expect a much improved Jonathan Jackson Foundation-sponsored side in the top tier league. “With this managerial setup, I feel we are cut out for better things in years to come. Going by the performance we’ve pulled in so far, then I believe we are ripe for the top tier,” he told the club’s website. He added: “I have to give all the appreciation to Jonathan Jackson and the company for the new set-up that has  massively improved the welfare of the players and outlook of the club.” Agesa, who has played professional football in Bangladesh and Seychelles, hailed coach Sanjin Alagic and the entire technical bench for keeping the team on course. The Kawangware Primary and Kaimosi Boys' alumnus also spoke about his experience in Seychelles and Bangladesh. “It was a whole new experience at the professional level in Seychelles. Different type of players and a different mentality, but same football though on a very different level with very high humidity,” he noted. He added: “This was in 2015 when I signed a one-year contract with Revengers FC. I stayed at the club for six-months but terminated the contract on mutual consent due to financial struggles at the club. I then returned to Vapor Sports.” In late 2018, he joined Baridhara in Bangladesh but that didn’t go well as he suffered a knee injury while playing preseason tournaments. “It was my first major injury and a major setback and I struggled to recover from it. I never even got to sign a contract for Baridhara,” he regretted. Agesa says he now has the experience and aspires to return abroad.
