Kiambu police are on a manhunt for suspects who killed a 75-year-old businessman in Ting'ang'a village in Kiambu county. Kiambu OCPD Joseph Kimani confirmed the incident on Wednesday. Raphael Gichinga was last seen on Sunday after he closed his butchery in Kiambu town to beat the 7pm curfew. “From witnesses, Gichinga who operates a butchery in Kiambu town at Kangangi market closed around 6.30 pm and headed for his home at Ting'ang'a village,” Kimani said. Gichinga lived alone as he had lost his wife. His body was found on Monday in his home. He had deep cuts on his body and his head had been smashed with a blunt object. Kimani said the attackers dismantled CCTV cameras and his vehicle was stolen. Gichinga's house looked like it was thoroughly ransacked, like something was being sought, the officer said. “The scene was made to look like it was a burglary but this is a murder since no locks had been broken and the CCTV cameras were dismantled and taken away. His vehicle KCT504H Nissan Adivan was stolen and his house ransacked,” the police said. He said they were following crucial leads as there was someone seen with him at around 7pm near his home. Patrick Muiruri, Gichinga’s brother, said Gichinga was a peaceful man who had never been in trouble with anyone. “My brother had no children and lost his wife sometimes back and anyone wanting to kill him is absurd since he operates a butchery and had no grudge that we know of with anyone,” Muiruri said.
