Kenya Morans center Tom ‘Bush’ Wamukota will be key for Rwandese side Patriots when Basketball Africa League (BAL) action starts, assistant coach Ben Oluoch has said. Oluoch said the towering Wamukota has settled well at the Rwandese top side after joining from Tunisia in February. Speaking from Kigali, Oluoch said Wamukota had impressed in the one match he had played before the coronavirus pandemic halted the action. “Bush will bring the presence we badly need. He is vocal and has a 7-foot reach which will be crucial in covering our weaknesses,” said Oluoch. Oluoch and Wamukota arrived in Kigali early this year with the aim of propelling the team to glory in the inaugural 12-team tournament. “Bush has shown all in Patriots the importance of being self-motivated. It is never dull in training when he is around,” Oluoch noted. “ He talks, he yells, he is leading in sprints. His energy is amazing and this has made his investing in him worth every penny. He is a leader in training and during games, though he played only the last game before the lock down,” said Oluoch, who handled Tangit Sparks in the Kenyan Premier League. “Since this is our maiden voyage to the African big stage. Patriots will be fully prepared and ready to waltz with the big boys when the time comes.” Patriots won the Kigali qualifiers in November and are grouped alongside Monastir (Tunisia), FAR Cameroon), Rivers Hoopers (Nigeria) and Zamalek (Egypt). Head coach, American Dean Murray, will spearhead the team’s continental onslaught assisted by Oluoch and Burundian Olivier Ndayiragije. The Rwandan league is semi-professional with Patriots, Rwanda Energy Group (Reg), IPRC Kigali and Espoir making the top four.
