Uganda has announced it will repatriate a man who tested positive for coronavirus. The Tanzanian truck driver is said to have entered the country through Mutukula border point on April 16. The Ugandan Ministry of Health said the 34-year-old man from Dar es Salaam did not show any signs and symptoms upon arrival. "He did not have any signs and symptoms consistent with COVID-19. Efforts are underway to track the driver and return him to Tanzania," a statement from the ministry said. On Friday, the ministry confirmed one case out of 744 samples tested from truck drivers at Ugandan entry points. Uganda confirmed 55 cases of the virus at the time. On Tuesday, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni extended national lockdown for another 21 days to mitigate the virus spread. The government introduced a food programme to support the vulnerable and those in the urban areas depending on daily earnings. "The qualifications for these food grants are two: you were depending on a daily earning that was suspended," Museveni said. "Therefore, those that do not fall in these categories, should not clamour for food grants." Edited by Henry Makori
