The Beulah Christian Fellowship Church in Mwingi donated maize flour, bars of soap, sugar and rice to 60 vulnerable families for Easter. The donations, through Bishop Gabriel Ngulutu, were delivered to the doorsteps of each family to avoid crowding to curb the spread of the coronavirus. The vulnerable who were far away were sent Sh10,000. Pastor Titus Ngulutu said life is no longer the same due to the Covid-19 pandemic and therefore as a church they decided to donate foodstuffs. He called upon those who have plenty to eat to donate to the less fortunate. Widow Eunice Mwangangi, a mother of five, thanked the church for remembering them during the pandemic as they are no longer working. Putting food on the table to feed her children has become a problem. “Times have proved hard ever since the pandemic struck, we are grateful for this kind gesture,” Eunice said. Christine Nthenya said she sometimes go without food for days as she was forced to close her business as directed by Health CS Mutahi Kagwe to avoid the spread of the virus. (Edited by V. Graham)
