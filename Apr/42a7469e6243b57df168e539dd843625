Enterprise Cup defending champions Kabras RFC tactician Henly Du Plessis is feeling disheartened by the cancellation of the rugby season by the Kenya Rugby Union The union made the decision last week due to the current coronavirus pandemic that has hit the world. Du Plessis expressed his disappointment that the season can't be played to the end. “It’s so disheartening for the season to have been cancelled at the time when we were aiming for the double. However, we agree that the decision is important in safeguarding the players and stakeholders in the rugby fraternity from the COVID -19 disease. “We were hoping to win the Kenya Cup and Enterprise Cup title. This has really demotivated some players, but we have accepted it considering that life is more important," he noted. “If we insist on playing and lose lives, it will be bad for the sport but taking precautions will give us another time to compete.  We shall, therefore, give our players time to rest as we wait for the next step of action," he added. “It’s important to the players to have a chance to rest and refresh ahead of the next season,” said Du Plessis. He also asked the players and other technical staff to be careful and observe the laid down directives aimed at curbing the dreaded disease that has become a major challenge across the world. Kabras have been in a stellar form, topping Kenya cup and qualifying for the semi-finals of the Enterprise Cup.
