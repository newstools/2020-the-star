The number of births recorded at public health facilities has significantly improved since the government launched the free maternity programme. The Economic Survey 2020 report released on Tuesday by the Finance CS Ukur Yatani shows that the percentage has been improving from 90.1 recorded in 2015 to 96.7 as by the end of 2019. The government rolled out free maternity programme in 2014 in all public health facilities, with a general focus on health care both at the county and national levels. In the year 2015, the survey indicated that 950,224 babies were born, out of which 9.9 per cent were born at homes. The survey indicated that 1,178,260 births were registered in 2019 at the health facilities while 3.3 per cent of the number were delivered at home. The number of home deliveries in 2018 was 5.3 per cent out of 1,138,654 births. Also, the statistics show that the number of girls delivered in 2019 was 50.8 per cent while that of boys was 49.2 per cent. The survey also revealed that in 2019, a total of 190,696 deaths were registered compared to 192,019 registered in 2018. Slightly over half of the reported deaths (56.3 per cent) were reported to have occurred in health facilities while 43.7 deaths occurred in homes. Also, the proportion of deaths that were registered in 2019 was higher for males than females. Registered male deaths accounted for 55.6 per cent, yielding a death registration sex ratio of 125 males per 100 females. This sex ratio might be attributed to a higher likelihood of deaths to males being registered due to possible incentives of property inheritance.
