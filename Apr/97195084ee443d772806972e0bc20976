Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua has said no distribution of alcohol will be allowed in his county until the end of May. The governor on Tuesday said the decision was reached at following a meeting held by the county Emergency Response Committee, which also comprised national government officials and a section of county elected leaders. The team said no one will be allowed to distribute alcohol or alcoholic products in Machakos starting from Wednesday up to the end of May. However, the order will be reviewed if the bar owners and the locals will fully comply with the laws and regulations that have been set. Mutua said that alcohol-based medical supplies including sanitizers will be allowed in the county. The decision was made to tame bar owners who have been opening bars secretly despite the ban. “We are trying to tame errant bars that open illegally, every day, behind a closed door, basically in every village in Machakos county. They are restocked with new supplies daily,” Machakos County Emergency Response Committee said. Also, the team said that no transit trucks will be allowed to stop in Machakos. The government banned clubs and bars from operating in order to reduce the transmission of coronavirus. Several people have been arrested for being in bars illegally. The government has announced that those who will be found outside at the time of curfew will be quarantined for 14 days. On Tuesday, Health CAS Mercy Mwangangi announced that the country confirmed 15 more cases in the last 24 hours, bringing the total to 296. Out of these, 11 are Kenyans, while four are foreigners. None have a history of travel. The CAS said seven of the new cases are from Mombasa, which has become a hot spot for the virus.
