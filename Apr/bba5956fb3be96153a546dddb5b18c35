Individuals taken into quarantine facilities for breaching curfew directives will be tested for Covdi-19 and released if they turn negative, acting director general of Health Patrick Amoth has said. Amoth on Thursday said those released will be advised to self-quarantine. He said quarantine facilities have now fast tracked coronavirus testing to allow the release of those who test negative from the centres. Amoth spoke during the daily Covid-19 presser on Thursday when 17 new coronavirus cases were reported. This brings the country's total to 320, Health CAS Mercy Mwangangi said. All 17 are Kenyans; 12 are from Mombasa, while five were from Nairobi. Mwangangi cautioned against the stigmatization of those sent to the facilities. "Being quarantined is neither detention, nor a punishment. Quarantine is meant to serve the greater public good, which is public health," she said. On April 15, Health CS Mutahi Kagwe announced that total of 455 individuals have been put in mandatory 14-day quarantine for failing to adhere to curfew regulations. This followed a directive for those found breaching curfew rules to be rounded up and put in mandatory quarantine at their own costs. The decision is part of the government's move to ensure strict enforcement of the dusk-to-dawn curfew to curb the spread of coronavirus. Several people among them police officers, MCAs and athletes were arrested after they were found to have locked themselves in bars, drinking.
