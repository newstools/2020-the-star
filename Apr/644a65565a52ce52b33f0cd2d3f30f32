Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko might not, after all, remove the city from his deal with the national government, the Star can reveal. The deal saw Nairobi transfer some key functions to the national government when Sonko surrendered the crucial functions of health, transport, public works and planning. This week, however, the county chief sensationally claimed he was hoodwinked into signing the agreement, saying he never saw the draft document before signing it. “I was not given sufficient time to even read the draft," he said. Hence, he threatened to withdraw from the deal, claiming some top state officials had hijacked the process and were frustrating his office. “There are people who have chosen to hijack the process. He (the governor) is not happy with the way they are managing the process and he is contemplating going to court,” the governor’s spokesman Ben Mulwa told the Star. But after a high-level meeting with senior officials from the national government, Sonko is now said to have agreed to soften his hard stance and will no longer pursue the divorce. According to a highly placed source, who talked to the Star, the deal was hammered on Thursday in a meeting that brought together the county assembly’s leadership, the county executive and two officials from State House. “They discussed the governor’s concerns, especially about the slashing of his office budget. They have agreed to amend the supplementary budget that the governor rejected last week,” the source said. “The governor has also 'stepped down' his threat to terminate the transfer deal.” On Friday, however, a senior county assembly leader denied ever attending such a meeting. “There was no such a meeting that I attended,” she said.
