City Hall has started a crackdown in Nairobi on restaurants and businesses flouting the preventative measures and guidelines on Coronavirus. Those found defying the directives risk losing their business licenses and face legal action. Nairobi County Health Executive Hitan Majevdia on Monday said no one will be spared in the crackdown. He noted that restaurants, especially within the estates, were secretly operating their businesses and offering service to customers opposing the Ministry of Health directive that they should only offer take away services. President Uhuru Kenyatta on Monday declared the cessation of movement in and out of Nairobi, Kilifi, Kwale and Mombasa counties for 21 days. “Nairobi is already a hot spot with most coronavirus cases situated here. We will not allow anyone to undermine our efforts to curb the spread of Covid-19,” Majevdia said. Traders found operating within the dusk to dawn curfew in Nairobi risk having their licenses withdrawn. Nairobi County has been declared as the epicentre of the coronavirus by the Ministry of Health. “Restaurants and business must adhere to the law, be responsible and exercise high levels of discipline during this trying time. Everyone's business in the county is going at a loss but we have to bring in measures to prevent the spread of Covid-19,” Majevdia said. In addition, the county government of Nairobi has urged its residents to adhere to all government directives to curb the spread of Covid-19.
