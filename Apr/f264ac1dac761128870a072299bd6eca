A Nairobi court has recognised Daisy Namachanja as one of the wives of the late Ex-CBK bank employee Christopher Namachanja. This brings to a close the burial dispute that was there between Daisy and the first wife Lucy Namachanja. Senior Resident Magistrate D.M. Kivuti on Thursday further lifted the order stopping the burial and directed Lee Funeral Home to release the body to the two wives. "The body of Christopher now lying at Lee Funeral Home shall be release to Lucy and Daisy for burial at Bungoma family ancestral land" the court ruled. The court says both Daisy and Lucy are at liberty to attend the burial at par with other family members all relatives of the deceased in conformity with Luhya customs and practice in burial. Kivuti also noted that the evidence produced by Daisy including children birth certificates, photographs of a traditional wedding and their joint account documents are satisfactory enough to presume a marriage between the deceased and Daisy. Daisy had obtained orders stopping the burial after first wife Lucy refused to recognise her marriage to Christopher. Christopher who died last month was Assistant Director at the Kenya School of Monetary Studies.
