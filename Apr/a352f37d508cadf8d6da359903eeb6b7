Kenyans can help the government's fight against the coronavirus by heeding directives to contain its spread, ANC party leader Musalia Mudavadi has said. Mudavadi said citizens should not view the virus as the state's problem but be proactive to ensure they are protected against infection. "As leaders, we are informing our people on a daily basis about what they should be doing in order to protect themselves from this disease," Mudavadi said. He said the number of infections and deaths in Italy, Spain and China and other European countries had alarmed him. “This is a global pandemic and it has cost heavy damages in most of the nations out there. As Kenyans, let's follow the guidelines provided by the state for our own sake,” Mudavadi said. Mudavadi said that Kenya cannot combat Covid-19 through police brutality that has been witnessed countrywide. He urged the security officers not to use excessive force on Kenyans while implementing the curfew. “Curfew was not a pass to law enforcers to mistreat and beat Kenyans in that manner we are seeing. We cannot fight this coronavirus on teargas, chains and other crude weapons,” Mudavadi said. The ANC leader said Kenyans are struggling with how they will take care of their families during the tough times.
