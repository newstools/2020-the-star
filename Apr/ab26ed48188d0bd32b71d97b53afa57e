More than 17 people are still missing after the government ended the search in areas hit by flash floods and mudslides along the West Pokot and Elgeyo Marakwet border. President Uhuru Kenyatta initially said 29 people died when the mudslides destroyed several villages and flattened Chesogon market where a police station was swept away. Two officers were killed. The estimated death toll, including the 17 missing, is now 46 from the tragedy on April 18. More than 100,000 people live along risky escarpments and officials want them to be relocated. Villagers are still searching to find the bodies of their relatives. Uasin Gishu Senator Margaret Kamar, Soy MP Caleb Kositany and other leaders criticised the government's decision to end the search. “It was insensitive to end the search when affected families are still camping in the same area waiting to recover bodies of their loved ones,” Kositany said. More than 30 people were injured and 4,000 displaced after the heavy rains and flash floods. Elgeyo Marakwet Governor Alex Tolgos said 28 people died in his county alone. Only six bodies have been recovered in the last five days, he said. “We are still recovering many body parts and figure 28 is just for my county," Tolgos said. "If we tally with the exact figures yet to be established in West Pokot, then it's evident we lost so many lives in that tragedy." Tolgos said the situation in the region was still critical with many families camping at Sambalat and Wewa primary schools. The national government was working with well-wishers and neighbouring counties to help the victims. “We still urgently require assistance for the affected families in the area where our measures to fight Covid-19 have been affected," Tolgos said. He said Kitui county had pledged to send face masks. Agriculture CAS Linah Kilimo visited the area and said the resettlement of families living along the escarpments won't end the perennial flooding but will prevent deaths. Edited by V. Graham
