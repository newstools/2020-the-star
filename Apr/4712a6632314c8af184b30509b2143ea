At least 1,000 households from Riverside in Nairobi’s Baba Dogo have received food donations worth Sh1.5 million from Kenafric Industries. Working closely with Baba Dogo community youth, Nyumba Kumi and volunteers, the company distributed food, confectionery and stationery to put a smile on children’s faces during the Covid-19 outbreak. Speaking on Saturday, Kenafric board chairman Bharat Shah said the country faces an unprecedented impact of the pandemic, adding that the little things done for Kenyans will help limit the spread of the virus and ease related economic hardships faced by the community. “The purpose is to give hope to people who are going through a very difficult time because of this virus,” Bharat said. He added, “We are taking care of 1,000 families in the first round and as we don’t know how long the virus will be in the country, so we will ensure the sustainability of this project continues.” On Saturday, President Uhuru Kenyatta rolled out an initiative that will create jobs while making the environment healthier. The inaugural cluster of employment will involve residents in 23 informal settlements across seven of the most affected counties including Nairobi. Nairobi alone has more than five informal settlements including Kibera, Mathare, sections of Dandora, Mukuru kwa Njenga and Mukuru kwa Reuben. Dandora has already recorded five positive cases of Covid-19. “I believe this added to the already existing 108,000 vulnerable households that are presently receiving cash and the Sh8 billion that our senior citizens' programme and vulnerable families are getting will continue to provide tangible relief to the neediest in our society,” Uhuru said. The first phase of the programme for the next 30 days will employ 26,148 workers and eventually grow to over 100,000 young people across the country. Edited by R.Wamochie
