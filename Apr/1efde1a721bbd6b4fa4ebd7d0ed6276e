Former Papa Dennis boss and Maliza Umaskini CEO Sadat Muhindi has offered to support singer Majirani after he came out to the public, claiming he was depressed and needed someone to help him continue running his normal life. In a viral video seen by Word Is, Sadat has encouraged Majirani to remain strong. "Life is hard but you have to struggle. Nothing comes easy. Sometimes you fail, other times you wake up," he said. "I have been auctioned like three times and my house has been locked for more than five times when I was renting a house. I did not lose hope so even you in Bungoma, stay there and when things will be back to normal, together with Maliza Umaskini, I will help you come back to music. "I know people love your work and they miss your music. I will make sure you go back to your normal lifestyle and continue doing your music. God bless you." Majirani came out to the public a week ago, saying he was broke and has been sleeping on the streets after he was unable to pay rent. The singer is currently living in a grass-thatched house with a friend, and he said he was open to any job. "I’ve lost weight and I don’t regret starting a football team that has helped many. Only God can repay me," he said. On seeing Sadat's video, Majirani thanked him. "A big message from a big heart... Just what I needed during this low moment of my life... A message of hope at least I can hang on a little bit... Thank u soo much Maliza Umaskini president Sadat Muhindi," he said.
