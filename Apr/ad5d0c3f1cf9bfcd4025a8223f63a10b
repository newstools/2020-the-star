Kenya Cup clubs and the Kenya Rugby Union will have an emergency meeting this evening to chart a way forward on the status of the 2019/2020 season. A fortnight ago, the union canceled the current season due the coronavirus pandemic, adding that there will be no relegation and promotion thus invalidating all results for the entire campaign. The meeting has been called by the KRU board to avert an appeal after the top clubs sought audience with the Judicial Appeals Committee with an aim of having the federation’s decision rescinded. The conference call between the union and the clubs will involve champions KCB, Kabras, Impala, Homeboyz, Mwamba, Menengai Oilers, Nondies, Quins and Blak Blad. Kenya Cup caucus chairman Xavier Makuba said: “We had already started paperwork on the appeal process but the union have called for this meeting. Let’s hear what they have to say and if we can get consensus on the way forward,” said Makuba. On one hand, the country’s top clubs insist they were never consulted on the cancellation of the season and believe the federation acted in haste while on the other, the union believes with the spread of coronavirus, it’s is unlikely to resume the season in the next two to three months. The league was suspended last month following the government directive banning all sporting activities. The leagues were entering the playoff stages.
