The office of Teso North MP Oku Kaunya has denied claims by boda boda riders his office is distributing free condoms instead of free face masks. Constituency manager Richard Ochalu told the Star on Thursday the Wednesday and Thursday protests by boda boda riders were stage-managed by political opponents out to tarnish the name of the first-time MP. He said the legislator would not give condoms to constituents when every Kenyan’s attention is focused on fighting the coronavirus. “Why would we distribute condoms now and why?” Ochalu asked."These are the works of opponents. Boda boda riders in Malaba town protested on Wednesday and Thursday demanding why the MP chose to give them condoms instead of face masks to protect them from the virus. Boda boda riders in the subcounty say the government should provide free face masks. Putting on face masks can protect against the spread of the virus from an infected person who coughs or sneezes. The riders, mostly from Roadblock Stage, said the decision to give condoms was an insult. As they protested, they waved packets of condoms they claimed were given out to them by officials from the MP’s office. They said, however, condoms are useful and they will not return them. “If condoms are all the help we can get from our leaders, we still appreciate them and will use them," one protester said. Another one asked, “Are these the sanitisers we are supposed to receive?” Kaunya distributed face masks, hand sanitiser, soap and water in Amagoro town on Tuesday, urging residents of Teso North to follow Health ministry guidelines. Attempts by the Star to get a comment from the MP were unsuccessful as his mobile was busy. He did not respond to a text message Teso North has not recorded any case of Covid-19. By Thursday, 184 Kenyans had been confirmed coronavirus positive. (Edited by V. Graham)
