Telkom has recorded a 50 per cent spike in data consumption on its network, as the government and health authorities urge Kenyans to stay home to curb the spread of Coronavirus. Since the closure of schools and people being asked to work from by the government, most students have been studying online as the rest of the people made the switch to conducting their affairs, virtually, from home. Kenya currently confirmed 12 new Covid-19 cases bringing the total number to 246 in the country as the government intensifies enforcement measures to grapple the fast spreading Coronavirus pandemic. “In the past month, we have experienced a sharp increase in data usage on our network as a result of increased number of users who must now minimize movement but still meet their contractual, professional, business or educational obligations.” Telkom’s CEO, Mugo Kibati said. Data from the Communications Authority (CA) showed that the company’s mobile subscriptions stood at 3.5 million last year down from 4.2 million. The firm realized that the growth on its network is most notable in residential areas that had not been initially dimensioned to support such unusually high traffic. The telco is also supporting e-learning programs as it launched the Soma na Telkom bundles, a monthly data package and internet solutions tailored to the needs of faculties, staff and students, as more schools and institutions of higher learning adopt e-learning approaches. Telkom also recently announced, that its partnership with Loon, the Alphabet Company working to bring balloon-powered Internet to Kenya, has received all regulatory and cabinet approvals to begin flying balloons in Kenya. Once the balloons are in place over the coming few weeks, this new technology will complement Telkom’s ongoing strategy to further widen its network coverage, confirming the telco as Kenya’s preferred data network.
