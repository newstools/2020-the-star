As at the night of April 1, Kenya had recorded one coronavirus death and three resulting from police brutality. On Wednesday night, hours after the President apologised for their brutality, a fourth was added to the list of police victims—a barman caught up at work. Relatives of Erick Ng'ethe, 23, said he was beaten to death by police officers at Nyamira Bar in Mandigo, Diani. Relative Edith Waithera said Ng'ethe was still at work when police officers arrived. The officers, who were enforcing the 7pm-5am curfew, lobbed tear-gas canisters into the bar. Waithera said Ng'ethe and his colleagues had barricaded themselves inside. They were trying to escape when police broke in. "Due to teargas chemicals my uncle and other people were suffocating and wanted to run away through the roof but they were unsuccessful," she said. Waithera said her uncle was whipped until he lost consciousness while others were severely injured. But Msambweni subcounty police commander Nehemiah Bitok denied the police killed Ng'ethe. He said Ng'ethe was injured in a stampede while trying to run away. According to Waithera, police say Ng'ethe died as he was being rushed to Tiwi Hospital, but she thinks he died while he was being whipped. Bitok said officers had taken him to a nearby health dispensary to save his life. The other police victims are a 13-year-old boy playing at his balcony during curfew hours on Monday and two boda boda operators—one of them had taken a pregnant woman to hospital. Muhuri rapid response officer Francis Auma condemned the killing, saying police should be held responsible for Ng'ethe's death. He said more than 200 people from Mombasa and Kwale are nursing serious injuries after being assaulted by police enforcing the curfew. Police have begun investigating Ng'ethe's death.
