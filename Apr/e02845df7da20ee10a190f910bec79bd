Siaya Senator James Orengo has publicly displayed the results of his coronavirus tests after 17 legislators and parliamentary staff tested positive for Covid-19. Panic hit Parliament after the reports emerged of the legislators' results. According to multiple sources, the Ministry of Health told the Speakers to cancel the special sitting of both Houses because some of the MPs had tested positive. With names withheld, Orengo has now come out publicly to admit that he tested negative. According to the results posted on Twitter on Wednesday, Orengo who did his tests and screening with Lancet pathologists was cleared of having any virus. "I took a voluntary Covid-19 test on Friday last week. The result was directly conveyed to me in person by a doctor. Tested Negative," he said. " It is my civic duty to continue complying with guidelines. It's not a matter of choice. At the same time, Parliament cannot abdicate. Chew gum and walk." Orengo said as a nation and a people 'we are in this together and must confront COVID-19 as an army'. "...fear of the virus should not be turned into stigma but into a resolve to fight the pandemic. Count me in the army," he said. Senators, Members of the National Assembly and staff have been undergoing voluntary tests for Covid in Parliament Buildings since last week. More than 200 members who have undergone the test, including the Speakers, have been receiving their individual results from the Ministry of Health. Some members and staff had been on mandatory self-quarantine. A week ago, some of them took to the social media to celebrate and thank God for the successful completion of the 14-day quarantine. They included Eldas MP Adan Keynan, Naomi Shaban (Taita Taveta), Aaron Cheruiyot (Kericho) and George Khaniri (Vihiga). They had travelled to the UK and jetted back early last month.
