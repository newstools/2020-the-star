A 15-year-old girl was on Saturday morning found murdered at Urudi village in Kisumu West subcounty. The body was found dumped a few metres from their home. The girl reportedly went missing on Friday at around 2pm causing her parents and relatives to look for her in the nearby bushes and homes all in vain. It is suspected she was raped before being killed. The Standard 7 pupil at Ogada Primary was in good health when she disappeared, according to relatives. Before she disappeared, she had taken some drinking water to her mother, who was working on the farm. Kisumu West police boss Edward Kang'ara did not pick calls or reply to text messages when reached over the matter. Haki Africa programme associate Mathias Shipeta visited the scene alongside Transform Empowerment for Action Initiative officers and condemned the killing. “This is a barbaric act that should not be taken lightly. From the look of things, the girl might have been raped by more than two people who she knew,” Shipeta said. Shipeta said the injuries on the body suggested the attackers wanted to kill the girl. He called on police to conduct a thorough investigation to bring the culprits to book. “Human life must be guarded at all costs. Nobody has the right to take another person’s life,” Shipeta said. Kisumu West MP Olago Aluoch condemned the killing and appealed to the police to increase their patrols. He asked residents to be vigilant and give police information that might lead to the arrest of suspects. “We want to see those responsible for such savage face the full force of the law,” Olago said. Last year, in the same village, a Form 1 girl was found dead under unclear circumstances and her private parts cut off. The body was dumped inside a culvert. During her burial, mourners stormed and torched a house of a relative whom they accused of devil-worshipping. They claimed the relative was taking the lives of innocent children. Edited by E.Kibii
