Every syllabus will be completed before students can sit for exams later this year, Government spokesman Cyrus Oguna has said. Speaking on Citizen TV on Monday, Oguna said the government would even consider teaching over the weekends to ensure that the syllabus is completed. "The Ministry of Education will ensure that every syllabus will be completed before we sit for the examsâ€¦even if it means working every weekend to catch up for the time lost," he said. "The ministry is working on a strategy to ensure that the syllabus of that period will be completed." Noting that online learning is not being accessed by students, Oguna said that the majority of students would benefit from the programmes they are airing. "We understand that some do not have access but as we head towards the end of the year the ministry has worked on a plan that every syllabus will be completed for every child," he said. "The students will be given sufficient time to revise and be given the confidence that they would need to sit for the exams." The reopening of schools and colleges has pushed forward by another month. Education Cabinet Secretary George Magoha on Sunday said the earliest schools can reopen is June, even though Kenya is now registering more recoveries from Covid-19. "There will be many interventions depending on how we control the disease. Every child will be given time to cover the lost time before an exam is administered. The government hasn't decided if to postpone both the KCSE and KCPE [exams]," Magoha said. On Sunday, the government reported 12 new Covid-19 cases, from 500 tests. This brought the total reported cases in Kenya to 355.
