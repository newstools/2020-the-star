The bodies of a woman and her son have been retrieved from a river in Kabondo Kasipul constituency after they allegedly drowned. The bodies of Lydia Adhiambo,30, and her son Edwin Omondi, 10, were found floating on River Awach at Kabong’o village, Kokwanyo, on Saturday morning. The two went missing on Thursday shortly before curfew time when they went to Olima market on Thursday according to Lydia’s husband, Jack Omondi. “My wife went to the market but at about 7.20pm, she saw police who were on patrol. They ran to escape but accidentally fell and drowned in the river,” Omondi said. Nicholas Otieno, Lydia’s brother-in-law, said they have been looking for them since they failed to return home. Otieno called on the police to investigate the matter and unearth what caused the death of his wife and son. “Justice should prevail in deaths of the two. They can’t just drown at once,” he said. County police Commander Esther Seroney said they are investigating the cause of the two deaths. “These people were reported to have drowned when the family realised they were missing. We’re pursuing the matter,” Seroney said. “What is clear about deaths of the two is that they drowned,” she said. The bodies were taken to Rachuonyo South Subcounty Hospital mortuary.
