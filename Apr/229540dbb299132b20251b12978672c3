I have met many people in Mombasa county complaining that they have not received food rations. The food is being distributed by young men in their 20s and l think they are not up to their job. In the area I live in, they have come thrice and given food to four people, while about 200 people are in need. When the young men were asked why that is happening, they showed a list of names, which they were supposedly were given by a Mzee wa Mtaa. Some of those being given food are able and instead of distributing the remaining food to those present, the youths go back with it. This is unfair because the food has been donated by well-wishers to help the sick, vulnerable and those without jobs. It also defeats the purpose of distributing food. A government officer, a religious leader in the area and community leader should be involved in this process for fairness. There is no area where there has been satisfactory food distribution. The video showing food being distributed to homes is painting a different picture of what is happening on the ground. Ver0nica Onjoro from Mombasa
