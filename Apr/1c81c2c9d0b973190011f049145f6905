An elderly man was attacked at his Bunyala home on Saturday and robbed of Sh8,000. Adriano Kundu, 85, is nursing neck injuries. He is a beneficiary of the government's cash transfer programme for the elderly. His wife Agnes Adikinyi said Kundu had just received the money. She said their neighbour raised the alarm when she heard a loud bang on their door followed by groans as the thugs battered her husband. “Unknown people broke into our house and started strangling and ordering my husband to give them the cash he had been paid last Thursday," Adikinyi said. "She [the neighbour] raised the alarm that drew my attention and I rushed outside the main house only to discover that unknown people, who had already disappeared from the scene, had attacked my husband." This was the second time her husband had been robbed. Kundu was ambushed in January and robbed of Sh3,500. He was home alone. Kundu, who is now bedridden, has appealed to Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong and other well-wishers to help him get medical attention. “I cannot take my husband to the hospital because of lack of money," Adikinyi, a traditional birth attendant, said.
