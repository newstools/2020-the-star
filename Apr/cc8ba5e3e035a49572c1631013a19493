A portrait will be hung in a crypt at Meru Catholic Cathedral where Bishop Silas Silvius Njiru would have been buried. Njiru, the first African bishop of Meru diocese, died of Covid-19 on Tuesday in Turin, Italy, aged 92.  He was diagnosed with the virus and hospitalised three days before his death. The death was announced by Fr Pedro Jose da Silva Luoro, the secretary-general of Consolata Missionaries. Njiru retired in 2004 after serving for 25 years as Meru bishop. He thereafter moved to the Blessed Joseph Allamano house in Alpignano, Turin. He was succeeded by Bishop Salesius Mugambi. He had succeeded Bishop Lawrence Bessone. A requiem mass in Meru was yesterday presided over by Mugambi during which he announced that the portrait would be symbolic as Njiru's body cannot be brought home for burial. The crypt can take 12 bodies, Mugambi said. A crypt is a stone chamber beneath the floor of a church or any other building. Luoro eulogised Njiru as a clergyman of integrity, who dedicated his service to the well-being of the people of God. Mugambi remembered Njiru as a mentor of young people in Isiolo, Embu, Tharaka Nithi and Meru counties. “He was a very good mentor and disciplinarian. He sacrificed so much for the vulnerable in society. Some of his projects include children’s homes." He said only a few priests, among them Father-in-charge David Kaberia, sisters and the faithful (less than 10) could attend the mass to keep distance as per Covid-19 regulations. Njiru was born in Kevote, Embu county. His elder brother, the late Emilio Njeru, was the first African Catholic bishop of Eldoret. - mwaniki fm
