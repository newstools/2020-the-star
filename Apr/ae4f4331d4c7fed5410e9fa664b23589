President Uhuru Kenyatta has dismissed plans by UK based researchers to launch a coronavirus vaccine trial tests in Kenya. In his fifth address to the nation President Kenyatta said no clinical trials in relation to coronavirus was planned for testing in Kenya. On Friday, BBC reported that a British scientist had picked the country to start its tests of Covid-19 trials in Kenya if tests in the UK donâ€™t get the expected results. However, the President revealed that Kenya Medical Research Institute had joined in the search of a coronavirus treatment. "I want to assure you that reports in the media on planned vaccine trials is a lie. Our researchers are working and if they develop anything notable then we will communicate. We won't do anything in the sidelines," Kenyatta said on Saturday. This comes as the government confirmed seven new cases on Saturday to push the number to 343. The first human trial of a coronavirus vaccine in Europe began on Thursday. Two of the 800 volunteers were given the vaccine. Oxford University said it may start trials in countries like Kenya later on. The vaccine was developed by a team at Oxford University. Sarah Gilbert, professor of vaccinology at the Jenner Institute, led the pre-clinical research. Half of the volunteers will receive the coronavirus vaccine while the remaining will get a meningitis control vaccine. Edited by R.Wamochie
