Respiratory diseases are the top causes of hospital visits in Kenya. Such diseases, and diarrhoea, are also the leading causes of death in the country, according to the 2020 Economic Survey. The survey shows that last year, respiratory illnesses formed 25 per cent of reported disease incidence in public health facilities. The report bears the risk Kenya faces in combating Covid-19, which is more severe in populations affected by other respiratory illnesses. Respiratory diseases may be caused by infection, smoking tobacco, or breathing in secondhand tobacco smoke and air pollution. The next most common disease was malaria, whose burden increased by 18.6 per cent to 4.7 million cases in 2019. "The lake stable endemic zone accounting for the largest number of cases at 74.4 per cent," the report produced by the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics reads. Symptoms of upper respiratory tract infections include nasal congestions, running nose and sore throat. In total, disease incidences as reported by public health facilities increased by 17.3 per cent to 87.8 million in 2019, the report reads. For children, pneumonia accounted for the highest number of admissions at 18.7 per cent, followed by malaria at 9.9 per cent in 2019. The report indicates there were 190,696 registered deaths in Kenya last year, 55.6 per cent of them being of men. The report does not, however, give the causes of death, but according to the World Health Organization, diarrhoea remains the leading cause of death in Kenya, followed by influenza and pneumonia. The report also shows obesity is now one of the diseases driving Kenyans to hospitals. It further shows the number of murder cases registered at the High Court increased to 1,171 in 2019, while convictions decreased to 243 in the same period. The total number of murder cases registered in court increased by 10 per cent from 1,065 in 2018. However, there were 1,527 reported cases of murder in 2019 compared to 1,312 in 2018. The Economic Survey released on Tuesday indicates that 1,275 males and 252 females were reported to have committed murder. "Murder accounted for the highest share of homicides at 68.2 per cent in 2019 with the number of persons reported having committed this crime increasing by 16.4 per cent to 1,527 in the same period." "Similarly, persons reported to have caused death by dangerous driving increased by 49.2 per cent over the same period," the report states. According to the data by the KNBS, the government also recorded 92 cases of manslaughter in 2019 up from 39 in 2018. Murder is a homicide committed with “malice aforethought.” That doesn’t mean it is a malicious killing. Manslaughter is typically treated as a less severe crime than murder. Manslaughter can be broken up into degrees or categorised as voluntary and involuntary manslaughter. Edited by R.Wamochie
