Suspects in remand prisons will have their bail terms reviewed downwards to decongest jails, the Judiciary has said. The move is meant to avert a possible health disaster caused by the coronavirus. Already, the Naivasha law courts have introduced a video-link trial model for remand suspects at Naivasha Annex Prison, which is congested. Naivasha senior principal magistrate Joseph Karanja said the outbreak had adversely affected the judicial system, hence the need to go digital. Karanja said remand cases will be fast-tracked and their bond terms eased. “Currently the number of suspects in remand prisons is three times higher, leading to congestion and affecting plans to fight this pandemic,” he said. The magistrate noted that before the outbreak of the virus, courts already had a backlog of cases. He said that despite the backlog, the Judiciary was keen to make sure that justice was dispensed as fast as possible. “We are seeking ways of moving away from the incarceration of the suspects and also make sure the wheels of justice are moving.” He said that with the high number of suspects in remand, it would be impossible to observe the social-distance as directed by health officials. “We shall seek new ways of either putting them on probation, community service or on suspended jail terms,” he said. During the session, Harison Gicheru,a 54-year-old suspect who has been in remand for over a year for stealing livest ock, was set free.  (edited by o. owino)
