The government has issued a stern warning to Kinale residents in Kiambu county that whoever will interfere with preparations for tree planting will be arrested. The Kenya Forest Service has said it is going ahead with preparing land for tree planting. Kiambu ecosystem conservator Paul Karanja said they would not compromise in realisingÂ  President Uhuru Kenyatta's vision of 10 per cent forest cover, whaich is recommended internationally. Karanja said a group of Kinale residents were being incited that there was no community forest association in place. Karanja warned the group that those inciting locals always hide from being arrested, leaving others to causechaos. "Last week, we witnessed something very ugly. Our members would have fought with pangas and jembes out of incitement by some few individuals," he said. Last Tuesday, the two groups almost fought over control of the Plantation Establishment and Livelihood Improvement Schemes (Pelis) plots. Trouble started when one group started uprooting beacons indicating how pieces of land were subdivided. KFS officials dispersed them, saying the issue could not be discussed since gatherings had been banned by the Ministry of Health. One group alleges that they do not recognize Peter Kimani Githuka as their CFA chairman, saying they know Mwaura wa Mugo as the chairman. "The KFS Act does not allow two CFA's to control one forest," said Dominic Chui, a CFA member. Pelis is a programme where communities living near forests are allocated pieces of land in the forest to cultivate and plant food crops but they must take care of the trees planted by the Kenya Forest Service. The Mugo-led group vowed last week that they would uproot beacons subdividing the blocks for Pelis. However, Karanja said even though no meeting will be held, plans to cultivate the blocks would continue as they plan to plant trees when the rain starts. Edited by Henry Makori
