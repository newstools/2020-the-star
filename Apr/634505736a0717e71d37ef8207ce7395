No areas of the city will be hit by serious water shortage amid the coronavirus outbreak, the Nairobi Water and Sewerage Company has said. Acting director Nahason Muguna told the Star on the phone that a lot is being done to enhance the supply of water in the city. “We are putting up 20 boreholes in collaboration with the ministry and Athi Waterworks Development Agency,” Muguna said. He said five boreholes are almost ready in Mukuru. In Kibra, another five boreholes are nearly operational. Muguna said Mathare and Matopeni will each benefit from five boreholes. The NWSC boss said water points for handwashing have been provided, especially in open markets. The ablution blocks in informal settlements have also been provided with 1,200 handwashing water points. "We are still putting up more," Muguna said. Muguna said the Ndakaini Dam — the main water supply for Nairobi — is still overflowing. However, they can only supply the city with what the installed capacity produces. Ndakaini Dam can store 70,000,000 cubic metres at full capacity. On March 17, Muguna said his firm was producing 526,600 cubic metres per day from the dam. This is against the demand of 800,000 cubic metres per day, leaving a shortfall of 273,400 cubic metres. Experts have faulted the leadership for failing to upgrade the dam based on population projections. Nairobi county currently has 4,397,073 people according to the last census. Residents of several estates in Eastlands have lamented that water was still scarce in their neighbourhoods. NWSC had last month announced it would revise the city water rationing programme to increase supply in estates, especially informal settlements. Mukuru Kwa Njenga, Kibera and Mathare were among those listed to receive water supply five days a week in the revised programme. Muguna said the closure of some institutions due to the coronavirus pandemic such as airports and universities has freed up some water that will be diverted to the estates. (edited by o. owino)
