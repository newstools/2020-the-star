The government should work out an economic stimulus package that will cushion the SMEs to deal with the effects of the Covid-19 crisis, Lurambi MP Titus Khamala has urged. He said on Wednesday that the informal sector has been hit hard by the measures taken by the government to check the spread of the virus and would require about three years to recover, hence the need to support them to aid their faster recovery. "By the time the government announces that the situation has normalised, Kenyans will have nothing to begin on. The end of the pandemic will mark the beginning of the hard times ahead, which we must prepare for as a country," Khamala said. He made the remarks when he distributed food, face masks, sanitiser, water tanks and handwashing soap to his constituents. Khamala said the majority of Kenyans have lost their livelihoods and hunger will set in as the government struggles to steady the economy. The legislator urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to ask China to either agree to restructure or write off its loans to Kenya. "Kenyans need tax relief and the government cannot, therefore, raise money to service the debts by China. The President should take a bold step and tell China that now that the virus came from them and it has destroyed our economy, we have no money to pay them," he said. Khamala urged the government to ensure fairness in the selection of the beneficiaries of the Inua Jamii stipends to ensure the money is sent to deserving cases. He said all elected leaders should set aside their political aspirations and support the efforts targeted at containing the virus so the government can embark on fulfilling the Big Four agenda ahead of the next general election. “This is not the time to politic. The situation facing us calls for everyone’s effort to save the country from a catastrophe. Let us revisit our ambition later,” he said.
