Nairobi Records has brought together artistes in the release of the song, 'Corona ni Hatari'. The project is funded by Caleb Amisi Foundation. Artistes featured include Precious PI, Fire Bwize, Ken-Artiste, Ta-Boy, Jecks, Gillipi and Naps. Speaking to Word Is, project manager Mash Mjukuu said the motive of the song is to educate the public, create awareness on the dangers of the coronavirus and how to avoid being infected and affected. "Corona is a threat to humanity. I urge everyone to be vigilant and take care of themselves and the people around them. The government cannot manage to fight this pandemic if we don't cooperate and do as required," he said. "Always wear masks, gloves and sanitise. If possible, stay at home."
