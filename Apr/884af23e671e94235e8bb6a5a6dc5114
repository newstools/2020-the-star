DJ Mo has told his wife they will not be getting more children. He tickled his fans when he started campaigning for family planning on Instagram after unsuccessfully attempting to work with his two children around. DJ Mo had his son seated in a rocker that was placed on the table, while his eldest daughter, Ladasha, chose to use daddy’s back as a chair and playing ground. He had earlier convinced himself he would work at home and multitask with watching over his little ones. The more he struggled to concentrate on his computer, the more his daughter kept pestering him and jumping behind him. Size 8 came downstairs and burst into laughter. “I know kids come with blessings but these two are enough. We will use family planning from here,” Mo said.
