Some restaurants will be allowed to open, President Uhuru Kenyatta has said. During a press briefing on Saturday, he said that restaurants that meet highest levels of health regulation will be allowed to open. "One immediate step from the work done so far is that we will allow a few restaurants and eateries that show the highest levels of health regulation compliance, and the ability to arrange for employee testing, to undertake minimal operations while maintaining measures that mitigate against the spread of the coronavirus," he said. He said Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe will announce and release the protocols. He warned that any report by the public or authorities that these establishments are not following the measures will lead to their instant closure and prosecutions. "We will reopen this economy but it must be in a way that does not endanger thousands of lives. Some countries had initially succeeded in suppressing the pandemic, only for them to open up without a proper process and suffer a huge spike in infections," the President said. At least 5,000 bars, entertainment spots, and restaurants remain closed in Nairobi with another 4,000 in Mombasa. Countrywide, more than 20,000 joints are shut, according to the Pubs Entertainment and Restaurant Association of Kenya (Perak). This puts more than 300,000 direct jobs on the edge with at least two million dependents affected. Edited by R.Wamochie
