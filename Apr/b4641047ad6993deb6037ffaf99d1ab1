Efforts by Kilifi deputy governor Gideon Saburi to be released on police bond have proven futile. The DG was arrested on Friday, hours after he was discharged from the Coast General Hospital Isolation Centre. He is currently being held at the Port Police Station after he recovered from the coronavirus. A contingent of about 20 DCI officers in at least four cars was at hand to arrest the DG on Friday. Saburi had kept the detectives waiting at the hospital for about five hours. On Sunday, his lawyer Otiende Omollo revealed his frustration as he tried to secure Saburi's release on a police bond. "There is no progress. He is still in," said Omolo. He said he could not understand why his client is being denied police bond. "We have been denied police bond without explanation," said a frustrated Omolo. Saburi is likely to be charged in court on Monday for refusing to self-quarantine upon arrival from an official trip to Germany on March 6. Health CS Mutahi Kagwe said the government would use Saburi as an example for those who refuse to adhere to the anti-coronavirus measures issued by the government to try and check the spread of COVID-19. Kenya has recorded 126 cases, four deaths and four recoveries. On Saturday, leaders from Rabai defended Saburi saying he has already suffered enough punishment. Philip Mbaji, a vocal opinion leader in Rabai, said the DG has suffered enough psychological torture and trauma. "He is human. He made a mistake and was remorseful. We should forgive him," said Mbaji. He said talk of impeaching the DG should be shelved for the moment. "Let everyone finish their terms and then in 2022 everyone will get a chance to vie for whatever seat they want," Mbaji said. Saburi is facing a fine of up to Sh30,000 or a jail term of not more than three years.
