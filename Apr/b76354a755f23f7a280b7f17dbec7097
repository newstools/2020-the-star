The number of people who died in road accidents last year increased by 13.6 per cent to 3,586, latest statistics shows. The Economic Survey 2020, which was released on Tuesday, shows that the number of reported traffic accidents also increased by 39.3 per cent from 5,158 in 2018 to 7,184 in 2019. “The number of reported casualties increased by 22.3 per cent to 15,747 in 2019,” the survey shows. It shows that the number of people that were seriously injured in the accidents increased by 48.5 per cent to 6,952. In 2015, reported road traffic accidents were 5,310, while in 2016 had 5,296. In 2017, there were 4,452 reported accidents compared to 5,158 in 2018 and 7,184 last year. Those killed in 2015 were 3,057 and 2016 had 2,965. In 2017, some 2,919 victims died as a result of a road crash. A total of 3,158 passed on in 2018 and 3,586 last year. The survey shows that 4,731 victims were seriously injured in 2015 as compared to 4,661 victims in 2016. In 2017, 3,943 victims were seriously injured as compared to 4,681 in 2018 and 6,952 last year. Further, the survey shows that 4,350 victims were slightly injured in 2015 as compared to 5,533 in 2016. In 2017, some 4,353 victims were slightly injured compared to 5,038 in 2018 and 5,209 last year. “The reasons given for the increase in accidents were losing control of vehicles, improper overtaking, speeding and crossing the road without due care at the junctions,” the survey says. The number of vehicles and motorcycles being registered and those responsible for road accidents is increasing on Kenyan roads. According to the survey, the number of newly registered motor vehicles increased by 7.6 per cent from 102,036 units in 2018 to 109,751 units in 2019. The number of station wagons registered also increased by 13.0 per cent to 72,512 units. The number of new minibuses registered more than doubled from 812 units in 2018 to 1,932 units in 2019. This may be attributed to improved performance of public transport coupled with increased acquisition of buses by learning institutions. The survey shows that the number of newly registered motorcycles increased by 11.4 per cent to 217,425 units in 2019. This was mainly driven by an 11.2 per cent increase in the number of newly registered motor and autocycles that rose from 188,994 units in 2018 to 210,103 units in 2019. Newly registered three-wheelers increased by 17.0 per cent from 6,259 units in 2018 to 7,322 units in 2019. However, the number of newly registered saloon cars decreased by 5.1 per cent to 9,971 units while that of panel vans and pick-ups dropped by 9.2 per cent to 10,189 units in 2019. Similarly, the newly registered wheeled tractors shrunk by 55.1 per cent from 4,040 units in 2018 to 1,815 units in 2019 while trailers dropped from 2,083 units to 1,639 units during the same period. The decline in newly registered wheeled tractors may be attributed to the continuation of major construction projects that had started earlier while the reduction in trailers registered was largely associated with the use of SGR as an alternative mode of transport. The number of PSV licences issued rose by 10.3 per cent from 57,949 in 2018 to 63,938 in 2019. This was mainly due to increased licences issued to PSV taxis using mobile apps and registered PSV Saccos and companies in 2019. The number of PSV licences issued to matatus increased by 28.2 per cent to 47,183 in 2019. However, licenses issued to buses decreased by 32.4 per cent to 8,969 over the same period. PSV licenses issued to minibuses also decreased from 7,861 in 2018 to 7,786 in 2019. The number of individual driving licences issued dropped by 14.6 per cent from 164,349 in 2018 to 140,279. This may be partly attributed to a lag in the replacement of old driving licences in compliance with the requirements for smart driving licenses. During the review period, NTSA introduced smart driving licences to replace the old type of driving licences referred to as red books. Edited by R.Wamochie
