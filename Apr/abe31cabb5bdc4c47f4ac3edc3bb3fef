The government on Friday banned uncoordinated direct distribution of food and non-food donations following the chaos witnessed in Kibra. Kibra residents scrambled for the food - which was donated by ODM leader Raila Odinga among other well-wishers - and in the process broke social distancing rules. But barely a day after the directive, Nairobi governor Mike Sonko was seen distributing food and non food products to residents. "Earlier today(Saturday), our team donated foodstuffs, masks and sanitisers to our neighbours in Mua Hills shopping centre," he tweeted. Residents were seen queuing wearing masks while others were seen carrying the goodies to their various homes. According to the pictures seen, Sonko had bags of food stuffs that saw many people queue to get the products. However, they adhered to the social distancing rule and wore masks as per the government's directive. These are some measures put in place to stop the spread of coronavirus in the country. In Kibra, Raila donated Sh15 million worth of food to help Kibra communities as livelihoods continue to be negatively affected by the coronavirus pandemic. The residents crowded outside the commissionerâ€™s office to receive the food. Two people are said to have lost their lives. Kenya is one of the African countries that have reported cases of Covid-19. It has recorded 191 cases and seven deaths. Twenty four patients have successfully recovered. Africa has reported close to 11,000 coronavirus cases, with over 500 deaths. Over 1,000 people have recovered.
