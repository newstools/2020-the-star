Health officials in Wajir county have started fumigating streets and buildings to control the spread of coronavirus. They used fire trucks to carry out the exercise. Health executive Ismail Sheikh said efforts and resources should be redirected urgently to the fight against the pandemic. "We need to focus on prevention as opposed to treatment because the latter is expensive. This pandemic affects all of us, so we seek cooperation from the public,” he said. Sheikh added that the county will set up handwashing facilities in all subcounties and distribute masks to the public. “As much as we have put in place the necessary resources and response teams, the public should know that the virus is highly contagious, therefore, it is our responsibility to adhere to the set measures so as to prevent its spread,” he said. On Tuesday, neighbouring Mandera confirmed its first two coronavirus cases—passengers who travelled from Mombasa by bus. Sheikh said the county has stepped up measures to control the virus, including screening all passengers who are entering and leaving the county. On Wednesday, a team led by deputy county commissioner Omar Benja and county secretary Abdullahi Maalim visited Wajir Girls' Secondary School to inspect the quarantine facility and readiness of medical personnel. “We urge the public to follow the recommended guidelines which include staying at home, putting on masks in public places and washing hands frequently with soap or using sanitiser,” Maalim said. “I thank the national government and partners such as Unicef, Kenya Red Cross, Save The Children and Kijabe Hospital for their collaboration and support in our efforts to prevent the spread of coronavirus in our county.” Edited by Frank Obonyo
