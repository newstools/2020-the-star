NCBA has committed Sh100 million to help the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic in the country. KCB and Ecobank donated Sh150 million and Sh10 million respectively on Wednesday. NCBA Group Managing Director John Gachora on Thursday said the bank's contribution will go towards humanitarian support for the vulnerable members of the Kenyan society. This follows the government's appeal to individuals, corporate entities and institutions to support the country fight the pandemic. “As a bank, we acknowledge that we have a central role to play in supporting individuals, businesses and the economy during this crisis and facilitating rapid and sustained recovery. Our contribution is aimed at protecting and safeguarding people’s lives in our community,” he said. "The Bank is also working closely with small and micro enterprises, especially its customers, who are involved in the production and distribution of critical inputs in containing the spread of Covid-19. These critical inputs include masks and food which will be distributed for in partnership with the Emergency Response Fund". In a statement on Wednesday, KCB group CEO Joshua Oigar said the bank's contribution is directed towards cushioning vulnerable Kenyans who have been affected by the pandemic. “We stand with the nation to help limit the spread of the virus and ease the related economic hardships faced by the communities in which we operate,”   Oigara said.
