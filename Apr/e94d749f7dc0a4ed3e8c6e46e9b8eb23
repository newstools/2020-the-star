Kilifi deputy governor Gideon Saburi has been arrested. Saburi was handcuffed and taken to the Port Police Station on Friday afternoon. He was picked by a contingent of about 20 detectives in five cars. Detectives had camped at the Coast General Hospital since morning to arrest Saburi. Saburi had been discharged after recovering from Covid-19 and had beenÂ holed up at the isolation centre at the CGH. Police told the Star they arrived at the hospital as early as 8.30 am. "He says he has sent for another pair of clothes but we think it is a delaying tactic," said a detective, who sought anonymity. Saburi, dressed in a cream casual trouser, a white T-Shirt, a Godfather hat and green and brown loafers, appeared calm. There was excitement at the hospital as cameras flashed at the sight of a diminutive man, who is said to have put many Kenyans life at great risk. Saburi is said to have held meetings with the Kilifi county cabinet, attended about three funerals in Rabai and other parts of Kilifi, partied at night before he was called out. An MP who came into contact with him is in isolation after testing positive for COVID-19. Saburi was taken to record a statement at the Port Police Station ahead of his arraignment likely to be on Monday. Police would however not say what they would charge him with. Sources told the Star his lawyer and family members found their way to where he was holed up and had a very long chat with him. Health CS Mutahi Kagwe on Thursday announced that Saburi had recovered from the virus and will be arrested and charged for refusing to self-quarantine upon return from an official trip on Germany on March 7.
