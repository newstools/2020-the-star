Kenya Golf Union have called on all clubs to suspend all formal competition following a directive by the Ministry of Health as the fight against the spread of coronavirus pandemic intensifies. The union suspended all handicaps in the country for a period of 30 days and directed that golfers must not be allowed to access the clubhouse for any services whatsoever. However, golfers can still play as long as they do not use the services of caddies and strictly maintaining social distancing. In a communique signed by KGU chairman Anthony Murage, the Union added: “Clubs must ensure that there is strictly no congregation on the premises. This must be strictly enforced by clubs.” “Clubs should only be open to their members and should not allow guests or reciprocation.” Murage also appealed to the clubs to set up a welfare kitty in support of caddies who will be affected by the directive. The union clarified that clubs risk closure after non-compliance of many golfers who have continued to congregate within the club premises in direct contravention of the current directives given to help stop the spread of Covid-19.
