 A regional Covid-19 command centre will be set up in Nakuru next week, Rift Valley Regional Commissioner George Natembeya has said. “The centre will incorporate all the departments offering essential services in the region,” Natembeya said on Friday. The facility will be located in the administrator’s offices. It will give real time updates on Covid-19 in Rift Valley. Natembeya spoke soon after Health CS Mutahi Kagwe announced that the number of those who had tested positive of coronavirus had risen to 110 by Thursday evening. Rift Valley will be the first region to establish such a centre after the national  government on Thursday established Operation Kinga Corona, a National Multi-Agency Command Centre in Embakasi. The Operation Kinga Corona is headed by Major General Ayub Matiiri. It is intended to contain and manage the effects of coronavirus. It will also restore normalcy in the country after Covid-19 epidemic. Matiiri said the team has representatives from government ministries, departments and agencies as well as crucial humanitarian service providers. “Established through a recommendation by the National Security Advisory Committee (NSAC) on March 25, 2020, the National Multi Agency Command Centre has been mandated on the basis of priorities established by the government to immediately develop strategic preparedness and response involving all key players in the government,” he said. The team is also tasked with coordinating the delivery of strategic, technical and operational support through existing mechanisms and partnerships across the country. “Recognising the respective roles and responsibilities of the various ministries and departments of the government, the team will work closely with all stakeholders in mobilising resources to support and monitor the implementation of activities meant to tackle the current coronavirus outbreak," Matiiri said.  - mwaniki fm
