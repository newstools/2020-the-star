 A Kiambu chief has denied claims of hiding a relative who recently returned from the US, saying the man was in mandatory quarantine. Kambaa chief Antony Kuria said they agreed as a family to have the relative put in isolation. He accepted to be quarantined. He said the relative arrived in the country on March 21, and was subjected to screening at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport where he showed no signs of the coronavirus. "Even before he arrived home, villagers had started speaking that we were planning to hide one of us who was expected from the US," Kuria said. He was speaking to the Star in his office on Saturday. He said the man arrived home in Kambaa in Lari subcounty where he was put in isolation. "We prepared a separate house, toilet and food was preserved in a fridge and a gas cooker placed inside that house in readiness for his requests for self-quarantine" Kuria said. He said no family members went to the airport to receive their relative. "When he arrived at home using a taxi, he found me at home and no one greeted him with hands. I told him he must undergo the 21-day of self-quarantine and not 14." He said the man was given conditions including the threat to call the police if he disregarded any quarantine requirements. He said the man has been checked on several occasions by doctors from Lari Level 4 Hospital. He has not shown any signs of coronavirus yet. The chief said the location has received five people from abroad. Two jetted in from the US and the rest from Dubai, India and Germany respectively. Deputy county commissioner Aaron Koros lauded locals for remaining vigilant, saying they keep saying openly what they notice.  Edited by peter obuya
