Maasai clans fighting over a boundary in Transmara West have two days to surrender illegal firearms if the 4pm curfew is to be lifted. Narok county commissioner Samuel Kimiti said that the 4pm-7am curfew will remain until residents hand over the guns used in recent skirmishes. “It is possible to lift the curfew but you must surrender the guns as a sign that you have agreed to maintain peace,” Kimiti said. He spoke after meeting elders from Siria and Uasingishu clans in Kilgoris town, Transmara on Wednesday. Narok Governor Samuel Tunai had convened the meeting also attended by  MP Gideon Konchellah, deputy county commissioner Mohammed Noor and 10 elders from each clan. The state extended the nationwide dawn-to-dusk curfew by four hours in the area to contain inter-clan conflict at the Nkararo-Enoretet border. A curfew to limit the spread of the coronavirus begins at 7pm and ends at 5am. “The government is processing the land title deeds for the area as part of measures to end the violence,” Kimiti said. Tunai said a lasting solution must be found to stop the loss of lives and properties. “This action is unacceptable and people should consider peace as the only solution to their problems, not fighting,” Tunai said. He said that elders will be used to preach peace among their people and stop the feuds. “This will make the work easy for the government in solving the contested issues.” The governor said the county and national governments will monitor the situation to avoid the recurrence of violence. “We want the two clans to accept that it is wrong to kill each other and destroy properties,” he said. Konchellah said the elders will play a key role in peace efforts by advising the youths on the importance of maintaining calm. “The state will sort out this issue in the next two weeks. The people should work in harmony and avoid clashes that will subject them to untold suffering,” Konchellah said. (edited by o. owino)
