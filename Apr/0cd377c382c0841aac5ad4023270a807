With all sporting activities in the country suspended, tennis sensation Ryan Randiek has shifted his focus on final exams set at the end of the year. The youngster is among the lucky few candidates as programs in his school, which offers the American system of education, had not been disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic. While students in the Kenyan system are crossing their fingers to have schools re-opened after the one month period added by the government last weekend, Randiek's sole fear is that the centres accredited to administer their exams may delay in opening. He, however, exuded confidence that the pandemic would fade away soon and allow students from all schools to continue with their studies. "I am doing thorough revision and I hope normalcy will return soon and I will sit for my exams once the centres and all other schools are open. I am studying my units online as usual although I am in the process of transferring to another school to fully concentrate on my revision," said Randiek, who is in his final year. Besides concentrating on studies, the rookie has not dropped the racket as he trains by himself from home. "I have been balancing between studies and tennis and I want to excel in the two events," he added. "I train in the house daily just to keep fit. I run around the compound as much as I can and I am hoping to return to the court and pursue my dreams as far as playing tennis is concerned," he said.
