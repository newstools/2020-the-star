Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua has urged the government to bring back Kenyans who are mistreated in China. Mutua on Sunday said the Kenyans can be examined and treated here in Kenya just like those who have been quarantined, but only if they are brought back. "It is shocking to see Africans, on the basis of their skin coloUr, being mistreated in China. We have not witnessed any Europeans or other non-black people being mistreated. This is purely racism," Mutua said. He criticised the government for tolerating the alleged discrimination and urged it to act accordingly. Mutua addressed the press in Mavoko. "It is ironic for the Chinese to claim Africans are bringing to them Covid-19 whereas the disease came from China," he said. He said the government should not fear taking action just because the country owes China. "Even though we are indebted to China and they are our friends, they do benefit a lot from us too. We must call out their racism and tell them we will not tolerate such behaviour," he said. "We haven't seen Citizens from other races being discriminated like Arabs, Asians or Italians who are affected the most. This is nothing but racism and we should address it as it is." He said this action defines the true friends of Kenya from their enemies. "How do you lock out people to sleep in the cold and it's winter just because they are black? This is an excuse for them to express their racism," Mutua said. "The government should stop sending polite statement and letters to China. We must be on force here. I was expecting the President to be in line with the Chinese President to inquire about the alleged mistreated and put the right measures to end the situation." This comes a few hours after the national chairman of Churches in Kenya Archbishop Timothy Ndambuki urged the government to take seriously the cry of Kenyans who are allegedly suffering in China after allegedly being evicted from their homes.
