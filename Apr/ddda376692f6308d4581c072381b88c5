A police constable who shot dead a man in Mathare on April 13 is set to be charged with murder. This is after the Directorate of Criminal Investigations concluded the probe into the murder of Reuben Karani Kirinya, 26. It was reported that Beckham Osoro based at Muthaiga police station, Joseph Mwendwa of Kamukunji station and Harrison Mwanza were chewing miraa at a kiosk in Mathare Area 4 in Nairobi county when the incident occurred. Around 3am, Kirinya was shot in the chest and later succumbed. In an affidavit before a Makadara court, Corporal Robert Mburu of Starehe DCI said that hours after the incident, Osoro surrendered and was booked in a cell. He then handed over the Ceska pistol he had used to shoot Kirinya. Osoro is said to have been on night patrol when he shot the man and took off. Mburu said that after investigations, he found no evidence to charge Mwendwa and Mwanza. The two will instead be the state prosecution witnesses against Osoro. DCI officers recovered a spent cartridge and a bullet head from the scene of the crime. “We have forwarded investigations file to the office of Director of Public Prosecutions after recommending murder charges against Osoro,” he said. Mburu asked Makadara senior principal magistrate Angelo Kithinji to allow him to hold Osoro for seven days awaiting the directions from the ODPP. Osoro will remain in custody at the Pangani police station. Edited by R.Wamochie
