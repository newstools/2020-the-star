The Star visited Shona EPZ on Tuesday, April 14, 2020. The EPZ is one of the three factories in the countries producing Personal Protective Equipment and face masks. The Protective Personal Equipment (PPE) once ready will be distributed in counties to be used by health workers to prevent them for transmission of coronavirus. The masks will be distributed freely to selected vulnerable communities across Kenya. Here is a glimpse at the factory and the activities carried out at the EPZ.
