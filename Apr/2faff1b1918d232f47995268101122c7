Kongowea Health Centre has been closed after traders from nearby Kongowea Market invaded the facility. This has made it difficult for health workers to provide services to residents of Mkomani, Umoja, Kitaruni, Kongowea, Kambi Kikuyu, among others. At least 100 patients are treated at the facility every day. The traders were pushed out of the market by the county government over Covid-19 concerns, and relocated to satellite open air markets in Tononoka and Likoni on March 20. Most complained that the decision denied them business. On Monday, defiant traders forced their way into Kongowea to deliver fresh farm produce, with some displaying their wares near Kongowea Health Centre, blocking the entrance as they displayed and sold tomatoes, maize, oranges and vegetables. Earlier, traders had clashed with Mombasa county inspectorate officers and caused a commotion at Buxton Junction after some trucks carrying fresh produce were blocked. A health worker told the Star it has become difficult to offer services because traders had invaded the hospital up to the entrance. The community youth volunteer said the issue has brought a crisis at the health facility since there is no social distancing in the area. Hundreds of patients cannot access services. And with the current directive limiting outpatient cases at major hospitals like the Coast General Hospital, residents are left with Ziwa la Ngombe, Maweni and Mlaleo clinics, which are quite a distance away. “I have had to take a motorcycle from Kongowea to Maweni to have my daughter treated. She has been unwell for two weeks, and we have been taking her for check-ups in Kongowea. Now that cannot happen,” Mary Katana said. County health communications director Richard Chacha promised to get back to the Star after establishing the situation on the ground. Edited by A.N
