A man was on Monday charged with injuring his six-year-old son with a crowbar aimed at his father. Ezekiel Kariuki Ng'ang'a denied injuring the boy on the chin on April 7Â  Kiwanja shopping centre, Kasarani. The prosecution told a Makadara court that Kariuki had threatened to kill his father, James Ng'ang'a, for denying him money. He is said to have been charging at his 65-year-old father with the weapon he had removed from the bedroom when his wife, Agnes Waitherero, grabbed it before it landed on the old man's head. Unfortunately, it landed on their son's chin. The father was escaping towards a nearby police post from where he was later told of the child's injuries by the daughter-in-law. Waitherero was also injured on the left shoulder. Three days before the incident, Kariuki had allegedly demanded money from his father with menaces. Prosecutor Jacqueline Omol asked senior principal magistrate Angelo Kithinji to deny him bond. She said the lives of the witnesses - father, wife and son - might be endangered since they share a house with the accused. "Your honour, the accused also faces a similar case in a Kiambu court. He is charged with attempting to kill his neighbour. We ask the court to deny him bond," Omol said. Kithinji said the bond application will be considered after the minor's testimony. - mwaniki fm
