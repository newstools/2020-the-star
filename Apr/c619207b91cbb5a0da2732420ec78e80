The number of prisoners who have tested positive for coronavirus in a correctional facility in South Africa has increased by 49 in two days. The Department of Correctional Services (DCS) said the number of infected prisoners at the East London Correctional Centre now stands at 53. Some 23 prison officials are also infected at the facility, according to DCS spokesperson Singabakho Nxumalo. The first case was reported on 6 April after an official who had attended a burial tested positive. Another official tested positive two days later and mass testing started at the facility. The department's spokesperson said the correctional centre was being disinfected and health care workers were monitoring and managing those who had tested positive. Mr Nxumalo said a list of hospitals where the prisoners could be admitted if need be had been prepared and transport was on standby.
