@itsetyang Pastoralists in Turkana North have urged the county and national governments to sensitise them on coronavirus control for their safety. They say that they have little knowledge about the coronavirus and have not been informed by the health workers in the county. The Star established that health workers assigned to sensitise the community did not cover parts of Turkana North including Todonyang, Lowarengak, Nachukui and Katiko. Peter Edukon, a pastoralist from Todonyang said they have no information about the coronavirus. “We are also Kenyans and it’s our right to have the information about the coronavirus.  I heard my child talking of coronavirus and when I inquired he said I should wash my hands and at home for my safety,” he said. Shadrack Ekitela said that county health workers from the Ministry of Health did not reach their region. “Turkana is the second-largest county and county government should put proper plans for health workers to reach all residents for the information on the virus,” he said. Esther Lochodo, a resident of Nachukui, said that all residents deserve to get information about the virus. Nachukui said that health workers should reach residents in all regions to sensitise them to wash their hands, about social distance and avoid crowding. (edited by o. owino)
