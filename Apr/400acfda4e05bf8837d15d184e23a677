The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission has directed the Mombasa assembly to forward the list of nominees to the County Public Service Board for integrity verification. This comes after Governor Hassan Joho submitted the six names MCAs for vetting. The nominees are Farida Abdallah (proposed chairperson), Liban Hassan, Ruthyana Ngundo, Abdalkadir Ali, Zohari Khamisi and George Obiria. In a letter dated March 20 to the county assembly clerk,Â  the EACC notes that the names were not submitted to the commission. The list was handed over to the assembly through Majority leader Hamisi Musa on December 19, 2019, when the MCAs were on recess. "The letter containing the names of the nominated members was written by the governor on December 16 and brought to my office on December 19. I couldn't act on it because the MCAs were on recess," Hamisi during an interview. The nominees were supposed to be vetted in February. Hamisi wants the matter treated as urgent as the last board chaired by secretary Jayzan Farouk exited mid-last year. "This vetting should be done as soon as possible because everything is at a standstill. The board secretary cannot work without members and the governor cannot employ because the office does not have members," he said.
