National Nurses Association president Alfred Obengo has told off SRC over claims that counties should seek permission before awarding health workers special allowances. This was after Machakos governor Alfred Mutua promised to give its workers a special allowance of up to Sh20,000. This was to help them during this coronavirus pandemic. In a notice on April 9, SRC Chairperson Lyn Mengich said the due process was not followed adding that such an award is 'unlawful and causes inequality' in remuneration across the country. "The government is raising funds to facilitate the fight against coronavirus..in light of scarce resources, it is prudent to use the available resources by providing personal protection equipment," she said. But Obengo in a statement asked Mengich to stop irritating workers during this tough times. "While we appreciate it's statutory obligation, the timing and the language of the circular from SRC is uncalled for. The Commission Chairperson may be working normally probably from her comfort zone at home," he said. He said that health workers are working abnormal hours in an abnormal situation, combating an abnormal disease. "...and given the projections from the government, we entering a critical stage in the war against COVID-19. Am rather convinced that we may not be living in the same country with the Chairperson of SRC," he said. "Your letter is not just provocative, but extremely insensitive, to say the least." Obengo said Health workers were restraining themselves from being on a warpath with the government. ".... this is the wrong time to address the health workers with contempt .We also demand demonstration of same solidarity from different arms of the government to health workers," he said. "I repeat, it's the wrong time to provoke health workers. "
