Police in Umoja, Nairobi, have recovered the mobile phone of a university student who was killed at a hospital while buying medicine for his sick mother on Wednesday. Rodgers Opiyo was buying medicine at the chemist in Phadam Hospital in Umoja 2 when a gang of two came in disguised as customers. “They started pretending they were also buying medicine. In the process, the man identified one of them and called out his name. He removed a pistol and shot him dead,” Buruburu subcounty police commander Adamson Bungei told the Star on phone. He said the thugs were on a stealing mission but noticing the victim knew them, they killed him. The incident happened on Wednesday at 8.30pm. On Thursday, Bungei said the mobile phone of the deceased was traced to Dandora area. “They escaped very fast because within a few minutes they were in Dandora where we are concentrating our investigations,” he said. The two thugs escaped using a motorcycle waiting outside the hospital after shooting Opiyo on the throat. His body was taken to Mama Lucy Hospital mortuary. A police report seen by the Star indicates the victim was a fourth-year student at Meru University. Police on patrol police who had just passed the area heard a gunshot and returned to check and found the man lying on the ground. With many businesses closed, criminals are turning on essential services which, remain open throughout the night. “They are now targeting clinics because the businesses remain open during curfew,” Bungei said.
