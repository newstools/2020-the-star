President Uhuru Kenyatta has ruled out the postponement of national examinations. Speaking on Wednesday during a live radio interview from State House Nairobi, the President said the Ministry of Education is looking into measures that will be put in conducting the exams amid the coronavirus pandemic. "We need to know when it will be done and how it will be done. When that time comes we will elaborate on details how we will make sure all this is taken care of," he said. The President said the government will release a schedule on how learners will return to schools especially those who are to sit the national exams. "Our responsibility right now is to make sure that our children especially those who are supposed to sit for their exams will do it in a certain way," Uhuru said. He said that they are looking into ways to help children catch up with the time lost while at home during the Covid-19 period. The President thanked radio stations for stepping in during this time and airing different learning sessions. "We thank different radio stations that have accepted to help us as the government by airing those lessons which are helping our children who are at home to continue with their studies," he said. Last month, Education CS George Magoha announced that learners will be taught extensively through lessons delivered digitally and via broadcast. The announcement followed confirmation of the first Covid-19 case in Kenya, which led Magoha to announce the closure of schools countrywide. The CS said the ministry has partnered with the national broadcaster KBC to provide radio programmes on weekdays through Radio Taifa and the English Service.
