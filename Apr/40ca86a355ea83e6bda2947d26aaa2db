Lillian Muli says her greatest regret was cohabiting with a baby daddy. According to her, she decided to because of her child. The Citizen TV anchor was responding to fan comments on her Instagram stories, where she had asked them to share their regrets in life. When one of the fans said she regretted cohabiting with her baby daddy, Muli was quick to respond to her, saying she had also gone through the same. “This one is very complicated because a child is involved. I have done it, too, and it is not easy,” she said. Lillian also admitted to having wasted six years loving the wrong person. “Lol. You and me both, honey! Mine, six wasted years. You will love again,” she said. This was after a fan said they had wasted two years loving the wrong person. Lillian has been in two well-known relationships in the past. The first was with her ex-husband Moses Kanene. Their seven-year marriage yielded a child, Joshua. Her next much-publicised relationship was with Shabana boss Jared Nevaton. The two were blessed with a baby boy called Liam. They have not announced whether they have ever solemnised their union. She promised her fans that after this corona pandemic, she will come out a new person as she is no longer going to have time for “inauthentic and non-value adding relationships”. “When the Rona is over, I am 100 per cent sure I will be a different Lillian, and I'm not mad about that,” she said.
