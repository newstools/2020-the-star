Tens of motorists escaped death narrowly after a driver lost control of lorry and rammed into six other vehicles near Mai Mahiu centre in Naivasha. During the midday accident, six people were injured, two of them seriously, while the vehicles were extensively damaged. The lorry was heading downhill from Nairobi but developed a mechanical problem. Some of the other vehicles were parked on the roadside. Witness Joseph Kimotho said the accident caught other motorists by surprise adding that all they could do was watch. “The trailer was at high speed and it ended up ramming into several cars, including two lorries that were ferrying sand before crushing by the roadside,” he said. Naivasha OCPD Samuel Waweru said the injured were treated at Mai Mahiu health centre and discharged. Meanwhile, members of the pastoralist community living in Olkaria area of Naivasha are counting losses after wild animals raided homesteads killing more than 30 sheep and goats. Following the incident in Lapland village, residents were left in fear of more attacks. They accused KWS officers of failing to contain the wild animals. It’s suspected that the animals strayed from the nearby Hellsgate National Park. One victim, Santai Nairenyi, said he lost 20 goats, while 12 others were injured. He said they woke up to find carcasses littered in the compound, with some body parts missing. “We suspect that a leopard or hyena could have attacked the animals and we have since reported the matter to the KWS,” he said. A senior KWS officer said the human-wildlife conflict has been on the rise because the park is not fenced. Two months ago, lions that had strayed from Soysambu farm in Gilgil killed several cattle and sheep before KWS officers managed to corner them.
