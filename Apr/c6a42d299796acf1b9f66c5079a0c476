Blazers coach Jos Openda believes that this year is as good as gone if the current coronavirus pandemic crisis is anything to go by. The highly successful hockey tactician said that not much in terms of the competition is expected this year and clubs must start planning for next season. “Due to the pandemic, I do not see much happenings this year. I just pray that things will come back to normal, but it seems unlikely that it will happen this year,” he observed. He said the self-supporting teams will have a lot of difficulties financially as many organisations will not have money to dish out. “The self-supporting teams will have a lot of challenges and will be hit hard,” he said, adding: “It will be a tall order asking for financial aid from corporate entities and individuals.” But despite all that is happening globally, Openda believes 2021 will be a much productive year. Blazers, he promises, will continue to dominate the local hockey scene considering that the team recruited some promising young talents. “We have new good players and we hope they will blend well with the older ones and continue dominating the women’s hockey scene,“ he said. Blazers had played their first league tie of the new season beating United States International University (USIU) 1-0 before the games were called off. Openda, whose team has dominated the sport locally and continentally, said the challenge now is how to keep the players busy.
