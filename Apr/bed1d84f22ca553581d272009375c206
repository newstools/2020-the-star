The Machakos government has threatened to close all entry points on its borders to stop the spread of the coronavirus. "A time will come when we will need to close all the roads to and from our county since we donâ€™t have many cases," Governor Alfred Mutua said on Monday. He spoke during the launch of mass screening and an isolation centre at Kenyatta Stadium. Truck drivers transporting goods from Mombasa to Uganda and other countries will be tested and screened at all entry points and those who test positive will be returned to their respective counties for quarantine. There will be no stopping in Machakos county since we cannot ban them from transporting food and other goods to those countries, but there will have to be more than two drivers to make sure they don't sleep in Machakos county. The county chief said they have put in place measures to curb the spread of the virus. The county will soon start door-to-door screening depending on the rate and the level of infections, he said. Mutua said the laboratory at Machakos Level 5 Referral Hospital was assessed by medical officers from the Kenya Medical Research Institute and will soon be used to test Covid-19. The county has trained 2,524 community health volunteers and 1,600 health workers on how to deal with the coronavirus pandemic. Mutua said he would ensure that all isolation centres and quarantine units have the necessary amenities, equipment and provisions to ensure patients and those suspected of having contracted the disease are not held under harsh conditions. The isolation facility has 60 beds, but the county government aims at increasing the number to 400 before the end of this month. The county has 10 ventilators and is expecting 10 more this week.
