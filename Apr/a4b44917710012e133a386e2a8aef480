Nadia Mukami has dismissed claims she terminated a pregnancy while dating fellow artiste Arrow Boy. The singer says she has never even been pregnant. "Ati ulitoa mimba ya Arrow Bwoy?" a fan asked during a Q/A segment. To which Nadia responded, "Lmao lol sijawahi beba mimba. Children are a blessing and I canâ€™t wait for that experience in a few years. Probably with J Cole (an American rapper)." Adding, "Children are a blessing but I am focusing on myself and my career as there is so much in store." Asked whether she is dating Arrow Bwoy at the moment, Nadia responded, "Nope." Nadia and Arrow Bwoy had been dating before they went their separate ways. A few months ago, Nadia wrote an open love letter to J Cole, saying she dreams he would be the father of her kids.
