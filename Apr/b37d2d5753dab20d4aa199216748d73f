The President did not and cannot be party to any fraudulent changes to our party, DP William Ruto has said. Ruto who was responding to one of the local dailies on Sunday said the decision to forward names to the National Management Committee was illegal and must be rejected. The ruling political outfit had forwarded five new names to the NMC following the exit of three others. The committee currently has 13 members appointed by the party leader, President Uhuru Kenyatta. But Ruto who had termed the move as 'illegal' said it was the work of conmen "This is the works of political rejects,conmen and fraudsters who's party allegiance is already elsewhere," he said via Twitter. "They should give us a break and leave JP alone." The Star has established that the move by Uhuru's allies to initiate changes to the leadership of the party's top organ has triggered an all-out war. The DP's terse protest letter on Friday, as the Jubilee Deputy Party leader, appeared to spoil the party for change proponents even as it exposed the deep-seated wars roiling the shaky outfit. The party has been rocked by deep factional wars pitting Tangatanga politicians supporting Ruto against Kieleweke team that is backing President Kenyatta and the handshake with opposition chief Raila Odinga. With the new battlefront, politicians and analysts opine that a political and legal battle for the heart and soul of Jubilee looms large weeks after the Building Bridges Initiative train was stopped by coronavirus outbreak.
