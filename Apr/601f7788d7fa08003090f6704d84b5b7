A life sentence imposed on a man for killing a secondary school student has been reduced to 25 years on appeal. Silas Obonyo Nunda aka Moses was convicted of murdering Mark* (not real name) with others not in court on December 28, 2011. Nunda was arrested on January 15, 2012, after the student's decomposed body was found near Lake Victoria days since he was reported missing. He denied the charge before the High Court in Homa Bay, which subsequently found him culpable and sentenced him to life imprisonment. Dissatisfied with the ruling, Nunda moved to the Appeal Court in Kisumu. Court of Appeal judge Patrick Kiage ruled on Tuesday: “The sentence meted on the appellant by the High Court is set aside. In its place we order that the appellant shall serve a sentence of 25 years in prison.” The particulars of the case were that the deceased was a student used to live with his uncle in Mbita. He occasionally operated a boda boda business to raise pocket money. On December 28, 2011, he borrowed a motorbike from Nicholas Owiti to pick a customer and friend at Mbita Secondary School. He was in a white shirt, truck trousers, a hooded jacket, school shoes and a pair of socks. That was the last time he was seen alive. Those clothes were used to identify him. His keys were found at Nunda's house during a search. According to the postmortem report, the student was strangled. His skeleton was covered in tattered clothes. In his defence, the accused claimed that his name is Silas Obonyo Nunda and not Moses and that an identity card found in his house and phone number M-Pesa registration details did not belong to him. “He claimed these documents were taken from his neighbour’s house and that he had nothing to do with the murder,” court papers read. The High Court found that it had been established that the student's belongings, which were identified by four witnesses, were found in Nunda's house.  Edited by R.Wamochie
