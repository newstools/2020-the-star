The government will soon deploy a mechanism that will enable surveillance teams to determine who should get tested based on prevailing symptoms. Health CAS Mercy Mwangangi on Wednesday said this system will be useful in areas with already confirmed cases of Covid-19 such as Kawangware, Rongai and Pipeline. The mechanism is known as seroprevalence studies within the environment which will enable exposed individuals to be selected to testing. "In terms of capacity, the country does have the capacity to run almost 37,000 tests a day. However, it will require ensuring that we have all those inputs and components that go into a successful run for a test," she said. According to Mwangangi, this system will enable the ministry of Heath to uphold containment measures in case of the inadequacy of testing supplies. The MoH will also make use of volunteers to heighten surveillance. " We have realised that we need to utilize our community health volunteers to ensure that they run what we call community-based surveillance and ensuring that they are utilising a tool that can pick up someone from a crowd based on prevailing symptoms of the virus. The CAS was speaking during the daily Covid-19 presser where she announced Â 10 new cases of Covid-19, raising the number to 384. She said another five people have been discharged, bringing the total recoveries to 129. A total of 508 samples were tested from 14 counties in the last 24 hours. Mwangangi has expressed disappointment at how individuals who have recovered from Covid-19 have been treated when trying to reintegrate into society.
