The county government of Machakos headed by Governor Alfred Mutua has converted Machakos Stadium into a Covid-19 isolation facility. It will now be used to isolate those who will be found positive and treat them for mild and non-critical conditions of the virus. According to Mutua, the stadium will also house temporary mass screening and treatment areas. "We have taken this step to free our Machakos Level 5 from being a treatment and isolation centre because hospitals are notorious for the spreading of bacteria and viruses to patients who are suffering from other conditions," he said in a statement on Monday. Mutua said the stadium is in a wide-open area, allowing for a good flow of air and conditions that promote distancing and quality of life. "Machakos Level 5 hospital sits only 200 meters from the stadium and during treatment, any medications required or health workers required can be dispatched to the stadium within minutes by foot," he added. In addition to the stadium, the county is also in the process of acquiring a 200-bed hospital which will be set aside for critical care of Covid-19, patients. 'We will announce the hospital when everything is ready and set-up. Our plan is to have 1,000 beds for Clovid-19 patients" Mutua said. "We have sensitized and trained 2,524 CHVs and 1,519 health workers, we have 228 persons in quarantine now e 1,056 previous persons have completed the quarantine," the governor said. "We have procured and continue to procure masks for health and communities, prevention materials. We have fumigated 40 markets and have a multisectoral sensitization system for the village level involving MPs, MCAs, national government administrators and community leaders." The county confirmed its first local transmission positive Covid-19 case on April 17 - from the Mlolongo shopping area in Mavoko. Photos courtesy of Machakos County Government.
