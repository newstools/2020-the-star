France is considering restarting Ligue 1 on June 3 or June 17, with the latter date more likely, according to sports daily L'Equipe, who cited a document from league organisers (LFP). Soccer in France was suspended indefinitely last month due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On Monday French President Emmanuel Macron extended the lockdown in the country to May 11. The L'Equipe report said that if the season resumed on June 17 teams would have to play every three days so the regular campaign could end by July 25, leaving time for relegation and promotion playoffs to be completed by Aug. 2. L'Equipe also said LFP members had voted on Friday to push back the start of next season by two weeks to Aug. 23, but that the decision would have to be confirmed by France's Football Federation (FFF). The French Cup final between Paris St Germain and St Etienne has been scheduled for June 27, according to the document, while the League Cup final between PSG and Olympique Lyonnais had been pencilled in for July 11.
