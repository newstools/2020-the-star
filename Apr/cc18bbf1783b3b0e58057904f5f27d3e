Apptivate Africa is using a mobile phone-based solution(M-Kula) to help employees eat healthy meals as well as reduce movement in a bid to combat COVID-19. In a statement, Apptivate Africa CEO Neil Ribeiro said, the key to combating this challenge is employers' willingness to prioritise the health of their employees by riding on available digital platforms. ''Our merchants provide healthy meals to help boost employees immunity which is the main defense against the virus in addition to other measures set by medical professionals and the government” Ribeiro said. M-Kula is a digital voucher that gives employers the opportunity to feed at their places of work in a transparent and efficient manner, reducing their chances of picking up the virus, especially where social distancing becomes difficult at vibandas. In addition to the measure put in place by employers,  firms that are still operating through this period should consider providing their employees with meals on-site to help build the employee’s immunity as well as minimize their interaction with outsiders, where they can potentially pick up the virus. His statement marries that of the associate dean for clinical affairs and chief of staff at The Aga Khan University Hospital, Majid Twahir, who stated that there is no cure for Coronavirus, the body produces immunity on its own and helps clear the virus from the system. On Monday, President Uhuru Kenyatta added new measures to combat the pandemic by declaring the cessation of movement in Nairobi, Kilifi, Kwale and Mombasa Counties for 21 days as the Nairobi directive was effective yesterday at 7 pm while that of the other counties will begin from Wednesday. On Monday, Kenya had 16 new confirmed coronavirus cases bringing the country's total number to 158 as well as six fatalities.
