Meru Governor Kiraitu Murungi has been urged to waive Sh50-Sh200 charged on receipts issued in dispensaries and level-4 hospitals. Residents also want levies paid by traders suspended to cushion the jobless and the vulnerable from the effects of the Covid-19. They told the Star they cannot afford the money due to the hard times occasioned by the virus. Nchooro residents, who held demos despite Covid-19-related risks of crowding, claimed health workers have abandoned them at their hour of need. They said the medics sometimes report to duty at 10am and leave at 2pm because there are no drugs and personal protective equipment. Atanasio Nkubitu said many do not have face masks and urged area MP John Mutunga and MCA David Kaithia to supply the protective gear. “I used to earn daily wages. I no longer do. How will I afford Sh50 daily to buy a mask?” he asked. Kiraitu’s communications office said the governor would start distributing PPE today at the county headquarters. In Kalingene, Kunati, Gacibine and Igarii, the cry was the same. Residents complained of untold suffering. They said no doctor wants to attend to patients because they lack personal protective equipment. Patients are asked to stay two metres from one another. Health executive Misheck Mutuma, MCA Gervasio King’ori and MP Gichunge Kabeabea were asked to equip health workers. Ruth Karimi said Kalingene dispensary has only one medic. "I went to Kunati Hospital and the doctors ran away. They told me they had no face masks, gloves and other PPE and can’t touch or come close to my sick child. I was told to wash my hands and leave. She demanded of Kiraitu: "Wake up. If this continues, many will die of diseases other than the coronavirus. Equip our health workers. People have suffered enough.”
