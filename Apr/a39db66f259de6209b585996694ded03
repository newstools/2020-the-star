 Medical tests of a quarry worker admitted to Naivasha sub-county hospital on suspicion that he had Covid-19 have turned negative, to the relief of the 34-year-old. The worker was picked from Namcha village Mai Mahiu coughing and with high fever and breathing complications and taken to an isolation ward. Kenya Medical Research Institute's laboratory in Nairobi said that repeated tests on the samples taken from him showed he did not have the contagious disease. A Naivasha hospital medic said the worker would be transferred to the normal ward. “The results from the national laboratories have come out and the results are negative of Covid-19. He will be taken to the general ward,” he said. Meanwhile, the Nakuru county government is training mortuary attendants in both public and private facilties on how to handle bodies of people who succumb to Covid-19. It has directed that bodies should be disposed of within hours of death to avoid the spread of the virus. Health CEC Kariuki Gichuki said morgue attendants were critical in stopping the Covid-19 pandemic. The county has equipped the attendants with protective gear. “Already some of the attendants have been trained on handling the bodies and we are keen to train all the workers,” Kariuki said. He at the same time said that the health authorities had started disposing of tens of unclaimed bodies in various mortuaries. The Naivasha mortuary has 16 unclaimed bodies, most of them brought by the  police. “There is a legal way of disposing of the bodies. We have to get a court order,” he said. There has been a public outcry after the body of a Kenya Ports Authority  worker was early this week hurriedly buried in a shallow in the middle of the night at his Siaya home. The family has since petitioned the High Court to order the exhumation of the body for postmortem examination to establish the cause of death and a proper burial. - mwaniki fm
