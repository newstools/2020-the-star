Detectives have concluded there is no evidence to hold anyone criminally liable for the deaths of 14 Kakamega Primary School pupils in February. In a file on the investigation forwarded to the Director of Public Prosecutions for direction, Western DCI boss Shem Nyamboki recommends a public inquest into the cause of the deaths. "Yes, the file is here and the Western region DPP coordinator Patrick Gumo is still perusing it and he will make a decision in two weeks. The file is big," Gumo's deputy Peter Kiprop said The 14 pupils in Standards 4 and 5 died on February 3 during an evening stampede that left the country in shock. Education CS George Magoha visited the school a day later and promised to release a report on the cause of the stampede but has not done so more than two months later. The CS returned to the school and declared that the government would not publish the findings of an inquiry into the stampede. Postmortems on the 14 bodies by Kakamega County Referral Hospital pathologist Dickson Muchana revealed that the children suffocated to death. Muchana said the deceased had problems of the lungs caused by the pile-up of pupils during the stampede. Theories about the cause of the fatal stampede have swirled around. Some point at ghosts while others at a teacher with a cane. Others attributed the incident a prank that turned awry. Detectives had earlier indicated that they would summon former Kakamega Senator Boni Khalwale to shed more light on devil worship at the school as he had claimed. During a requiem service for the children at Bukhungu stadium on February 7, Western leaders led by Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang'ula called for a public inquest into the death of the pupils. Wetang'ula said the event at the school was beyond the DCI and only an inquest would unravel the cause of the stampede. Edited by Henry Makori
