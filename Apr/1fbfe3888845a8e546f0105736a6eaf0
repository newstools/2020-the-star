On March 27, singer Davido announced that his fiancee, Chioma, had tested positive for coronavirus. The singer has now announced that Chioma is negative after being kept in isolation. He tweeted on Sunday, "Glory to God. Chioma has now tested negative twice for Covid-19. Thank you all for your prayers. We love you." Chioma had visited London together with their baby before she flew to Nigeria. The baby's results came back negative. Part of Davido's message on Instagram read, "Unfortunately, my fiancé’s results came back positive, while all 31 others tested have come back negative, including our baby. We are, however, doing perfectly fine and she is even still yet to show any symptoms whatsoever." "She is now being quarantined and I have also gone into full self-isolation for the minimum 14 days. I want to use this opportunity to thank you all for your endless love and prayers in advance and to urge everyone to please stay at home as we control the spread of this virus! Together we can beat this!"
