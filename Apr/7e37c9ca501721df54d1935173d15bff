Oil supplier Asharami Synergy Limited, Kenya has refuted claims that its 75 million liters of super petrol that docked into the country mid last month aboard MT Ocean Tiara was substandard. Reacting to a story published recently in a local paper, the oil importer said the quality of the imported oil was above board, having been sourced from the Saudi Arabian Oil Company, one of the world’s foremost oil and Gas Trading companies with an acclaimed reputation for quality and global standards. According to the firm, the report relied on documents and information provided by unnamed sources to arrive at a misleading conclusion regarding the specification of the gasoline. ''We note that the product is on-specification for all parameters right from the loading port where the test by Bureau Veritas recorded a Final Boiling Point (FBP) of 199 degrees Celsius,’’ Asharami Synergy said in a statement to media houses. It added that reputable surveyors in Kenya have also confirmed that the Cargo is on-specification for all parameters after tests by Intertek Group PLC, one of the world’s leading Total Quality Assurance Companies, returning FBP of 200 degrees Celsius and the Kenya Petroleum Refineries Limited (KPRL), returning FBP parameter of 199 degree Celsius. ‘’Asharami Synergy Limited Kenya operates within an impeccable track record of over 20 years of globally acclaimed best practice that has qualified Sahara Group as a member of the World Economic Forum Partnering Against Corruption Initiative (PACI),’’ the statement read in part. It went on to announce that it has supplied over 1.2 billion litres of petroleum products to Kenya over 23 months and is planning to announce a series of new projects to accelerate economic productivity in the country. ‘’We are delighted to support the critical sectors of Kenya’s economy that require access to energy sources for sustained growth and steadfast in our commitment to leading wherever possible in the development of Kenya’s economy,’’ Asharami Synergy Limited Kenya MD Debola Adesanya said.
