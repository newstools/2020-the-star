All hotels which are currently used as quarantine facilities have been warned against admitting new guests for fear of possible infection. Making the announcement on Tuesday, Health CS Mutahi Kagwe said that admitting new clients defy the purpose of the quarantine process. Hotels make up the majority of the 57 facilities where Kenyans can go for mandatory quarantine as the country continues to fight the spread of the virus. "Once a hotel has a positive case it must not admit any other person," the CS said. The CS cautioned hotels not to take advantage of people whose quarantine period has been extended. "If need be we will take control of how much they should charge. The government has already taken over the cost in its facilities," he said. Further, Kagwe announced that supermarkets are at risk of closure if shoppers will be found with no protective masks. "We have announced that you must have a mask when going anywhere including supermarkets, and you know the rules," he said. "If our health officers go to supermarkets where shoppers are not wearing masks, we have no choice but to close those supermarkets." Some of the hotels being used as quarantine facilities include; Hill Park hotel in Upperhill, Hilton Garden Inn, Safari Park, Pride Inn Hotels, Jacaranda Hotel, Trademark Hotel, Four points Sheraton, Boma Hotel among others. Kenyatta University, Kenya School of Government, Crown Plaza airport, Mombasa beach hotel, LaMada hotel are also being used as quarantine facilities.
