The ministry of health has lashed out at Baringo Governor Stanley Kiptis and other leaders for violatingÂ measures introduced by the government to curb further spread of the novel coronavirus. This is after Kiptis and other Baringo leaders flouted social distance rules on Saturday and gathered locals in Kabarnet to demand the immediate transfer of County Commissioner Henry Wafula. Led by Governor Kiptis they accused Wafula for ordering the arrest of Bartabwa MCA Reuben Chepsongol over hate speech claimed to have been made on Friday. Agitated residents who crowded outside the county assembly buildings did not heed to the calls by the public health and security officers to separate and observe Covid-19 social distance. However, on Sunday, Health CAS Mercy Mwangangi said, "We are witnessing another unbecoming phenomenon, where people are assuming that face masks alone can beat this virus. Yesterday, we witnessed a situation in Baringo where elected leaders led a mass demonstration in Kabarnet Town, thus endangering health of the locals." "What we saw in Baringo must be condemned in the strongest of terms. All gatherings, including political, religious etc remain banned." Other leaders who convened the meeting which lasted for an hour include Baringo North MP William Cheptumo, his Baringo South counterpart Charles Kamuren, Baringo County Assembly Speaker David Kiplagat and Deputy Governor Jacob Chepkwony and several MCAs.
