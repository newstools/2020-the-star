Sauti Sol's fifth album 'Midnight Train' will be released on June 5. Band member Polycarp says there is a lot of maturity in it. “We have come of age and we express how people should perceive us freely after 11 years as professional singers. Every song speaks to an issue that is relatable to everyone.” This is the group’s first major-label record with Universal Music Africa. Before the release of the whole album, the boy band has released yet another single, 'Brighter Days', a motivational and spiritually uplifting anthem featuring Grammy Award-winning Soweto Gospel Choir. The song reaffirms one should not be weary or in despair but focus on the promise of Brighter Days. Speaking about the album, Bien explained that 'Time flies' is inspired by Burna Boy’s journey. "A lot can happen in a year with dedication,” he said.
