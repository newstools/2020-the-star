Muslim and elected leaders in Mombasa are calling on the government to adjust curfew hours during the Holy month of Ramadhan. They want the curfew to be pushed to 10pm instead of 7pm. The curfew, they say, will mostly affect the less fortunate because they normally break the fast at 7pm. The leaders also want Muslims to be allowed to go to the mosques during Ramadhan, promising to follow all the preventative measures to curb the spread of coronavirus. Among the leaders present in the address were Mombasa Senator Mohamed Faki and Mvita MP Abdhulswamad Nassir among other Islamic leaders. Senator Faki urged the government to ensure donations also reach mosques. "We are urging the government to consider mosques so that believers who are fasting can get food," Faki said. Council of Imams and Preachers of Kenya Secretary General Mohamed Khalifa also called for a reduction of electricity prices. "We want Kenya Power to reduce its bills by 50 per cent," Khalifa said.
