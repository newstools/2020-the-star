The Lamu government has started the mass production of face masks. The masks will be free. The county government has partnered with all technical institutions in the region to achieve the 100,000 masks target in the first phase of the exercise. The production is going on at the Lamu, Mpeketoni and Kizingitini Technical Training and Vocational centres. Lamu Health executive Anne Gathoni said on Friday at least 4,500 masks are being produced daily. She said the 100,000 masks will be ready in the next three weeks. With the last census putting Lamu’s population at 143,920, the mass production is set to effectively cover every resident and visitor in the region. Lamu is among the few counties in Kenya that have not recorded any Covid-19 cases and authorities are under pressure to maintain the status quo. Lamu TVET chairperson Ali Shebwana said the second phase of the mass production will start after the first phase target is met. He said the masks are being designed and produced in line with the Ministry of Health directives. “Lamu TVET alone will have produced at least 30,000 masks by end of next week. We will be done with the 100,000 in three weeks or less,” he said. A week ago, women in some parts of Lamu were spotted donning bras as masks. In Lamu, face masks retail for between Sh100 and 200 which way out of reach for many residents. Edited by A.N
