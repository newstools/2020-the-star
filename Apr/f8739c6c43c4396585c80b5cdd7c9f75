The declaration of the Olympic qualifiers as null and void by the African Karate Federation for individual pugilists who had already booked their tickets to the showpiece is a blessing in disguise for Kenya. Karate has never been an Olympic sport and the Tokyo edition was to serve as their debut. Kenya Karate Federation (KKF) secretary-general, Gabriel Mutuku, said with the qualifiers set to begin afresh, Kenya stands a chance to clinch some slots and wants athletes, whose hope had diminished, to redeem themselves. Mutuku asked Kenyan karatekas to maintain their fitness levels through individual training despite the coronavirus pandemic having crippled the sports activities. “The team’s preparation window might be elongated due to the postponement of the games but training must continue whatsoever,” he added. The African time frame for the qualifiers will be communicated later once sporting activities return to action. Mutuku said that thorough preparations are key if the Kenyan karatekas are to make the Olympics cut. Kenya failed in their bid to go for Africa pre-qualifiers in Morocco slated for February this year due to lack of funds. Kenyans were hoping to realise their dream at the final global qualifiers in France next month but the event was postponed. “The decision to nullify the qualifiers is welcome. We need to go back to the drawing board now that the decision has really favoured us. The athletes need to train extra hard but not in groups as it used to be because of the current situation. They now have a point to prove by exceeding the expectations.” Those, who had booked their tickets did so through the Kata Premier League where points were considered. James Mwangi Gikonyo was close to qualifying if the France qualifiers were not shelved. Kenya made their debut at the World karate Championships in 1980.
