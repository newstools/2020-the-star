All local swimming championships slated for May and June have been postponed to September due to the coronavirus pandemic. Kenya Swimming Federation (KSF) chairman Patrick Muyah said with a government ban on all sporting activities and restriction on movement, it is impossible to have some of the events next month. “With what is going around us, we can’t take chances. The safety and health of swimmers are paramount and we will have to wait until we are given the go-ahead by the government to resume operations,” he added. Some of the events included the national championship and Inter-school tournaments among others. Muyah said the postponement of the Olympic Games to next year gives the swimmers a chance to sharpen themselves and get the qualification times for the show. “It’s a window of opportunity for our swimmers with the next 12 months enough to get into good shape and attain the qualification mark for Tokyo,” he added. A provisional squad of four swimmers —Emily Muteti, Issa Abdulla, Danilo Rosafio and Maria Brunlehner— were named in January for Tokyo show. The KSF chairman expressed confidence that the quartet will still fly the flag high at the games despite the postponement. “They are our best swimmers in the country and they are training under the best coaches abroad. I am sure come the games next year, they will do the country proud,” he added. Elsewhere, Sports Dispute Tribunal chairman John Ohaga said progress is being made towards having the KSF elections. Ohaga, who chairs the Interim Management Committee (IMC), said with the world governing body, FINA having ratified the constitution recently, what is remains is top have eight counties get interim registration from the Sports registrar and to send a notice out to the affiliates starting with the branches. Ohaga, however, failed to give the elections dates with the first quarter of the year gone.
