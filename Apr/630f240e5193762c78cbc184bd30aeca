This yearâ€™s Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (Chogm) that was scheduled to be held in Rwanda has been postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic. More than 10,000 delegates, including heads of state and the Prince of Wales, were expected to attend the 26th summit in the capital, Kigali, in about two months. A new date has not been announced. This was going to be the first time for the summit to be held in a country that has no colonial links with the UK. Rwanda, which was formerly a Belgian colony, joined the Commonwealth in 2009. Rwanda has extended its lockdown until early May and put in place stringent measures, including cancelling major public events.
