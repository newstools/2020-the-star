@ppcheti Beauty salons and barbershops are operating in Lamu again after the county government lifted a ban it placed on them two weeks ago. Lamu's more than 200 grooming services providers were shuttered to contain the spread of the coronavirus. Authorities were concerned the businesses requires close contact with clients making it impossible to observe social distancing rules. But in a public notice, the county Health department has given new guidelines to be observed in the business premises. Face masks are now mandatory for clients and workers while social distancing is to be achieved by limiting the numbers entering premises. Lamu health promotion officer Ahmed Muhsin said Thursday that the businesses are to also provide sanitiser and handwashing gear fro clients. Muhsin also ordered compulsory and regular disinfection of the premises. Barbershops are to also ensure that the hair cloth or barber cape is of single-use and re-washed immediately after. Public health officers have been dispatched all around the county to supervise and ensure those flouting the directives are prosecuted. Barbers and beauty salon owners pledged to observe all regulations. Lincoln Matu said the two-week ban had reduced many of them to a life of begging and borrowing to survive not knowing how they will repay. “God knows how much debt I have accumulated in these two weeks but we are glad it’s over,” he said. Susan Shiro, a salon owner was almost evicted for failing to pay rent. “The landlord had given me the notice to vacate and any efforts to convince him that it wasn’t my fault were fruitless,” she said. Shiro said she was confident she would pay up the rent arrears before the end of the week.  (edited by o. owino)
