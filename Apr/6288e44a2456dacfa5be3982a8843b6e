Strathmore University has installed a programme to help coaches to monitor their athletes’ training from the comfort of their homes in the wake of the coronavirus. Basketball tactician Tony Ochieng revealed that through the system, they can observe the fitness level of all their players in the institution. “All players have to instal the App and link with coaches to allow them to monitor not only the progress but also the duration of the training,” said Ochieng. He added: “Once they are through with training, the device automatically records the timings. This helps to keep their fitness levels.” The tactician said the players will work on their own until it is safe to resume the sporting activities halted by the coronavirus pandemic. Strathmore Blades, he said, will be a tougher team in the Premier League this year going by their recent recruitments. “The team is going to be fine. I have recruited five new players from high school and I am sure they will be equal to the task,” he said. Strathmore University were runners up in the league in 2018— their best placing so far—and Ochieng believes they can improve and do better this time around. “The unfortunate thing for us was that we were done with the recruitments when the sporting activities were stopped,” he notes. The new players are Dennis Koja, Tony Were, Maxwell Ochieng from Maseno School, Richard Ochieng (Maranda High), together with Garang Ding from varsity’s lower tier. Meanwhile, Shem Otieno has declared his candidature for the post of second vice chairman in Kenya Basketball Federation (KBF) polls. Otieno, who is an active player turning out for Equity Bank, said he will ensure the youth living with disability have access to the facility. He said he will develop the youth coaches caucus and create a platform where youth access opportunities in the game. The polls are set for April 25. “I will developing U-21, U-19 and U-10 national teams by establishing continuous training camps,” he said.
