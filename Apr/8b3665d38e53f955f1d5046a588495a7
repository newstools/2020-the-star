Death took literary icon Ken Walibora at the peak of his career, fellow writer Tony Mochama, alias Smitta Smitten, has said. The icon died on April 10. Tony, a veteran journalist and poet, on Tuesday paid him tribute via Facebook Live. "Ken was never supposed to die in that manner. It breaks my heart to learn he died while interacting with the common mwananchi," he said. Tony described his friend as humble, saying he kept himself in the shoe of a common man. "His fame could not go to his mind. His humility was seen in the way he spoke to people," he said. Tony's fondest memory of Ken was his utter mastery of the Kiswahili language. "Because I am not good in the language, when we met, Ken used to chide me every time we met about his book, 'Kidagaa Kimemwozea'. And I would tell him, 'Kiswahili kiliniozea, usijali ndugu, there is hope for you'," Tony said. What inspires Tony the most about Ken is he never rested but kept writing. "He has left us with a body of work that will be read for decades. He was never distracted by awards or achievements," he said. The author was involved in an accident on Friday, when a matatu ran over him on Landhies Road. According to government pathologist Dr Johansen Oduor, the postmortem found that Waliboraâ€™s body had facial injuries and a deep knife wound on his right arm.
