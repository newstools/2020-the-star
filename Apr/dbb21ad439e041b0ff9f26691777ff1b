Lilian Muli is already in her birthday mood. She will be turning a year older on May 4, and this year, she is planning to just chill or go to the park. She said this while replying to a fan who sought to know her plans. Reminiscing on her last year's birthday, Lilian shared memories of her past year's birthday. One of the videos was when Bongo star Harmonize left her shedding tears after he surprised her on air. She was pregnant with her son Liam. Lilian wrote; "â€¦no wonder Liam is a dancing baby he Loves to dance. @harmonize_tz sang for meâ€¦ I cried me a riverâ€¦ can't wait for my birthday ðŸ’ƒ itâ€™s Birthday week and I am so excited." Adding, "Just so blessed and thankful that God continues to be so faithful. I donâ€™t have much but he has given me the grace to be content with what I have."
