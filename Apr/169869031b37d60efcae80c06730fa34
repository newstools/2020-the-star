@alalmaurice Religious leaders urged their congregations to stay away from churches and worship at home to prevent the spread of coronavirus. Ruwe Holy Ghost Church of East Africa Archbishop Joel Ofuna said on Monday clerics should support the government in combating the virus - and not push to reopen churches. “Let us wear face masks, keep social distance and avoid hugging and shaking hands,” Ofuna said. He also asked the faithful for not congregating in churches. He said churches should be reopened for worship when the time is right but not now. Ofuna was accompanied by Pastors Nicholas Ondiek, Kennedy Nyaori, Alphayo Odongo, and Calvins Rachuonyo. He spoke at the church's headquarters in Kisumu. Several clerics have been pushing President Uhuru Kenyatta to lift the ban on worshipping in churches. The virus can spread easily in crowds. Some clergy sued to compel the government to allow congregations to worship together. The case was dismissed. Ofuna said the directive must be followed to the letter to avoid any problems, such as crowding, that could lead to the arrest of church members. “The church faithful have the opportunity to pray at home as a family and ask God to protect Kenyans from the deadly coronavirus,” he said. “A responsible government always protects its people and that is simply what President Uhuru Kenyatta is doing,” he added. “We want young people to protect the image of the church by not violating the government’s directive. We must show a good example,” Ondiek said. He said the church was raising funds to purchase foodstuffs for members in need. (Edited by V. Graham)
