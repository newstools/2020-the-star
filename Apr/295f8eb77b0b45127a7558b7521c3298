As clubs continue to reel from the effects of the directives by the government to help control the spread of coronavirus, well-wishers continue to chip in to alleviate the suffering citizens, players, officials and employees and clubs are feeling. Yesterday, AFC Leopards announced on their social media pages that Cabinet Secretary for Sports Amina Mohamed had chipped in with donations as did Central Organisation of Trade Union secretary general Francis Atwoli. “We extend our gratitude to Francis Atwoli for the financial support extended to the club. The AFC Leopards fraternity takes this opportunity to say thank you for standing with us during this time,” read an appreciation note posted by the club. A similar message of gratitude was passed on to CS Amina for her generous donations. Leopards, who have not had an official sponsor since the exit of SportPesa from the local scene, has been going through hard financial times and the situation has since been aggravated by the pandemic that the whole world is determined to eradicate as quickly as possible.
