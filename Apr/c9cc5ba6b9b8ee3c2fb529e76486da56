Despite Kariobangi Sharks announcing that they will not object the duo of Sven Yidah and Harrison Mwendwa from crossing the border to join Tanzanian giants Yanga, the club insist they are yet to receive offers for the duo. The two players have been on Yanga's radar since last year and have in the recent weeks been reported to be inching closer to joining them. However, Sharks chairman Robert Maoga said Yanga had not formally tabled bids for the two players whom he said have running contracts. He said Yidah had a year remaining in his contract while Mwendwa had two. "Yanga have not shied from expressing their interest in the two players from the time we played the Super Cup in Dar es Salaam last year. However they have not approached us to negotiate. The two players have contracts with us and it is only fair that they launched negotiations. If they table good offers then we will let the boys go," said Maoga. Maoga also insisted that the decision to relegate Mwendwa, a player deemed experienced and senior at the club, to train with the U20s just before the league was suspended was based on his performance. He said training with the junior team would help him recover his form. "The technical bench had observed that his form had dwindled. Other players in the senior team had stepped up and we had to challenge him to fight for his place in the starting team," he added.
