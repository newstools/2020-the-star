Health CS Mutahi Kagwe has directed that all health workers, including those in private hospitals and rapid response teams and all staff in all facilities holding quarantined persons, undergo testing with immediate effect. The CS said medical people are not immune to the virus. He cautioned medical personnel who are casual in using protective gear. The CS said that nobody was going to exposed areas without protective gear. "Nobody is going to lack Personal Protective Equipment in the next two weeks. We expect to roll out 200,000 kits in the seven days," he said. Kagwe said measures that have been put in place by the government are not going to stop the disease abruptly. According to Kagwe, though Kenya has been getting mild infections, the time has come for all citizens to mentally prepare for the worst. In his press briefing on Tuesday on the update of the virus, Kagwe announced Kenya had confirmed 14 more coronavirus cases. This now brings the country's total number to 172 with four fatalities. 12 of these are Kenyans while two are foreign nationals. Health Director General Patrick Amoth said during the briefing that those in quarantine must observe social distancing rule. He said the government will accommodate health workers who have been exposed to patients who have tested positive. "We have found suitable accommodation near Nairobi hospital for health care workers who have come into contact with positive cases," Amoth said.
