It was business unusual for small scale traders during the Easter season due to the social and economic disruption from the novel coronavirus. Rose Kanini who sells broiler chicken in Syokimau area had been gearing up been for the Easter season when she enjoys bumper sales but things were different. She sold less than 50 of the chicken despite reducing the price from Sh450 to Sh300. “Biashara ni mbaya (business is bad). I have had to reduce my prices and even go at a loss but I still did not manage the customers I used to get during this season,” said Kanini. Most clients would buy chicken to celebrate Easter but most remained indoors as advised by health officials. “Let’s pray this disease dies down so that things can go back to normal as my chicken business is my only source of income,” said Kanini Streets that are usually filled with people selling balloons, face painting for kids and other activities to celebrate the season but this was not the case. The tourism industry is the most hit with the suspension of flights into the country and cessation of movement to and from Nairobi. Mombasa, Kilifi and Kwale. There was no Easter celebration this year, over 90 per cent of facilities at the Coast and the entire country remained closed, as Kenyans stayed at home. According to a recent World Bank report countries with greater dependence on tourism revenues will be significantly affected, Kenya being one of them. Tourism earnings which rose 3.9 per cent last year to Sh163.56 billion are poised for a major dip this year following the shut down in travel.
