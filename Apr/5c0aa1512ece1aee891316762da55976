Traders in Budalang'i have raised concerns over increased cases of robbery in the area since the government imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew. They said criminals use huge stones to break into shops at Budalang'i trading centre in Bunyala North ward. Pastor Samson Midi Wanyama and Caleb Otieno said on Sunday traders have lost goods worth thousands of shillings in the robberies. Midi urged the law enforcement officers in Budalang'i to step up their patrols. Edited by A.N
