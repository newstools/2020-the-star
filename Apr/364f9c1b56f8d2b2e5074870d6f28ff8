Vihiga government plans to recruit 124 health workers to boost service delivery during the Covid-19 pandemic. These are part of 5,500 that the state had directed counties to hire through their Public Service boards. Health CS Mutahi Kagwe said they will be required to boost labour in the health sector by 5,500 workers. CPSB chairman ambassador Franklin Esipila said they have started receiving applications for the positions. “We have already gone through the applications and we are shortlisting applicants for interviews that are expected to take place in this week,” Esipila said. We are even prepared to give contracts to those 528 workers who have been battling with the county since last year but only if they meet all the conditions put in place, he added. He said they should apply as new applicants and submit all requirements. He further said CPSB is preparing to conduct a human resource audit to root out ghost workers. The audit comes in time as the county battles a bloated wage bill with an unknown number of staffers. “We trying to see if we can reduce this mess of the ghost workers that has been the game of cat and mouse with the county,” the official said. He said for interviews to sail through this week, the county must have “a sober county secretary who understands how the county affairs are dealt with”. Vihiga has one in an acting capacity after Francis Ominde was kicked out by Governor Wilber Ottichilo. They are in the process of eplacing him, Esipila said. Edited by R.Wamochie
