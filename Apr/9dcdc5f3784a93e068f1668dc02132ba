Former Nyandarua Finance officer Michael Kuria has suffered a major setback after the High Court dismissed a case in which he sought to stop the anti-graft agency from summoning him to explain sources of his wealth. Kuria and his company Gachomba Properties Limited filed the case in August last year, claiming that the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission illegally summoned him to explain how he acquired property and cash totalling to Sh286 million without following proper procedure. He accused the EACC of improperly obtaining details of his bank accounts over suspicions he was engaged in corruption. While dismissing the case, Justice Mumbi Ngugi said there was no violation of his rights because the law allows the commission to move to court and obtain orders to investigate suspect accounts. “The petitioners were issued with a notice to explain the source of the assets identified pursuant to the notices. Thus, the petitioners have an opportunity to be heard with respect to the assets and funds,” the judge said. According to the evidence on record, the commission had summoned him on August 13 to explain how he obtained his source of wealth, failing which it would begin proceedings to have the assets forfeited to the state. The commission said it was impossible for Kuria who earned a salary of Sh120,000 to purchase properties worth Sh186 million. It was found that between January 2013 and December 2017, he had received cash deposits and bank transfers of Sh82,083,066 suspected to be proceeds of corruption. In total, he had accumulated assets and money worth Sh263 million. EACC said the company was established with the sole aim of using it as a vehicle for receiving proceeds of crime. Edited by A.N
