Health CAS Mercy Mwangangi has said that the government has witnessed a spike in domestic violence, gender-based violence and sexual offences during the Covid-19 period. During a press briefing on Tuesday at Afya House, Mwangangi warned Kenyans against engaging in such vices and disputes during the pandemic. "As the Ministry of Health what we are really saying is that this is not the time to engage in disputes and to bend about in terms of domestic violence towards our partners," she said "We want to remind everyone that the law has not been suspended and that it will catch up with those who mete violence on others during this period." The CAS said that the ministry is in constant communication with the Gender Violence Recovery Centre as well as the National Council on Administration of Justice over the worrying numbers. "Both organisations have told us there is an increase in both numbers of gender-based violence and sexual violence and most of the times it's been noticed that this violence has been perpetrated by close relatives and guardians." The Ministry has also called on Kenyans to focus on fighting the virus and to handle the disputes within the laid down civil structures, devoid of any violence. Her sentiments came on the day she reported the country recordedÂ eight new coronavirus cases, bringing the country's total number to 216. Mwangangi said the eight new cases were out of 694 samples that were tested in the last 24 hours. Of the new cases, five are Kenyans while three are foreigners. Six of the new cases are from Nairobi and one each from Siaya and Nakuru counties. The CAS said the mass testing exercise will be based on priorities of high-risk regions. She said 12,000 testing kits will be deployed in phase one that will cover Nairobi, Mandera, Mombasa and Siaya counties.
