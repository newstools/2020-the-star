Ten nurses from Longisa referral hospital in Bomet who attended to a patient who died of respiratory complications have been released. The release of the health workers came after samples taken from the deceased for testing at the Kenya Medical Research Institute in Kisumu were negative for coronavirus. Fear gripped the facility after the 50-year-old female patient died in what was believed to be as a result of the pandemic after exhibiting signs related to the disease. The medics had been put under quarantine at the facility following the death of the patient they had attended to on Friday night. Health executive Joseph Sitonik told the press on Sunday that the deceased had been undergoing frequent checkups at the facility. “Our surveillance team is on high alert to monitor any suspected cases. We would like to urge the residents to follow the guidelines from the Ministry of Health at all times to avert possible spread of the disease,” Sitonik said. Meanwhile, 39 out of 63 persons who had been under close monitoring at the county have been released while 24 were being sought. The 24, according to Bomet county commissioner Geoffrey Omoding, sneaked into the county from Nairobi and Mombasa. Edited by Henry Makori
