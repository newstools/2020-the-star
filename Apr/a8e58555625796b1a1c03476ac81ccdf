Police on Sunday cut short a wedding party at Nasra Estate in Komarock and arrested 39 people. Acting on a tip-off, police set off at the area and arrested the merrymakers. Details of the arrests came to light on Monday but reports indicate the incident happened on Sunday. Several of those arrested were still held at Ruai police station waiting for processing into KMTC quarantine facility on Monday evening. “Tumekubali makosa yetu, tunajua harusi haikubaliwi, inakubaliwa ya watu wachache. Ni wasichana wengine hawakualikwa, (We have accepted our mistakes. We know weddings are prohibited and only a few are allowed to attend but it’s some women who gate-crashed),” a woman is heard telling police in a viral video clip. On Monday, Kayole subcounty police boss Wilson Kosgei said those found contravening social distancing directives would be arrested. “They know these things. They think they can hide but thankfully other law-abiding citizens are informing us,” he told the Star. One of the women was busted while hiding on the roof to evade arrest, to the surprise of the officers. Health Chief Administrative Secretary Mercy Mwangangi on Sunday warned that anyone defying the curfew will be subjected to mandatory quarantine at their own cost. Kenyans continue to flout regulations despite ballooning coronavirus statistics. On Saturday, Health CS Mutahi Kagwe narrated how a group of people travelled from Nairobi disguising themselves as mourners, armed with an empty coffin and a burial permit. They evaded roadblocks from Nairobi only to be arrested in Homa Bay. The driver of the vehicle was confirmed positive for coronavirus. On Monday, Kagwe announced 11 more virus cases bringing the total to 281. (edited by o. owino)
