Since time immemorial, the Mijikenda have always turned to their forest shrines (kayas) to solve the community's problems. Prayers are conducted by elders and divine revelations relayed to the community. Kaya elder Daniel Mwawara said the coronavirus pandemic could be stopped through prayers and offerings in elaborate rituals by elders. “Calamities are a way of God communicating to his people and calling for repentance. God can be angry and the only way to demonstrate his anger is through calamities,” Mwawara said. The Kaya elder said although there was no revelation from seers about the pandemic, there was need to conduct prayers. A special prayer is performed during calamities and involves an offering of three goats. “This is a simple ritual but right now we cannot perform it because the government has banned gatherings as a measure to stop the spread of the disease. We are calling on the government to allow us perform this ritual to save our land from this pandemic,” Mwawara said. Similar sentiments were expressed by Malindi District Cultural Association secretary general Joseph Mwarandu. “When there is such a calamity the seers get a revelation through a dream and the elders are called and given the message. For now such a thing has not happened but there is a need for prayers. Muslims, Christians, Kaya elders and any religion should perform prayers in their respective ways,” Mwarandu said.
