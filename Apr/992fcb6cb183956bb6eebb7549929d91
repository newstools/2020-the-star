A Nyandarua police constable is fighting for his life at Mediheal Hospital, Nakuru county, following a suicide attempt on Friday evening. According to a police report, Constable Geoffrey Irioko was on duty at Mirangine police station. He excused himself to go and eat supper, but shortly after, a female officer who was on duty with him heard gunshots from his unit within the police lines. The shots also attracted the duty officer, who upon rushing to the scene, found that Irioko had shot himself through the chin using his G3 rifle. The matter was reported to the subcounty criminal investigations officer, deputy subcounty police commander and area OCS. It was established that a bullet exited through Irioko's head and through his roof. Six spent cartridges were recovered on the floor of his house, as he was rushed to the hospital in critical condition. Mirangine subcounty police commander John Matsili on Sunday told the Star it is yet to be established why the officer attempted to take his life. He said they suspect domestic problems. Matsili said the officer, who was recently employed, lives with his wife in the police lines. “We thank God that he is still alive. We shall have to record his statement for him to tell us what lead to this action,” he said on the phone. The officer is in stable condition and set to undergo a surgery to remove bullets lodged in his body. Edited by R.Wamochie
