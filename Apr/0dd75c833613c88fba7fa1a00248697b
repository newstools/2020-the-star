Starehe MP Charles Njagua has pleaded with president Uhuru Kenyatta to stop landlords from evicting tenants over unpaid or delayed rent. "Evictions of tenants, while we are facing this crisis, is a health and security risk that we can't afford. How will they obey curfews when they are out in the cold?" he posed. Via Twitter on Thursday, Njagua said some evictees will turn to crime out of desperation to fend for their families. "Let us avoid such risks by banning evictions. I urge the President to take a similar stance on rent as Uganda's Yoweri Museveni," he said. Museveni on Wednesday warned landlords against hiking or evicting tenants during the Covid-19 lockdown saying it is not allowed. "Museveni has stopped evictions in Uganda. Let's ban them as well. Most Kenyans aren't going to work. They have little to spare for rent. Also, government should protect landlords from auctions by banks," he said. Njagua also asked landlords who can waive rent to do so for their tenants. "...others can collect rent later. Tenants who can pay full rent should pay. Those who can pay part of it should make local arrangements with their landlords. Play your part and we shall overcome," he added. Two days ago, Uhuru urged landlords to ease the burden for their tenants who are struggling through the Covid-19 crisis. "If someone has for years been your tenant and has never failed to pay rent itâ€™s only logical that you reciprocate at this difficult time. This is a time for compassion and understanding," the President said. Uhuru commended property owners who have come out to support measures taken by the Government by waiving and/or reducing monthly rent to lessen the cost burden on Kenyans during this difficult period.
