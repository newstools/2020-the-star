Ex-P Square member Peter Okoye, alias Rudeboy, says at the time he married, he was broke and had nothing. Speaking in an Instagram live video, he urged men not to always stereotype women by thinking all of them are just after money. "I met my wife 18 years ago. I was a gold-digger. When I met her, I f*cking had nothing. Men wise up, every woman is not a har_lot or a slay mama. Pick one and make her look the way you want her to be," he said. "My wife was never perfect, don’t get me wrong, what I did was make her look the way I want her to be and she made me look the same way she wanted me to be. Have you seen me before? I was ugly before. Look at me now, every day I’m looking younger." Peter married businesswoman Lola Omotayo, a half Nigerian, half Russian, much to the displeasure of his family. Peter went on to reveal in an interview that his marriage was one of the things which led to the split of the P-Square group because his family did not like Lola. After the group parted ways, Lola, who is years older than Peter, got most of the blame for causing the family rift. Peter and his wife are blessed with two children, Cameron and Aliona.
