The six-year-old boy Covid-19 patient who died at KNH had a pre-existing bone marrow condition. Health CAS Mercy Mwangangi on Friday said the boy had a bone marrow condition, which suppresses the immune system and worsened with Covid-19. "..when Covid-19 comes in, those whose immunity are compromised cannot survive it..." she said. Sources also told the Star that the child went to hospital with symptoms of pneumonia. "He deteriorated very fast. A lot of the people who came into contact had no PPE. He was taken to ICU and a test for Covid-19 ordered. The child died and the results came back positive," the source said. Health ministry director general Dr Patrick Amoth said the necessary prevention and quarantine of staff has taken place. "The place has been disinfected. We are in the process of testing them... They are at a high risk of contracting Covid-19," he said. During the presser, Mwangangi said In the last 24 hours, they have managed to test a total of 362 samples out of which 12 people have tested positive for the Coronavirus disease. Out of this number eleven(11) are Kenyans and one (1) Somali National. This now brings the total number of those who have tested positive for the disease in the country to 122. The distribution of these new cases according to their Counties is as follows; One in  Kiambu,  Laikipia 1,  Mombasa 2, Nairobi 7 and Nyeri 1.
