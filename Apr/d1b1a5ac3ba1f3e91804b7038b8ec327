Kenya Revenue Authority has shifted to conducting its tax disputes online. Individuals and business owners can now access Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) sessions with KRA digitally. Taxpayers and their agents can connect with the KRA from their offices or homes via video/teleconferencing technology applications such as Zoom, Skype or Google hangouts, a move aimed at ensuring business continuity. “We encourage parties with tax disputes, such as assessing Commissioners and taxpayers together with their agents to continue engaging virtually under the ADR framework,” KRA Deputy Commissioner for Tax Dispute Resolution Rispah Simiyu said. This offers a platform for disputes to be heard without physically attending ADR sessions.  The online session is cost-effective and convenient to taxpayers since it covers a larger geographical area with the option of multiple individuals at different locations dialing in. ADR was rolled out in June 2015 to complement litigation by providing timely settlement of tax disputes. The ADR process takes the form of facilitated mediation moderated by a member of the KRA’s Corporate Tax Dispute Resolution Department. During the 2018/2019 financial year, there was a hike in ADR applications where 502 applications were received. Of the 502 applications, 237 cases with a revenue yield of Sh8.102 billion were successfully resolved. In the 2017/18 financial year, 90 cases were resolved with a revenue yield of Sh3 billion. “KRA has not been left behind in the use of technology as a business continuity model,” Simiyu said.
