Trucks transporting food and medicine are exempted from the government imposed curfew, Health CS Mutahi Kagwe has reiterated. The CS on Wednesday said that the purpose of the curfew is to limit social contact and not disable businesses. "We have not stopped commerce because of the curfew. Food trucks are free to move in the evening," he said. "Police have also  been advised on the same." Mutahi was speaking during a press briefing where he announced the country now has 81 confirmed cases of the virus. This is a sharp increase of 22 cases within 24 hours, the highest reported since the first case. The 7pm-5am nationwide curfew is part of the government's measures to deal with the spread of coronavirus. The onset of the curfew has met a lot of protests as many outcry economic loss. It was not a smooth start at all and scenes from Mombasa, Nairobi and other major towns painted quite a sad and worrying picture. Police brutality, stranded passengers and surging crowds at the Likoni ferry marred an otherwise good measure to deal with the spread of the disease. While the government is urging people to stay at home, it is not possible for all to work from home. This is more so for factory workers, Jua Kali operators, shop attendants and others whose work demands their physical presence. Going forward, employers have been advised to  review working hours to enable employees to leave work early enough to beat the curfew.
