 Kwale residents have been cautioned of dangerous lightning storms accompanied by heavy rains in the April-May season. Last month, two women died on the spot while six others were injured after they were struck by lightning at Mutsaviani village in Matuga constituency. County meteorological director Dominic Mbindio said due to change in weather patterns, thunderstorms are expected in some parts of the coastal region. "Global warming is rampant hence we expect certain weather variations like lightning among others, " he said. Mbindio advised residents to remain indoors during such periods. He spoke on Tuesday in an interview in Kwale town where he urged residents to keep off metallic surfaces and switch off the electricity when lightning hazard persists. Lightning carries high voltage posing a great threat to human life. "Majority of our homes have metallic window and door frames. Please stay away from them and disconnect electricity if need be for your safety." He warned that floods might also affect areas like Ukunda in Msambweni and Vanga in Lunga Lunga subcounties. He said most people have established settlements in swampy areas and water drainage routes hence becoming vulnerable to floods. Mbindio asked the county government to clear and enhance water drainage. "I would like our governor to be proactive and act before the floods hit us. We do not want to worsen the challenges we already have due to coronavirus," he said. The weatherman advised small scale farmers to take advantage of the short rains to increase food production.Â He said farming is likely to do well as a lot of rain is anticipated this season.
