In December 2021, Nairobi National Park will hopefully celebrate 75 years since being gazetted. However, many people are currently greatly concerned about the proposed 10-year management plan for the park. What if this was the year 2046, the 100th year of the Nairobi National Park? Would that year be a moment of great celebration or merely a sober moment of reflecting on the sad, lost past? The year 2020 will be very critical in the history of the Nairobi National Park, a time when key leaders hopefully decide to keep a priceless Kenyan treasure intact with minimal infrastructural development inside the park. Or sadly, if proposed developments take place, then Kenyans will lose much of the priceless integrity of the Nairobi National Park. Forever! A priceless treasure is a treasure that no money can replace. If this current generation does not act now to stop habitat destructive development within the park and to find long-term alternative solutions with minimal impact on ecosystems, then the Nairobi National Park will be reduced to a mere fraction of a “green island” in an ocean of concrete. God has put many wonderful treasures on this earth. The Nairobi park is a priceless treasure that needs to be kept for future generations. Concerned citizens and environmental organisations need to work together to leave a legacy! The Latin words “custos naturae” translate into English as "guardian of nature". Kenya is blessed with incredible natural diversity that needs to be protected for future generations. In Genesis 1 vs 28, it is written, “Then God blessed them, and God said to them, 'Be fruitful and multiply; fill the earth and subdue it; have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, and over every living thing that moves on the earth'.” Are we really being the Guardians of Nature we are meant to be?
