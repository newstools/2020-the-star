Two prison police officers are in custody after they were arrested at a bar in Majaoni, Kisauni. They were arrested on Tuesday. The two have been identified as Harriet Mwende and Richard Mutinda. They were arrested by fellow Shimo La Tewa prison officers and others from Bamburi Police Station. “The two will face charges of failing to comply with legal notice No. 50 of the Public Health Act issued through gazette notice No. 41 on the control of the Covid-19,” reads a police report seen by the Star. They are expected to be arraigned before Shanzu Law Courts on Wednesday. Police officers are increasingly being arrested for flouting coronavirus rules. Despite the countrywide closure of non-essential businesses, including clubs, dozens of people have been arrested in police swoops in the past two weeks.
