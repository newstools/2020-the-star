One person died and another was injured when the vehicle they were travelling in lost control and rolled several times along Namanga Road. The two are employees of the Kajiado government’s fire-fighting department. They were driving to Namanga border town on a Covid-19 fumigation exercise on Thursday evening. Kajiado Central subcounty police boss Daudi Lornyokwe said the driver of the government vehicle lost control near Maili Tisa centre, a few kilometres to Namanga. “My officers have gone to the scene and the injured civil servant has been brought to Kajiado County Referral Hospital,” Lornyokwe said. Health county executive Esther Somoire said the injured official was receiving treatment but she had not received any details of how the accident occurred. The administration announced Monday that it will fumigate all the urban towns and markets starting Wednesday. Fumigation began in Embulbul and Ngong market on Wednesday as Kitengela, Kajiado and Namanga town markets were scheduled for Friday.  (edited by o. owino)
