Bungoma county commissioner Abdi Hassan has ordered the arrest of boda boda riders who burnt down government motorcycles in Webuye East constituency. Addressing the press in Bungoma, Hassan said the government will not allow criminals to run the country as if it was a banana republic. “All government officials are supposed to enforce coronavirus control measures. We do not expect anybody to attack government officials who are supervising the directives,” he said. Two motorcycles assigned to chiefs were torched by boda boda operators on April 25 in Magemo village. “Government officers are only enforcing the directives from the President. Anyone who attacks them will be dealt with according to the law,” he said. The boda boda operators demonstrated after the arrest and demise of one of their own in the hands of police officers, after he allegedly hacked the area assistant chief with a panga. Hassan said the culprits, who are on the run, will be arrested "and serve as an example to others”. He urged the public to corporate with law enforcers in pursuing the suspected arsonists. "This is a bad example and if it is allowed to continue, we will be breeding militias in our society,” he warned. Bungoma residents have on a number of occasions clashed with police officers since the 7pm-5am curfew began. Hassan also advised residents living in areas prone to flooding and mudslides to move to safe ground. Edited by Frank Obonyo
