Mugithi singer Samuel Muchoki, alias Samidoh, says the greatest challenge in music is how to deal with people. Speaking to Word Is, he said, "Sometimes I feel like people expect so much from celebrities." Regarding how corona pandemic has affected his music, Samidoh said he had to postpone many events that were ahead of him. "I would simply term this pandemic as a total grounding because there are zero events. Artistes earn from social gatherings, which are no more," he said. "I had a calendar booked up to September, but all these events will be suspended and my Europe tour postponed." Samidoh will have a live performance on his social media platforms on May 2. He urges Kenyans to follow the regulations laid down by the government. "It's the only way we shall overcome this pandemic," he said. Samidoh, also an AP officer since 2013, says he is currently enjoying his duties. "Police work entails so much, but I like it since where I work, I don't deal with people directly, so that has saved me," he said. "I can never leave my military work because I looked for that job while naked." Samidoh joined the service in 2013 and went through 15 months of training, graduating in 2014. His first operation was in Eastleigh, Nairobi, after which he was posted to Mpeketoni in Lamu county. It was during his posting to Daadab in Northern Kenya that his vocals reawakened his talent and he gave music a try. “I was off duty in October 2016 when I composed the first song that brought me to the limelight. I never knew it would become an instant hit until I heard it being requested and played on the mainstream media repeatedly,” he said. The song was titled 'Ndiri mutwe mwega', which translates to 'I don't have a straight mind.' Samidoh says it was inspired by the anger he had and decided to express it on paper, only for it to sound musical. “Ninety per cent of the song is a true story, while the rest is art,” he adds.
