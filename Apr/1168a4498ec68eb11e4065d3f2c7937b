Police are pursuing three criminals who shot dead a 22-year man while he bought medicine for his sick mother. The incident happened at a chemist in Umoja Innercore on Wednesday at 8.30pm. According to Buruburu subcounty police commander Adamsom Bungei, the victim was engaging the attendant at Phadam Medicare Hospital chemist, when three men came in posing as customers. He said the victim had just completed college. “They started pretending they were also buying medicine. In the process the man identified one of them and called out his name. He removed a pistol and shot him dead,” Bungei told the Star on the phone. He said the thugs were on a theft mission, but noticing the victim knew them, they killed him. Patrol police who had just past the area heard a gunshot and returned to check what had happened, only to find the man lying on the ground. The three escaped on foot. “We have been pursuing them as we speak. We must get them. This is sad,” Bungei said. With many businesses remaining closed, criminals are now turning on essential businesses which remain open throughout the night. “They are now targeting clinics because the business remain open after curfew,” Bungei said.
