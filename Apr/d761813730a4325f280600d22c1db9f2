Ghetto Radio presenter King Kafu has denied claims he has neglected his child who was dumped by his alleged baby mama. A special needs child said to be his was dumped at Kasarani estate with a note saying the child wanted to be taken to his father, Nicholas Cheruiyot, aka King Kafu, a radio presenter at Ghetto Radio. “…..my dad is Nicholas Cheruiyot, Ghetto Radio presenter, please take me to him,” the note read in part. Speaking to Word Is, the presenter said the child is now under his care. "We had issues with the mother seven years ago. I took the baby for two years, after which she came back and claimed the baby," he said. The mother of the child was untraceable on Monday as the police launched a manhunt for her over the baby abandonment.
