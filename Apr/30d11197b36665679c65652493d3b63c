Police officers and frontline health workers are the most vulnerable to coronavirus infection, a wind firm representative said as the firm distributed sanitisers and masks. Wind Lab energy firm representative Douglas Kaume said police and health workers are some of the most crucial stakeholders in the fight against Covid-19. On Saturday, he donated masks and other protective gear to Tigania West chiefs, AP posts and police stations. Athwana Ward MCA Victor Karithi, Akithi Rep David Kaithia and Kangeta MCA Romano Mwito also issued free face masks, sanitisers, water tanks and soaps to curb spread of Covid-19. Mwito donated the free gears to green grocers, bodaboda riders and at matatu termini while urging the riders to exercise caution and adhere to the Ministry of Health guidelines. Mwito said prevention is better than cure and asked the public not to panic. Karithi told residents not to always wait for free things from the government. He said the virus does not recognize a gun or crown, neither does it have any respect for any race, denomination or age group. “Let us support the government’s guidelines because we may ignore and the pandemic becomes uncontrollable. We are aware most of our people depend on daily earnings to feed their family, so observe directives and there will be no lockdown. A mask is Sh40, buy yours, wash hands regularly, we are living in an abnormal world,” Karithi said. Joel Chepkwony, the Tigania West deputy OCPD, thanked the wind firm and MCA Karithi saying it is a rare community social responsibility to remember the men in uniform. “The disease invaded our country when no one expected and we are grateful for sanitisers and other gears as officers will be protected. We appeal to bodaboda riders to adhere to the law by ferrying one customer who must wear a mask. So, far people have honored and obeyed the curfew,” he said.
