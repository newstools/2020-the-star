Vihiga county government has turned to polytechnics to produce volumes of face masks to be distributed to residents. Governor Wilber Ottichilo was speaking at Ebusiralo Polytechnic over the weekend where he launched the mass production of the face masks that will be distributed freely. Ottichilo urged the security agencies in the county to arrest any individual who will be found outside without a mask. “We had to turn to our local institutions for mass production of face masks after the lock own of Nairobi,” Ottichilo said. The polytechnic is expected to produce at least 3,000 face masks daily during this period. He said the masks have been approved by the Kenya Bureau of Standards. Health CEC Amos Kutwa said they will take some of the samples to health facilities to experiment whether they can be used in the theatre and for other services in hospitals. “If they fit the standards and serve the intended goals within our facilities then we won’t make any purchase,” Kutwa said. The virus has messed up Western nations and we only thank God for protecting us, Ottichilo said. “Let’s comply with the simple rules and regulations put in place to curb Covid-19. If we cooperate as a team we will win against this virus,” the governor said. “Sanitise at all times, wash your hands with water and soap, maintain social distance and stay at home,” he said.
