The supply of drugs and other essential equipment needed to fight the coronavirus should be expedited, Nyeri Governor Mutahi Kahiga has said. Kahiga said Friday that the county placed orders for drugs and other supplies from the Kenya Medical Supplies Authority about a month ago but the items are yet to be supplied. “We appeal to Kemsa to deliver the personal protective equipment, gloves and masks we ordered for use by staff in our hospitals,” Kahiga said. The governor also said the Universal Health Coverage piloting agreement had expired. “We are trying hard to ensure we continue offering UHC services despite experiencing financial constraints,” he said. Nyeri is among the four counties that had been selected to pilot UHC. The other three were Machakos, Isiolo and Kisumu counties. (edited by o. owino)
