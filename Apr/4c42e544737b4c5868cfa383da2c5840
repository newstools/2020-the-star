Health CS Mutahi Kagwe has expressed disappointment at Kenyans who escaped the quarantine facilities at KMTC Mbagathi. He urged Kenyans to be cautious about the people they surround themselves with. This is after a video went viral of people spotted escaping a quarantine facility at KMTC. "It's just not in KMTC that people escaped. Mandera had the first case and it is not easy for people to escape a place that has security," Kagwe said during a press briefing on Wednesday "Quarantine facilities are not a prison. You are kept there for monitoring purposes. We saw Kenyans jump over KMTCÂ  fence, which is very dangerous." Quarantined individuals have previously complained of poor living conditions in facilities. Some said they feared contracting the disease despite not entering the facility with the virus because of poor standards of hygiene and lack of social distancing. Kagwe urged those who escaped to surrender themselves to the communicated quarantine facilities in the country. "People need to police themselves in a matter such as this one. I urge people to surrender themselves to the quarantine facilities," he said. President Uhuru Kenyatta said on Wednesday that the government is pursuing those who escaped from quarantine facilities. The President said the escapees will be taken back to complete their quarantine period. Uhuru was addressing a section of Swahili media houses from State House on Wednesday morning. "For those ones, those who we saw escaping. They should not think they have won. We know them and we will find them," Uhuru said.
