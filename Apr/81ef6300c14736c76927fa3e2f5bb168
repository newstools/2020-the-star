Bomet Governor Hillary Barchok has nominated Jane Sigilai as chief officer for gender, culture and social services. Sigilai, who has been acting in the position, is a cousin of the late Governor Joyce Laboso. She was the late governor's chief of staff. Her nomination comes in the wake of interviews conducted by the public service board last month. In what was seen as a reward to his loyalists and doing away with his opponents, Barchok sent packing some CECs and other staff who held senior positions in the county and brought in new faces. The Sigilai nomination is expected to calm Laboso supporters, who had accused Barchok of sacking her appointees. Evelyne Rono, who was Laboso’s county secretary, is the latest to be sacked. No one has been proposed to take over the position. Other names submitted for approval in the governor's notice to the county assembly are Alice Kirui and Peter Tonui. Acting chief officer for medical services Joyce Tonui has also been nominated for confirmation to the position, while Peter Kiprono Bii has been nominated as chief executive officer for the County Public Service Board. The county assembly convened a special sitting on Tuesday  to deliberate on the nominees and adopt a supplementary budget for the coronavirus pandemic. The county has so far spent Sh15 million on the fight against the pandemic. Edited by Henry Makori
