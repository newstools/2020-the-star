No legislator or parliamentary staffer was found positive for coronavirus during voluntary testing in early April. Speaker Justin Muturi, in a note to members, said the results of those tested from the National Assembly, the Senate and members of staff came back negative. “Let me sound a word of caution. We should not relent, and we must continue to uphold the sanitisation measures including wearing of face masks at all times, handwashing or use of hand sanitisers and observing strict social distancing, amongst other measures,” he advised. Voluntary testing for MPs and staff was carried out between April 2 and 4 within the precincts of Parliament. The House had asked legislators and members of staff to undergo voluntary Covid-19 testing as part of early measures to combat the disease. Reports in the local dailies had indicated that 17 MPs had tested positive for the disease. Parliament had asked MPs and members of staff to undergo voluntary Covid-19 testing. Muturi said the National Assembly continues to implement response measures and targeted interventions to mitigate the spread and transmission of the disease within the precincts of Parliament. He said the measures are in line with guidance and advice by the Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization. He said the Parliamentary Service Commission is in the process of organising another testing exercise. “This exercise, which will be voluntary, is targeted at all Members of Parliament and all members of staff. Further, the staff of contracted cleaning companies working in Parliament will also be required to be tested,” he added. He encouraged legislators and members of staff to take advantage of the opportunity to take the test.“The dates when the excise will be undertaken will be communicated as soon as practicable,” he said.
