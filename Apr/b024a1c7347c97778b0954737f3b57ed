The Fed Cup Euro Africa Group 3 tournament in Lithuania, where Kenya were to take part in June, has been postponed to July due to the coronavirus pandemic. International Tennis Federation (ITF) in a statement said they were aligning themselves with the ATP and WTA Tours and Grand Slams in extending the suspensions of their respective events in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Team Kenya was to be represented by top-ranked Angela Okutoyi, Rosehilda Asumwa, Shufaa Changawa, Cynthia Cheruto and Faith Nyabera. The team was hoping to improve their performance from last year having lost with a similar 3-0 to Morocco, Egypt and Ireland hence being locked out of the qualification to Group Two. The players in the squad have been given individual programmes by the coaches to train on their own for the next couple of weeks to ensure they are in peak condition by the time the tournament is played in July.  Tennis Kenya administrator, Nancy Nduku said top ITF  junior tournaments slated for  May and June have been pushed forward to July due to the pandemic. ITF President David Haggerty said: “Protecting the health and well-being of all those involved in tennis as well as the wider public has been and remains our priority. Our sport is in uncharted territory but we are committed to taking a pro-active and responsible approach to meet the challenges we are facing,” added Haggerty.
