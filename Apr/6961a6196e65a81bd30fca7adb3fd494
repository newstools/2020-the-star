A section of Mandera residents on Thursday welcomed movement restriction orders issued by the national government to contain the spread of coronavirus. Mandera becomes the fifth county to be placed under partial lockdown after Nairobi, Mombasa, Kilifi and Kwale to curb the spread of Covid-19. The order by the government comes after the region recorded eight positive cases of the virus. Adan Ali, speaking to the press in Mandera town, said the new order was long overdue. He said the rate at which the disease was spreading in the county was alarming. "I welcome the government's decision to completely lock down our county. We are more than willing to cooperate if that is what will help stop the spread of the virus," he said. Abdi Hassan, a businessman who also welcomed the new orders, however, urged the security apparatus not to harass motorists carrying goods. "We have in the recent past witnessed cases of some of our drivers carrying goods say that they were given a rough time by police officers on the roads. This is despite having the necessary documentation which lists them among the essential service providers," Hassan said. Governor Ali Roba, who put the county on partial lockdown two weeks ago, welcomed the government's move and urged residents to comply with the directive. On Tuesday, Roba said his county had continued upscaling interventions against the virus including active surveillance, contact tracing, case management and community interventions across all subcounties in line with rising cases of the pandemic. He said measures including fumigation of public places and setting up of a 78-bed isolation facility had been put in place. The health department has been doing active surveillance and screening of people at entry and exit points where more than 30,000 persons entering or leaving Mandera county have been screened. The health department has so far sent 92 samples to Nairobi for screening in government laboratories. Edited by Henry Makori
