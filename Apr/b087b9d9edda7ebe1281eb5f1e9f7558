A landlord in Turkana has waived April rent for his tenants to ease their suffering amid the difficulties caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Justus Eleman said his decision was prompted by the fact that many employees had been forced to stay home, some without work. Some companies have asked their employees to take compulsory unpaid leave, while others have introduced mandatory pay cuts. Eleman said he wants to help his tenants because he has stayed with them for a long time and knows their challenges. "Everybody is worried about this pandemic that is ravaging countries, including the superpowers. Following the government directives, my tenants are staying at home for their safety, which makes it hard for them to earn," he said. He has waved April rent and the tenants will only be required to pay next month's rent if the situation allows. Eleman said his rental house at Kampi Mpya, Kanamkemer ward of Turkana Central constituency comprises 20 compartments. Each earns him an income of Sh5,000 per month. "Money is not everything. All we want is safety for people and put a smile on their faces during difficult times. I will lose close to Sh100,000 but at least I would have helped my tenants to be comfortable when they stay at home, " Eleman said. He has urged other landlords who are willing to waive rents for their tenants to do so. David Egule, a tenant, welcomed the decision, saying he would have struggled to pay his rent. “I was worried when government directed that we stay home for our safety. At least the landlord has reduced the burden of rent and the only problem now is food,” Egule said. He has urged the government to provide food to those staying at home. Edited by Peter Obuya
