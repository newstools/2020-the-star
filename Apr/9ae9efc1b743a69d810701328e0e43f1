The administrator of the estate of a man who died nine years before he had paid a Sh1,696 debt has been ordered to include the creditor to the estate. Kanyoike Kiboo borrowed the money over 30 years ago from Peter Mumbwa. Now son John Kiboo, the sole heir, will have to pay the money plus accrued interest, Justice Lydia Achode ruled and directed him to include Mumbwa as a creditor. Kanyoike died intestate on August 15, 2011. He had, among other properties, two parcels of land in Kiganjo, which his son inherited. Judge Achode cited a 1990 Kiambu court decree relied on by Mumbwa showing that Kiboo died before he had paid the debt. “Ever since the administrator was appointed in 2017 to determine the assets and liabilities of the estate, no action has been taken towards the payment of the debt,” the judge noted. John had argued that he needed more time to establish the assets and liabilities of the estate before any orders of refund can be made. However, the court ruled that once he was notified of the existence of a liability by the creditor, it was mandatory to include the liability in the petition. “The upshot of the foregoing is that the administrator of the estate is granted 30 days within which to file fresh summons for confirmation of grant and to include the protestor as a creditor to the estate,” Achode said. The letters of the estate were issued to John on September 14, 2017. He thereafter filed summons for confirmation of grant and proposed that all his father's properties be distributed to him as the only remaining beneficiary. However, on December 13, 2017, Mumbwa filed an affidavit of protest and claimed he is a creditor entitled to compensation pursuant to the Kiambu court judgment.  It was his case that the deceased owed him a refund of Sh1,696. He had asked the court to include him as a beneficiary. John did not dispute the existence of the judgment but denied knowledge of accrued interest. He proposed to settle the debt in instalments. - mwaniki fm
