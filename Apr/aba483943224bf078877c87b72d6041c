The government is expected to develop a home-based nursing protocol for Covid-19 patients, Health Director General Dr Patrick Amoth has said. In a televised address on Wednesday, Amoth said the government is seeking to treat mild cases at home rather than in isolation centres. "The home-based care protocol will be launched soon, we are validating it in the next 24 hours so that sociologists do an assessment on how suitable the home is," he said. "From our statistics, the majority of our cases have been mild." The DG said once it is completed, the government will bring counties up to speed for the management of mild cases at home. Amoth said the government is looking at deploying testing on the 14th or 15th day for those in quarantine. Those who test negative will be allowed to go home. "Those who test positive will go to isolation centres. For those in isolation, a negative case is one where two tests within 48 hours are negative," he said. During the briefing, the Health Ministry announced seven more confirmed cases of the coronavirus in Kenya, raising the country's total to 179. CAS Mercy Mwangangi said all the new patients are Kenyans. Five of these are from Nairobi, one from Mombasa and one from Uasin Gishu counties. Two of these cases emanated from the quarantine facilities while five were tracked down by the surveillance teams. 49 out of the 179 cases reported so far are aged between 16 and 29 years. Mwangangi also announced two more patients have been discharged after two more cases tested negative. This now brings to nine the total number of recoveries in the country. The CAS said all private testing facilities are required to share their results with the Ministry of Health for monitoring purposes.
