Kenya Basketball Federation (KBF) want to use this period of inactivity to sort out players cards and transfer issues once and for all. KBF first vice-chairman, Hilmi Ali yesterday said the executive has agreed on the issue and want it sorted once and for all. “We want to start early preparations this time,” said Ali adding: “We have agreed that all team managers should present players list and soft copy of passport size photos.” He said the league delay has given the federation the best opportunity to fix the problem before the season starts. “We have the time before the league starts. I proposed this exercise three years back but it has never been implemented,” said Ali. The other issue is the streamlining of the transfer of players from one team to the other. “This also has never been smooth and need to be sorted,” he added. He said it is important to document the movement of all players before the league start and ensure the transfer fee is duly paid before allowing them to play. Ali wants the transfer fee increased to ensure teams that lose players benefit from the money paid by the gaining clubs. In a related development, KBF fixtures secretary Joseph Amoko said the fixtures will have to be revised once it is safe to play. He had released the games scheduled for both the premier and the lower division league, running up to the end of July before activities were halted. “I am just waiting for the situation to change,” he said, “Once it is announced that it is safe and we can start our activities, I will do the necessary changes.” The league was to tip-off March 21.
