A Chinese construction company has donated masks, sanitiser and soap to residents of Lodwar to prevent the spread of Covid-19. The China Railway No.5 Engineering Group Co Ltd is upgrading the Lochangamatak-Lodwar Road that links Lodwar to Juba in South Sudan. Project manager Tian Ming said they have supplied the coronavirus protective products as part of corporate social responsibility. “The firm has donated 1,100 face masks, several cartons of soaps and 10 litres of sanitisers to Lodwar residents and the county government offices. The products will boost efforts to curb the spread of Covid-19 in the region," he said Of the 1,100 masks, 700 were issued to the essential county government workers while 400 were given to needy residents. “We are happy that people in Lodwar and Kanamkamer have embraced hand-washing. We have decided to use our little resources to join the rest of the world in this fight,” Tian said. Lodwar Town resident James Lopeyok thanked the company for donating the protective products. "I now have a mask, sanitiser and soap. The products given are not enough but at least I will spend my money on food and other commodities as we wait for more help from the government,” he said. Lodwar Township MCA Robert Lowoko urged the residents to adhere to the government's directives to stop the spread of the virus. “Turkana is at a higher risk for the infection of the virus because there are many visitors working in NGOs sector as well as refugees in Kakuma and there is need for residents to strictly adhere to Covid-19 preventive measures,” he said.
