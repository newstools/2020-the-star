Nairobi MCAs have proposed centralised relief intervention for families in slums rendered vulnerable by coronavirus. Minority whip Peter Imwatok urged the national government to provide a platform where all aid related to Covid-19 can be channelled. This would avoid risking the lives of residents especially within the slums who might scramble for relief food and masks from opportunists. “The suggested platform will be prudent for the equal distribution of food. We need to move away from how people line up to receive relief food and having crowds scramble for food,” Imwatok said on Wednesday. He noted that many politicians become opportunists and use such moments to popularise themselves instead of helping the less fortunate in society. "The crisis we have in terms of the Covid-19, as Nairobi we should be prepared for anything. Having such platforms in an organised manner with reliable state officers in control would be best," Imwatok said. Assembly Speaker Beatrice Elachi on Tuesday urged the national government to take up measures in slums to curb the spread of coronavirus. Distribution of sufficient food, water, preventative products and boosting security would help fight Covid-19, Elachi said. She recommended the introduction of a relief food card that could be used to distribute supplies. “The food card will ensure no one is left out and that every family will get food. When the state comes to give a household food they will be given the card which will be used as evidence to avoid insufficient distribution of food," she said. The speaker said water distribution should be keenly monitored for people to observe proper hygiene to prevent the spread of Covid-19. She proposed numerous water points should be set up across the slums. Speaker Elachi said police officers should be deployed in the slums to ensure the businesses taking place are lawful.
