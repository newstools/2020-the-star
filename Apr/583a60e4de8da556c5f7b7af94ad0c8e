The Turkana county assembly has approved Sh667 million to fight against the coronavirus. Speaker Erastus Lokaale said the money will be allocated to the ministries of water, health, and public service and disaster management. He said the ministry of public service and disaster management would receive Sh441 million to provide relief food to vulnerable people. “We made this decision because the majority of our people are poor so we needed to cushion them during this crisis,” Lokaale said. The ministry of health was allocated Sh159 million while the ministry of water was allocated Sh67 million. "The Ministry of Health needs funds to procure face masks, sanitisers, ventilators, personal protective equipment and to renovate the ICU facility," he said. The Water department, he said, has been allocated funds to boost supply, fix broken boreholes and contract people to truck water. Lokaale said he has forwarded the Appropriations Bill to the governor for assent. To ensure accountability, the county assembly of Turkana has formed a Committee to oversight the utilisation of funds to address the Covid-19 pandemic. "In times of crisis, the oversight role has to continue to avoid funny things, and misappropriation of public funds," he said. Members of the committee include deputy speaker Mike Ewoi, leader of majority Bethwel Kobongin, leader of minority Benedict Lokamar and Katilu MCA James Abei. Turkana Governor Josphat Nanok last week said his government has come up with a raft of measures to protect the most affected by the coronavirus crisis. Edited A.N
