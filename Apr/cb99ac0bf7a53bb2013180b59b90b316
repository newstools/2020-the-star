Gospel singer Pastor Antony Musembi has been sued by Zimbabwean music icon Oliver Mtukudzi's management over copyright infringement of his hit song ‘Todii’. Musembi ignited a storm on social media over the weekend following the release of his corona awareness song, which borrows most of its elements from Mtukudzi’s song. Tuku Music manager Walter Wanyanya said they have engaged Musembi over the development and are pursuing the matter through legal channels. 'Todii', which was originally themed around HIV and Aids, now carries a corona message. In a statement, Wanyanya said they were notified about the cover version of the song 'Todii' on April 19, and after watching it, they reached out to Musembi on Facebook. Wanyanya said although Musembi did not seek rights and permission to use the song, “he has shown willingness to rectify the mistake” and they would work together to ensure that was done. “We believe his version of the song will complement efforts to flatten the curve in the fight against corona in Kenya and Africa,” he said. Wanyanya said Tuku played a pivotal role in raising awareness about various health issues and would have done the same in light of corona. He said the cover would help raise awareness in Kenya and other parts of Africa and artistes needed to play their role in helping to flatten the corona curve and save lives. According to copyright law, all airplay royalties will go directly to Tuku music. Tuku died last year after a long battle with diabetes.
