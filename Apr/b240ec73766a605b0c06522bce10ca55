President Uhuru Kenyatta has urged Kenyans living close to water bodies to move to higher grounds in the wake of heavy rains currently being experienced in the country.` At least 20 people have been killed after the country witnessed landslides in the past few days in areas such as West Pokot and Elgeyo Marakwet counties. Speaking on Wednesday during a radio interview at State House, Uhuru said that people leaving in areas like Masinga, Kitui, Tana River counties should move away from water bodies after having already been warned. "We must be ready because we don't know which other damage we can have because of the heavy rains. We've told people to move away from areas that are close to water bodies," he said. Uhuru urged journalists and county commissioners to make sure that Kenyans are well informed of the potential danger. "We hope Kenyans will take this early warning because we don't want to lose lives. Let us go to safe areas," Uhuru said. The President said the government is currently aiding those affected by the landslides. "We sent the army and police officers in West Pokot and they are still there, providing food and other equipment. They are working with West Pokot and Elgeyo Marakwet Governors because it affected both counties." Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen appealed for government interventions in locating displaced persons following the Sigor landslide. The landslide occurred last weekend in Kerio Valley affecting residents in West Pokot county and Marakwet East constituency. The aftermath of the landslide left a trail of death with over 20 persons including four police officers confirmed dead and over 15 persons missing. "I wish to commend the government for the quick efforts undertaken to manage the current situation. However, little or no effort has been made to account for the over 15 persons missing as a result of the landslide," he said.
