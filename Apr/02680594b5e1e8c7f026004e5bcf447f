Vihiga county commissioner Ochillo Oyugi has warned matatu operators against hiking fares because of the government policies to contain the coronavirus. Oyugi said the pandemic has affected all people countrywide and there is no need to harass commuters. “We are going to arrest all those who are taking advantage of the situation to siphon money from commuters,” Oyugi said. He said it is a government policy for public service vehicles to carry half their capacity to avoid crowding, and there is no need to pass on the losses to commuters. But matatu operators have said the state has not reduced the price of fuel and scrapped other levies to cushion the transport sector. “We have no problem carrying fewer passengers, but fuel is still costly. Matatu owners need their income and we also have to eat,” Western sacco conductor Jossiah Inonda said. Inonda said the state should understand that the sector is hurting and reduce petroleum prices so that commuters do not have to pay double the price to cater for the empty seats. The county commissioner said most Vihiga residents have complied with the 7pm-5am curfew. “Since we started enforcing the curfew, only 29 people have been arrested for not obeying the state orders. Insecurity has reduced,” Oyugi said. He said most criminals cannot continue with their activities due to the curfew. They are not able to meet and strategise within social halls and pubs that are currently on shutdown, he said. The administrator urged the residents to embrace farming as it might be the last option to produce food in case the Covid-19 epidemic prolongs. Farmers should prioritise crops that mature faster to curb food shortage, he said. “Food supply zones will remain operative to ensure there is food circulation within our markets‚” Oyugi said.
