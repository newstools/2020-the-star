The performance of agriculture decreased from 6.1 per cent in 2018 to 3.6 per cent last year, the latest survey has shown. The Economic Survey 2020, which was released on Tuesday, shows that the extreme weather characterised by drought during the first half of the year, followed by high rainfall in the second half of the year culminated in reduced production of selected crops. “Maize production declined from 44.6 million bags in 2018 to 39.8 million bags in 2019 largely attributed to drought in several areas coupled with the fall armyworm infestation,” the survey shows. It states that tea production also decreased by 6.9 per cent to 458.5 thousand tonnes in 2019 from 493.0 thousand tonnes in 2018. Cane deliveries to factories declined from 5.3 million tonnes in 2018 to 4.6 million tonnes last year. However, the volume of horticultural exports increased by 1.8 per cent from 322.6 thousand tonnes in 2018 to 328.3 thousand tonnes in 2019. Further, the survey shows, the quantities of milk deliveries made to dairy processors increased by 5.3 per cent from 634.3 million litres in 2018 to 668.2 million litres last year. Milk prices per 100 litres decreased by 15 per cent from Sh3,530 in 2018 to Sh3,000 last year. According to the survey, earnings from sugarcane decreased by 16.6 per cent from Sh21 billion in 2018 to Sh17.6 billion in 2019, while pyrethrum earnings increased by 49.2 per cent from Sh26.2 million in 2018 to Sh39.1 million. “During the year under review, coffee earnings decreased by 31.5 per cent from Sh14.8 billion Sh10.2 billion, mainly attributable to excess production of coffee globally, especially in Brazil, which led to reduced average prices.” The survey shows that the value of marketed maize increased by seven per cent to Sh10.7 billion, while that of wheat increased by 13.9 per cent to Sh13.4 billion. It also shows that the value of marketed fresh horticultural produce declined by 5.9 per cent from Sh153.7 billion in 2018 to Sh144.6 billion in 2019. This was mainly as a result of an eight per cent contraction of the value of cut flowers from Sh113.2 billion in 2018 to Sh104.1 billion in 2019. The survey shows that the value of vegetables decreased by 1.6 per cent to Sh27.2 billion. However, during the review period, the value of fruits increased by 2.8 per cent from Sh12.8 billion to Sh13.2 billion. The survey shows that the earnings from sugarcane decreased by 16.2 per cent from Sh21.0 billion in 2018 to Sh17.6 billion last year. Pyrethrum earnings increased by 49.2 per cent from Sh26.2 million in 2018 to Sh39.1 million in 2019. Likewise, earnings from tea reduced by 18.5 per cent from Sh127.7 billion in 2018 to Sh104.1 billion in 2019, on account of reduced export prices following a higher production of tea globally. The survey shows that earnings from sisal increased by 15.4 per cent to Sh4.4 billion in 2019. During the review period, the value of marketed milk decreased by 11.7 per cent from Sh22.7 billion in 2018 to Sh20 billion in 2019. Last year, prices paid to farmers for coffee and tea decreased by 25 per cent and 12.4 per cent to Sh30,227.22 and Sh22,681.04 per 100 kilogrammes, respectively. Similarly, the price paid to farmers for sugarcane decreased by 4.3 per cent to Sh3,816.0 per tonne, in 2019. The decline was partly attributable to stiff competition from cheap sugar imports accumulated from 2017. The price paid for maize last year increased by 49.1 per cent to Sh3,372.59 per 100 kilogrammes, while the price of seed cotton increased by 13 per cent to Sh5,200. Increases were also recorded in prices paid to farmers for wheat, sisal, beef meat (third grade) and pork. The total value of inputs purchased increased from Sh62.4 billion in 2018 to Sh63.9 billion in 2019. The value of fertiliser purchased increased by five per cent to Sh15.7 billion last year. The power consumed in the sector increased by 2.7 per cent from Sh16.4 billion in 2018 to Sh16.8 billion last year. Further, the value of purchased manufactured feeds and certified seeds stood at Sh7.7 billion and Sh4.2 billion, respectively. Edited by R.Wamochie
