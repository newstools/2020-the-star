A three-judge bench has upheld a life imprisonment sentence handed over to a man convicted of defiling two of his nieces. It was the second time that the man had appealed against the sentence handed over to him on July 20, 2013. The man (name withheld to protect the girls) will now serve life imprisonment for defiling his eight and six-year-old nieces in February 2012. The convict also infected the minors with sexually transmitted diseases. The defiler was convicted after a hearing that lasted two years but he appealed, arguing that the High Court erred by sentencing him to life imprisonment since he was a minor. He said he should have been been sentenced under the Children’s Act. He maintained that during plea taking, he had informed the trial court that he was 15 years old and that he was in primary school. However, a probation report tabled in court indicated that he was born in 1992 and was therefore 19 years in 2012 when the offences were committed. It said he attended Kyamalutu Primary School up to Standard 5 where he dropped out due to poor performance and truancy. The court was convinced that the accused was an adult and that he was not a first offender. The accused further argued that the charge sheet was defective as he should have been charged with incest in line with the prosecution’s case that the complainants were his nieces. Justices William Ouko, Wanjiru Karanja and Fatuma Sichale said the appeal was bereft of merit and was dismissed it.
