Shiru ward MCA Nixion Buyite has urged the Vihiga county assembly to re-allocate funds meant for the speaker’s residence to the fight against Covid-19. He said funds for the Moses Mudamba Cultural Centre should also be redirected. Buyite made the proposal during a special sitting to approve the Sh7 billion supplementary budget. Some Sh28.5 million has been set aside to combat Covid-19. “This is a delicate matter that we need to discuss wisely for the sake of our people. The funds allocated to the speaker’s residence should be transferred to the fight of covid-19," Butiye said. The cultural centre is not yet operational due to land issues. “We need more funds for Covid-19 control because we have no water points and sanitiser in the markets. However, we appreciate the chairman for his goodwill and support towards the fight against Covid-19,” Butiye said. His sentiments were echoed by Emabungo ward MCA Moses Opole and Victor Ijaika of Lugaga Wamuluma ward. “We need to put measures in place to protect our people at any cost during this pandemic. Madam Speaker, once we have these funds, we will be able to provide all emergency services," Butiye said The Budget committee chairman told the House that coronavirus is an emergency and should be taken seriously. “That being the case Madam Speaker, all departments were requested to contribute to our emergency kitty so that we are able to curb Covid-19 spread. All departments contributed at least Sh1 million and others went ahead to contribute even more, that is why we have a total of Sh13.5 million,” Budget committee chairman Patrick Akhwale told the House. Some Sh5 million was slashed from the governor’s travel and sustenance allowance and channelled to the control of Covid-19. The Sh20 million for the Ottichillo Care Programme was reduced to Sh10 million. Edited by Frank Obonyo
