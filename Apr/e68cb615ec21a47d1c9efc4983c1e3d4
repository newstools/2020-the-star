The package also included 100,000 free face masks and other basic needs targeting children's homes and elderly caregivers in Nairobi slums. Speaking during the event, Hindu Council of Kenya chairperson Kamal Cupta said, "We are giving face masks and other basic needs to the vulnerable in the society, especially the ones living in slums, to ensure families stay at home to control the spread of coronavirus."
