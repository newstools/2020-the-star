The Kenya National Convention Bureau (KNCB) will today host a virtual interactive session to discuss the country’s future prospects in Meetings, Incentives, Conferences and Exhibitions (MICE). The bureau, which is tasked with marketing the country as a MICE destination, will interact with industry players involved with venues, accommodation, meeting planners, event managers, professional conference organizers and service providers. It has partnered with Züri Events to bring together industry players in discussing challenges, and forge a way forward for the tourism sub-sector, which has equally been hit by the global coronavirus pandemic. The forum is themed: “We Will Meet Again”. “We just want to host a brainstorming session on status and preparedness for future meetings on this day, when all global industry leaders are celebrating the Annual Global Meetings Industry Day,” said Jacinta Nzioka, National Co-ordinator for the Bureau. The global meetings industry day this year is virtual and the organisers–Meeting Professionals International's (MPI) and Professional Convention Management Association(PCMA) are encouraging players to converse on future solutions post Covid19. “KNCB is calling upon meetings industry players to participate and share ideas and generate traction for @MeetInKenya,” Nzioka said. Tourism CS Najib Balala is counting on the bureau to attract more conferences into the country, with MICE being a critical segment in tourism earnings. It contributed 13.5 per cent of total 2,048,834 international arrivals in 2019, Tourism Research Institute data shows, where at least 276,592 visitors were here for meetings and business. earnings from tourism last year grew 3.9 per cent to Sh163.56 billion.
