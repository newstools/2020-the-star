The Kisumu county main bus terminus has been closed to enforce the social distancing directive aimed at stopping the spread of coronavirus. The main entrance to the terminus was barricaded on Tuesday night. A massive cleanup and fumigation of the terminus have been ongoing in the last week. The exercise was spearheaded by the city management, Kibos Sugar Company and bus park users. The city management is also undertaking a renovation of the drainage system within the terminus including the fish market. On Monday, county commissioner Susan Waweru said enforcing social distancing was still a challenge because residents were not taking it seriously. “Crowding is a problem and this is one of the main reason we decided that the bus terminus will not operate amongst other internal issues,” Waweru said. She appealed for attitudinal change because of how serious the outbreak is. Before the closure, the county government had sought to decongest the terminus. Governor Anyang' Nyong’o  directed that matatus and buses from Kisii, Migori, Homa Bay, Kericho, Chemelil and Muhoroni would offload passengers at the Mowlem terminus. Nairobi matatus would use the bus park. But the move did not work after youths engaged in a fistfight over control of the new bus park. (edited by o. owino)
