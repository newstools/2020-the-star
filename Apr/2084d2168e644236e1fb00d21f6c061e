Kenya Rugby Union will be among the beneficiaries of a Sh10 billion World Rugby COVID-19 relief strategy aimed at supporting the global game and mitigating the overall impact of the pandemic on the sport. The exact amount the country will receive from the world governing body will be known in the next fortnight. In  a press statement, World Rugby said: “The relief fund will be available for unions requiring immediate emergency funding subject to appropriate criteria being met. It is designed to assist the maximum number of unions for the maximum amount of time while there is a rugby void.” It added: “This includes likely short-term reshaping of the international rugby calendar, optimising competition opportunities for unions and domestic leagues. As a prudent precaution, further scenario planning factors in a competition environment where cross-hemisphere travel might not be possible and, in the worst-case scenario, where no international rugby is possible this year.” “Central to the contingency planning is player welfare and all potential scenarios have involved International Rugby Players input and recognised the need for adequate player preparation and rest.” World Rugby Chairman Sir Bill Beaumont said: “Global sport is facing a crisis never seen before and at this most challenging time we are taking unprecedented action as a sport united to support global rugby, its unions, competitions and players through the enormous challenge presented by the COVID-19 pandemic.” KRU has already  terminated contracts with the Kenya Sevens players and has postponed the Africa Under 20 Championship while the Kenya Lionesses were due to host Colombia in a Rugby World Cup qualifier. Both events were set for this month.
