A man collapsed and died outside the Co-Operative Bank in Mwingi on Sunday. Justus Kavindu, 55, was with his daughter Teresia Kavindu when he started complaining of chest pains and difficulties in breathing. Teresia said they were walking towards the Garissa bus terminus with her father when he suddenly lay down in pain and died. He had no visible physical injuries. Joyce Mwende, a witness said he saw Kavindu and Teresia coming from the country bus station as they talked. Mwende said upon reaching the Garissa stage Kavindu fell down. She took Teresia's phone and rang her mother to inform her of what had happened. The daughter was too shocked to do anything. “The man’s wife was very shaken as she said her husband was not sick at all,” Mwende said. She said she asked the wife is the husband was epileptic but was told he was not. “The wife, who could hardly believe what had happened to her husband said Kavindu was healthy before leaving their house for a stroll with their 30-year-old daughter,” Mwende said. Joseph Mutua, a fruit vendor at the Garissa stage bus stop also saw Kavindu slump and fall. He rushed to ascertain what had transpired but found the man had died. “I rushed at the scene hoping to offer first aid to the man but he died soon after collapsing,” Mutua said. He contacted the police to report the matter. The sudden death has created unease among Mwingi residents as they think that the man had contracted the coronavirus. Difficulty in breathing is one of the symptoms of Covid-19. Others include high fever and dry cough. Mwingi OCS and officers from the DCI visited the scene and took the body to Mwingi Level 4 Hospital mortuary for postmortem. Subcounty police boss Peter Mutuma said that an autopsy will reveal what else could have contributed to the sudden death of the man.  (edited by o. owino)
