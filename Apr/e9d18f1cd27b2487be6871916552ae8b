Harambee Starlets’ forward Mwanahalima ‘Dogo’ Adam plans to undergo trials at Swedish side Djugardens once the sporting activities resume worldwide, Thika Queens’ chairman Fredrick Chege has said. Adam was expected to leave the country on March 10 but the coronavirus pandemic distorted her plans. Initially, there was a problem with the player’s documentation as reported in February but everything seems alright as Chege said the move will be subject to a return to normalcy in sporting circles. “Mwanahalima is eager to head overseas. She could be in her new surroundings now but the current catastrophe proved a stumbling block. Djurgarden is in constant contact with Mwanahalima’s agent and promised to seal the deal immediately sports resume. Dogo is a big player and always ready for new challenges and we expect her to excel in her trials,” Chege said. Mwanahalima was the 2016 Sports Personality of the Year Award (SOYA) most promising girl. She has been playing for Thika Queens and her exemplary performance with the national team during the Olympic qualifiers as well as Cecafa tournament did not go unnoticed. Mwanahalima’s deal with the Stockholm side will make her the sixth Kenyan woman player to land pro status should her deal go through. Former Eldoret Falcons duo of goalkeeper Annette Kundu and defender Ruth Ingosi signed three-year deals with Cyprus side FC Lakatamia while Corazon Aquino of Gaspo landed a deal with Portuguese top tier side, Atletico Aurience. Esse Akida, formerly of Thika Queens is with Turkish Giants Besiktas while Vihiga Queens’ midfielder Cynthia Shilwatso is attached to FC Longrono of Spain.
