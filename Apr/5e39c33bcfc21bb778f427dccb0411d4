A city MCA has called for a waiver for all county tenants paying less than Sh5,000 rent. The economy has taken a hit as a result of measures put in place in Kenya and globally to stem the spread of the coronavirus. As of April 1, Kenya had confirmed 81 cases of Covid-19, with one death and three recoveries. Globally, the number of confirmed infections is nearly a million. Besides big businesses and SMEs, the measures have had a direct impact on low-income earners, manual labourers and the self-employed. Minority whip Peter Imwatok said it is this group of vulnerable people who pay a monthly rent of up to Sh5,000, and they need to be protected. In a letter to Nairobi Metropolitan Service director-general Mohammed Badi, Imwatok proposes waiving rent for the next three months for tenants in Makongeni, Kaloleni, Jericho, Bahati, Mbotela, Shauri Moyo, Maringo and Ngara estates. “This group of residents is currently unable to provide for their daily meals and at the same time pay monthly rent,” Imwatok says. “To this end, it is my humble request to you that you waive payment of rent by all county government tenants whose monthly rent amounts to Sh5,000 and below, most of whom are low-income earners, for the next three months to cushion them from the adverse effects of the Covid-19 pandemic.” Housing is one of the county functions transferred to the national government three weeks ago and falls under the purview of the Nairobi Metropolitan Service. On Wednesday, the Landlords and Tenants Association of Kenya (Latak) urged landlords to waive rent for the next three months. The association also wants the government to help landlords servicing loans to get a six-month moratorium from commercial banks. “Mr President, on a credible mediation process, start with writing off rent for three months with no threats, notices, locking houses, disconnection of water/electricity and eviction by auctioneers,” said Latak.
