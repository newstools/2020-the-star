Governors in the North Rift have opted for door-to-door public awareness, mobilisation and campaigns to curb the spread of Covid-19. The counties, under North Rift Economic Bloc (Noreb), have identified gaps which hinder success in enforcement of the Covid-19 control measures. They have deployed more than 8,000 community health workers to sensitise residents on how to prevent the spread and the importance of complying with government directives. Uasin Gishu Health executive Evelyne Rotich said they have deployed 100 health workers to educate 300 households daily to help them comply with the control measures. “We target to have more than 3,000 households sensitised in the next one week,” she said. County commissioners have also directed chiefs to educate the public on the measures. Rotich said health workers will educate residents on regular handwashing, social distancing and use of masks. Rivatex in Eldoret is currently producing 30,000 masks daily Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital CEO Dr Wilson Aruasa said social distancing remains the main challenge in Kenya. “We have to keep on emphasising the need for our people to take seriously all the measures that have been put in place by the government,” he said. Elgeyo Marakwet county is threatening to shut down all businesses, including supermarkets, which have failed to comply with government measures outlined to help control the spread of the coronavirus. Health executive Kiprono Chepkok said they may also be forced to ban boda boda operations in the region also due to non-compliance. Chepkok said businesses that are not providing water or hand sanitiser will be closed. “We continue to sensitise our people using all possible means, including deploying community health workers so that everyone gets the relevant information that will enable them to keep safe,” the official said.
