The country has enough food to last till June, a food security report shows. The report released by the Ministry of Agriculture this week shows that by the end of May the available maize stock will be 18.7 million bags. According to the National Food Balance Sheet, there will be a surplus of 3.5 million bags by June 30, 2020. The report indicated that the stock of maize as of​ March 31, 2020, was 18.6 million 90kg bags and the private sector and relief agencies are expected to import an estimated 50,000 bags. This will bring the total to 18,702,100 by end of May. The report further indicated that post-harvest storage losses are estimated at 10 per cent, equivalent to 1,870,210 bags. Another 220,000 bags will be used to manufacture livestock feeds, 187,021 bags will be retained as seed, and 224,000 bags will be used for the manufacture of other products. “This means the net available stocks by May 31 will be 16,200,869 bags. The national monthly consumption is at 4.25 million bags. So about 12,750,000 bags of maize will be used to feed the nation for three months until the next harvest starts getting in. This means by June, the country will have a surplus of 3.5 million bags,” the report said. Agriculture CS Peter Munya has urged farmers to intensify production in preparation for the coming days in what promises to be a protracted global crisis due to the Covid-19 pandemic. In a statement, Munya said with the long rains, farmers can continue to purchase and access DAP and NPK fertilisers at subsidised rates of Sh2,300 per 50kg bag from the Kenya National Trading Cooperation depots across the country in Nairobi, Nakuru, Eldoret, Kitale, Kisumu, Karatina, Meru, Kapsabet, Wote and Machakos counties. “Coffee farmers can also access organic hyper phosphate fertiliser from the same stores,” he said.
