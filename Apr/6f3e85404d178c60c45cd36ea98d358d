Sports Cabinet Secretary Ambassador Amina Mohamed has revealed her desire for a local solution to end the impasse in the management of football in the country. This is after the Sports Disputes Tribunal ended the term of the Football Kenya Federation (FKF) National Executive but Fifa reversed that order much to the consternation of some stakeholders. Speaking on a local television sports show on NTV, Amina said she was in talks with FKF and was equally awaiting official communication from Fifa on their recent letter to the federation that proposed a meeting between stakeholders to seek a lasting solution to the leadership crisis in football. “ It would be my wish for us as a country to find solutions internally rather than wait for intervention from outside. I am in talks with FKF as we all hope that we can find a solution so that our footballers can go on in using their talent gainfully without interruption. I am yet to receive communication from Fifa about their decision on the SDT ruling. But we have the Sports Act which guides us on how to deal with legal matters. It’s the federation and not the government which went to court and so it’s only advisable that everyone respects the outcome,” Amina said. The Cabinet Secretary also maintained her stance that the government will not pay dues awarded to former Harambee Stars Coach Adel Amrouche by the Court of Arbitration for Sports over breach of contract. Amina insisted that it’s up to FKF to seek out Amrouche and agree on a payment formula that will spare Kenya a ban from Fifa.
