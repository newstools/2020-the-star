"Make no mistake, we are at war and we must be together if we shall win this war." "There is a choice that we are asked to make. Do we carry out as normal or carry it as an emergency and fundamentally change the way we act," he said. "We are being called upon by our children to show the greatness in us by how we respond to this virus." Uhuru said the wearing of masks and washing will save lives adding that Kenyans must stick to measures to curb the spread. "We must avoid all areas and comply with government directives and we must be careful," he said.

There will be thousands of tailors who will make these masks," he said. He said these tailors will be provided with the proper communication of what is required.
