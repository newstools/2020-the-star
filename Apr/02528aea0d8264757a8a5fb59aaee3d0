The Nyandarua county assembly has put in place measures to guide the House operations as the country battles Covid-19. In a communication from the chair on Tuesday, speaker Wahome Ndegwa called cooperation and collaboration to help the country defeat the pandemic. In line with the new guidelines, plenary sittings shall be held in the assembly chamber starting 9.30am and end not later than 4.30pm. This is to allow members and staff to be home before the 7pm curfew. To ensure social distancing, chamber sittings have been limited to the speaker, 13 members and one clerk at any one time. The Nyandarua assembly has 39 MCAs - 25 elected and 14 nominated. Ndegwa said members may coordinate and swap places to allow room for debate so long as the chamber capacity does not surpass the said number. The speaker’s gallery and the public gallery shall not be occupied by any person except the technical staff facilitating the sitting. The speaker said it shall be out of order for a member to approach the speaker’s chair or the clerk’s table for any purpose. In accordance with the Ministry of Health’s advisory, members aged 58 and above, those with chronic illnesses, expectant and lactating women are encouraged to work from home. Edited by A.N
