Council of Governors chairperson, Wycliffe Oparanya has disputed claims of lack of preparedness on the part of county governments towards the fight against Covid-19. Oparanya said that county governments continue to make strides to fight the virus despite the daily challenges they face. The governor on Wednesday said a total of 3, 156 isolation beds are ready for use in all the 47 counties. The beds which have been prepared in collaboration with other government agencies have been distributed in different facilities including KMTCs and universities with cubicles. “Counties have also made progress towards procuring more ICU beds hence increasing the capacity from 162 to 208 and increased ventilators from the previous 161 to 201,’ Oparanya said in a statement. He said, in order to increase the capacity of health workers, counties have invested in training more than 9701 workers at both the county and sub-county level. Additionally, Oparanya noted that counties have also made progress in terms of funding and budget. "Through the supplementary budgets, county governments have committed an estimated total of Sh5 billion in the county governments Emergency Fund to respond to Covid-19," he added. "I assure you that county governments will make good use of the supplies to minimise the risk of infection among citizens in their jurisdiction". However, the chairman acknowledged the challenge in the procurement of medical supplies due to the monopoly of KEMSA. He urged the government to allow counties to procure essential medical supplies from other suppliers. On Tuesday, some governors said there are only two laboratories at the national level with their corresponding branches carrying out tests, which poses a great risk to the country since most counties have active cases.
