Mombasa County will from next Wednesday begin mass testing for its residents for the coronavirus. It will also be compulsory for residents to wear face masks in public places. This was announced on Thursday by Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho and county commissioner Gilbert Kitiyo. Kitiyo said the directive will be effected once masks are distributed to residents free of charge to all residents. "EPZs in Mombasa have donated a million masks," Kitiyo said. Joho said the mass testing will commence once all necessary equipment needed is acquired. "We will by then have the capacity to test about 600 people a day," Joho said. The two spoke after receiving 10 ventilators worth Sh60 million from friends both locally and internationally. Eight more ventilators are expected to arrive in the county in the next week. Coast General Hospital CEO Iqbal Khandwala said the 18 will add to the 12 ventilators that the county already has. Khandwala said the Coast General Hospital (CGH) will be able to take care of 50 critical Covid-19 patients should the need arise. Currently, there are six patients in isolation at the CGH. Joho also warned private hospitals against turning away patients for fear of escalating bills. "Don't refuse to use ventilators because of bills," he said. The governor said they had received reports of a patient who may have died from the coronavirus. Joho said they shall be asking national government through the DPP to prosecute private hospitals who are going against instructions and directives from the government. "Be careful, we are carefully watching your steps," said Joho.
