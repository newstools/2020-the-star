Kakamega county government will be firmly on the ground to ensure the construction of Phase Two of the Bukhungu Stadium is up to the required standards. County Executive Committee Member in charge of Culture and sports, Robert Makhanu Kundu, said his office will closely monitor the ongoing works at Bukhungu Stadium to ensure the facility is well handled and befits the international standards. This comes shortly after Governor Wycliffe Oparanya visited the site to commission Phase Two of the construction that is estimated to cost Sh.2.5billion. Phase Two is expected to be completed in the opening months of 2022. “This is a historic project for the current county government and I will try to play my part to the fullest to make sure the work is thorough," he said. “We ensured Phase 1 that cost Sh500m was well handled after working closely with the contractors and we successfully hosted Cecafa matches in 2017," he added. “We’ll ensure that this flagship project meets the standards to enable us to host international events,” he stated. During his visit to the Stadium, Kakamega governor Oparanya said the project was intended to grow sporting activities and talent among the youths. He assured football fans the construction of the stadium will be complete by the end of his term. The CECM said Phase Two includes completion of the perimeter wall, terraces, roof, washrooms and the offices. “My office will work with the contractor to ensure the legacy of Governor Oparanya has been realised through sports,”  he said. Bukhungu Stadium is targeting to 30,000 fans once it is done and is the home to Kenya Premier League side Kakamega Homeboyz.
