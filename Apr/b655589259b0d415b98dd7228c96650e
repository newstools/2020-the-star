The Kiambu government will from Monday allocate traders space at the new Limuru town market. Kiambu Governor James Nyoro, who opened the market on Friday, said the food market is supposed to accommodate 1,000 traders but due to the social distancing directive, only 600-700 will get space. Traders have been operating outside the market. "As the government embarks on reducing the spread of the coronavirus in the country, it has emphasised on social distancing, and we do not want to go against the instructions," he said. The governor instructed county askaris that no trader should operate on the streets. Though the governor did not say what will happen to those who will be locked out, his move was lauded by traders. Nyoro also urged Limuru Water and Sewerage Company to ensure there is constant water in the market to enhance hygiene. He appealed to Limuru deputy county commissioner Charles Mukele and subcounty police commander Joseph Ireri to help the county government officials arrange traders. "We do not want to put our people at risk. We do not want overcrowding of customers or traders," he said. Nyoro was accompanied by county executives Joseph Murega (Health) and David Kuria (Water and Environment) and market contractor Wanjiru Ndung'u, among other senior county officials. Cereals seller Richard Kimani said their stocks will never be at risk of being rained on again. "I have been operating here for more than 15 years and it has been an open-air market. We made roofs with polythene bags and nylon sacks. Now we are happy," he said. Nyoro said his government is planning to build markets in Bibirioni ward and another in Kwambira, Limuru Central ward.
