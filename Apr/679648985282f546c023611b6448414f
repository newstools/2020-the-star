 The Nyamira county government has identified five schools to be used as quarantine centres in case health facilities are overwhelmed by the coronavirus pandemic. Governor John Nyagarama said the schools include Sironga Girls, Kebabe Girls, Nyambaria Boys, Menyenya High and Riyabe Mixed. “We have set up forced quarantine rooms at the Kenya Medical Training College in Nyamira for suspected cases. Quarantine rooms have been set up in all the eight subcounty hospitals," Nyagarama said. “Renovation of a 17-bed isolation unit with five ICU beds at Nyamira County Hospital will be completed in two weeks." The county has identified a dispensary in each of the four subcounties to be used as isolation centres, Nyagarama said. The county chief, who was accompanied by health executive Douglas Bosire and county commissioner Amos Mariba, said he will take a 30 per cent. The money will be channelled to the Covid-19 response kitty. County executives will take a pay cut of 20 per cent, he said. “Directors will take a 10 per cent pay cut and I urge other cadres of staff to take voluntary pay cuts towards this noble cause." Sixty people who were in self-quarantine in the county have been released after they tested negative upon the completion of the mandatory 14 days in quarantine. Some 28 are still in quarantine. “We have intensified measures to prevent the spread of the virus into the county." Some of the measures taken include the closure of all open-air markets and mortuaries. “We bury our dead immediately to avoid overcrowding,” Nyagarama said. Enforcement and national government security officials, the governor added, are enforcing the measures and ensuring strict compliance. He said Community Health Volunteers have been trained to sensitise residents on coronavirus symptoms and preventive measures. “We have trained 1,000 health workers on case definition, screening, specimen collection and infection control,” he added.
