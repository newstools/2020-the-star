Trained but jobless nurses in Machakos have urged the Public Service Commission and the Ministry of Health to give them a chance to serve and help fight the coronavirus. Through their Union of Graduate Nurses,Â they said they have been discriminating against when it comes to employment. They are degree holders. "We have been neglected by the Ministry of Health," Secretary general Hassan Ojwang said on Thursday. He said there is an increased demand for healthcare workers and they are ready to serve. "The most affected human resource needed for this intervention are nurses. However, there is a general disappointment from the licensed degree nurses in Kenya. We have been sidelined and discriminated against during employment both at national and county levels of government," Ojwang said. He said the Public Service Commission had announced job vacancies for nurses and the application deadline was April 16, 2020. Ojwang said no vacancy for degree nurses was offered. Priority was given to the other cadres - diploma and certificate holders. "Kenya is currently producing impeccable degree nurses. It is sad to note that most of these national investments are exported due to lack of opportunity locally," he said. He said the World Health Organization recommends that the nurse-patient ration in every country be 83 nurses for every 10,000 patients but in Kenya, there are only 25 nurses for every 10,000 patients.
