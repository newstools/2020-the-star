Police have arrested party goers at an estate in Embakasi. They were arrested on Saturday at a birthday party. While reports say the arrested were 16, Embakasi OCS Philip Olenkidi put the number at 8. "They are at the station; those who are able to raise cash bail will be released, those unable will have to spend the night here, " he told the Star. Olenkidi said among those arrested are owners of the house hosting the party. "Many more fled using their vehicles, they almost caused accidents while evading arrest," he said. The arrest comes amid calls for social distancing to control spread of the coronavirus. On Friday 17 other people were arrested while partying at a club near JKIA. Among them was a senior principle magistrate and a senior military officer. Also arrested in the swoop were a sitting MP and former MP. Despite consistent directives against social gatherings, Kenyans are going at bizarre levels to have fun. Early this week, several Kenyans were arrested while using an ambulance to head to a party. On Saturday, Health CAS Mercy Mwangangi announced two more coronavirus positive cases, putting the number at 191.
