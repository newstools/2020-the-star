The opening of restaurants is not a permit for bars to start selling alcohol, Health CS Mutahi Kagwe has warned. While announcing the reopening of restaurants, Kagwe was quick to note this was not a licence to start opening bars and sale of alcohol across the country. Speaking on Monday at Afya House, Kagwe said that the restaurants will operate only between 5 am and 4 pm even as the country grapples with coronavirus. Kagwe said that all workers must be tested within the food joints and social distancing be practised at all times. The CS also announced that no buffet services will be offered in any restaurant. "We want to make our own measures based on our own experiences as compared to other countries. The restaurants will operate between 5 am to 4 pm and they must maintain the social distancing that is required," he said. Kagwe said patrons must seat 1.5 metres apart. "Restaurants will not be allowed to serve buffet while patrons must sanitise and wear face masks," he said. "Anybody walking into a restaurant should walk in with a mask, sanitise their hands and if your staff has not been tested you cannot open a restaurant," he added.
