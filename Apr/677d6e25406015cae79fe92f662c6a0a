More than 900 gold miners at Macalder in Migori county have received donations to cushion them from the slump in prices caused by the Covid-19 crisis on the global economy. Copper Hill Sacco, which manages the gold mines, pooled resources from stakeholders, business partners and officials to help distribute food to the miners and their families for four days ending Thursday. More than 100 bags of maize, 100 bags of rice, soap, salt, sugar and face masks were distributed. Sacco chairman Felix Okwanyo on Wednesday said prices of gold per gram have dipped by more than half, from Sh4,000 to Sh2,000 since the start of coronavirus pandemic. He spoke during the distribution. Businesses that rely on gold mining such as those selling machines and mercury for extraction and commercial property have also been hurt. "We've seen buyers shying away from mines because transportation and economy in the gold market in Dubai and Europe has dipped completely,” Okwanyo said. Mining has been worsened by the measures put in place by the government to contain the virus, he said. Such measures include social distancing and the curfew that is effective from 7pm to 5am. "We have several families that depend wholesomely on the gold business. What we have distributed will help cushion them at this time,” he said. Sacco vice-chairman Sylvester Ageng’a said they had ensured government directives are adhered to at the gold mines and hoped the economy will bounce back soon. Margaret Adhiambo, a beneficiary, appealed to the government to consider artisanal miners through an economic stimulus plan and help revamp the sector. Meanwhile, the Migori government launched a county resource mobilisation committee headed by businessman Walter Ogwada to help collect and distribute donations across the county. Governor Okoth Obado unveiled the committee in his office on Tuesday. It has already received food, face masks, handwashing points and sanitiser worth Sh9 million.
