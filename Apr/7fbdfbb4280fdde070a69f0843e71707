The government will hire an additional 500 additional doctors to help in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, Health CAS Mercy Mwangangi has said. While speaking during the daily Covid-19 briefing on Wednesday, Mwangangi said more medical personnel will enhance the country's capacity and protection in dealing with the virus. She noted that the government is actively training more health workers to fight the dreaded virus. "We continue to train the different carders of personnel to be able to handle the different aspects in terms of dealing with this global pandemic," she said. "Additionally, as a way of appreciating the risks placed to health workers the government is setting up separate isolation and quarantine centres for them across the country." Mwangangi, however, did not give details on the specific institutions that will be used for this purpose. "Medical workers tremendous help in the country's fight against the virus, we appreciate them," she said. This comes as seven new Covid-19 cases were confirmed in Kenya bringing the country's total number to 179. Mwangangi during the brief on Wednesday said the seven cases were out of 305 samples tested in the last 24 hours. The government also announced it is expected to develop a home-based nursing protocol for Covid-19 patients. Health Director General Dr Patrick Amoth saidÂ the government is seeking to treat mild cases at home rather than in isolation centres. The DG said once it is completed, the government will bring counties up to speed for the management of mild cases at home. Amoth said the government is looking at deploying testing on the 14th or 15th day for those in quarantine. Those who test negative will be allowed to go home. Last week, Health CS Mutahi Kagwe asked hospitals to hire 1,000 more health workers in the proceeding seven days.
