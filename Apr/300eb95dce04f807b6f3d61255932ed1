Contractors who do shoddy jobs will be blacklisted, the Taita Taveta county government has warned. Public Works, Transport and Infrastructure executive Gasper Kabaka also told contractors that standards must be maintained at all times. "There is no shortcut to quality works. We have given you this job hoping that you are up to the task. This is public money and therefore we want to see its value," Kabaka said. Kabaka spoke after meeting with the contractors on Thursday. He challenged the contractors to deliver projects on time. "I will be inspecting the works from time to time to ensure that it is up to standard," he added. The department wants to upgrade all roads that had been washed away by heavy rains, he said. Kabaka urged residents to support initiatives being taken by the department to improve roads in the county. Acting Public Works chief officer Leonard Langat urged the project committee members to give the contractors full support. "Make sure you see the bill of quantities for the projects so that you follow up to ensure the required materials are used. "You are the eyes of the community members you are representing, therefore, don't let them down," Langat said. He asked contractors to hire local youth to assist them in the work.
