Kitui Senator Enoch Wambua has called on county leaders to undertake Covid-19 response initiatives with a clear heart without political competitiveness. He said competition in managing the coronavirus will negate benevolent undertakings hence countering gains made in the fight. “If we take that competition approach, we shall definitely fail and we shall all suffer the wrath of the virus,” the Senator said in Kitui on Sunday. He addressed to the media after donating a public sanitation booth at the Kitui main bus and matatu terminus. On Friday and Sunday, the senator donated and launched two other booths at Mwingi and Kabati towns in Kitui. The only other counties with sanitation booths are Nairobi and Mombasa. The senator appreciated elected leaders and other persons of goodwill from the county who have chipped in to fight the virus. “This battle is one that we must all fight from all fronts. It must never be viewed as a ground for competition to see who does more or better,” Wambua said. He promised to use his all in efforts to combat the spread of Covid-19. “I am ready to fight for my people and I will not spare any personal resource that I can use to help. These are very different and difficult times.” The booths are ideal in disinfecting other parts of the body not taken care of by sanitiser and handwashing, he said. “The virus does not just settle on the hands. It also settles on fabrics and so it is important to fight it there as well.” He added that he plans to acquire and donate more booths to the best of his ability “considering that he is using his personal resources”.
