State agencies and at least two counties are under EACC surveillance to prevent price gouging for Covid-19 emergency supplies. Sources at the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission to the Star detectives have been deployed to investigate the inflated cost of supplies. "A county at the Coast and another at Western are in focus," a source said. Others indicated the probe will extend to all counties. Meanwhile, the anti-graft agency warned procurement officers in state departments and counties against corruption. CEO Twalib Mbarak has written to the Council of Governors informing them of the surveillance in the procurement of goods and services for prevention of Covid-19 spread and treatment of infection. “We will be keenly monitoring the utilisation and management of public resources by all county governments and state agencies to avert loss or misuse of public resources during this extraordinary period,” the letter reads. The letter to CEO Jacqueline Mogeni has been copied to Head of Public Service Joseph Kinyua and COG chairman Wycliffe Oparanya. Twalib wants county governments and state agencies to ensure there are no pricing loopholes. The EACC has warned against failure to adhere to laws and procedures relating to public procurement and financial management. The scaled-up scrutiny comes at a time Bungoma leaders have accused Governor Wycliffe Wangamati of buying 20-litre jerricans at Sh10,000 each. Leaders in other counties have also flagged the procurement of handwashing materials, sanitiser and face masks. (Edited by V. Graham)
