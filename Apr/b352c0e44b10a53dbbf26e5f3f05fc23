Elgoeyo Marakwet officials have warned athletes of further arrests if they continue training in groups contrary to the government directive of social distancing. County Executive Committee (CEC) for Sports, Anita Kimwatan, told athletes to follow the laid down rules or risk being locked up. The directive comes just a day after 12 athletes were arrested for training in a group against the government’s ban on social gatherings and sports activities. However, the athletes were released without pressing any charges but the CEC warned that there will be no next time. “The arrest and release was just but a warning to others who may violent the rules. We had to talk to them and make them understand why the social gathering was banned,” said Kimwatan. Among those arrested were 10 Kenyans and two foreigners who were taken to Iten Police Station before being released. “We are not against their training but it should be an individual undertaking. This order must be followed to the letter and others who will go against it will be charged in court,” she added. Early this month, the Elgeyo Marakwet County and Athletics Kenya closed all training camps in the country and athletes were instructed to maintain social distancing and train individually.
