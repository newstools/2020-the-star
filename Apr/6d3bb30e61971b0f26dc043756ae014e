Residents of Kiplombe in the outskirts of Eldoret town found a headless body of a man in a trench on Monday morning. The first people to report the finding were boda boda operatos along the Eldoret –Kiplombe Road. It was suspected that the man was killed by a mob on suspicion of being a member of a gang terrorising residents during curfew hours. His head was found a few metres from the body. Assistant chief Ronald Tuwei cautioned residents against taking the law into their hands. Tuwei said even though the deceased might have been involved in criminal activities, it was illegal to kill a suspect. The administrator suspects the John Doe hails from Kamukunji. “The deceased is suspected to be a criminal, but it is illegal for residents to take law into their hands especially during this time of curfew,” Tuwei said. Pamela Mwale raised concern over increasing cases of insecurity during the coronavirus outbreak when the government is focusing on how to beat the virus. “We appreciate initiatives taken by our government in the fight against coronavirus, but police must not relax in matters of general security,” Mwale said. Police arrived at the scene five hours after the body was found and took it to Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital mortuary. More than three bodies have been recovered in various estates in Eldoret in less than a month. All incidents have been confirmed by Uasin Gishu county police commander Johnston Ipara.
