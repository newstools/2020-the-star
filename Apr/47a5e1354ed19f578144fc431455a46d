Weezdom says he has quit the gospel industry. He was first introduced to us as a gospel artiste but critics say his music doesn't match the genre. He was initially signed under Bahati’s EMB, dramatically left then he returned and joined Bahati Reality. A while ago, he was caught up in a scandal after pictures of him in bed with another gospel artiste who is not his wife leaked. Taking to Instagram, Weezdom announced he can no longer handle the hate in the gospel industry. “Been getting so many DM's watu wakiniuliza why I've edited my b10…soon I’ll be explaining why but for now, chenye najua tu ni kwamba i’m no longer doing gospel music nimechoka na vita na chuki za gospel industry ya Kenya,” Weezdom posted. When Word Is reached out to him, he did not pick the calls.
