Nairobi County Health Department has expressed its displeasure over the conduct of a section of city ward reps over water tanks. This was after reports reached the department that on Tuesday, some MCAs had broken into Charter Hall where the tanks had been stationed and forcibly took them. The Public Health Deputy Director Wilson Langat told the Star that some MCAs took the tanks before they were officially distributed to them. The 288 water tanks had been donated by Unicef to be distributed across the 85 wards to ensure that the public is observing hygiene to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. “At that time, I was in a meeting at the Ministry of Health when I was informed that some MCAs had forcefully accessed the charter hall, demanding they had rights over the tanks," Langat explained. He noted that the tanks were specifically to benefit informal settlements. Prior to this, the department had already distributed 187 tanks and 60 were enroute to Dagoretti. “Some MCAs took away the tanks but we agreed with the rest and the department was able to distribute the remaining tanks,” Langat said. The public health department will however be making a follow up on whether the tanks handed to the ward reps have been installed in the wards. Eastleigh North MCA Osman Adown expressed disappointment at the actions of his colleagues terming them uncivilized. He wanted the police to take action on the legislators who were involved in the incident. “Unicef donated soap and water to be distributed to the people of Nairobi but a few individuals decided to share amongst themselves. They have no problem taking someone else’s share,” Adow lamented.. However, Langat said they won’t involve the police since the tanks can be traced. According to the Public Health department, all the 85 wards were to initially receive 10 tanks each. Unicef pledged to donate more tanks so the county government can curb the spread of Covid-19.
