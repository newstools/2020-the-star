The government has said it will release a detailed report on how the Sh1 billion World Bank cash has been spent in the war on the coronavirus. Health CAS Rashid Aman on Thursday said the accounting team and international partners will issue a detailed report on Friday. "This is a matter that is being addressed even as we speak they have made a statement that they will share tommorrow." A document tabled before the Health Committee of the National Assembly chaired by Murangâ€™a Woman Representative Sabina Chege indicates the ministry used Sh42 million to lease 15 ambulances. They also used Sh14.4 million to maintain and fuel 30 vehicles used by its officers across the country, translating to Sh40,000 per vehicle every week. The ministry spent Sh2 million out of the Sh6 million approved for airtime for some of its 500 staff for a period of three months. Aman said that April has been one of the most painful months, adding that this is month in which Kenya's resilience has been tested. "We must be weary of those who want to bring us down with side shows and propaganda. Equally, we should not become complacent and feel that we are out of the woods," he said. Speaking during the daily Covid-19 presser, Health ministry acting director general Dr Patrick Amoth said there are 210 patients in various hospitals across the country. "... of all these, 208 are in stable condition. Only two are in critical condition and I think even one is recovering," he said. Kenya on Thursday recorded 12 new cases of Covid-19, raising the number to 396. Another two patients have died, raising the number to 17. At the same time, a total of 15 new discharges were recorded in the last 24 hours, bringing to 144 the number of recoveries. Seven of the new Covid-19 cases are from Mombasa, three from Nairobi, one form Wajir and one from Kitui. This marks the first case being recorded in Wajir. The Nairobi cases are from Eastleigh, Fedha and Kileleshwa.
