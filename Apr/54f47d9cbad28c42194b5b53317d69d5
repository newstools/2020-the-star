US Senator Elizabeth Warren will endorse former Vice President Joe Biden for president on Wednesday, CNN and NBC reported, giving the presumptive Democratic front-runner another high-profile backing from one of his former rivals. Warren, a progressive leader who ended her own bid for the White House last month, was expected to release a video announcing her support, CNN reported. The endorsement continues Bidenâ€™s consolidation of the party, after Senator Bernie Sanders and former President Barack Obama endorsed Biden this week.
