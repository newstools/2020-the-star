The government should use chiefs to monitor those traveling from towns to rural areas to check the spread of Covid-19, Lugari MP Ayub Savula has said. Savula said older people who are more vulnerable to the virus live in rural villages and could catch the disease from relatives visiting from towns. The lawmaker spoke when he donated sanitisers, face masks and gloves worth Sh1 million to be distributed to homes in Kakamega county. He delivered the items to chiefs to distribute to residents. He said those calling for a total lockdown of the country over the virus were insensitive. "Declaring a lockdown would cripple the already hurting economy. I don't agree with the Kenya National Union of Teachers that the country be locked down for 21 days because teachers want salaries. Where will the money to pay them come from?" Savula said. He said all leaders should instead support the half measures put in place by the government to ensure the virus does not spread further as it could result in a catastrophe. Kakamega senator Cleophas Malala said the government should lock down Nairobi for 14 days to stall spread of the virus in rural areas. Speaking in Kakamega town, Malala said no one should be allowed to enter or leave the city and mass testing should be carried out to isolate cases. The senator said public service vehicles from Nairobi to rural counties should be stopped from operating. "Governors should set up mechanisms to ensure that all people traveling from Nairobi to their counties are forcefully quarantined in identified isolation centres until they are tested," he said.
