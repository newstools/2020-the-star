Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kahiga has tirelessly and passionately been urging Kenyans to adhere to government precautionary measures to deal with the coronavirus pandemic. Among the measures his ministry has announced include washing hands, wearing a face mask and keeping social distance. Ironically, however, Kagwe does not wear a face mask in his daily Covid-19 status briefing at Afya House or Harambee House. The CS should lead by example so that Kenyans can also do what he preaches. It is a way of presenting how serious and important government recommendations are to everyone. Joseph Macharia, Nairobi
