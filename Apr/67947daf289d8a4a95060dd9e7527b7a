Kitui Senator Enoch Wambua has donated fumigation booths for installation in Mwingi, Kabati, and Kitui towns in contribution to the fight against coronavirus. A few weeks ago, the senator donated hand washing water drums to 15 market centres across the county in efforts to contain the virus spreading across the country. Washing hands with soap and running water have been proven to kill the virus. So far, Kitui has recorded two cases of coronavirus and one death. The county’s quarantine centre is at the Kauwi Level 4 Hospital. Speaking during the installation of a fumigation booth at Mwingi bus park, Wambua urged all Kitui leaders to unite in the war against coronavirus. Wambua also said he would mobilise more funds to ensure all major towns and market centres in Kitui are installed with fumigation booths. “I am working towards ensuring that more market centres are installed with such booths for the safety of our residents,” the senator added. He urged residents to adhere to the health guidelines being issued by the Ministry of Health to avoid contracting or transmitting the virus. “Coronavirus is real so let us take necessary measures of ensuring safety and we shall overcome this pandemic.” Once coronavirus clears, Wambua said, the booth will be moved to Mwingi Level 4 Hospital for sanitising patients.
