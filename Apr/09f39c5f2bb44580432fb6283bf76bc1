Youth in polytechnics have been urged to improve their production standards so they can win lucrative tenders after Covid-19. Vihiga county commissioner Ochillo Oyugi also told the youth to invest in other products that will help them generate income even after the coronavirus pandemic. “After the coronavirus, this should not be the end of your activities. Invest in other businesses that will help you remain in the market,” Oyugi said on Sunday. “We should produce these face masks and even supply to other markets such as China, the US and the UK. What is so special about them that we can’t sell to them?" Oyugi had previously urged parents not to ignore polytechnics, saying they can provide jobs for the youth. Deputy Governor Patrick Saisi last week in Luanda said polytechnics should develop further to produce dust coats and school uniforms. “We should further go and get these polytechnics on subcounty levels to produce different goods for them to generate income and job opportunities for our youths,” Saisi said. Oyugi also urged residents to invest in agribusiness. “We are depending on market value goods instead of producing our food within our farms. We have enough rains during this period for food production,” he added. Edited by E.Kibii
