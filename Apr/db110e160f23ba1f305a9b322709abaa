Coast water companies want the national government to waive their power bills to enable sustained water supply which is key in the fight against Covid-19. Tavevo Water and Sewerage Company director David Ngumbao said most customers might delay paying their water bills which will eventually lead to disconnection of power when the firm doesn't pay. "It is clear that very few people will manage to pay their bills. We shall, therefore, be not in a position to pay the huge power bills to Kenya Power," he said in an interview. He revealed that all the managing directors across the six counties had agreed to push for a waiver for the next six months. "We have agreed to push the agenda for the benefit of our customers. We cannot afford to have dry taps at this trying moment, " he said in his Voi office on Wednesday. Ngumbao said in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, water consumption has doubled due to the recommended constant hand washing. Further, Ngumbao asked residents to use water sparingly. Most coastal counties depend on water from the Mzima Springs in Taita Taveta county. Tavevo has donated over 75 water tanks to facilitate regular hand washing across the county. Ngumbao said water has been restored to customers that had previously been disconnected due to unpaid bills. "The first priority is to prevent spread of the pandemic." Edited by R.Wamochie
