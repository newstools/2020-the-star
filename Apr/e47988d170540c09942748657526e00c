An organisation has urged the government to support elderly people with food as people have been urged to stay at home to reduce the spread of coronavirus. Naitera Foundation director Mukabi Njoroge said many elderly people had been affected as their children who supported them were stuck in Nairobi. Njoroge said since the cessation of movement order by President Uhuru Kenyatta making it difficult to leave or enter Nairobi metropolitan area, people are not helping their elderly parents and grandparents. Others have obeyed Health CS Mutahi Kagwe's advice to stay away from old people to cut the risk of coronavirus transmission. "What is saddening is the fact some are not sending anything in terms of money to their elderly parents or grandparents," Njoroge said. He spoke on Saturday at Nyambare village in Lari constituency where he distributed food to elderly people. "We were three and visited 25 homes whose elderly are extremely needy. We gave them maize flour, wheat flour, sugar, cooking fat, rice and salt," he said. Njoroge asked the government to come up with a clear strategy of distributing relief food to the needy.
