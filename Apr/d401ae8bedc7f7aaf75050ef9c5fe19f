Police in Baringo North subcounty are looking for a man who shot and injured his neighbour with a poisoned arrow over an old sufuria. Suspect Musa Chemwetich, 50, fled after shooting and injuring Rodgers Kipruto, 35, in Litein village, Barwessa ward, on Thursday. “We are looking for him. He will be arraigned for attempted murder,” subcounty police commander Fredrick Odinga said on Friday. Kipruto is being treated at the county referral hospital in Kabarnet town. Chemwetich earns a living by repairing worn-out aluminium kitchenware such as sufurias, metallic plates, bowls and basins. Speaking from his hospital bed, Kipruto told journalists he stays alone and had gone for days without cooking since all his sufurias were leaking. He said he went to Chemwetich's home at 2pm to get a sufuria he had left for repair a week ago when an argument ensued. “We quarrelled after he demanded Sh150 yet I owed him only Sh50. I had already paid him Sh100,”Kipruto said. He said he was further infuriated because Chemwetich had not repaired his sufuria. "I requested him to give me back my sufuria and refund the money, but he refused,” Kipruto said. He said Chemwetich entered into his house, came out armed with a bow and poisoned arrows and started shooting at him. Two arrows missed him but the third one got his upper arm. He said he quickly pulled out the arrowhead and sucked out the poison. Residents rushed him to the hospital. Edited by A.N
