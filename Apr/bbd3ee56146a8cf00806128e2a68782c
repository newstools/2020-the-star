A rare zonkey, born to a zebra mother and a donkey father, has been spotted in Chyulu National Park in Kenya. Sheldrick Wildlife Trust said its squad noticed the zebra had a small foal by her side with a bizarrely brown body. According to the Trust, the had Initially chalked up the animal’s hue to a bath in some mud. "At first, we thought that it had just been wallowing in the mud bath, but then the truth dawned on us: Our wayward zebra had given birth to a zonkey," it said. "While zebra foals are born with white and brown stripes that eventually turn black, this little one’s body was suspiciously light on stripes and overwhelmingly tawny in color." A zonkey is a highly unusual hybrid between a zebra and donkey. "During her time living within the community last year, she had obviously become acquainted with an amorous donkey. The zonkey combines the sturdy body of its donkey sire and the striped legs of its zebra mother, which makes for a striking creature," it added. "While it should otherwise lead a normal life, zonkeys are mules, meaning that it will be unable to successfully breed once it reaches maturity." The Trust noted that the mother and baby are thriving. ."... while this unusual pair wait for some wild zebra's to discover them both. Until that day comes, they seem quite content to spend their days grazing side-by-side, a sight that makes us all stop and marvel at the wonders of nature," it added.
