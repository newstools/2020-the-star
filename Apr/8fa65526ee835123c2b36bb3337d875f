The government has announced that one person is under critical condition due to the coronavirus. Acting Director General Public Health Dr Patrick Amoth said the patient is under ventilators but is responding well to treatment and should be out of the ventilators in two days time. Amoth said out of all the 172 confirmed cases, the youngest patient was two years while the oldest was 74 years. “In terms of gender, the ratio of the cases is 56 per cent for men and 44 per cent women with a fatality rate of two per cent so far,” Amoth said. He said the low fatality rate can be attributed to mild infections that have been reported and the swift response of the medical teams. So far Kenya has reported six deaths since the first case was reported on March 13. Health CS Mutahi Kagwe on Tuesday announced an additional 14 coronavirus cases. This now brings the country's total number to 172 with four fatalities. Kagwe announced three other people have been discharged after they tested negative. This brings to seven the number of those who have recovered from the virus in the country. The CS asked Kenyans to brace themselves for 'bad news' as the Covid-19 pandemic continues to spread in the country. He said measures that have been put in place by the government are not going to stop the disease abruptly. According to Kagwe, though Kenya has been getting mild infections, the time has come for all citizens to mentally prepare for the worst. The CS warned that the government will not hesitate to take bolder measures in the coming days to curb the spread of the disease. Kagwe directed that all health workers, including those in private hospitals and rapid response teams and all staff in all facilities holding quarantined persons, must commence testing with immediate effect.
