Kisii government has banned cooking and hawking of food on the streets as a measure of combating the spread of coronavirus disease. Municipality director of public health Hezron Omayio warned hawkers of dire consequences if they ignore the order. This is meant to promote hygiene. Those violating the order will be fined between Sh3,000 and 5,000, depending on the counts, or sentenced to a two-month jail term. "We've banned cooking and hawking of any food in the streets of Kisii town and its environs. We must take all measures to avert the spread of Covid-19,” he said. "Stern action will be taken against those who will be found cooking and selling food during this trying moment." Also targetted are those who cook food at their homes, and ferry it to sell it to consumers. "Every corner has been reduced to an eatery. Consumers are not aware of the dangers they are exposing their lives to since they do not know how the food is cooked,” Omayio said. He appealed to consumers to buy food from licensed eateries, adding it will help them lodge complaints in case of food poisoning. The Public Health department has directed enforcement officers to launch a mass crackdown to nab noncompliant traders. “We have since discovered that most of those who conduct such businesses have no medical certificate and food licences, nor do they have uniforms,” Omayio said. He said customers crowd areas where the food and vegetables are sold, thus endangering their lives. Omayio also warned residents against constructing kiosks on drainages, saying that such structures will be demolished. “It is illegal to construct kiosks on drainages because the same clogs them, hampers planning and movement of people,” the director said.
