Sixteen relatives of at least two medics in Mombasa are under quarantine for suspected contact with a coronavirus positive person. Mombasa county commissioner Gilbert Kitiyo and Governor Hassan Joho confirmed that the 16 were quarantined on Monday. The response team is tracing those who came into contact with the medics, two of whom have lost a parent each in two weeks. The county government announced that private and public hospitals will have separate sections for Covid-19 patients. This comes in the wake of a high number of infections reported in Mombasa, mostly at home and workplaces, according to health officials. By Tuesday, Mombasa had reported 66 cases and five deaths. Health executive Hazel Koitaba said anyone who comes into contact with Covid-19 patients for more than 15 minutes will be quarantined and tested. “There are people who are positive but are interacting with their family members and workmates. This increases the infection rates,” she said. The county will today (Wednesday), launch the first Covid-19 centre at the Technical University of Mombasa. TUM’s engineering block has been set aside for Covid-19 patients. “We are starting with 59, although the facility has a capacity of 300 beds,” Koitaba said. She said patients with other ailments can still access services at health centres. “All hospitals will have beds specifically for Covid-19 cases and TUM will accommodate patients who are not in critical conditions,” she added. She said they will be able to test at least 700 people per day once they start using the test kit. “The use of this machine is being tested at Coast General and once it is approved, we shall test contacts of positive cases,” Koitaba said. The second phase of the project would ensure that at least all health facilities are able to carry out mass testing. Koitaba said it is unfortunate that some employers are not allowing their staff to work from home as directed by the national government. Edited by Frank Obonyo
