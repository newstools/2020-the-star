Kenya has reported 15 new coronavirus cases bringing the country's total number to 296, Â Health CAS Mercy Mwangangi has said. Out of these, 11 are Kenyans, while four are foreigners. None have a history of travel. The CAS said seven of the new cases are from Mombasa, which has become a hot spot for the virus. On a positive note, another five patients have recovered, raising the number to 74. Out of the new cases, seven are male, while eight are female. The cases are between 19 and 75 years. A total of six were from quarantine centres. The new cases were from 545 samples. "We are in a war... some of our young people are breaking curfew regulations thinking that they are unable to get the diseases," Mwangangi said. The CAS, during her daily Covid-19 briefing on Tuesday at Afya House, urged supermarkets to devise innovative ways of dealing with goods to avoid spread of the virus. Mwangangi lauded the Kenya Air Force for flying military choppers in solidarity with medical workers. One military chopper flew a banner with the words, "God bless medics" while another had the message "Stay at home" urging Kenyans to keep safe to help control the spread of the virus.
