A man convicted of defiling a 12-year-old orphan he claimed was his wife will serve 10 years in prison after a successful appeal on Wednesday. Earlier, a Kakamega lower court had sentenced Kevin Musoga to 20 years imprisonment. The particulars of the charge against Musoga were that on diverse dates between February 24 and March 18, 2017, in Kakamega county, he defiled a child aged 12. But in his appeal, Musoga said the trial magistrate grossly erred in law and fact for presiding over a trial before being served with witness statements as required by the Constitution. “The evidence that was malicious, fabricated, farfetched and inconsistent,” he appealed at a Kakamega High Court. According to court documents, the minor was in February and March 2017 employed as a house help by a woman identified as Carol and also worked at her hotel. In her testimony, the complainant said Musoga frequented the hotel. One day, she served him food but on requesting for the bill settlement, he pulled her to a nearby bathroom and sexually assaulted her, the documents read. A watchman heard her distress calls and opened the bathroom door. A village elder was informed of the incident who then summoned the accused. Musoga told the elder that the complainant was his wife, the papers read. The accused was later arrested by the public and handed over to the police. He denied the offence and claimed to have been arrested for a traffic violation after he failed to raise Sh1,500 bribe, alleging fabrication of the defilement suit. Justice Jesse Njagi dismissed the offence of defilement saying the prosecution had not fulfilled all the necessary requirements to prove defilement. They, however, proved sexual assault.
