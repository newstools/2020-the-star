 County Assemblies in the country have been asked to extend their adjournments by two weeks to limit spread of the coronavirus. The assemblies have been on a month-long recess and most of them resumed on Tuesday. Secretary-General of the County Assemblies Forum (CAF) Kipkurui Chepkwony says the ban on meetings and requirements on social distancing will hurt their work and affect their operations. “We all support the ongoing fight against the coronavirus and CAF urges assemblies to postpone their sittings for at least another two weeks as we assess the situation and work closely with the government,” Chepkwony said in Eldoret. He said employees of the assemblies should be encouraged to work from home but respond if needed. However, some of the assemblies such as Uasin Gishu operate in shifts with fewer MCAs and staff to comply with social distancing. “We will operate with only 24 MCAs and some staff at a time to avoid crowding because our chambers are small and we will not allow in any members of the public,” Speaker David Kiplagat said. He said MCAs would decide if they want to extend their adjournment or continue with smaller sittings as they comply with government guidelines. MCAs in Elgeyo-Marakwet, Trans Nzoia and West Pokot were also expected to announce measures they would put in place to fight the virus. Meantime, Moiben MP Sila Tiren wants Kenyans to stop ignoring government guidelines on social distancing and staying indoors. He pointed to the disastrous situations in countries like Italy and Spain. He called for more awareness campaigns. Elsewhere, private security guards in Eldoret and other parts of the North Rift region have been warned not to report to duty without uniforms during the curfew. Peter Odima from the Kenya National Private Security Workers Union says an inspection in the region and found many night guards were on duty without uniforms, risking their safety. Police might think them curfew-breakers. (Edited by V. Graham)
