President Uhuru Kenyatta today chaired the first meeting of the board that was created to marshal funds for combating the Coronavirus disease. The team led by East African Breweries managing director Jane Karuku was put together by the President to rally Kenyans together in raising resources that will support government efforts to mitigate the effects of the disease. Uhuru chaired the meeting through video-conference where he assured the task force that comprises of private sector captains of industry and senior state officials of his full support. “Thank you for agreeing to work together throughout this time as we seek to find solutions on how to cushion the vulnerable in our country as well as deal with the future,” he said on Wednesday. Karuku assured the Head of State of her team's commitment to the task ahead of them, saying they will work hard to deliver on their mandate. “We will work closely to ensure that we achieve the mandate that this fund has been created for. We will pool our brains and resources to ensure every Kenyan is cushioned,” Karuku said. At the same time, the President thanked employers who have undertaken to ensure that no jobs are lost due to the disruption caused by the pandemic. He applauded oil marketing companies, led by the Kenya Pipeline Corporation for blending hand sanitisers for free distribution to vulnerable Kenyans. The Head of State regretted incidents of violence reported on the first day of the dusk to dawn curfew and urged Kenyans to continue adhering to protocols issued by the Ministry of Health including voluntary isolation and social distancing. The President said the government will continue to proactively implement measures to curb the spread of the respiratory disease. "As a Government will we continue to take measures. Keep in mind that these measures, we are taking, are to ensure every Kenyan is protected and is safe," the President said.
