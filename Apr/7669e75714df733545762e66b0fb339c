Former Kibwezi MP Kalembe Ndile has urged the state to support health workers in the country and employ additional medics. Kalembe said health workers need additional staff to increase efficiency in to attending coronavirus patients. Kalembe added that the nurses should be motivated since such measures can give much-needed reassurance to stressed caregivers and protect the public too. Kalembe said the government should even consider increasing their salaries since they are the most important resource at the moment. "If there is anyone who should be earning a huge salary in this country are doctors and nurses because right now, everybody is looking for their help to save people's lives," heÂ  told reporters in Machakos. "The government should train and provide adequate support for caregivers who are in the frontline of this fight across the country," he stated. The former legislator said all trained medical staff should be recalled to help fight the pandemic. He further noted that like soldiers, health workers also face considerable mental stress. "It is often forgotten that as humans, they feel the sorrow of loss when their patients succumb to the virus," he said. In this regard, the former Tip Tip party leader said the government must ensure healthcare workers have access to counselling services. "We must give these health workers all the support they need to do their jobs, be safe and stay alive" he added.
