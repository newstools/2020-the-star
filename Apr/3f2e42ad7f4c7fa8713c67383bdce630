Singer Harmonize has shut down rumours he had a thing for his video vixen Nicole in the music video 'Bedroom'. When asked about them being lovers, he said in an interview with a Tanzanian radio station on Wednesday, "No, it's not true." Adding, "She has been my friend even before we shot the video. She is from my hometown (Mtwara). She is like my sister. "My director advised me to shoot the video with her. And because we were doing the video in South Africa, when I approached her, she asked me to provide two air tickets, one for her husband. "When we were shooting, her husband was there. I didnâ€™t have an interest in her."
