Tanzanian musician Rayvanny has refuted claims he is back with his baby mama Fahyvanny. The singer distanced himself from the mother of his son after fans alleged the two were even living in the same house. According to Tanzanian media, Rayvanny urged people not to believe what they hear on the streets. "Who told you we are back? People should stop listening to lies," he said. Fahyvanny left her matrimonial home a few months ago and allegedly accused the singer of cheating on her with a hot video vixen. The video vixen, however, strongly denied having anything to do with the star apart from work. She even introduced her man and said she was in a happy relationship and would never sleep with any man, let alone Rayvanny.
