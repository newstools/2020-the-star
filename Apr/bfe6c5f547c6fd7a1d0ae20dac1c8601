A woman who delivered quadruplets in Kilifi county is seeking help to raise her bundle of joy. Mishi Kitsao from Kaloleni subcounty is currently at the Kilifi County Hospital where she has been for the past one month with her newborns. The newborns, all girls, were brought to the facility on March 17. At birth, they weighed 1.29kgs, 1.01kgs, 0.93kgs and 0.97kgs. Kitsao is ready for discharge but nurses at the hospital fear she may not be able to take proper care of the children. They also fear thee babies could also contract nosocomial infections as the HDU is full. Speaking to the media on Friday at the hospital, nurse in charge of HDU Mwanamvua Boga said the mother may be overwhelmed by the nutrition demands of the children. “The babies here are in a controlled environment but their time to be discharged has come because they can survive without the support of incubators. From what the mother has told us, they do not have a house after their house was brought down by heavy rains in December last year. So shelter is a problem," the nurse said. "The other problem is milk. The mother cannot produce enough milk to sustain all the four babies hence she needs formula milk,” Boga added. According to Boga, every baby needs at least 500gms of formula milk per week. “This means every week, the children will need about 2kgs of formula milk, which is very expensive for her,” she added Kitsao said she is a house wife while her husband is a casual labourer in Mombasa. “I need support to raise up my babies. Right now, I live in my mother-in-laws house because my house was brought down by rains,” Kitsao said. Kitsao delivered her babies at home in Kaloleni. She has three other children aged 10, 8 and 7. Boga appealed to well-wishers to come out and support the mother in raising up the babies. Edited by E.Kibii
