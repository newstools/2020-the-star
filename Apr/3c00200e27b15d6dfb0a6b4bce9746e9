Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has warned cartels against 'hijacking' the deed of transfer he signed with the national government in February. He on Wednesday threatened to terminate the agreement. Sonko now says he will go to court to have it terminated. The governor accused ‘State House hijackers’ of taking advantage of the deed of transfer and decided to pursue its implementation in an 'atrocious and repugnant manner'. Sonko took to Twitter to rant, "Let them kill me or jail me if they want, ndio waendelee na ujinga zao (so they continue with their stupidity ) when I’m not your governor.” Speaking to the Star on Wednesday , Sonko’s personal assistant Ben Mulwa confirmed that the governor has already tasked a team of lawyers to carry out the paperwork before he moves to court next week to initiate the process if the frustrations from “State House hijackers’ don’t stop. “Just a few weeks after the deal has matured, we have witnessed a lot of disrespect from the 'State house hijackers'. The deed is a two-year deal; we cannot proceed like this,” he said. Sonko said he and President Uhuru Kenyatta "had good intentions when the process was initiated, however, some of his greedy officers in government especially the ones who hate me have hijacked the process to embarrass and frustrate me". He said that up to date, he has not been furnished with a copy of the deed. “I was not given sufficient time to read the draft. I was just told it was a good thing on service delivery to the great people of Nairobi as I deal with my court cases. Since I love you people I had to accept without even going through the document,” Sonko said.
