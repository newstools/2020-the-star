The management of St John Ambulance has dismissed claims that have been doing round in social media regarding the death of Kenyan author Ken Walibora. There have been claims that one of its ambulances was seen at the scene of the accident but refused to evacuate him because he did not have money at then. Walibora is said to have died on April 10 after being knocked down by a vehicle at Landhies Road. His body was discovered five days later at the Kenyatta National Hospital mortuary. The statement from St John Ambulance posted on its Twitter handle on Saturday said that the claims were not true and that none of its ambulances moves along the road where the accident is said to have taken place at. “As a matter of fact, St John Ambulance was not alerted about this incident, neither did any of our Ambulances move along Landhies Road where the accident is said to have occurred." It also said that the confirmation was reached after checking all the St John's call centre logs and ambulance GPS movements on the said date. The management added that members of the public might have confused its brand with other ambulance services which bear almost similar branding. “In the past, we have seen people confuse other Ambulance services with St John Ambulance due to near similarity in branding, and this could be one of those rare cases." It further said that false claims might have negative effects on it from the members of the public. The management said that St John Ambulance has always been at the forefront to rescue any victim of the accident or disaster-free of charge. The author died at the age of 55 and was born on January 6, 1965, in Baraki, Bungoma county. Walibora was one of the most prolific authors in the country with more than 40 titles to his name. The most famous title was Siku Njema, a secondary school set book between 1997 and 2003. He had more than 40 books in his title.
