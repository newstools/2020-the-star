Nairobi and Mombasa account for 90 per cent of all the Covid-19 cases. "This is not the time to drop the ball," Aman said. Meanwhile, the CAS reiterated the reopening of eateries does not include pubs. This is after the ministry received queries on which eateries are allowed to open. On Monday, Health CS Mutahi Kagwe released guidelines for reopening of restaurants. Alcohol can only be sold in a restaurant when ordered with a meal. In addition, the alcohol can only to be served to customers waiting for an order, during the meal, or 30 minutes after the meal ended. Kagwe released a raft of measures to be followed by restaurants after President Uhuru Kenyatta on Saturday announced a planned easing of restrictions for eateries. The President announced the move as one of the ways to revive the economy progressively. "We will reopen this economy but it must be in a way that does not endanger thousands of lives. Some countries had initially succeeded in suppressing the pandemic, only for them to open up without a proper process and suffer a huge spike in infections," the President said. The Head of State, however, said he would not hesitate to close restaurants which flout government directives to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. In the new rules, restaurants will only be allowed to operate between 5 am and 4 pm. More follows..
