Kisumu Governor Anyang Nyong'o has nominated veteran doctor Boaz Otieno Nyunya to become the county executive for health and sanitation. Nyong'o is the county's acting Health executive. He took over the role after  Judith Miguda was re-appointed to the business co-operatives and marketing docket. Nyong'o said he would manage the docket until a substantive executive is appointed. "Pursuant to powers conferred by Article 179 (2) (b) of the Constitution 2010 and Section 30 (2) (d) of the County Government Act 2012, I have today nominated Nyunya to serve as the county executive committee member in charge of the department of health and sanitation," Nyong'o said in a statement on Wednesday. Nyunya is a consultant obstetrician-gynaecologist and public health practitioner, researcher, leader in reproductive health, educationist and programme specialist. He has been an associate professor at Moi University's college of health sciences and is currently the associate director for programmes, Western Kenya at Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Kisumu. Nyong’o in May last year appointed Nerry Achar as acting health executive pending clearance of nominee Miguda. Edited by Peter Obuya
