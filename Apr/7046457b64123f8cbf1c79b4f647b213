Oserian Ladies coach Hudson Odari wants players plying their trade outside the country to be considered for the next national team assignment to avoid further slump. Starlets won a single match in four encounters during the Turkish Women’s Gold Cup tourney last month in the absence of the overseas players. Their unavailability was heavily felt and Odari, 35, wants them to be part and parcel of the next assignment. “Starlets performed dismally and the reason is well known. The team was without experienced players and stakeholders need to rethink their decision before the next assignment,” said the former Oserian FC men’s team player who retired in 2008 after suffering a serious knee injury. “A player like Corazon Acquino is an asset both at the club and national team level yet she was missing in the Turkey assignment. Striker Marjolin Wekesa, who is a currently on a sports scholarship in the United States, also deserves a call-up. Others are Anneth Kundu, Ruth Ingosi and Cynthia Shilwatso, who are attached to European clubs,” said Wekesa. At the same time, Odari wants the federation to assist players to secure passports. “Some players have in the past been dropped due to lack of travel documents. There’s no need of calling a player and dropping him at the eleventh hour over passports,” recounted the youthful tactician who has been with Oserian for 14 years. Meanwhile, Odari reckons that playing friendly matches with quality teams will not only help the coach gauge the ability of his charges but also regenerate self-belief in the team. “It’s one thing to play test matches but the quality of the opponent must be considered. Training without friendlies again is useless and every team must strive to engage teams above them for ideal preparations.”
