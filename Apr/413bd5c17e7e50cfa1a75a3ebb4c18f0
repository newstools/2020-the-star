Two Meru MCAs have appealed to the Interior ministry, the Ministry of Health and President Uhuru Kenyatta to lift the ban on church gatherings. Athwana Ward MCA Victor Karithi and his nominated counterpart Kinya Kiambati wondered why the government banned church meetings whereas markets, supermarkets and matatu are allowed to operate in compliance with social distancing. They termed the ban as a stigmatisation and discrimination of the highest order. Kiambati said the Methodist, Catholic and other churches have small Christian groups where, if allowed, members can worship while observing social distance. "We can’t run from coronavirus and run from God. People are pleading to be allowed to worship," she said. Karithi said there has been a case in Meru where a pastor was clobbered by police officers during his prayer and fasting in a mountain with only two of his believers. "People are allowed to cross the ferry, matatu have reduced passengers, why can’t churches with big congregants of 2,000 people not allowed to worship with 10 people? The same way the ministry came up with a rule that only 15 people attend a burial, allow churches to operate while observing required health guidelines and social distancing," Mutuma said. Karithi said people need spiritual nourishment and it cannot be achieved through TV, online or radio because not everyone is capable. Mutuma said police brutality has made worshipping to look like a crime among christians. "Our brothers in Tanzania are still worshipping. I call upon Interior CS Dr Fred Matiang’i and Health CS Mutahi Kagwe to speak with county commissioners and police against harassing the clerics and faithful," Mutuma said. Mutuma called on Meru clergy to plan and hold a prayer day at Kinoru stadium and seek God's intervention against Covid-19. They asked the government to involve the Church in its fight against coronavirus.
