Farmers in Kericho have been urged to sanitise farming tools before and after use this planting season. County commissioner Moses Mbaruku on Tuesday said for the farmers to be assured of a harvest this year, they should be able to plant without fear of catching the coronavirus. Mbaruku said food security is paramount, hence growers must go to their farms to prevent hunger. "Coronavirus is real and is here, but it should not scare us into abandoning farming," the administrator said. He spoke to journalists in his Kericho office, where he said the war against the virus can be successful if citizens heed the directives put in place for their protection. Governor Paul Chepkwony has waived land rates, single business permit rates and rents for those occupying county government houses. Chepkwony also declared free water supply by the Kericho Water and Sanitation Company. The county has set aside Sh280 million towards the fight against Covid-19. While launching the county fumigation programme on Friday, the governor asked Kenya Power to follow suit and spare residents from power disconnections during the outbreak. He said during an economic crisis, financial institutions should also spare those with outstanding loans from being auctioned until the economy is stabilised. Chepkwony was accompanied by Deputy Governor Susan Kikwai and Mbaruku when he commissioned the disinfection of the local bus park and some streets in the town. He said the war against coronavirus can only be won only if the public adhered to health rules and regulations. “Wash your hands with soap regularly, sanitise them and keep the mandatory one-metre social distance," Chepkwony said. He said all the six subcounties, namely Ainamoi, Belgut, Buret, Sigowet/Soin and Kipkelion East and West, are prepared for any attack of the virus. “We have placed 300 water tanks where the public can wash their hands," the governor said.
