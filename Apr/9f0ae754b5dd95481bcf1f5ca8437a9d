One million locally manufactured face masks are ready for distribution in the war on Covid-19, Industrialisation CS Betty Maina has said. The CS on Friday said the masks should cost no more than Sh20. "The Kenya textile industry is currently able to produce as many masks as we require as well as the personal protective equipment that doctors require,” she said during the daily briefing on the Covid-19 situation at Afya House. She also said the country is looking for ways to procure ventilators. "The coronavirus has affected the global supply chains for a lot of goods and chief of those is medical commodities so since last week, we have been working really hard to see if we can supply this within the country because it has proved a challenge to trace them and to be able to order them across the world because the demand from Europe, US is very large," Betty added. Maina said that the government has risen to the task. "This morning all these samples (of PPE) were presented at KEBS for testing and confirmation of our compliance with Kenyan standards and starting Monday we will have the discharge and receipt of  the certification from the Bureau of Standards," she said. Health CAS Mercy Mwangangi announced that Kenya has 12 more Covid-19 cases. This now brings the number to 122 cases.  Out of these, 11 are Kenyans and one is Somali. While giving an update on the new cases, Mwangangi said 362 samples were tested in the last 24 hours. In terms of gender, eight of the patients were male and four were female. The age of the new infections ranged from 28 to 68, Mwangangi added.
