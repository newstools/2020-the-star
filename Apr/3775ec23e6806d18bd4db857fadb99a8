Nadia Mukami has been speaking about her secret love with singer Arrow Bwoy, which they kept on the down-low. Nadia had previously denied dating the artiste after the rumours emerged following the release of their song 'Radio Love', then admitted it. "He's an amazing friend. We tried dating but it didn't work," she said. Arrow Bwoy responded in a recent interview. "I'll give some advice to Nadia Mukami. She is one of the vibrant female artistes in East Africa," he said. "She has so much potential in raising our Kenyan flag high. However, she can only reach these heights once she channels all her energy into her craft. "Aachane na hizo sideshows, hazileti shangwe yaani. Because the Nadia I know is the one I did a collabo with and I love the fact that she is a go-getter. Piga tu kazi. I'm your fan."
