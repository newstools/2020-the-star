Shoprite has announced plans to close its supermarket at Waterfront Mall, leaving 100 without jobs, in a month's time. Shoprite HR Manager Carolyne Walubengo through a letter on Wednesday,  notified the Kenyan Union of Commercial Food and Allied Workers of the planned closure inviting them for a consultative meeting. A total of 74 of the employees are members of KUCFAW. As a reason for the proposed redundancy, Walubengo said, "Endeavours to continue trading at the Waterfront branch is no longer viable". The retailer will officially terminate employment contracts of all employees on May 20 even though trading operations will cease before then. "...This will not prejudice employees as they will continue to render their services at said branch until the termination date," Walubengo said. On their part, the management of the Waterfront Karen mall assured their customers that their shopping requirements will continue to be met through other grocers and Game supermarket. "Following the industry’s experience from the closure of one the largest supermarket chains, it was our strategy right from the onset to offer you enhanced variety through more than one anchor in order to cushion consumers and retailers against loss of traffic as a result of such closure. We will endeavor to ensure that our clients will continue to receive the services and goods in spite of the closure," David Muguku, Director at the Waterfront Karen said in a statement. "Similarly, we would like to assure our other tenants that we will continue to closely work with them to ensure minimal interruption to business and wherever possible, jointly establishing solutions that fit their business needs".
