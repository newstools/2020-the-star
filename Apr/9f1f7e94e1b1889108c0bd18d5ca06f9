The impact of Covid-19 has started to hit home as tenants in Eldoret town face eviction over unpaid rent. Panic has gripped tenants in Shauri Moyo, Kamkunji and Langas after their landlords started demanding rent or they would be evicted by force. The estates are mostly occupied by low-income earners who eke out their living from small businesses such as selling second-hand clothes at Eldoret West open-air market. Other tenants staring at forceful eviction are from the jua kali sector, hotels, security and flower firms. Tenant Amos Mutsami said landlords had warned that failure to clear last month’s rent would result in being kicked out. Mutsami used to operate at the Eldoret West open-air market before it was closed by Uasin Gishu county two weeks ago as part of the measures to contain the spread of coronavirus. “We have not done any work for the last two weeks after the county closed the open-air market due to outbreak of the deadly virus,” he said. Another trader Jane Wamalwa asked landlords to be considerate and waive rent for two or three months. County commissioner Abdirisack Jaldesa told landlords to be sympathetic to their clients owing to the impact of the coronavirus. Edited by Henry Makori
