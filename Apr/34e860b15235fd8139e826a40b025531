Uasin Gishu residents should avoid crowding for relief food from politicians, county commissioner Abdulrazack Jaldessa has said. Jaldessa said the leaders' charity is welcome but residents must follow the directive on social distancing to avoid the spread of coronavirus. The administrator told journalists in his office on Monday that food distribution should be done by chiefs, Red Cross and subcounty administrators. The team will deliver any donations at the residents' doors before the curfew hours, he said. “We do not have enough hospitals for all of us in case of an outbreak. Already business has suffered and we should get over it quick. Let's all stay home,” Jaldesa said. On Sunday, Kesses MP Swarupp  Mishra had to postpone a planned distribution of food to over 12,000 households after the commissioner dispersed residents. Mishra said he wanted to give a reprieve to the elderly and the poor as the country grapples with the Covid-19 pandemic. Residents of Uasin Gishu have appealed to the business community to price their goods fairly. Traders are, for instance, selling face masks from Sh30 to Sh150 - a price that is unaffordable for the mandatory protective gear. A majority of residents are now forced to walk to and from work to save some money to buy food. Groceries trader John  Marete said he bought a single reusable face mask for his family of three because he can't afford to buy more pairs. (edited by o. owino)
