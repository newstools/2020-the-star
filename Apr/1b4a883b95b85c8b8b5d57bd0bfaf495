Elsek Group of Companies on Thursday distributed food items worth Sh150,000 to residents of Kikamabala Sun ‘n’ Sand area. Residents are struggling to make ends meet after their sources of income such as palm wine selling, restaurants, stalls and other businesses were closed due to coronavirus control measures. Lenox Dida, an elder from Maweni B village, expressed gratitude and said the food was not only for Easter but a relief during the containment period. “We thank Elsek Osma, the company’s chief executive officer, for supporting us with the food items. We will be able to have at least a meal for a number of days,” Dida said . Each household received 2kg of maize flour, 1 litre of cooking oil, 0.5kg of sugar and 0.5kg of beans. “We used Nyumba Kumi Initiative and village elders for distribution because they know residents better than us,” Elsek said. A total of 1,190 families benefited. Elsek said the food will be provided on a weekly basis until the pandemic is over. Florence Kalu, a Nyumba Kumi ambassador, encouraged other well-wishers to emulate Elsek. She said Elsek has not only given because of the pandemic but he always supported them in times of lack. “We are able to drink clean water and wash our hands regularly as required by the Ministry of Health because Elsek set up five water points,” Kalu said. Kalu added that before Elsek’s water initiative, they used water sparingly because it was not enough for domestic use and frequent handwashing. “When I went with Dida to Elsek’s home, I was surprised to see bags of posho and beans meant for our residents,” she added. A fortnight ago, he distributed home-made face masks to the residents. “We were born with nothing and we shall not take anything with us when we die. That is why I like giving to the vulnerable people,” Elsek said. Edited by Frank Obonyo
