Teenage mothers in Migori county are making soap and masks to fight the coronavirus pandemic and earn a living. The about 200 young mothers under the Teen Mums CBO have been learning how to make soap and masks on YouTube. The masks are made from cotton materials. Reagan Otieno, the head of the CBO, said when the first case of Covid-19 was reported in the country, there was a sharp increase in the demand for soap and masks. “The prices of masks shot through the roof and we are trying to offer alternatives,” Otieno said. Group treasurer Veronica Ogwayo said they produce 100 litres of soap daily and about the same number of masks which they sell to residents for between Sh10 and Sh30. Judith Atieno, the CBO chairperson, said a litre of sanitiser retails at over Sh1,000 while masks cost about Sh100. “We have people who cannot afford that amount and that is why we are providing an alternative,” Atieno said. When the Star visited their offices in Migori town on Tuesday, a group of 50 teenage moms were making soap while others were sewing together pieces for masks. The group officials said they formed the CBO owing to the high cases of teenage pregnancies in the county. According to Migori County Family Planning report by USAID conducted between January and June 2016, of the 20,712 pregnancies, 402 were from mothers aged between 10 and 14 years. Another 6,639 were mothers aged between 15-19 years. “Mothers aged between 15-19 in Migori stand at 20.9 per cent, which is more than 15 per cent of the national rate,” the report shows. The report also indicates that only 44 per cent of women in Migori use contraceptive against 53 per cent nationally. Edited by A.N
