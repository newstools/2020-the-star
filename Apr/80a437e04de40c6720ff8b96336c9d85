Health care workers are the government's top priority and their terms and allowances will be reviewed, CAS Mercy Mwangangi has said. This comes after the National Nurses Association president Alfred Obengo told off SRC over claims that counties should seek permission before awarding health workers special allowances. This was after Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua promised to give its workers a special allowance of up to Sh20,000. This was to help them during this coronavirus pandemic. In a notice on April 9, SRC Chairperson Lyn Mengich said the due process was not followed adding that such an award is 'unlawful and causes inequality' in remuneration across the country. "The government is raising funds to facilitate the fight against coronavirus..in light of scarce resources, it is prudent to use the available resources by providing personal protection equipment," she said. Kenya has reported two new coronavirus cases, bringing the country's total number to 191, Health CAS Mercy Mwangangi has said. A total of 491 samples have been tested in the last 24 hours, the CAS said on Saturday. One of the cases was from Mombasa, the other from Nairobi. One is a Kenyan. The CAS also said two more people have been discharged. During the daily briefing on Covid-19, the CAS on Saturday said, "To relent on government directives is to invite mass deaths." The government has boosted the amount of sanitiser being produced. Saturday marks Day 31 of efforts to stop the spread of the virus. On Friday, CS Mutahi Kagwe warned Kenyans against handling of cash which could hurt efforts to curb spread of the virus. He said many Kenyans were not heeding advice of using mobile money. Kagwe also acknowledged the problem of disposing of face masks.
