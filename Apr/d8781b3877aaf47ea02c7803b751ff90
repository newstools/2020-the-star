Jackson Rakama, alias Jegede, says the only solution to the spread of the coronavirus is a 21-day total lockdown. Speaking to Word Is, Jegede said most Kenyans still do not take the virus seriously. "The more we say we are looking for a contact person, we are interfering with the economy even worse. The government needs to shut down everything for at least 21 days, and then we have another two weeks of curfew for it to be a month," he said. Jegede said Kenyans may suffer but after that, all will be well. "We all want our normal life back,‚Äù he said. He urged his fans to follow the guidelines issued by the government. "I watch the news and see what is happening in the US, in Italy, and I kind of know the threat coronavirus is," Jegede said.
