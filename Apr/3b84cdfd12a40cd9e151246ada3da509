Grief engulfed Kaloleni estate in Voi, Taita Taveta county, after a Class 7 pupil drowned while swimming in a flooded river on Saturday. According his mother, the victim, who was in the company of two other boys, was sent to a farm near the river. "He went to deliver lunch to his brothers at the farm near the river on Friday but he never returned," Jane Majala said. Majala said she received the heart-breaking news from the deceased's friends that his son had drowned in the river. His two friends survived. The lifeless body of the 12-year-old boy was later retrieved by residents after hours of search. The body was moved to Moi County Referral Hospital morgue. Kaloleni MCA Omar Ahmed who led residents in the search asked parents to be cautious and take care of their children. He asked parents not to allow children to leave their homes. "Children went home on an unusual holiday and they are supposed to stay at home. Besides falling into such tragedies, they pose a risk of spreading the coronavirus," Omar warned. He asked residents to be on the lookout to avoid being washed away by the flooded river. The river bust its banks last week due to a downpour in Taita hills, posing danger to residents. In December last year, over 300 people were displaced after ranging water from the river swept their houses in Tanzania, Mnaoni and Msambweni estates. Most of those affected had built their houses on riparian land. However, people have rebuilt their houses even as the Meteorological Department warned of heavy rains in the area. Encroachment on the river and human activities like sand harvesting and brick making have been blamed for the perennial flooding. Edited by Henry Makori
