Dock Workers Union members have set aside their differences to fight the coronavirus. The unity was evident last Tuesday when secretary general Simon Sang, vice chairman Gunda Kaneno and treasurer Joseph Makero addressed a press conference on the coronavirus control measures. The union has since 2014 been locked in squabbles, sabotage and betrayal. Kaneno was in chairman Mohammed Sheria’s faction, which split from Sang’s camp and opposed every proposal the general secretary presented. Sang accused the splinter group of being used by the port management to fight him. “It is interesting that coronavirus has come to unite us and regardless of our differences, we are working together to eliminate it,” Sang said. He added that port workers were losing so much due to their internal and external divisions. “The Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) human resource department had capitalised on these conflicts to set unfavourable policies. We shall not allow divisions to break us anymore,” Sang said. The union has negotiated with KPA about working conditions, compensation and staff who work till 11pm and cannot go home because of the curfew. They are drafting a report, as directed by the human resource department, containing working schedules during the Covid-19 pandemic. Their proposals include 12-hour shifts for those working with non-heavy machines—from 6am-6pm and 6pm-6am—with four hours of compensated overtime. For those working with heavy machinery, they propose three shifts—7am-3pm, 3pm-6pm and 6pm-6am. They propose that the shifts should be on a seven-day rotational basis so each group works in each of the shifts. Kaneno added that they have proposed a one-month allowance for employees who might test positive with coronavirus. “We are ready to discuss any matter with KPA for the welfare of our members,” he said. The last meeting was held on Friday between Sang, his deputy Anthony Odero, Kaneno, chief shop steward Badi Mohammed, and the KPA officials. Edited by Frank Obonyo
