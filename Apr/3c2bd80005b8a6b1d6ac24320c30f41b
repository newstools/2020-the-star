Classic 105 FM radio presenter Maina Kageni is not in the hospital as reported by some blogs. Speaking to Word Is, the radio king said, "I have just come from seeing a doctor. I was not feeling well yesterday I was vomiting and running a fever. I went in, tests were run, I was treated and discharged.. I'm fine." Colleague Mike Mondo says his statement was misquoted when he went live on Instagram yesterday with Kiss FM's Kamene Goro. Speaking to Word Is on the phone Mondo said, "What I said is that I will be doing breakfast tomorrow because Maina is unwell. There is nowhere I said that he is admitted," he said. He added; "Maina is doing well it's just ile kukua unwell ya kawaida (it's just that normal feeling of being unwell), otherwise he is at his home." Maina is also enjoying his annual leave and Mondo has been covering his breakfast show on Classic 105.
