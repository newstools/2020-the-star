About a week ago, Health CS Mutahi Kagwe said that Kenya was concerned about the rise in the number of positive Covid-19 cases in neighbouring countries. Despite this concern, at least four cases announced this week are of persons who were across the borders recently. The second case in Kwale county announced on Tuesday was that of a woman who had travelled from Tanzania on April 13. Three of the cases in Nairobi were reported as persons who had visited Somalia recently. The two countries had fewer cases than Kenya but their numbers have more than doubled in the last 10 days. As the government continues to restrict movement within the country, it is probably a good time to stop movement through the borders. The government should deploy more security forces along the borders which have in the past proven to be porous. At the same time, Kenyans are seeing the government continue to enhance operations to curb the virus. However, recent revelations that Kemri is underfunded to the extent of not having enough testing materials is a matter of concern. The government must do all it can to ensure that the institution is well funded and has the capacity to do its job.
