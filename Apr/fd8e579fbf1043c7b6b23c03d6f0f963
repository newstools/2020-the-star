Residents of Kivou in Mwingi are up in arms over a quarry abandoned by a Chinese contractor in 2014 that has claimed two lives recently. In the latest incident, an 11-year-old boy drowned while swimming with his friends in rainwater that had filled the quarry. The Standard 6 boy was herding cattle when together with his friends decided to swim in the quarry. The quarry was dug to extract ballast during the construction of Kyuso-Kamuwongo road. Upon completion of the road up to Kamuwongo, the Chinese contractor left without filling it up, despite an agreement to do so. Landowner Joseph Mailu said the contractor was supposed to rehabilitate the quarry after extracting the ballast needed for construction. “After completing their extraction, they left without adhering to our agreement and nothing was explained to us,” Mailu said. Mailu said that due to their negligence, lives have been lost on his farm. Mwingi senior chief Harrison Mutia sought to know how the China WU YI Company handed over to the environment agency while leaving the place unattended. Sammy Munyithya, another resident, said the quarry is not fenced and exposes both human and animal lives to danger. Munyithya added that most rocks are hanging loosely, hence pose risk to passers-by and children playing around the area. “This quarry gives us nothing but sleepless nights. We want the relevant authorities to act swiftly to avert loss of more lives,” he said. (edited by o. owino)
