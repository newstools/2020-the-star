Northeastern regional coordinator Nicodemus Ndalana on Thursday warned Mandera residents against defying Covid-19 control measures, saying they risk being jailed. He said Mandera has a low population and the virus could spread fast if not checked. “I would like to warn people who continue to break the rules that are in place to help us mitigate the spread of the virus. We will arrest and impose heavy fines on you. I call upon everybody to be responsible to enable us to fight Covid-19,” Ndalana said. Movement into and out of Mandera has been banned after the county recorded eight coronavirus cases. Ndalana said security forces will set up roadblocks at Takaba on the Moyale entry and exit and Kutullo on the Wajir highway. Kenya borders Ethiopia to the north and Somalia to the east, with Wajir and Mandera residents sharing a lot in common with nationals of the two countries. Apart from trade and healthcare, residents from Bula Sufti in Ethiopia and Bula Hawa in Somalia, which are less than 10 kilometers away, share blood relationships with Kenyans at the border. Ndalana urged residents along River Daua to move to safe areas because their lives are at risk after the river flooded. The river has displaced people as far as Mandera town, which is more than three kilometres away. Governor Ali Roba said they have identified 86,000 vulnerable households who need support. Speaking at the launch of the food distribution programme, Roba said the most vulnerable groups include Dugsi/Madrassa teachers, people living with HIV and internally displaced persons. He urged the national government and other development partners to provide support to these categories of people. Edited by Frank Obonyo
