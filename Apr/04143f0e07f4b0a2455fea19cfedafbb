Renowned scholar Prof Mohamed Hyder has died at his home in Kizingo, Mombasa, after a long illness. The 88-year-old has left behind a widow and three children. Hyder studied at Allidina School for his primary and secondary education. He then joined Makerere University, where he studied Education. Hyder then went to Scotland to further his studies in the field of Biology, which was his passion. He came back to Makerere University to be an assistant lecturer and after some time he got a scholarship and went back to Scotland to do his master's and PhD. He was the first Kenyan PhD marine scientist. While teaching at Makerere, he also conducted research in marine and fisheries. He later got a job at the University of Nairobi. Hyder set up and headed the College of Biological Sciences at UoN. Some of his former students include Deputy President William Ruto and Technical University of Mombasa vice chancellor Laila Abubakar. Hyder practised dairy farming in Mtongwe, Mombasa. Ten years ago he retired from UoN and started a lobby Muslim group at Kizingo. He was the chairman. Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho took to social media to give his condolences. "Mombasa mourns the loss of one of its great sons, Prof Mohamed Hyder Matano.Â  A great scholar and known to many across the world for his knowledge, wisdom, kindness and humility," Joho wrote. Communication scientist Julius Kirigha, who also wrote a film about Hyder, said academia has lost a very important person. "His contributions in the field of academics were great and we wish he could stay longer," Kirigha said. Edited by Josephine M. Mayuya
