Churches have been allowed to have a limited number of attendees to broadcast their services, as long as they maintain social distance. Justice James Makau on Thursday temporarily allowed broadcasting crews of the churches and church leaders to broadcast their services to their members. In the case, two pastors had moved to court in a bid to suspend the directive on church gatherings being barred by the state. Justice Makau has barred the police from victimising and harassing those who will be in the churches for purposes of broadcasting services. “Pending the hearing and determination of this application, the courts be pleased to order that the alternative forms of worship such as broadcasting of church service be allowed on specific days to allow the various churches to broadcast to their faithful congregants without victimisation and harassment of the broadcasting crew, church elders and leaders and congregants who will be part of the church service, by the second and third respondents or their agents and representatives,” the order reads. The order, however, is unclear on the number of people allowed to be present for broadcasting of services.
