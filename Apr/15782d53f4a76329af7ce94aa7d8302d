Kenyans will start enjoying faster 4G internet in August when the government projects to have the entire country covered by Google Loon Services. ICT CS Joe Mucheru on Friday told a parliamentary committee that his ministry will within the next 90 days ensure 100 per cent coverage across the country. He said the service launched by President Uhuru Kenyatta at State House last month will enable Kenyans do more from wherever they are. Most people have been working from home since the first case of the coronavirus was reported in the country. By end of this month, the CS said, four balloons will fly over Kitui, Kirinyaga all the way to Maralal airspace ahead of nationwide coverage in August. Mucheru was before the Senate committee on Covid-19 chaired by Nairobi Senator Johnson Sakaja. He told the team that Google will offer the services free during the period of the pandemic. On March 23, Uhuru announced the approval of Loon services in the country to enable universal 4G data coverage. He said the approval was in line with the government’s measures to respond to the disruptions caused by the global pandemic. “In that regard, and to foster communication and enable Kenyans to retain and enhance remote access to the offices and enterprises, my administration has granted approvals that will ensure universal 4G data coverage throughout Kenya,” the President said. The first balloon arrived in the Kenyan space just a week following  Uhuru's announcement confirming the approval given to Alphabet Company, Google’s parent firm, and Telkom to fly the balloons in the country’s airspace.
