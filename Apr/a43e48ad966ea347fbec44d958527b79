Treasury CS Ukur Yatani’s new nominee for the National Government Constituency Development Fund CEO is set to be vetted by a House committee. Yatani nominated current acting CEO Yusuf Mbuno after the House rejected the first nominee Mohamed Abdille. Under the new regulations, should Parliament reject a nominee, then the Treasury CS is compelled to submit another name to Parliament for consideration from the remaining two submitted by the board. According to the board's report, acting CEO Yusuf Mbuno was ranked first followed by university don Abdille. Jackton Omulo Akelo came in third. The law requires the CEO of the board to be recruited by the board through a competitive process. Three names are forwarded to the Cabinet Secretary for appointment after getting the National Assembly’s approval. On Tuesday, National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi directed the NGCDF committee chaired by Maoka Maore to vet the nominee and report back to the House within 14 days. “The Cabinet Secretary is asking the House to approve the appointment of Yusuf Mbuno for the position of NG-CDF CEO. I, therefore, refer the name to Select Committee to undertake approval hearings,” Muturi said. The speaker further urged the Maoke-led team to notify the nominee and members of the public of the venue of vetting. The committee is expected to table its report before the House on April 29 for members' consideration. The NGCDF board has been operating without a substantive CEO since 2011 and two attempts to fill the position have failed before the House. In 2012, the first attempt to have a substantive CEO flopped after the House term ended before the relevant committee processed the nominee as required by law. A second stab was made in 2017 when MPs rejected the nomination of Wilfred Buyema, raising concerns about the recruitment process and the fact that the board was then not fully constituted. The House then advised reconstitution of the board and the process started afresh Edited by R.Wamochie
