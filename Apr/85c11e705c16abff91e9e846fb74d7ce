At least 10 shops have been broken into and looted in Lamu since the curfew started across the country to curb coronavirus. Residents suspect police are involved as they are the only ones supposed to be outside during the curfew. If not, the residents said, they are colluding with those behind the burglaries and vandalism. Several kiosk owners have reported finding their premises broken into and looted dry. Most affected areas are Langoni in Lamu town, Wiyoni, Bombay and Kashmir. The affected traders want to know how the thieves were able to break into their shops and steal despite the heavy presence of security officers on patrol to enforce the curfew. Sharuti Ali said the government should provide a guarantee for the safety of their businesses once they close them and head home for curfew. “Just the first day and already shops are being looted. The second day, the same. This means whoever is doing his plans to ground our businesses. The big question is, who? Everyone is at home and there are police officers on patrol, Ali said." Residents of the town have criticised the police for 'portraying inability to handle the curfew' owing to the reported crimes since it began. “Obviously, we suspect either the police alone of they are working with whoever is breaking into these shops. Once the curfew hours kick in, it is only the police who are out on the streets, Anything that goes wrong outside will be entirely on them," Shifa Munira said. Musa Abdullahi said he was shocked when he walked into his shop on Sunday morning to find half of his stock missing. “I almost fainted. They took the most precious commodities like bags of sugar, flour, cooking oil and others." County commissioner Irungu Macharia defended his officers saying they were not responsible for the break-ins "if any". He said no such incidents had been reported to his office. “I am appealing to anyone affected to file a report with the police so we can investigate." Edited by R.Wamochie
