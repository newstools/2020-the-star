A Kisumu county boda boda rider accused of stabbing his client to death will be arraigned and charged on May 4. Stephen Onyango, who was based at Ahero Township, allegedly murdered his cousin Peter Owate last Friday after dropping him home in Kobura village, Nyando. They scuffled after failing to agree on the fare. On Monday, Nyando resident magistrate Reuben Sang ordered the suspect to appear in court after two weeks, following a request by DCI officer Phillip Otieno, who needed more time to conclude investigations. The accused was held at Ahero police station. Nyando OCPD Lawrence Matete said the rider ferried Owate, who paid Sh50 upon arrival at his home, but Onyango demanded another Sh50. Owate refused, prompting a fight. Onyango then grabbed a kitchen knife and stabbed him several times in the chest. Onyango also suffered stab wounds during the fight. Owate was pronounced dead on arrival at Ahero Subcounty Hospital. His body was transferred to the mortuary at the same facility. Matete condemned the incident and urged residents to resolve their disputes amicably or seek help from judicial facilities, instead of resorting to unlawful measures. "What the suspect did was out of the law. He should have involved the police. I appeal to the public to mediate their disputes," he said. Onyango was rushed by some villagers to a private clinic in Ahero as an irate mob bayed for his blood. According to Dr Felix Orwa, he was unconscious and was bleeding from stab wounds. "He was brought in the evening in an unstable condition. We managed to stitch the wounds to limit and stop the bleeding, after which he stabilised," he said. Orwa said the mob was so unruly that he could not release Onyango from the clinic for his protection. "There was a big crowd here. He got stable after some time, but we feared the crowd, which was shouting and was disorderly, would descend on him. I, therefore, called the police to pick him," he said.
