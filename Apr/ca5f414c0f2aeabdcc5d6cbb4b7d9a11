The government has directed all the barbershops and salon operators to ensure that they wear masks while attending to their clients. Announcing the latest government directive, Health CAS Mercy Mwangangi on Wednesday said the measure is meant to protect both the operators and their clients from being exposed to the novel coronavirus. The directive is expected to take effect immediately.  The CAS said that further instructions to prevent crowding in barber and salon shops will be communicated soon by the government. She has also asked them to observe hygiene in their daily operations. The new directive comes on the day the government announced seven new cases of the coronavirus in the country. This now raises Kenya's total Covid-19 cases to 179. All seven are Kenyans. Five of these areÂ from Nairobi, one from Mombasa and one from Uasin Gishu. Out of the seven, four are female and three are male. The seven have been moved to isolation facilities and contract tracing of the patients' close contacts have begun. The CAS added that one patient who had been under ICU in a private institution has been moved to the general ward. 49 out of the 179 cases reported so far are aged between 16 and 29 years. Mwangangi also announced two more patients have been discharged after two more cases tested negative.
