A police van with officers enforcing the 7pm curfew was pelted with stones by unknown persons in Kyuso, Kitui county on Sunday. One police officer was hit on the left arm at Kandwia trading centre during the 9pm incident. Kyuso subcounty police boss Charles Machinji said that the injured policeman was treated at Kyuso Level 4 Hospital and discharged. “My officers who numbered seven were on patrol to enforce the curfew and had just packed their vehicle at Kandwia market around 9pm when out of the blues stones started raining on them,” Machinji said on phone. Machinji said the no other officer was injured and the police vehicle was not damaged. He added that the goons took advantage of the darkness and threw stones from behind shops. Machinji said he had to restrain his officers when they informed him about the ambush. “I asked them not to open fire in darkness as there was a possibility of accidentally hitting a person who was not involved. I ordered them to return to their base at Kyuso,” he said. The police boss said the attack on the security officers was a show of ignorance by the locals on the importance of the curfew imposed by the government. Machinji said that he would visit the Kandwia area to sensitise locals on the essence of strictly adhering to the terms of the curfew. Investigations into the attack on the policemen is underway, he said.  (edited by o. owino)
