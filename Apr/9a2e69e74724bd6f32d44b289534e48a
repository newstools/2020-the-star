Activists in the Kuria community are offering free sanitary towels and support to girls outside school during the fight against coronavirus. Natalie Robi of Msichana Empowerment Kuria alongside other colleagues in Kenya and Spain have set up a menstrual care bank where more than 100 girls and women have benefitted since the coronavirus scourge was confirmed in Kenya. “Menstruation doesn't stop during this period. With the curfew and slowing of the economy it has been hard for women and girls from vulnerable backgrounds to manage their menstruation during the crisis,” Robi told the Star. From their headquarters in Ikerege in Kuria West constituency, the organisation has also been on high alert regarding cases of gender based violence, which Robi said have been on the rise since schools were closed. Robi said most girls used to get their supplies from schools, which are now closed. “We are setting up a food bank of dry food like rice, beans and maize after mapping out 100 vulnerable families,” she said. She urged activists to be on high alert to ensure cases of gender based violence are tackled, especially sexual abuse on school children, teen pregnancy and marriage. Migori Civil Society Association secretary Titus Orwa said most parents had stopped their roles especially after schools were closed. “We have children who have ignored calls for social distance and mass gathering as their parents have incorporated them to sell wares,” Orwa said. He said activists will ensure rights of minors are upheld after courts scaled down their activities and police are busy enforcing Covid-19 prevention measures. “Women and girls are still at a great risk of exploitation, sexual violence in the home and neglect. We need to be alert to ensure no increase in child marriage during this time,” Orwa said. Edited by Henry Makori
