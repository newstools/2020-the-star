Eighteen youth have been arrested while partying while naked in Nairobi's Kilimani area. In a police report on Monday, one of the residents reported that at about 6.45 pm on Sunday, there was a party in a house within the estate. Police visited the apartment in Hurliqueen Courts and found the 18 all naked and in possession of a camera. The 18 were all taken to Kilimani Police Station and booked under OB number 33 of 26/04/2020 for illegal gathering as police carry out the investigation. Two out of the 18 were aged 14 years. The government last Friday extended the dawn to dusk curfew to contain the spread of coronavirus pandemic. The government has also asked Kenyans to practice social distancing thereby banning going to churches where there are more than 15 people including parties and funerals. But many have defied these orders with others still gathering and partying. Health Chief Administrative Secretary Mercy Mwangangi last week said those found breaching curfew rules would be rounded up and put in mandatory quarantine at their own costs. The decision is part of the government's move to ensure strict enforcement of the dusk-to-dawn curfew to curb the spread of coronavirus. “I think this is important to note because once you are out during curfew hours it is assumed that you have now been exposed and, therefore, you will be taken to quarantine centres for 14 days at your own cost,” Mwangangi said.
