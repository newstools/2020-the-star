A miraa pick-up truck driver is among 70 people forced into quarantine in Meru after he was found sneaking two people from Nairobi into the county. Meru county commissioner Allan Machari said 57 of those being held were arrested on Wednesday. They are being quarantined at the Kenya Medical Training College in Meru town. Machari said people like the driver will not be tolerated adding that they may be forced to ban the use of vehicles that are being used to traffic people from coronavirus hotspot counties. Meru medical services director Koome Muthuri told journalists at KMTC that the 57 were arrested after breaking the dusk-to-dawn curfew and for not wearing face masks, being in bars and not keeping social distance. Muthuri said they will intensify the enforcement of health directives to ensure residents help prevent the spread of coronavirus. He said they had strict instructions from Governor Kiraitu Murungi to aid the fight against the pandemic. Nyambene Miraa Traders Association chairman Kimathi Munjuri said any driver disobeying directives to curb the spread of Covid-19 must carry their own cross. He said the driver had delivered Miraa in Eastleigh in Nairobi. Edited by P.O
