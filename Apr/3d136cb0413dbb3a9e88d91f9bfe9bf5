Former Kenya Power acting MD Jared Othieno has been appointed as the new managing director and chief executive officer of the Geothermal Development Company. GDC Board of Directors chairman John Njiraini said the new boss was appointed after a competitive process that involved 64 applicants. Interviews were conducted by the board and the appointment approved by Energy Cabinet Secretary Charles Keter. Eng Othieno takes over from Eng Johnson ole Nchoe who has been at the helm for four years. "The appointment takes effect on April 19, following the expiry of the term of the outgoing managing director," the board said in a statement released on Wednesday. Njiraini congratulated Othieno on his appointment and wished him success in his new role. "I also wish to thank Nchoe for his service to GDC particularly for the achievements attained during his tenure," he said. Eng Othieno has a bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering and a master's degree in Business administration from the University of Nairobi. At Kenya Power, he rose to become the managing director, a position he held from July 2018 to October last year. Nchoe is now among the few CEOs to leave the public service without being linked to any scandal. During his tenure, the GDC’s net profit grew six times to Sh1.4 billion as of June 2018. The growth was driven by increased steam sales and the absence of the prior year’s Sh991 million one-off charge. Nchoe holds a Master of Business Administration (MBA) and BSc both from the University of Nairobi. Before taking over at GDC, he was on a two-year assignment at the Liberia Electricity Corporation, where he served as director and helped the West African country to rebuild its electricity network. The outgoing boss also served as the chief manager in charge of IT and Telecommunications at the Kenya Power Company until 2013.
