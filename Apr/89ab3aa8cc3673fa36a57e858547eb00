Wazalendo players will have the opportunity to choose their new captain when the team resumes training, coach Fidelis Kimanzi has hinted. This comes in the wake of Kennedy Munialo’s shift to defending champions Butali Warriors in favour of greener pastures. Munialo, an all-round player, ended his six-year stint with Wazalendo and his exit is giving the tactician headache on how to fill the void he left. Vice-captain Mathew Mutiso will not resume the role having been a peripheral figure in the team last season, thanks to a muscle injury that kept the marauding forward out of action for the better part of the season. Kimanzi said the players will have the right to pick on their new leader after Mutiso, who only returned to action in the ultimate match of the season, decided to take a break. “Our biggest challenge now is who to pick as the captain. We have three players in mind whom we believe, as the technical bench, have the capacity to guide this team but it is up to the players to decide who they want. It is better if the decision comes from the playing unit. Mutiso wants a break. He only returned recently from a bad injury. He could be the perfect fit having done it before but it won’t be possible,” Kimanzi observed. “The team will decide on the matter immediately we return to action and there’s nothing to worry about.” Wazalendo will be hoping to pick from where they left last season having finished second.
