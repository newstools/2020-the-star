Two criminals who shot dead a university student in Umoja were shot dead in a dramatic hou- long shoot out with detectives in Ruiru. They were shot dead by Special Service Unit officers after a chase and firing at Kamakis area on Wednesday afternoon. Police linked the two to the killing of Rodgers Opiyo, a fourth year university student who was shot dead while buying medicine for his sick mother at a chemist in Phadam Hospital in Umoja, Nairobi last week. Opiyo had identified one of the two, who were on a robbery mission at the chemist during curfew time. They shot him and escaped via motorbike. On Tuesday, police, acting on intelligence information ambushed the two with the same motorbike without a registration number in Ruiru area. They responded to calls to surrender by firing at police officers prompting a shootout which lasted for than one hour, Kiambu police boss said Ali Nunow told the Star. “At around 11am, we received information that they had been spotted along Eastern Bypass. The two were fatally injured as we engaged them,” Nunow said. During the fracas, two members of public were shot at, as the two criminals shot indiscriminately targeting the SSU detectives who were in plain clothes. The condition of the two is yet to be established. Police recovered a Ceska Pistol and the motorbike. One of the suspects enjoyed his criminal lifestyle, regularly posting his pictures donning chains with captions that lay bare his profession. “Even though I'm marked for death, I'm gonna spark till my last breath,” reads on of his posts on his Facebook account under the name Bugii King Ihab. In another post he wrote: “I no longer live in fear… my pistol close in hand.. convinced this is my year.” Last week, police vowed to trace the two after killing the student.
