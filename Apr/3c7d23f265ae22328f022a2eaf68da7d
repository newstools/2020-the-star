Police officers in Isiolo county have received a consignment of hand sanitiser from the East African Breweries Limited. EABL Eastern regional head Collins Wachira said as part of corporate social responsibility, they opted to first distribute the sanitiser to the police because they are exposed to possible coronavirus carriers while on the line of duty due to the many people they interact with. He spoke at the police grounds when he handed over the consignment which comprised 70 boxes with 24 pieces of 100ml hand sanitiser each. “The company will do other phases of distribution soon, targeting other departments that are prone to the virus,” he said. Isiolo Governor Mohamed Kuti and county commissioner Herman Shambi, who jointly co-chair the County Covid 19 Emergency Response Committee, received the consignment and lauded the company for the gesture of goodwill towards the police. “The hand sanitiser is small and easy to carry and will enable the police officers to carry them wherever they go while on duty,” Shambi said. Governor Kuti asked the donor to also consider providing more for use by the over 3,000 boda boda operators in the county who are also prone to the virus as they cannot carry passengers and still maintain social distance. The leaders pleaded with members of the public to abide with the directives issued by the Ministry of Health in order to keep the virus at bay, given that the county is yet to report any case.
