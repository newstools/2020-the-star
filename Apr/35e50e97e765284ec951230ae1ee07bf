Nyeri clergymen have backed a move by three pastors who have gone to court seeking orders to press the government to allow re-opening of churches. Foursquare Gospel Church in Kenya's bishop Erastus Njoroge, however, said the faithful were ready to adhere to the government's directives in the fight against Covid-19. The bishop said as much as the country wanted to fight coronavirus, there should be no discrimination of some of the groupings in obeying the directives. "I believe the congregation can be more organised than matatu operators, market traders or even boda boda operators," the bishop said. He said the faithful were ready to wash hands, use sanitiser, wear face masks,Â  gloves and observe social distancing in church. The bishop noted that it was only in the church that one could find solace, repent and seek God's healing. Bishop Njoroge added that it is through prayers that God will save the world from Covid-19. The bishop complained that the church was not consulted during the issuance of new directives by the state on the fight against coronavirus. Last week, three pastors moved to the High Court in Nairobi seeking to compel the government to re-open the worship houses, saying congregations were ready to adhere to health directives. The case will be heard on Thursday this week. Edited by Henry Makori
