Kiambu Senator Kimani Wamatangi has started distributing free water to areas where there is a shortage to help residents maintain hygiene. The senator is also giving out hand sanitiser and fumigating homes to fight Covid-19 in the villages. He has partnered with volunteers in educating residents on good hygiene and advising them to observe social distancing. Joyce Wanja, a resident of Kirumbi village in Kiambaa subcounty, said on Monday that the area has been hit by a water shortage and they have to walk many kilometres in search of the commodity. “We are grateful for this gesture by our senator because we don't have water in our village,” Wanja said. Eddah Wanjiru said since the coronavirus outbreak in the country, it has been difficult to maintain proper hygiene at all times due to lack of water. “This area has been abandoned, and we have asked the county government to take up the matter, but that is yet to happen,” Wanjiru said. Resident Danson Gitau called on well-wishers to donate food to needy residents who have heeded the government's call to stay at home to stop the spread of coronavirus. “The people heeded the government's call to stay at home, but they do not have food, water and other basic needs,” he said. Gitau said though the senator has been educating residents on Covid-19, more needs to be done to educate people on the ground on how to prevent the spread of the virus and why social distancing important.
