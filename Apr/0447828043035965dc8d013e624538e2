  Plenary sittings of the Nairobi county assembly will only resume after the end of the 21-day containment period for the city metropolis. President Uhuru Kenyatta ordered a cessation of movement in and out of the Nairobi Metropolitan Area for three weeks from April 6 to curb the spread of coronavirus. County assembly speaker Beatrice Elachi on Wednesday said some MCAs had travelled out of Nairobi and have been locked out of the city by the containment order. She said it would only be fair that the assembly resumes after the MCAs return to the city. Plenary sittings were suspended on March 8  for 30 days as a preventative measure against the spread of coronavirus and are expected to resume on April 16. “We have to wait for the 21 days to end before house plenary sittings can resume,” Elachi told the Star. There had been fears in the assembly after three MCAs and some members of staff travelled outside the country in February. They were thought to have contracted the virus. The speaker urged the ward representatives and workers to observe preventative measures issued by the Ministry of Health. Two weeks ago, the assembly held a special sitting to consider the Nairobi City County Supplementary Appropriation Bill, 2020. The house also acceded to the designation of Enosh Momanyi as the Authority to Incur Expenditure (AIE) holder of the Nairobi Metropolitan Services. Elachi only allowed 42 members in the chamber due to the coronavirus pandemic. Members aged 55 years and above were not be allowed in the assembly precincts since they are more vulnerable to the virus. They were advised to stay at home.  Edited by Peter Obuya
