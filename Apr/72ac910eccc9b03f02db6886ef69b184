Deputy President William Ruto has asked Kenyans to play their role in ensuring guidelines issued to contain Covid-19Â  are followed. "Fellow countrymen/women, HE the President has issued enhanced measures including containment in Nairobi, Kilifi, Kwale and Mombasa; use of face masks; supply of free water in informal settlements. It's our patriotic duty to do our part to ensure these measures succeed. We shall overcome," DP Ruto tweeted. This followed President Uhuru Kenyatta's address to the nation on coronavirus on Monday from State House, Nairobi. Uhuru told Kenyans to wear masks in public places and to wash hands to protect themselves. "I have faith in Kenyans. We must turn out for our country by sticking to government measures," Uhuru said. He also ordered the cessation of movement within Nairobi metropolis for the next 21 days starting today. The President announced Kenya now has 158 confirmed Covid-19 cases. He added that Covid-19 does not know religion, tribe, the colour of your skin and the size of your wallet. "We must face the enemy standing side by side. Our unity will be demonstrated by each Kenyan going the extra mile to ensure our personal conduct does not endanger others". Uhuru said the ministries of Health, Industry and Trade will ensure tailors are provided with proper information on which materials to use to make the masks effective. DP Ruto has been missing from Uhuru's national addresses. Edited by E.Kibii
