 Procter & Gamble on Thursday donated 16,000 sanitary towels to Amref Health Africa's Youth Programme at the Amref International University. The sanitary towels are to be distributed through grassroots' youth-led organisations in Nairobi and Samburu counties. Sanitary towels remain a critical challenge for many girls in Kenya, a situation that has been aggravated by the coronavirus outbreak. P&G’s Kenya manager Simon Mwangi said, "Sanitary towels are not an option but a basic need. Most women have been affected by this pandemic, most of them have to choose between having a meal and buying a pack of sanitary towels." Amref Health Africa group director of programmes Mette Kinoti said the response by the private sector to the need comes in handy. "Through support from the private sector, we are able to reach out to large numbers of women in the slums like Kibera and Mathare and other parts of the country like Samburu," Kinoti said. She urged organisations and the government to also consider sanitary towels in their donations. "Since it has become very difficult to access non-perishable food staples like toilet paper and hand sanitiser, various organisations and the government should consider adding a pack of sanitary towels as they plan donations.” Rights advocate Editar Ochieng said girls from slums accessed sanitary towels at school since the government enhanced the Education Amendment Act in 2017. "But since schools have been closed due to the coronavirus outbreak, they cannot get them now." "Young girls in my area are having sex for as low as Sh40 for them to afford even one towel. This has made it difficult for them to manage their periods safely and with dignity," Ochieng said. She thanked Procter and Gamble for the donation and urged more organisations to come on board to help girls and women from unprivileged backgrounds have an easy time as the country battles with Covid-19.
