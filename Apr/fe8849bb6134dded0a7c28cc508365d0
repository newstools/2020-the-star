Mathare United forward Dani Lual has hailed club's physical trainer Dismus Onyango for his virtual programs which have helped him keep fit. The South Sudanese has revealed that Onyango had gone a notch higher for the time the league and public gatherings are suspended to organise video links for the entire squad. He said the videos are made up of tips to train at home and have helped him to remain fit for the weeks they have been out of action. "We normally train four days a week under the guidance of Onyango. He sends instructions through video links which have proved helpful thus far. I feel fit even though I miss training with the rest of the team and playing league matches," he said. The lanky striker joined the Slum Boys in January from Atlabara. He was among the best scorers in last year's Cecafa U20 championships held in Uganda.
