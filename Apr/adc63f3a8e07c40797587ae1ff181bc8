Two people died on Monday after a quarry they were working in collapsed at Kwa Chepsat in Baringo county. Perkera assistant chief Sheila Torokwo said Petero Kadija, 34, and Alex Miroya, 28. died on the spot during the 2pm incident. A colleague escaped with injuries. “The survivor, only identified as Joram was rushed to Eldama-Ravine nursing home where he is receiving treatment. Doctors say he is in stable condition,” Torokwo said on Tuesday. She said the three were casuals working in the quarry. “Residents and police officers rushed to the scene to rescue the victims but unfortunately the two died,” Torokwo said. The administrator said loose soil made the exercise tedious. “We had to ask for an excavator used by a county contractor working on nearby road construction to assist in removing the heap of soil and stones,” she said. The bodies were removed several hours after the quarry caved in. The bodies were taken to Eldama Ravine Subcounty Hospital mortuary. Koibatek police boss Maxwell Agoro urged quarry workers to suspend work until the downpour subsides, saying they are putting their lives at risk. Lembus-Perkera MCA Paul Serem condoled with the families of the two men. Serem also condoled with families who lost loved ones during Saturday's mudslide in the neighbouring Elgeyo-Marakwet and West Pokot counties. “This is another disaster hitting our country besides the coronavirus pandemic and I appeal to our people living in the lower areas to move to higher safer ground to avert more deaths,” he said. He appealed to the government to fast-track food and non-food donations to help the victims. Edited A.N
