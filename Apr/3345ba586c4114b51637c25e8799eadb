Relegated Kenya sides Kisumu RFC and Western Bulls have welcomed the cancellation of the entire 2019-2020 Kenya Rugby Union (KRU) season. The move means that the two clubs which were relegated after just a season in Kenya Cup maintain their status. Kisumu RFC coach Brian Makalama and his Bulls' counterpart Bram Shikanda will have another opportunity to play in the top tier league. In an interview, Shikanda said: “It’s a great opportunity for the boys to show up for the party again. The decision favours us. It is like being given another opportunity by God to repent after missing the cut off by a whisker.” “I feel sorry for teams that had a good run in the season especially the championship sides. However, desperate times, call for such decisions,” added Shikanda. Makalama said the move to cancel the entire season was good news for his team who finished bottom of the 12-team league, winning only one game. “We are now back to square one. The boys learnt a lot during the campaign because it was their first time to play in the Kenya Cup. I’m sure they will give a good account of themselves next season,” he said. He, however, challenged the management to look for sponsorship following the withdrawal of Silverstone Airlines. The moved by KRU to cancel the entire season has drawn mixed reactions with Kenya Cup promotion candidates Strathmore Leos and Masinde Murilo University of Science and Technology (MMUST) rejecting the move and saying it was done without consulting key stakeholders including the club chairmen. Leos coach Louis Kisia and his MMUST counterpart Ochieng Ahaya faulted the union, saying the board should have indefinitely suspended the season instead of unilaterally cancelling it. Kisia and Ahaya separately demanded that the decision be rescinded. On Thursday, KRU secretary Ian Mugambi announced the cancellation of the entire season— in a move that will affect promotion and relegation in Kenya Cup, KRU Championship and Nationwide leagues.
