Nameless says during this quarantine season, he has discovered he is a natural psychologist. He urged fellow Kenyans to make use of this season to learn something about themselves. Taking to Instagram, Nameless wrote, "Use this time to discover things about yourself that you couldn't find out due to the hustle of life. "Work on self-growth and self-awareness. Discover gifts you never knew you had and truths you never discovered. "I discovered I am a natural psychologist and philosopher. I knew I always interested in understanding human behaviours and principles of life. "But I never delved in it because I rarely found people I could have pleasant debates with about the meaning of life. Studying more about it and loving it. Keep discovering your inner gifts. Google is your friend." Nameless unveiled his hidden talents days after Vera Sidika said she is a painter at heart and will be rolling out artworks in due course. She said she is going back to what she loves most and that she neglected her talent as she expanded her portfolio. “Sweethearts, I’m going back to drawing and painting. For y’all that probably don’t know, I have talent in art yup. I am an artist. I’ll be creating a few art pieces soon and record an entire process while at it! It’s about to be fun,” she wrote on her Instastories.
