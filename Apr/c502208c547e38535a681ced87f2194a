Kenyans on Wednesday showed their solidarity with health care workers nationwide by applauding them with a one minute clap at 12 noon amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Nairobi, Mombasa, Voi, Murang'a, Kisii, Makueni, Nyeri are some of the counties that joined in showing gratitude to the medics' hard work. Radio Africa Limited staffers also joined Kenyans across the country at noon by applauding the medics for selflessly being on the frontline in the fight against the coronavirus. Every Wednesday at exactly noon, Kenyans have been urged to spare a minute to applaud the country's medics for a few minutes, a move that shows that their services are highly appreciated. Apart from the health care workers, others to be applauded include journalists, police officers among others on the frontline in the fight against Covid-19. The Kenya Editors Guild (KEG) announced on Tuesday it was starting the campaign in conjunction with the Kenya Medical Association and National Nurses Association of Kenya. “Finding credible information and delivering it to Kenyans is every journalist’s duty. That duty puts many journalists at risk, but it also helps many avoid burdening our health workers and hospitals with sickness," KEG president Churchill Otieno said in a statement. The Kenya Defence Forces on Tuesday showed their solidarity with medical workers by flying military choppers with banners carrying inspirational messages, a move that made Kenyans willing to join the movement. In the UK, citizens, led by Prime Minister Boris Johnson have on several occasions led the country in giving medical workers e a clap for their efforts to contain the virus. The campaign dubbed 'clap for carers' had citizens giving a tribute to health workers. It started last month with many citizens going to their balconies in one big clap for health workers. The Royal Family joined in saluting the medics.
