Police in Lesotho say they will charge a minister caught on CCTV allegedly buying alcoholic drinks during a nationwide lockdown imposed to curb the spread of coronavirus. Lesotho - like its bigger neighbour South Africa - has banned the sale of alcohol during the lockdown.

His deputy in the ministry, Paseka Mokete, said investigations had been completed and the police were ready to charge Mr Moramotse,Â EWN news site reports.
