Renovation works at Kasarani are still ongoing but with strict adherence to the government directives aimed at restricting and controlling the spread of coronavirus, the Cabinet Secretary for Sports, Amb. Amina Mohamed has said. While speaking via Skype on a mid-morning sports show on NTV, Amina asserted that despite the cancellation of some major world events that were to be held in the country, ensuring the venues are ready was necessary. “Works at Kasarani are going on. The stadium was supposed to host the Continental Tour and the  World Athletics Under-20 Championships both of which have been postponed but preparations to host them in the not too distant future are ongoing,” the CS confirmed. Amina went further revealed that they are waiting for communication from World Athletics to ascertain when the events might be held. The Cabinet Secretary also revealed they are waiting for an official statement from organisers of the World Rally Championships to know if the Safari Rally leg of the WRC is cancelled. “As far as we know, the Safari Rally stands cancelled due to the current situation but we await direction from WRC. However, preparations on the parks continue and we hope if a new date is set, it will not be too far,” Amina remarked. The CS said they are considering taking advantage of the situation occasioned by the coronavirus to improve the standards of sports infrastructure across the country.
