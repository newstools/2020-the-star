A man jailed for 15 years for defiling a 16-year-old girl he cohabitated with for three months has been freed on appeal. Justice Roseline Lagat, sitting in Garsen, said it was unjust to incarcerate Jamleck Gitari for what appears to have been an ill-informed budding romance and moral indiscretion on his part and the girl. Gitari was charged with defiling the school dropout and committing an indecent act with her between May 25 and June 10, 2017, in Lamu county. He pleaded innocent, saying  he did not know the girl was a minor. “I looked at her and thought she was of age. I never asked her age,” he said. The girl, Angie (not her real name), had told the court that Gitari, 20, was her husband, having moved to his house in April 2017. They lived as a couple and had consensual sexual intercourse until June 2017. Angie had dropped out of school due to lack of fees. She then moved in  with the man she loved. “She said her parents were not happy with Gitari as he had not asked them for permission to marry her. On her part, she had met his parents,” according to court papers. Her father’s testimony was that Angie left home on March 3, 2017, for an undisclosed place, prompting him to report to the police. He disapproved his daughter's marriage since she was too young and he wanted her to go back to school. After the testimonies of four witnesses, the magistrate sentenced Gitari to 15 years imprisonment. Aggrieved, Gitari appealed against the sentence, maintaining that the magistrate erred by not ensuring that he was provided with witness statements before trial. He asked the High Court to quash the sentence. In her ruling, Justice Lagat said there was existence of a marriage between the appellant and the girl and freed Gitari.  Edited by R.Wamochie
