The Co-operative Bank Group is set to payout Sh5.9 billion worth of dividends to its shareholders for the year 2019. In a statement, the lender announced shareholders would receive the payout Sh1 per share on April 23. This is aimed at increasing cash flow to the grass-root level to the over 15 million-member co-operative movement. “In line with Capital Markets Authority guidelines, the bank is progressing to make the dividend payment for ratification at the next Annual General Meeting,” Co-op Bank company secretary Samuel Kibugi said in a statement. Of the sum total, Sh3.79 billion will be awarded to Co-op Holdings Co-operative Society for its 64.5 per cent stake. To help combat the negative impact of coronavirus, the lender has also made a cash contribution of Sh100 million to the Covid-19 Emergency Response Fund. Last year, the bank reported a Sh14.3 billion profit after tax, a 12.6 per cent growth from Sh12.7 billion the previous year. Last month, Co-op Bank, classified among the country’s biggest lenders, announced plans to acquire Jamii Bora Bank, the second-smallest by market share. Co-operative Bank is Kenya’s fourth-largest lender holding assets worth Sh450 billion ($4.5 billion), while the loss-making Jamii Bora Bank (JBB) has an asset base of Sh12.5 billion ($125 million). The proposed transaction, which is still subject to both shareholders and regulatory approvals, will see Co-op Bank acquire 100 per cent shareholding of JBB, which controls 0.12 per cent of the market.
