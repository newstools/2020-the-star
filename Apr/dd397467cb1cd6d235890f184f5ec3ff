Two groups seeking to control farming in Kinale Forest in Lari subcounty nearly fought with machetes and jembes on Tuesday. Each claim rights to the Plantation Establishment and Livelihood Improvement Schemes plots which allow forest communities to practice conservation farming. Trouble started when one group began uprooting plot beacons to the anger of their rivals. Kinale forest conservator Simon Mwema and a contingent of armed Kenya Forest Service rangers dispersed the groups using tear gas and by firing in the air. Some members of the groups thereafter sought a meeting to solve the dispute, but Mwema declined, citing the ban on gatherings to control the spread of coronavirus. However, one group said they do not recognise the Community Forest Association office led by its chairman Peter Kimani. They recognise Mwaura wa Mugo. They claim that KFS Act does not recognise two CFAs to control one forest. Dominic Chui, a member, asked Environment CS Keriako Tobiko to intervene. Chui said activities in the forest are ongoing and disagreements will follow if they the matter is not resolved. He said blocks that were proposed for Pelis have been demarcated and allocated illegally. “The people with lands will never cultivate in this place until all of us are given lands. We have rights too since we are CFA members,” Chui said. But Kiambu ecosystem conservator Paul Karanja said Kimani is the chairman of Kinale CFA on a three-year term. He said Kimani was elected in 2018 and has until next year before his term ends. “The other office had been in place since 2004. These are some of the changes we have been doing and we want to ensure we achieve good management of the forest,” Karanja said. Karanja said that some members who were disgruntled with the elections were inciting people. The Mugo-led group called Kifoka CBO said they will write to Tobiko demanding the elections be repeated.
