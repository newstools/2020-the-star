Residents living near Eitii Primary School in Kajiado have not had power for 34 days since the area's only transformer was vandalised The transformer serves about 100 homesteads. Residents Rosemary Kaguara and Paul Kipish said their grandchildren and children cannot access e-learning materials offered by their schools. “We have unsuccessfully attempted to inform them about our problem but they have done nothing so far. We are even worried about our security,” Kaguara said. But KPLC Kajiado branch manager Haron Wambugu said he was aware of the problem. He said the company has been slow to fix the problem for lack of a suitable and secure place to instal a new transformer. “That has been our challenge. We do not want to just replace it without considering its security in the face of increased vandalism. I am getting feedback from our security team on Thursday so I can act on the matter,” Wambugu said. Wambugu said another option is to place a new transformer on top of the power line. “This can also prevent thugs from vandalising it,” he said. Eitii is three-and-a-half kilometres from Kajiado town along the newly tarmacked Mashuuru Road. Wambugu said a transformer that served the home of Agriculture and Fisheries CAS Linah Kilimo in Isinya had been moved to her compound for security reasons. “We are now in talks with security personnel, among them chiefs and Nyumba Kumi ambassadors, to work out security details for our transformers,” he said.
