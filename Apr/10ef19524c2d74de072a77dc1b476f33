After a superb performance in a number of road races, former All Africa Games 3,000m steeplechase champion Ruth Bosibori is optimistic of taking his running career to the next level after the current coronavirus madness. After switching to road racing in 2017, Bosibori who won the Nanjing Pukou women’s half marathon in 2017, went ahead to finish second in both Huai’an International Marathon and Jiulong Lake international Half Marathon in China “Since I joined the road running, I have had a successful outing and I am yet to finish in a bad position. I have planned a number of races once the coronavirus pandemic chaos is over,” said Bosibori. In the current situation, where training in groups has been banned, Bosiobori trains as an individual twice a day just to keep herself fit. The former steeplechase star had taken a two-year break after the three Chinese road races following a stress muscle injury but she has since recovered. “I had an injury but I am now recovered fully and I am ready for competitions,” added Bosibori, who was placed fourth in women’s 3,000m steeplechase at the 2007 World Championships in Osaka, Japan. Bosibori was scheduled to run at the Kenya Police Service Championships early last month in a bid to gauge her speed but the event was called off by Athletics Kenya due to the pandemic.
