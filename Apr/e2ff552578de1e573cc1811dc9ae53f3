The Murang’a government will sponsor 20 nurses to undertake Critical Care Nursing Higher Diploma programme at Murang’a Kenya Medical Training College. Governor Mwangi wa Iria said this will ensure the new Intensive Care Unit being established at Murang’a Level 5 Hospital has sufficient medical workers. The county has advertised posts for 13 specialised health workers for the facility, including one radiologist, 10 ICU nurses and two pharmacists. The governor said more than 200 applicants have submitted their applications and interviews will be conducted next Tuesday. “As we fight Covid-19, our medics are our soldiers and we cannot win without them. We want to forge a stronger relationship between the health department and training institutions,” he said. Wa Iria said the ICU unit which has been under construction for 14 days will be ready for use in 21 days. The unit is being done in preparation for Covid-19 that has been ravaging many countries. But the facility will also admit other patients in need of ICU services in the Mt Kenya region, the governor said. Wa Iria said the county government has also written to the Aga Khan Hospital requesting a partnership to ensure the ICU facility takes off as planned. The county government signed a memorandum of understanding with the university to have the students undertake their training in local health facilities last year. It also made a similar arrangement with Murang’a University of Technology to help the institution start offering health sciences courses. “These partnerships will enhance the delivery of health services in the county as the students will be distributed across the county,” he said. KMTC Murang’a principal Evelyn Nyamai praised the county government for its invaluable support that has ensured students get placements in health facilities. Edited by A.N
