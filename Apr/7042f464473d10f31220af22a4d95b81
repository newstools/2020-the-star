Kilifi residents should observe Health ministry directives to reduce the spread of the coronavirus, Governor Amason Kingi has said. Kingi worried that people want to be pushed to observe the rules despite Covid-19 killing thousands of people worldwide. He spoke after meeting stakeholders in Malindi, some of who were pushing for businesses to re-open as they were incurring losses. Kingi said the residents should not dream of a total lockdown since it would have much tougher rules. Further, he said, a lockdown would require the county to spend Sh500 million per month to feed people. “Why should we relax as patient numbers increase to warrant a lockdown?  It's better to observe the rules now that people are allowed to move out,” he said. The governor said of Kilifi's 10 patients, only seven were from the county as the other three had travelled from abroad and were intercepted in Nairobi. Stakeholders present at the meeting included businessmen, police, bodaboda, Kenya Red cross, clergy, market traders, bar and restaurant owners and medical personnel. They questioned the governor on the level of preparedness for response, especially through ICU beds, personal protective equipment among others. Others sought to know how to donate or offer other support to the response team. (edited by o. owino)
