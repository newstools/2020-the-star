One pillar of President Uhuru Kenyatta’s Big Four agenda - food security- is at stake. The Economic Survey 2020 released on Tuesday showed that the level of enrolment for agriculture courses in training institutions is dwindling. President Kenyatta’s administration seeks to place an additional 700,000 acres - including idle arable land - under maize, potato, rice, cotton, and aquaculture and feed production through a public-private partnership to enhance food security. It also seeks to form Agriculture and Irrigation Sector Working Group (AISWAG) to provide coordination for irrigated agriculture as well as using locally blended fertilisers on a 50-50 basis and implement liming. Uhuru also seeks to provide incentives for post-harvest technologies to reduce post-harvest losses from 20 per cent to 15 per cent. However, the survey shows that the critical personnel to implement some of the strategies are shying away from courses offered in institutions of higher learning. The survey notes that agricultural training is geared towards improving human skills to enhance the quality and quantity of agricultural productivity. “The level of enrolment in training institutions is an indicator of the efforts put towards supporting the sector,” the survey states. The survey shows that there was a continued decline in student enrolment at degree level for the second year running from 18,165 in 2018 to 17,392 last year. However, there was increased enrolment at the diploma level. “Diploma level enrolment in agriculture courses at Egerton University increased by 51.6 per cent from 31 students in 2018 to 47 students in 2019. Total diploma level enrolment at Animal Health Training Institutes (AHTIs) increased by 26.9 per cent from 160 in 2018 to 203 in 2019,” the survey says. This was mainly from Kabete, which recorded a 35.4 per cent increase from 99 students in 2018 to 134 students in 2019. Also, there was a slight decrease in agriculture diploma enrolment at Naivasha Dairy Training Institute from 41 students in 2018 to 39 students in 2019. Diploma enrolment at Bukura Agricultural College has, however, witnessed a steady growth since 2014, with the highest increase recorded last year. The rise in enrolment was attributed to the placement of students at the college through the Kenya Universities and Colleges Central Placement Service coupled with an increased number of training programmes offered by the institution. Certificate level enrolment at AHTIs increased from 291 in 2018 to 297 last year. The slow growth was due to a drop in certificate level enrolment at Ndomba from 130 students in 2018 to 114 students last year. Naivasha Dairy Training Institute recorded a 10.6 per cent increase in agricultural enrolment at certificate level from 132 in 2018 to 146 in 2019. Admission to short-term vocational courses decreased for the third year in a row, mainly due to decreases from Naivasha Dairy Training Institute, which has witnessed a declining trend since 2016.
