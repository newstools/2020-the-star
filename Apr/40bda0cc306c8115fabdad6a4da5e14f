Farmers in Bomet have been urged to limit the sale of their harvests and instead preserve it to cushion themselves from coronavirus-related food insecurity. The Kenya National Federation of Farmers said the virus has hurt the economy, hence the need to care about tomorrow. Branch chairman David Tiroto said the situation is becoming unbearable and people must be wary of their action as no one knows what tomorrow holds. The government has introduced tougher measures to contain the virus and they might strain the economy further. "What we are facing as a nation is a real crisis and we might not know the longer it will take before it ends. We might experience a situation where it will not be possible for us to move out of our regions, yet we require food. So let's reserve what we have,” he said at a press conference in Bomet. Secretary John Rono appealed to the county government to support the farmers by providing them with inputs and other market stabilisation instruments such as financial grants to guarantee food security. "While public health is of more immediate concern, farmers are also worried about their livelihoods and the sustainability of their enterprises... They are strained and with such support, it will help them continue earning decent livelihoods while contributing to food and nutrition in the country,” he said. The package, he added, should include administrative measures such as designating produce markets and offering transport during this crisis, facilitating intercounty food trade and abolishing levies imposed on farm produce.
