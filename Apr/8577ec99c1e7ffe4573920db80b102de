A new battlefront has been opened in the seemingly unending supremacy wars between Football Kenya Federation and the Kenyan Premier League. This is after FKF President Nick Mwendwa took to his official Twitter account on Thursday to declare Gor Mahia as the 2019-20 KPL champions and Nairobi City Stars as the National Super League champions. "Congratulations Gor Mahia! You are champions once again and you will represent Kenya on the champions league Next season. Lets do this" tweeted Mwendwa. “Nairobi city stars!! Welcome to the Premier League. Sasa changamkeni na ma signature moto moto (Now get ready by signing quality players)," The federation boss seemingly invoked Article 2.6.1.2 where the mid-season standings were used to determine the champions in either leagues and demoted teams. This also meant that Bidco United joined City Stars in booking places in the elite league by virtue of finishing second in the NSL. Mwendwa's declaration did not sit well with KPL, which in a rejoinder insisted that they had not been consulted before the decision  was made yet they are mandated by law to run the top flight on behalf of the federation. KPL's Chief Executive Officer Jack Oguda criticized FKF for interfering with the running of the top flight.
