Street children in Lodwar have nothing to eat due to the mandatory closure of hotels in the fight against coronavirus. They said they no longer get leftover food from hotels following the outbreak of coronavirus. “We have been feeding on leftovers from one of the renowned hotels in Lodwar town but since the pandemic started we are starving because all the operations of the hotels have been shut down,” Ekeno, one the street children, told the Star. A spot check by the Star established that most hotels are either empty or closed following the government directive requiring hotel owners to only provide takeaway services. A street child only identified as Leakey said they were not getting food because hotels  cooked little food for takeaway services as the demand is low. “We are only left with the option of sniffing glue from the plastic bottles day and night to cool the pangs of hunger. Since the start of curfew, we are forced to sleep in cold verandas of shops early and we cannot get time to rush to the garbage to look for something to feed on. "We also sleep early to avoid movement and punishment by police officers,” he said. Leakey urged well-wishers and the government to consider them and issue them with soaps, sanitiser, face masks and food. “We normally depend on people for our survival in town. It’s not our wish to be in town. We came to beg because we come from poor families that cannot afford a meal in a day,” he said. Turkana county commissioner Boniface Muthama said all street children have parents and homes and they should leave the streets. He said they will flush out all street children and ensure that they get back to their homes to ease operation of the curfew in Lodwar town. “When you say Turkana people are poor, you are lying. Turkana are very rich people since they practise pastoralism. They have many cattle as their source of wealth,” Muthama said. Edited by Henry Makori
