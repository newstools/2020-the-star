The government should lower oil prices so that commuters  can pay reasonable fare, matatu operators have said. David Ongalo, a member to Ebeneza sacco that operates on the Kisumu -Busia -Siaya and Kakamega routes said oil importers buy one litre at Sh45. Ongalo who spoke to the Star on Sunday was responding to Vihiga county commissioner Ochillo Oyugi who said they would arrest all matatu operators who hiked fares. Oyugi said coronavirus had affected the entire country and commuters were paying higher fares. Ongalo said the matatu business had become unprofitable due to the stiff measures on movement imposed by the government to stop the spread of coronavirus. "When the government says we carry half the capacity due to situation at hand they should cut tax on oil until the situation is controlled," he said. He said Uganda had comparatively better oil prices. Somalia had cheaper oil prices than Kenya despite its weak economy, he said. “We fuel those vehicles. We maintain them. We pay drivers. We pay conductors. We pay stage rates and the county taxes us. Yet we are forced to carry half capacity. Who will bear those loses?” Ongalo said. Ongalo said the national and county governments should suspend suspend taxes until the situation normalises. Edited by Henry Makori
