The Siaya Priest who is alleged to have spread the coronavirus after jetting in from Italy has been detained for two days. Richard Onyango Oduor was arrested on Thursday last week after being discharged from hospital. The prosecution had asked the court to remand him for five days to allow police complete investigations. However, Magistrate Martha Nanzushi on Tuesday granted them two days to detain him at Kileleshwa police station. The case will be mentioned on Thursday this week. The state alleges that he arrived in Kenya from Italy on March 23 and is suspected to have had the virus. He then travelled to Kisumu County where he interacted with a lot of people. Oduor is being investigated for spreading an infection contrary to the law and the offense which he is facing attracts a sentence of a term not exceeding two years or with a fine or both. Police say the offense he faces is very serious and caused a serious threat to the health of several residents of a number of towns within the country. “I and my team of investigators are yet to complete the investigations because of Easter and weekend days that hindered us from obtaining information and statements from relevant offices,” the investigating officer said. Among the people to be interrogated include his juniors at his parish who include nuns and priests. The state says they are apprehensive that if released he will interfere with witnesses. However, the priest through his lawyer, opposed his detention arguing that he can't influence any witnesses as he can't travel to Kisumu because of the curfew and travel restrictions. Father Oduor further said that being detained for five days was punishment and a violation of his rights.
