The Great Rift Valley 10-a-side rugby tournament slated for April 10-13 has been cancelled, owing to the current coronavirus pandemic. Nakuru RFC rugby director, Eddy Moseti said the event can’t be held at any other time and will now be played next year. “With the ban on sporting events in the country, it’s unfortunate we are not going to have the event this year,” added Moseti. The three-day festival is a highlight of the rugby calendar and attracts teams from all cadres of rugby with Kenya Cup, Championship and nationwide clubs competing for the top prize. The tournament will now be held in April next year. Menengai Oilers won the 2019 edition of Nakuru 10’s after beating 2018 champions Homeboyz 10-5 in the cup final. Kenya Rugby Union (KRU) chairman, Oduor Gangla, said no decision has been made on the fate of the Kenya and Enterprise Cup fixtures for the remainder of the season. “I know fixtures committee has been consulting with the clubs as we keep assessing the situation,” said Gangla. “Now you can’t do anything. No decision has been made yet on the leagues but we have several options to consider,” added Gangla.
