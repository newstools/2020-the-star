Jadi, a Kaka Empire-signed boy band, has released 'Jibeba', a love ballad dedicated to the ladies. Vince, a member of the band, said in a statement that Jadi sings about how they like the way a lady carries herself and are proud to be the ones she loves back. "The fun about it is, 'Jibeba' might also mean that someone has a big derriere, and it is the double meaning which makes the song  loveable alongside the beautiful melodies given by the young lads," he says. Jadi describe themselves as a  bright and youthful boy band, where each member is different from one another, shining in their way to create synergy. The three members, Tumbo B, Vince and Ethan, say they came together under one dream in the hopes of building a new tomorrow.
