"The CPI increased by 0.18 per cent from 106.33 per cent in February to 106.53 in March," KNBS said in a statement. The rebased CPI was put in place to enhance the quality of statistics, including the measurement of inflation, upon which policymakers base their decisions. The CPI new basket has a total of 330 items, compared to the previous basket of 234 items. The weights in the rebased CPI have also been updated and the Expenditure Groups have been recalculated, based on the 2015/16 Kenya Integrated Household Budget Survey.
