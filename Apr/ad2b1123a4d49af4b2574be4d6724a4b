The Mombasa government has started distributing food to needy families. The exercise, launched on Monday, targets 50,000 households in the first phase, but will reach 227,000 families. The items distributed include 10kg of maize and wheat flour, 7kg of green grams, 6kg of rice, 2kg of sugar, 1kg of salt, 2 litres of cooking oil, sanitary pads, paracetamol tablets and a bar of soap. Governor Hassan Joho said each package is enough to feed a family of five for 30 days. County commissioner Gilbert Kitiyo said the food will be delivered to homes by Kenya Red Cross Society and a team of 7,000 youths. The officials were surprised that residents are contravening anti-coronavirus rules. "Boda boda riders carry four passengers and do not wear face masks. What more do you want us to say?" Joho said. He warned that they will be left with no option but to ask the police to arrest such careless people. Kitiyo said Kisauni residents are the worst culprits. Mombasa, as of Tuesday, had recorded 66 cases of Covid-19 out of the 296 countrywide. He said Kisauni matatu operators continue to carry more than the required eight passengers, disregard the 7pm-5am curfew, and do not observe social distancing. At least 25 people, including matatu operators, have been arrested and made to do community work as punishment. “Some people do not believe coronavirus is real. It is not a joke that the disease is among us. It will destroy our families if we are not careful,” Joho said. He urged residents to avoid travel. The food relief committee chairman Abdul Samji requested for more donations because what they have is not enough for all the families. He thanked Mombasa Cement for their support but said the county needs more clean water. Samji urged the private sector to help support poor families. Edited by Frank Obonyo
