A Judge has declined to allow a British and Kenyan couple to adopt an 18-year-old because of immigration concerns. Justice Aggrrey Muchelule said the British man had not proved the adoption would be recognized in the UK and the child be granted status. Muchelule also said the Briton had not been recommended by a British government authority or court as being morally and financially fit to adopt the child. “Unless those conditions have been met, I will not allow the adoption,” he said. The Briton is a banker with the African Development Bank. His spouse is Kenyan and a housewife. The couple lives in Ivory Coast and Nairobi and has property in Kenya. They have one child born on February 8 2013. They were married on July 20, 2018. On September 2019, they sought to adopt the woman's niece who was born in May 2002 and has lived with the couple since 2007. The child is willing to be adopted by them. The child's mother has also consented to the adoption and signed required forms. Court records say the child's parent is a single mother of meagre means. The child was declared free for adoption on October 11, 2018. On July 2019, the court appointed Karol Kariuki as the guardian of the child. Kariuki and the director of Children Services were ordered to conduct  a social inquiry to determine the couple's suitability to adopt the child. They were to prepare and file the requisite reports within 45 days. The reports were filed with recommendations that the couple be allowed to adopt. The couple's social, emotional and financial well being were found stable and suitable to adopt the child. The child and applicants had bonded well. But Justice Muchelule said unless conditions under section 162 of the Children's Act are met, the adoption cannot be allowed. (edited by o. owino)
