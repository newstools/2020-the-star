Garissa Deputy Governor Abdi Dagane has appealed to development partners and well-wishers to help fight Covid-19 and alleviate the suffering of flood victims. He said they need support because the county has inadequate resources to cater to the affected communities. "We plan to distribute food and other sanitary items to more than 10,000 needy households," Dagane said. Apart from floods, the county is battling the spread of coronavirus and other calamities caused by environmental degradation. Dagane, who chairs the county emergency response committee, said floods from River Tana have risen to six metres and affected more than 7000 households. "Displaced people cannot strictly follow handwashing and social distancing measures because they are desperate and are at higher risk of contracting coronavirus," he added. Dagane urged the national government to expedite assistance to the residents to prevent an outbreak of waterborne disease. Edited by Frank Obonyo
