Vihiga Queens' coach Alex Alumira has urged female players to avoid fatty foods during the coronavirus break since this will derail their return to fitness once action resumes. “Players are expected to have more muscles than fat in their bodies. Players with elevated fat get tired easily due to the lactic acid in the body and the best thing to do is avoid such foods altogether.” Alumira, who is doing a diploma course in sports medicine, said players should use vegetables and foods rich in iron. Such a diet, she added, will help prevent injuries. “Female players should strive to ensure they eat foods rich in vitamins, calcium and iron within their energy budget. Poor bone health and iron depletion are relatively common in female players." "Some injuries occur even without playing and taking a balanced diet can help prevent some of these damages,” said the three-time title-winning coach. “Ladies lose a lot of blood during their menses and are therefore advised to eat fruits. Vitamins trigger the body to replace the lost blood and improve immunity.” She specifically warned against chips (French fries), saying: “They should be avoided at all costs.” Alumira asked the players to consider having a healthy breakfast with a bias on white meat especially omena, which is rich in sulphur. The successful coach wants players to train for less than an hour and must be honest and self-driven in their activities. He encouraged other coaches to keep track of the progress of their charges during this difficult period. “Training for between 30-45 minutes is essential at this point. Players must be honest with their sessions and explain to their coaches the problems they encounter for advice. It is the responsibility of the tactician to also make follow-ups on the players and assist whenever possible.”
