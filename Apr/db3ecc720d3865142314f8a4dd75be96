Actress Funke Akindele held a party over the weekend in her Lagos mansion to celebrate her husband's birthday, producer JJC Skillz. The party, which was attended by a few celebrities, came when lockdown was imposed in Lagos to curb the spread of coronavirus. She wrote on Twitter that people who attended the party had been living together for over 14 days. 'Thanks for the love guys, we all have been together for over two weeks. We are safe and take all precautions," she wrote on Sunday. She later took to Instagram to explain she wouldn't wish to intentionally mislead people. 'Truly yesterday was my husband's birthday. We own a studio where we film our content. Before the coronavirus pandemic, we all worked together here and we have the strength of a hundred workers. When the pandemic started, we had to stop.," she said. "Before the lockdown was announced, some youths had been in boot camp here rehearsing, singing and dancing, most of which you saw on the video. Some of the staff live outside Lagos and they can't go back, borders are closed so they had to stay." Talking about where there were celebrities on the video, including singer Naira Marley, she said: "He is part of a new project. He was supposed to be a surprise so I have to spill it now. I am not defending myself. He came here before the lockdown." Adding, "Then my husband's birthday came up and we all came together as a family, but putting it up on social media is where we all feel bad about it. "People came days and others months before the lockdown. Nobody came to party with us." She apologised to her fans putting into consideration she appeared in a Nigerian advertisement giving awareness about the pandemic. "I am sorry if I misled with the video. I appreciate your concern and I promise to always practise what we preach," she said.
