The government faced an almost impossible choice over the coronavirus. A complete lockdown would effectively isolate the virus but it would put millions out of work. But no lockdown might allow the virus to spread uncontrollably. In the event, the government has struck probably the best balance possible. The cure should not be worse than the disease. Thousands may die from Covid-19 but is prevention worth it if it destroys the lives of millions? Kenya's very youthful population may cope better with Covid-19 than some other countries. And could government manage a total lockdown? As President Kenyatta said, it would be impossible to deliver food to every household. Social unrest could result if people were starving. So Nairobi and Mombasa have been sealed off but people can still move between 5am and 7pm. The curfew covers the whole county. Business has been hard hit but can continue to some extent. It is not as disastrous as a total lockdown. So let's cooperate with government on social distancing and hygiene. Let's do our bit to minimise the spread of the virus. We don't want a total lockdown.
