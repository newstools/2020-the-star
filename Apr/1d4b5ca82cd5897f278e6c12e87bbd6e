Lamu MCAs are advocating for mass testing to establish the status of the coronavirus in the county. Lamu is among counties that haven’t recorded a single Covid-19 case. The MCAs said mass testing would help eliminate any doubts among members of the public. They said it gives little comfort to assume that the county is indeed free from the virus unless there is mass testing to prove it. This comes days after the county assembly approved Sh157 million supplementary budget to help combat the pandemic. Led by Majority leader Abdalla Baabad, the MCAs want part of the money channelled towards the acquisition of testing kits. The last census projected Lamu’s population to be at 143,920. The population is small and hence cheaper and faster to conduct mass testing on, the ward reps said. Speaking on Monday, Baabad said the assembly had engaged Governor Fahim Twaha on the matter. “Let part of that money be used to conduct mass testing. Our population is very small and so that’s very achievable,” Baabad said. He said they are working on a plan that will enable the testing of 60 per cent of the population in every ward in the first phase if their proposal is approved. Lamu has 10 wards - three in Lamu East and seven in Lamu West. County assembly Health Committee chairperson James Komu (Hongwe) said mass testing is a call not just for the county but the entire country to ascertain exactly where Kenya stands. Komu said after testing, they will isolate those infected and work towards keeping the rest of the population safe. “We want to believe that Lamu doesn’t have a single case of the coronavirus but the only way to really be sure is through mass testing,” the MCA added.
