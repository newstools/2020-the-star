Investigative journalist Dennis Okari says he left BBC because he was not given a platform to tell his stories the way he wanted to. In as much as it is almost every journalist’s dream to go international, he was not satisfied. Speaking on QuickFire Friday segment, he said every other journalist in their career is always thinking of their trajectory, wanting to move from local to international. "A couple of reasons made me leave BBC. I always felt like I wasn't telling the kind of stories I wanted to tell," Okari said. "And BBC was not giving me that platform, because it is like a beast and there are so many people and there is no space for you to tell the African story the way you want to tell it, to be honest." The other reason was that he wanted to be close to his family. "The travelling was a bit too much on me, I was not enjoying it. I wanted to stay and just be around my family. Kenya is a beautiful country and a beautiful place to work in any way," he said. He concluded that NTV gave him that opportunity to tell his stories. "I could now do NTV Investigates, an opportunity I did not get at BBC” Okari said.
