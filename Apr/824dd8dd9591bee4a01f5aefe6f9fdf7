Residents of Matungulu subcounty have demanded that a police officer who returned home from Kiganjo Police Training College this week be forced to self-quarantine. Earlier in the week, the college was closed indefinitely over the coronavirus fears. Officers who were in the college were ordered to self-quarantine. The officer allegedly interacted with people on Thursday at Koma Hill roadblock. He lives in Nguluni and works in Joska. He has also neglected the order to self-quarantine and has been operating his wife's M-Pesa shop at Nguluni market. The officer now risks being arrested or moved to a forced quarantine. Matungulu subcounty police commander Kipkemoi Kirui said on Saturday the officer had gone to Kiganjo for a two-week course and was almost through when the college was closed. He said the officer ended up at the roadblock after more officers were called to man the roadblock at Koma Hill. Kirui said when he got the report that the college had been closed, he told the officer to self-quarantine. The officer tested negative for the coronavirus but was still advised to self-quarantine, Kirui said. Nguluni resident Mutia Kaloki said the officer should be forced to quarantine for 14 days before being allowed to interact with the society. Meanwhile, police in Kangundo have arrested a man who was caught sneaking into Machakos county from Nairobi. President Uhuru Kenyatta has declared cessation of movement into and out of Nairobi, Kilifi, Kwale and Mombasa counties for 21 days. Kangundo subcounty police commander Benjamin Ongombe said the man was heading to Kitui county but was arrested and taken to Kangundo Level 4 hospital for coronavirus testing. He tested negative. He was later taken to Koma Hill roadblock in Matungulu to be transported back to Nairobi.
