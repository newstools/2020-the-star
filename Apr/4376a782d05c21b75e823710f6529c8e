The national health insurer - NHIF - has extended the deadline for members to choose their preferred hospital to access outpatient services. This was done following the disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic. NHIF said it is mandatory for members to pick the outpatient hospital afresh, even if this was done previously before January this year. The exercise has been extended to April 30. In a memo sent on Friday, NHIF acting CEO Nicodemus Odongo urged customers to use self-help platforms, including SMS and the organisations web portal to sign up. "The NHIF continues to monitor local and international developments in view of the coronavirus pandemic," he said. In February, the board of the National Hospital Insurance Fund admitted the fund was cash-strapped. It blamed this on excessive payouts to private hospitals. The board, which was appointed last year, distanced itself from problems dogging the organisation, which it says dates back to as early as 2012. Board vice chairman Roba Duba said they were fighting to clear the mess and would scrap unreasonable reimbursement rates to private hospitals and cut the fundâ€™s administrative expenses from the current 14 per cent to less than 10 per cent.
