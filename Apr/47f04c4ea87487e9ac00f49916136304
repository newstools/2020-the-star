Six years after the death of her father, singer Kambua says the one thing she wishes for the most is that he would meet and see her son, Nathaniel. Prof Manundu was the founder of Manundu Herbal Clinics. At the time of his death, Kambua had not yet become a mother. Taking to social media to express her grief, Kambua penned a message to her departed dad, saying it has taken her years to heal and fully come to terms with the loss. "Grief is like unfamiliar, uncharted waters no one can fully prepare you for. Grief is multilayered; just when you think it’s over, it reveals itself in a new light. I have grieved the fact that he never got to meet my beautiful baby boy." She added that she has grieved her fading memory, guilted herself for forgetting things she should remember about her dad. "But I will never forget the sound of his booming laugh, nor the sparkle in his eyes, or the warmth of his hands… Just as I will never forget how cold they were before he breathed his last." Kambua added that it has taken her years to understand grief, as it is a process, after all. "And this hope in no way nullifies the pain- it gives it purpose. God writes our stories, and in Him, nothing is lost," she said. "Our present pain and suffering is nothing compared to the glory that will be revealed in us. I am grateful that my father’s legacy points to Jesus. Keep resting in glory my Papa."
