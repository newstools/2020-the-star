A group of Youth in Laare town, Igembe North is distributing hand sanitiser and teaching miraa farmers, traders and residents about Covid-19. Hermaton Mugambi, a third-year financial engineering student at Jomo Kenyatta who is the group leader, said they want to change people's mindset to avoid infections. “We went round matatu stages sanitising them and teaching residents. The only problem is we do not have enough resources to reach more people,” he said. Mugambi urged more youths to come out to help people who are not informed about Covid-19, especially in rural areas. He also urged the county to chip in and help such initiatives. Laare is a miraa region and Mugambi says they have also helped many miraa farmers sanitise and taught them it is important to wash hands before handling it. Many counties have banned miraa and set ablaze consignments of the mild stimulant. Edward Kamangi said they make some of the hand sanitiser while others are donations from well-wishers. Douglas Muchui commended the youth for their effort. “We are yet to receive any help from the county in terms of the fight against the coronavirus,” Muchui said. The Meru county government has set aside Sh36 million to fight Covid-19. But many residents say they are yet to see any impact. Abothuguchi Central MCA Ayub Bundi has slammed the county government for distributing water tanks from the national government. He said the county should be accountable and tell residents how they are using the funds. (edited by o. owino)
