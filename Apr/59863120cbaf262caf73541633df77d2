Residents of Rwatama village in Busia are in shock after lightning struck three students — all cousins — in a span of two weeks. This happened in two separate incidents in Teso North subcounty. Zola Otulia, an electrical engineering student at Kisii Polytechnic, was returning home from shopping when she was struck and injured. She is the daughter of former councillor John Otulia, who is deceased. Area assistant chief Erineyo Majune said Otulia was taken to Ang’uari Health Centre, where she was treated and discharged. The administrator said she is improving although she is still in shock. “We are happy she is alive and improving after medication,” he said. The incident happened seven days after her two cousins were struck by a lightning in their grandfather’s house. Constant Ekapel, who was a Form 3 student at Aboloi Secondary School, died on the spot but his cousin Dolphin Emojong survived with injuries. Ekapel has since been buried, while Emojong was treated at Kocholya Level 4 Hospital and discharged. Ang’urai South MCA Grace Olita said there are efforts to procure and instal lightning arresters at a cost of Sh5 million. “We have had many of these cases for many years. The worst incident happened in 1970, when lightning killed seven pupils at Katakwa Primary School. Two boys and five girls,” Olita said. She also appealed to well-wishers to assist in installing lightning arresters in the area. Majune also called on the government to instal lightning arresters in trading centres, schools and other public areas to prevent another case. A year ago,  another lightning killed three family members in Kakapel village in Ang’urai South ward. In July 2019, another strike injured a couple in Rwatama village. In September last year, three people were injured when a bolt of lightning struck a football playing field at Kakapel Primary School during a match. Edited by E.Kibii
