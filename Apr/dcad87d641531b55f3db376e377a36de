Blogger Cyprian Nyakundi has been charged with posting false information on Covid-19 on Twitter. He denied the charge before Kibera senior principal magistrate Boaz Ombewa. The blogger is said to have committed the offence on March 23, tweeting, “Cyprian Is, Nyakundi with, KRA CG jetted back from the US and started meetings before 14 days quarantine, but our question is, must this guy’s still fly out what is more important?" The charge sheet says the information was meant to cause panic and fear among citizens, and maliciously injure James Mburu's reputation. Nyakundi was released on Sh300,000 bond or Sh 150,000 bail. The case will proceed on July 2. Edited by Josephine M. Mayuya
