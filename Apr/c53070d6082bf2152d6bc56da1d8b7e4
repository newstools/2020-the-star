KenGen PLC has joined the efforts in fighting the novel coronavirus in the country by donating Sh20 million to Emergency Response Fund. Announcing the donation on Wednesday, the company’s Managing Director Rebecca Miano said KenGen had joined hands with the government and other stakeholders in offering economic and social support to the vulnerable in the society. “As KenGen, we take this opportunity to thank the government for establishing the Covid-19 Emergency Response Fund, which has been instrumental in mobilizing resources towards containing the spread, effect, and impact of Coronavirus disease,” Miano said. She added that the company had set aside an additional Sh10 million towards supporting the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended hygiene efforts among community members living near its installations across the country. The additional cash goes towards the purchase of hand sanitizers, liquid soaps, and water tanks. KenGen MD has also expressed his hope that more organisations and individuals will contribute towards the fight of the virus that has caused 14 deaths in the country. During the event, KenGen Foundation’s Managing Trustee, Anthony Igecha called on Kenyans especially those in arid and semi-arid areas to take advantage of the ongoing rains and plant trees while observing the laid out measures of preventing the spread of the virus. The donations come amid inadequate essential screening and testing equipment in the country. Kemri director Yeri Kombe said on Tuesday in his submission to the Senate ad hoc committee on Covid-19 that the institution is out of equipment, supplies, reagents, and materials used in screening and testing Covid-19 patients. As a result, Kombe said the institute was in dire need of Sh790 million to restock and resume normal operations and scale-up testing. “The institute has exhausted most of the reagents and materials being utilised in screening and testing for the virus,” Kombe said.
