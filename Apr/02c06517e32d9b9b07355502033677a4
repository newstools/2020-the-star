Reckless drivers using the Naivasha-Mai Mahiu road have been blamed for rising cases of fatal accidents. A Naivasha trader joined the growing list of people killed along the road by speeding trailers. The trader in the transport sector died on the spot near Longonot trading centre while the two occupants in the trailer escaped with minor injuries. Witness Jack Mwathi said the driver of the trailer which was headed to Mai Mahiu was carelessly overtaking another truck when the accident occurred. He said the trader tried to avoid the oncoming trailer but ended up ramming its side. “The trader died on the spot after his car was extensively damaged while the occupants of the trailer escaped with minor injuries. They were treated and discharged,” he said. In the second incident, a man died on the spot after a car he was travelling in was involved in a head-on collision with another car near Marula farm along the Nairobi-Nakuru highway. Four occupants of the two cars were seriously injured and admitted to Naivasha subcounty hospital in critical but stable condition. Driver Paul Njue noted that the car heading to Naivasha was to blame after the driver decided to overtake a fleet of vehicles. He said the driver underestimated the speed of the oncoming vehicles, leading to a head-on collision. “In the process, the driver of the car heading to Nakuru died on the spot while the motorist who caused the accident and three others passengers were left nursing serious injuries,” he said. Naivasha OCPD Samuel Waweru confirmed both accidents, adding that the bodies had been collected and taken to the mortuary. “We had two accidents where two people lost their lives and inquest files have been opened as part of our investigations,” he said.
