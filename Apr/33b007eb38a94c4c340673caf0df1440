Parents in Rift Valley have criticised Education CS George Magoha for insisting that the majority of children can access learning programmes through mobile phones, TV and radio sets. Parent Pamella Mwale said many homes did not have TVs or radios, while others had mobile phones popularly known as 'mulika mwizi' through which they could not access the internet. “Majority of parents are very poor and cannot afford to buy food let alone having smartphones. The claim that many of us can access learning material through mobile phones or electronic gadgets is just a theory,” she said. Mwale said they want the Education ministry to come up with other ways through which children can access learning material and prepare for national examinations later in the year. Parent James Boit said President Uhuru Kenyatta and his administration should come up with better ways to enable learning to continue as the country fights against Covid-19. All schools remain closed to help stop the spread of the coronavirus. The Kenya National Parents Association (KNPA) said it is working with the ministry to ensure all children do not lose out on their education programmes. “Parents should not be worried because CS Magoha and stakeholders are discussing easy ways to ensure our children are not left out in new education strategies,” KNPA chairman Nicholas Maiyo said. He urged parents to ensure all children remain indoors as directed by the government. Maiyo said some parents are allowing their children to go out and play in groups, thus disobeying government measures on social distancing to stop the spread of the virus. (Edited by V. Graham)
