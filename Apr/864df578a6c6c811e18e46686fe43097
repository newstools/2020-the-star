There is an upsurge of patients at Migori County Referral Hospital's renal unit. The increase of patients has been attributed to effects of Covid-19 because those who used to seek treatment elsewhere, have now turned to the facility for services. Before the coronavirus outbreak, the Sh18 million unit, which was launched on March 14, 2018, by Governor Okoth Obado, was receiving about 10 patients weekly, but the number has now increased to 35. The hospital has also extended working hours and more staff have been deployed. The unit has five beds and offers services at Sh9,500 per session. However, most residents have been ignoring the facility in favour of others in Nairobi, Eldoret and Kisumu towns. “For the past few days, we have witnessed an influx of patients forcing us to run our dialysis daily. We have expanded our services at the dialysis centre and extended working hours to cater for the influx of kidney patients,” Health Chief Officer Dalmas Oyugi said on Monday. He said they are getting patients from Nairobi and Eldoret who have moved to their rural homes. Hospital's nephrologist Dr Pedro Machural urged patients who had not enrolled for dialysis services to stay at home to avoid overwhelming the dialysis machine at the hospital. Kidney patients' immune system is also compromised. “Currently, we are only attending to patients who are timetabled for dialysis, those who had not enrolled for the services should stay at home to avoid contacting coronavirus while on transit,” he said.
