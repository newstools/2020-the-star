Bungoma residents living in Nairobi should not visit their home county,  Governor Wycliffe Wangamati has said. Wangamati said since Nairobi had recorded the highest number of coronavirus cases, its residents must stop moving to their home county to cut the risk of spreading the virus. “I am warning Nairobians and other people living in major cities especially which have recorded the highest numbers of coronavirus positive patients. Just stay there until the government declares victory over the virus,” Wangamati said. Speaking during the launch of fumigation of public places in Bungoma town, Wangamati noted that many registered cases had been brought about by visitors. “We are on high alert. Any visitor from Nairobi must be identified and put on quarantine. It is very expensive to treat coronavirus patients,” he stated. Fumigation of the town will be done at night when people have returned home to avoid inhaling chemicals. “We care about our people and we are very vigilant about their health. That’s why we will be carrying out the process at night,” he said. Bungoma county government has set aside a 16-bed isolation centre at Webuye subcounty hospital. So far the county has not recorded a single case of coronavirus. The governor said his government had invested a lot of funds to ensure nobody died from the pandemic. The county has closed all open-air markets for one month and told residents to bury their loved ones within 24 hours to avoid public gatherings. Edited by Henry Makori
