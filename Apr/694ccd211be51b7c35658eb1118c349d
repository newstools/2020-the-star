Turkana county has banned the movement of Kakuma camp refugees to prevent their mingling with outsiders. The aim is to control the spread of the coronavirus by limiting close contact. Turkana county commissioner Boniface Muthama has ordered the refugees to stay in the camp. “We are in hard times. No refugee should leave or enter the Kakuma camp. If he or she travelled to other regions, they should not go back to the camp," he said. If someone in the camp is sick and needs medical assistance from the Lodwar County Referral Hospital, county officials should be notified, he said. The county boss also warned polygamous men with more than one family to stick to one wife and stay with her as a way of restricting virus spread. Muthama said healthcare workers have been placed in all entries and exits of Turkana county and 151,000 have been screened. In March, a 72-year-old Somali American was isolated together with his son, grandson and driver after they were stopped at a roadblock on the Kakuma – Lodwar route. The four were screened by health officers and later taken to IRC Kakuma to be quarantined. The man had travelled from the US and his temperature was abnormally high. However, all tested negative for the virus. Muthama also urged boda boda operators to wear a mask and not carry more than one passenger at a time. He said lawbreakers would be arrested and charged with violating government directives. Muthama said people have been breaking the law because they knew court proceedings had been suspended due to the coronavirus, however, courts have resumed operations. (Edited by V. Graham)
