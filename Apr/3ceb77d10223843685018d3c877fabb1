Nominated Senator Mary Seneta has urged Kajiado leaders to support the government’s efforts in curbing coronavirus by educating people to follow health guidelines. Seneta, who spoke on Wednesday after meeting county commissioner Joshua Nkanatha, said the power to fight coronavirus was with the people. Their strict adherence to health guidelines will save the country, she said. “Travel from point A to B if it is very necessary. Wash your hands and sanitise your spaces at all times and listen to what the government is telling you on how we can put this virus to rest,” Seneta said. The senator met Nkanatha after touring several areas in the county to familiarise herself with strategies the government had put in place to handle the spread of Covid-19 in rural and urban Kajiado. She said there was a need for the government to help the people in rural areas get sanitiser, food aid and medicine. “It is also important that our nurses in health centres around the county are provided with proper gear for use in the line of duty. This coronavirus strain has no boundaries and if our medical staff in the rural areas are ill-prepared, then it will be the end of us,” she said. The county commissioner assured that all the precautions including controlling travel as per President Uhuru Kenyatta’s decree had been taken seriously. “We have managed all our roads well. The public service vehicles sector has also been streamlined as per the government requirements. We have also maintained law and order during curfew time,” Nkanatha said. “We deliberated on the progress of fighting the Covid-19 outbreak, supporting our people during this painful time and security matters.” He pledged to work with all the leaders and reaffirmed the government’s commitment to maintaining order during the period.
