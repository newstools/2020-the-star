US-based Kenyan gospel rapper Mohwaz has dropped a new single titled ‘Shujaa’ (Hero). In this context, it represents that artiste who will not give up on Christ, despite the hardships encountered in the journey. On the inspiration behind this single, Mohwaz told Word Is 'Shujaa' is all about the diary of a struggling gospel artiste, who finds solace in the fact that God is on his side, despite the ever-present setbacks. Born in Kitale, Mohwaz started writing and performing gospel rap songs at the age of 10 and recorded his first single 'Toka Kwenye Giza' back in 2005 at Frameless Records. He is working on his debut album expected to be released sometime mid-2020, and according to sources working closely on this project, it is expected to be a game-changer in the gospel hip hop arena.
