Women's Premier League side Eldoret Falcons head coach Joshua Ariko has appealed to Football Kenya Federation (FKF) and the government to establish ways and means of cushioning vulnerable WPL players during the coronavirus period. With KWPL now divided into two regions, 'A' and 'B', Falcons play in the latter zone. However, just like all other sporting activities in the country have been stopped due to the coronavirus pandemic, the WPL is also on hold. Sadly, the WPL and most of its teams have no sponsors thus leaving the girls on their own, literally.  “My appeal is for the federation to ensure that women football gets a sponsor. We have been struggling to honour matches,  especially away from and I believe a sponsor would make all these much lighter," said Ariko. With play halted, he said players have been finding it even harder to survive since they are broke and idle. “It is hard for girls to say idle and hungry. As a coach, I would like to ask the federation to cushion them in one way or another,” he said, adding that the government should also help since it is the same players who are called for duty with national team Harambee Starlets. Falcons, the only WPL in the North Rift, has had good players in the national team including Annedy Kundu, Janet Moraa and Ruth Ingotsi. Luckily, Kundu and Ingotsi now play professional football in Cyrus with Lakatamia FC. “Girls are very vulnerable to manipulation especially when they are broke and disoriented,” observed Ariko.
