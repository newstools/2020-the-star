Personal responsibility is crucial in the prevention of the coronavirus, Uasin Gishu Deputy Governor Daniel Chemno said on Wednesday as he announced that streets in county towns, starting with Eldoret would be fumigated. The county has deployed staff and equipment to spray streets, public spaces and surfaces as it moves to control the spread of Covid-19. Infection cases in the country had risen to 59 on Tuesday. "The fumigation is but a way to assist in the prevention, personal responsibility comes first," he said. “It is, therefore, better for you (Kenyan) to take personal responsibility as it is the best way to prevent this virus. Let us also obey advice from government and we shall overcome,” the deputy governor said. He also asked citizens to observe social distancing as well as washing and sanitising their hands. Health executive Everlyne Rotich reiterated that crowding should be avoided at all times. She also urged hotels to continue selling takeaway food to avoid large numbers of people in social places. The CEC member also reminded the public to sanitise doorknobs, gates and other areas that are often touched. County Secretary Edwin Bett, CECs Mary Njogu (Environment), Finance’s CPA Julius Ruto, and Agriculture’s Samwel Yego, COs Kenneth Mbeka (Ag Health), Simeon Kemei (Environment), ICT’s John Kemboi, Town Manager Tito Koiyet, Eldoret Municipal Board chair John Kitur were present at the launch of the exercise.
