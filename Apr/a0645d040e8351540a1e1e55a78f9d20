Police on Monday asked Kenyans to be careful against hardcore criminals posing as officers of the coronavirus response team. Police spokesman Charles Owino said the imposters were visiting residences and then robbing people. Some thugs are raping residents and committing other atrocities, he said. Owino asked Kenyans to scrutinise those who call on them in their homes claiming to be from the multi-agency agency team on Covid-19. He said efforts are being put in place to mitigate the incidents. “Those called should reach hotlines 999, 112 and 911 for verification,” Owino said. The public has also been directed to call the operations centre on 0110939676, 0110939684, 011093981, 011939688 or use Facebook page @kingaKorona and twitter @kingaKorona. Owino was responding to reports that homes had been invaded and persons attacked in Runda, Lavington and Ruaka by the thugs in Covid-19 team gear. The national multi-agency command centre on operation Kinga Corona is based at Embakasi, Nairobi and is headed by Ayub Matiiri of the Kenya Defence Forces. It was established through the recommendation by the National Security Advisory Committee (NSAC) on March 25. It is mandated to establish and develop strategic preparedness and response involving all key players. The team is also tasked to rapidly deliver strategic, technical and operational support across the country. “The team will work closely with all stakeholders in mobilising resources to support and monitor implementation of activities meant to tackle the current coronavirus outbreak,” spokesperson Monica Omoro said. The team is working on a 24-hour basis and is using technology to trace and quarantine individuals who had travelled from places viewed as danger zones in March but have failed to self-quarantine.
