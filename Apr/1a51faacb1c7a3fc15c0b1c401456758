Kibra residents on Thursday received food, soap and sanitiser from ODM leader Raila Odinga's family. The food worth Sh11,550,000, sanitiser and soap valued at Sh400,000  and cooking oil worth Sh1,100,000 were delivered to the Kibra deputy county commissioner’s office. The donation is for the needy in the wake of the economic burden brought by coronavirus pandemic. The items were delivered to the residents by Raila's secretariat chief of staff Andrew Mondo. “Raila is doing this to help Kenyans during these trying times. We have started and we will also proceed to other informal settlements,” Mondo said. Other areas set to benefit include Embakasi, Mathare and Mukuru kwa Njenga slums. Mondo was flanked by area MP Imran Okoth and MCAs. Other items were donated by among othrs Kenya Pipeline, Bidco, Tononoka Steels, KAPU Africa, Kapa Oil and Jimmy Wanjigi. In a statement, Raila said that the donations will help alleviate the challenges faced by the community. However, the ODM leader was not around to hand over the items “to comply with the need for social distancing." The coronavirus pandemic has left thousands of Kenyans in need of food aid. Companies closure has led to the loss of jobs affecting several families who live in informal settlements. (edited by o. owino)
