Counties in North Rift have tightened night curfew rules and imposed further measures to stop the spread of the coronavirus. The number of those arrested in Eldoret, Kitale, Kapsabet and Iten for defying Curfew orders and failing to comply with Covid-19 control measures increased to more than 300. Those arrested include people found without face masks in the town, those involved in the sale of illicit brews and those found drinking beer in locked bars. Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago said they have launched a major crackdown on those undermining government's effort in the war against Covid-19. Those arrested in the county would be taken to forced quarantine in Kaplelach for 14 days at their own cost. “We have been talking to people but now we will use the force of the law to ensure a few people do not take us backwards,” the county chief said. In Trans Nzoia, Governor Patrick Khaemba said boda boda operators found carrying more than one passenger will be quarantined along with the passengers. “All these measures are for the good and health of Kenyans and not the government or counties,” Khaemba said. In Elgeyo Marakwet, county commissioner Dr Omar Ahmed said more than 40 people have been quarantined for being defiant. Nandi and Uasin Gishu administrations have also launched screenings at border points for those moving in and out of the counties. Nandi Health department is installing a number of screening checkpoints at major entry border points of Mlango, Kopere, Chakaiya, Kaimosi, Serem, Lemook, Lessos, Kamasai and other routes commonly used by drivers. Health executive Ruth Koech said the checkpoints will be manned by police and public health officers. She cautioned the public against buying substandard masks which have flooded the market.
