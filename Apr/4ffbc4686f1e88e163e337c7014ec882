Homeboyz and Impala have joined other top Kenyan clubs in questioning the decision to cancel the Kenya Cup and other leagues due to the coronavirus pandemic Champions KCB and Kabras have voiced opposition to the cancellation of the league alongside Menengai Oilers and run-away championship league leaders Strathmore Leos. Hombeoyz RFC chairman Myke Rabar termed the decision hasty and without consultation, saying it will affect the clubs. "We have invested heavily in getting a new coach from South Africa, recruiting players and other expenses and cancelling the entire season is not right. There has to be a way forward,” he added. Rabar said he is cognizant of the pandemic, which has brought business and other facets of life to a standstill but lack of consultation from the union was baffling. “After the cancellation of the season, no one at the union has bothered to talk to us on way forward,” Rabar noted. He said events worldwide are being postponed not cancelled altogether. “Look at the Olympics and Euro football championships; they have been postponed for one year and will be held once normalcy returns and our league and other competitions should follow suit,” concluded Rabar. Impala RFC vice chairman Charles Ngovi said it was too early to cancel the league. “It was too early to cancel the entire season.  The union should know there are sponsors who have invested heavily in the clubs and we have to meet targets,” added Ngovi.
