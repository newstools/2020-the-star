Turkana county commissioner Boniface Muthama has warned traders against increasing the price of goods amid the coronavirus crisis. Muthama urged the county government of Turkana to revoke the licenses of businessmen who have raised the prices of goods to make more profits in the tough times occasioned by the outbreak. Residents of Turkana have decried the high prices of essential commodities such as sugar, maize, face masks and sanitiser since the pandemic was confirmed in the country. “There is no shortage of commodities such as sugar in Kenya. We have engaged the Turkana governor on the matter and county officers have been assigned to take a list of the businessmen who have increased the prices of commodities in these tough economic times,” Muthama said. The commissioner said businessmen had increased the price of sanitiser from Sh300 to Sh1,300. He said they were working closely with the Turkana government to either revoke or not renew the licenses of traders who had hiked prices. “This is the best time for the business community to help their customers. We will take action on those who have violated rights by inflating the prices of goods. You can make good profits today but tomorrow you will not be a businessman because we will not renew your business licence,” he said. Muthama urged commuters who complain of hiked fares to stay home. “It’s difficult to explain why a kilo of maize within 10 days can raise from Sh40 to Sh85. Do not inflate the price of commodities by taking advantage of the coronavirus crisis. This is a warning to the business community who are inflating the prices of goods for their benefit,” Turkana Governor Josphat Nanok said. Edited by Henry Makori
