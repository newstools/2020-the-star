Ride-hailing firm Bolt has introduced a protective feature to reduce the risk of the coronavirus spreading between passengers and drivers. Vehicles under a new category called Bolt Protect will be fitted with a protective plastic film between the passenger and driver seats. This will reduce the possibility of the virus spreading through droplets expelled through sneezes or coughs from an infected person. “The safety and wellbeing of our passengers and drivers are always our highest priority and we strongly advise all our drivers and passengers to act responsibly and continue following the guidelines issued by the Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization,” said country manager Bolt Kenya, Ola Akinnusi. Additional measures include proper ventilation throughout trips as well as cleaning of door handles and the backseat area after every trip. “We provide our drivers with a step-by-step guide on how they can build a protective sheet, instruct them on proper ventilation and cleaning of the car,” Akinnusi said. He praised the firm’s drivers for their commitment during the crisis and promised them that Bolt is doing its best to minimise their exposure to the virus. The new category does not attract additional base fare. The number of passengers is limited to two—on the back seat. Bolt Protect is currently available to customers in Nairobi, with plans to expand to more cities soon.
