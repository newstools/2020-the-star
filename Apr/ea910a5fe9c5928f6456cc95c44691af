According to the 2020 first quarter Capital Markets Authority  Statistical Bulletin, the NSE 20-share index shed over 5 per cent, prompting a market halt, sparked-off by panic selling in an already bearish market.

This led to a halt in trading at the NSE as the All Share index fell 15 per cent, wiping out Sh120 billion off investors’ portfolios. “The 20.7 per cent drop in the NSE20-Share Index witnessed in the quarter mirrored the corresponding declines in MSCI World, Emerging Markets and Frontier Market Indices of 21.4, 23.9 and 27.7 per cent respectively, albeit at a lower rate,” said Luke Ombara , CMA's Director, Regulatory Policy and Strategy.
