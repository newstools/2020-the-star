Lamu municipal market traders who were last month relocated to the Kibaki Grounds on the outskirts of the town to allow for social distancing have decried lack of customers. The over 200 traders have lost a large chunk of their customer base as the grounds are located over a kilometre from most residential areas. Their relocation from Mkunguni Square in the Lamu town centre was meant to ease congestion and curb the spread of coronavirus. Governor Fahim Twaha said the move was necessary to enforce social distancing as directed by the Ministry of Health. Kibaki Grounds allows for the one-metre social distance in stalls at the open air market. Speaking on Sunday, the traders said most of their merchandise was rotting away due to the lack of buyers. Mama Mwihaki who sells cereals at the market said she still had the stock she had when they were relocated. She said she discarded most of the stock after it went bad owing to lack of buyers. “I would restock weekly but since we moved here a month ago, I haven’t been able to restock since I still have the previous stock. Nothing is selling really. The situation is so serious for us and all we are making are huge losses daily,” she said. Lamu grocer Charles Chege said they had lost up to three quarters of the customer base since they were relocated to the grounds. He said from having over 200 customers daily, the number had gone down to a mere five to 10. He said many traders had given up on the trade and quit due to poor proceeds. Edited by Henry Makori
