Athletics Kenya (AK) Nyanza North chairman Joseph Ochieng’ is impressed with the progress at the Siaya Stadium. Ochieng’ said the construction at the facility is at 50 per cent and everything is progressing well. “Right now they are concentrating on the main and spectator stands. I’m happy that a standard running track has been factored in. He said AK is ready to give the Chinese contractor experts to help in marking the course. "Once it’s done, Siaya will now have two standard running tracks,” he added. The other standard running track is at Jaramogi Oginga Odinga University of Science and Technology in Bondo. He said Siaya Stadium will host next year’s track and field meeting. He challenged the county government of Kisumu to expedite the construction of Moi Stadium, Kisumu. The construction was stopped by the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission after questions were raised over the tendering process. “Bondo and Kisumu are very fast courses. Athletes, especially sprinters, love the two stadiums and my appeal to Governor Anyang’ Nyang’o  is to expedite the construction of Moi Stadium which was measured in yards, feet and inches by colonialists. The running track should be expanded,” added Ochieng. He proposed that the county government of Homa Bay constructs an ultra-modern stadium at Kendu Bay showground. “We discussed this with Rachuonyo MP Adipo Okuome and asked him to talk with the Homa Bay County Governor Cyprian Awiti. Kendu Bay Showground is appropriate for the construction of a modern stadium. The one in Homa Bay town is small,” noted Ochieng.
