Police officers in Busia are hunting for a businessman who escaped from a quarantine facility on Wednesday evening. Teso South police boss Charles Rotich said the businessman from Malaba town escaped from St Monica Chakol Girls High School, where he had been quarantined. Chakol Girls High School is among institutions designated as quarantine centres in Busia. Rotich said the businessman was admitted to the facility on Monday alongside three friends. The four were found drinking in a locked bar at Kocholya market in Teso North subcounty. The escapee and his friends tried to resist arrest when they declined to open the door. The act forced police officers to break the door to gain access to the popular entertainment joint. Nine other people were also arrested in the same area for violating social distancing rules. They were also quarantined at Chakol Girls. “We are still looking for him although we suspect he may cross into Uganda because he lives near the border. We just want him to finish his 14 days under quarantine,” Rotich told the Star on the phone. Earlier, county commissioner Joseph Kanyiri urged the escapee to voluntarily return to the quarantine centre. “We are giving him a leeway of returning to the facility voluntarily, failing which he will bear the cost of searching and bringing him back,” Kanyiri warned Thursday. He said the businessman may also be charged for violating quarantine regulations. Kanyiri also said 10 Kenyans including four fishermen from Sio-Port who had been arrested and quarantined in Uganda for illegally crossing the border have been released. “We have since released them to join their families after producing clearance certificate giving them a clean bill of health from Covid-19,” he said.
