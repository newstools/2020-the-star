Media school student Azziad Nasenya, 19, made headlines after videos of her jamming to Femi One’s new hit ‘Utawezana' were circulated on all social media platforms. On Twitter, for instance, she was trending at number one with her video retweeted over a 100 times. The trend partially started on Tik-Tok, hence she was dubbed the 'Kenyan Tik-Tok queen'. The video captured her sensational dance moves as she whined her tiny waist and smiled effortlessly. Her blonde hair also stood out. As has been the new trend on Twitter, a section of KOT always has a negative thing to put out. Random people started digging up Azziad’s old photos, body-shaming her and even comparing her looks for comical purposes. It didn’t stop there. One of her friends shared her phone number and the cyberbullying moved from social media to personal attacks on WhatsApp and calls. Speaking to Word Is, Azziad said the cyberbullying did not affect her as she was doing what she likes doing. "First, I did not expect that video to go viral. The fact that my family stood by me, that was enough for me to remain strong," she said. Azziad says despite the negativity, the positive energy was more even on social media. "Kenyans are used to hating on others, which is wrong. Just be nice to people and put yourself in the shoes of the person you are trying to bully. How would you feel? Find your peace and avoid bullying people," she said. After the viral video, Femi One has reached out to her and said she hopes to work with her. "I wouldn't want to dance like a video vixen since my focus is on media and acting," Azziad said. To the friend who leaked her phone number, she terms that disrespect. "People sent me encouragement messages, others added me on WhatsApp groups, trash me and then remove me, but I am not affected," she said.
