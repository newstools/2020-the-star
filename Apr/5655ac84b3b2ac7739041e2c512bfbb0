It is one month now since the first case of coronavirus was reported in the country. Without a doubt, the lifestyle of many Kenyans has been changed by this pandemic. Some people have been forced to close down their businesses, others have been forced to work from home, whereas others have been sent home on unpaid leave and others fired not knowing what to do next given the uncertainty. In this environment, Kenyans and by extension global citizens are in psychological distress. It is, therefore, important to introduce public counselling in various public places. The counselling programme should also continue after the pandemic is brought under control, when many will be trying to put their lives back together â€” a time when it is expected that cases of distress will be higher. During this time that almost all county government public service boards are recruiting medical staff, a consideration to as well include recruitment of counsellors is welcome. Counselling should also be extended to those in isolation and quarantine. Joseph Macharia is from Nairobi
