The Marsabit County government has suspended its daily tax collection from small scale traders for three months. Governor Mohamud Ali said the county Revenue department will not collect taxes from traders effective March 31 to cushion them from the effects of the coronavirus. While addressing the press on Tuesday, the governor said they will continue to review more areas that needed to be focused where members of the public will be having difficulties. He also suspended the repayment of county enterprise development fund for three months. The county boss has however implored residents to continue adhering to the government directive on prevention of the Covid-19. He urged them to always observe personal hygiene by washing their hands regularly using soap and observe social distancing in order to curb the spread of virus. The county residents will also continue to benefit from the service of water bowsers. He further directed each department to clear the pending bills owed to traders and contractors.
