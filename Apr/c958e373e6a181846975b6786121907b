The ban on religious gatherings as a measure of combating Covid-19 is appropriate, a clergyman has said. Potter’s House Ministries Kitui town head Charles Kimolo said Christians should not take offence over the directive. Kimolo said even the Bible directs believers to obey orders from those in authority. He noted that the ban on religious gatherings was necessary to overcome the coronavirus. “The fact that we do not meet in churches to worship should not be a big deal. We should not lose hope as Christians,” the cleric said. Speaking by phone Monday, Kimolo said Covid-19 had caused untold human suffering. However, it has also taught the church to submit to rulers, he said. “All things work together for the good of those who love the Lord and those called according to his will. We need to be reminded that God does not make a mistake.” The cleric asked the faithful to persevere during the hard times they are faced with. He said the Covid-19 situation should not leave Christians heart-broken as it will not last for ever. Kimolo said that Jesus Christ faced similar trials when he was on earth. “There was a time Jesus was advised to get out of his homeland when the situation was not favourable and he went into hiding in Egypt with his father and mother,” he said.
