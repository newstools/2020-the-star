An MP from a Coastal county with his eyes set on a governor seat has reportedly gone back to the drawing board. Corridors understands that the legislator, who was banking on the current governor and his party leader's endorsement, has gone back to his political advisers for a new plan. This after he discovered that the governor and the party leader are courting a tycoon politician in the county to run for the seat in 2022. Those in the know say he now wants to be his own man and fight for the seat, even without any endorsement *** As the wrangles in the ruling Jubilee Party persist, it seems one of the officials in a top party organ is undecided on which side he belongs. The infighting in the party has resulted in two camps, one operating around President Uhuru Kenyatta, while the oscillating around Deputy President William Ruto. The official, who held an influential position in one of the parties that folded to form Jubilee, has of late surprised his colleagues with his indecision, especially on matters touching on the management of the party. A mole intimated to Corridors that the official nowadays takes a backseat on controversial matters being prosecuted by the crucial party organ in what his colleagues say is playing safe not to offend any of the two camps. *** A senior official in one of the key government agencies is a frustrated man over what he claims to be open bias in promotion in the institution. The official complains of being overlooked in promotions as a number of his juniors with connections to who-is-who in the State department scale the ladder, leaving him at the same spot. The official is said to be so frustrated and is openly contemplating early retirement.
