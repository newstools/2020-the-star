The nominee for Roads executive in Kisumu county will be vetted by the county assembly next week. An advert in the local dailies said Joyce Osogo will appear before the Committee on Appointments at the county assembly hall on April 22. “The county government has submitted to the county assembly following the nomination for appointment of the CEC roads position. The nominee is hereby invited to appear before the committee,” the advert signed by the assembly clerk Owen Ojuok read. Osogo is a specialist in project planning and implementation and has wide experience in innovative work in diverse social sectors. In October last year, Governor Anyang Nyong’o sacked roads CEC Thomas Ondijo and two others as he reorganised his cabinet with the aim of improving service delivery. Land CEC Dickson Obungu was then appointed to act in the roads docket awaiting the appointment of a substantive holder. Recently, the governor nominated veteran doctor Boaz Otieno as Health and Sanitation executive. Nyunya is a consultant obstetrician-gynaecologist and public health practitioner, researcher, leader in reproductive health, educationist and programme specialist. He has been an associate professor at Moi University’s College of Health Sciences and is currently an associate director for programmers at the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention in Kisumu.
