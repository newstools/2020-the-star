The national and county governments have put in place stringent measures to ensure travellers entering West Pokot and other counties observe the Ministry of Health directives on Covid-19. All passengers entering West Pokot must alight and wash their hands with water and soap under the supervision of security officers before continuing their journey. Governor John Lonyangapuo and county commissioner Apollo Okello launched the practice and urged all passengers to obey precautionary measures to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Lonyangapuo said all four entry points at county borders will be sanitised. All potential entry points have been identified as well. The Kitale–Lodwar Highway entry point at Murkwijit, the Uganda–Kacheliba entry point at Alakas, the Marich entry point and Chesegon entry point have tanks with water for washing hands. The governor insisted that every vehicle or motorbike should have sanitiser. “Let’s embrace the culture of washing hands. We shall not leave anything to chance.” He praised residents for adhering to the 7pm to 5am curfew saying it is working well. “We have put in place measures like the closing of pubs and open markets to curb the spread of the disease that moves fast in densely populated environments,” he said, adding that markets will be fumigated.
