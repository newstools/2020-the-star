A man was on Wednesday charged with possession of a haul of bhang before Nyando law courts. William Odongo Owino denied the charge before senior resident magistrate Reuben Sang. Owino was allegedly found in possession of the drug on April 6 at Sondu in Nyakach subcounty, Kisumu county, contrary to Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Control Act No. 4 of 2010. Magistrate Sang released him on Sh70,000 bail or a bond of Sh200,000 with a similar surety. The case will be heard on June 17. Nyakach OCPD Roseline Mnyolmo said the accused was arrested on Monday while transporting the bhang from Tanzania to Nairobi. He was found with seven and three-quarter sacks of bhang valued at Sh450,000. The drug was stashed in a Toyota Ipsum car. “We chased him all the way to Nyabondo as he was trying to escape the police on Katito-Ahero road. We managed to arrest him after he got a puncture,” Mnyolmo said. The drug, she said, belongs to someone in Nairobi according to the accused person. The police boss said the accused claimed that he sold part of the bhang in Migori while on transit to Nairobi. Edited by Henry Makori
