Tomato traders in Menyinkwa, Kisii have protested constant harassment from security agencies and vigilante members. They especially singled out some police officers from Kiogoro Police station for storming the market on Monday dawn and drove away a trader's car which was loaded with tomatoes. The officers said market officials, later returned and extorted more than Sh 10,000 in bribes from the trader. But speaking to journalists, the market officials condemned the manner in which the police were terrorizing them. Market vice-chair Patrick Yogo said the president had already given a green light to fresh produce trading given the traders observe the social distancing regulations set forth by the government. "We have observed all this to safeguard the buyers from coronavirus and it perturbs to see police with vigilante groups ganging up to terrorize us for no good reason," said Yoge. Yoge said as tomato dealers they want explanations from the County boss Governor James Ongwae on why traders conducting legal business in his County were not being cushioned against exploitation from rogue security agents. " The governor should make a followup on such issues. He should fight for traders who trade in his backyard," said Yoge. Kisii County Commissioner Stephen Kihara said investigations into the harassment claims have begun. Separately in Nyamira traders have asked the County to temporarily halt revenue collection saying most traders were already hurting from the effects of covid 19. Speaking to the Star County traders association chairman Robert Ongera said business is highly depressed to afford paying taxes.
