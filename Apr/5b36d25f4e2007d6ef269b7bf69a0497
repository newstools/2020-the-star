Mathira constituency has started the production of 200,000 face masks to be distributed to residents for free. MP Rigathi Gachagua said on Monday the masks will be distributed door-to-door with the help of elected leaders in the area, Nyumba Kumi officials and chiefs. He said the first priority will be given to tea farmers who cannot deliver tea leaves to buying centres without masks. Those making the masks will work in three shifts of 30 tailors. This means 90 tailors will be engaged in the project every day. “We will be producing every day. We hope to be producing 5,000 masks every day and whatever is ready we will distribute door-to-door,” the lawmaker said. Gachagua said the project will create employment for residents. He said once they produce enough for Mathira residents, they will make more for sale to other constituencies and regions at a subsidised price. The masks are being made at Mathira Technical and Vocational College.  The project is being undertaken in collaboration with Mathira NG-CDF and Mathira Technical and Vocational College. The machine being used in the project were procured at Sh3 million. Gachagua said after Covid-19, they will train young people on tailoring skills at the institution. “We have agreed with the college that we shall be supplying school uniforms produced from the institution to primary and secondary schools in Mathira at cost,” he said.
