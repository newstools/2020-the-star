Mama Ngina Kenyatta and other well-wishers have donated food worth Sh20 million to 13 children and elderly homes in the metropolitan area. “Mama Ngina is targeting children's homes. Since the coronavirus pandemic hit the country she has helped the vulnerable. The assorted food will go a long way in cushioning the effects of Covid-19 on this group of people,” she said. The food donated included 13 tonnes of soya, seven tonnes of uji mix, 950 litres of cooking oil, 750 kilogrammes of green grams, 2.5 tonnes of rice, 1,500 kilogrammes of beans and 100 bales of maize flour. Former Kiambu Woman Representative Annah Nyokabi Gathecha said the institutions targeted include Gatundu, Morning Star, Mama Ngina, Imani, Amicable, Muthiga, Heaven on the Hill and Joy Blessed children’s homes as well as Mji wa Huruma for the elderly. “We need to come together as a nation and help in whatever ways we can and see to it that Covid-19 is defeated and this will be achieved by all Kenyans adhering to the laid-down guidelines by the Ministry of Health,” she said. Gathecha said the family has always given back to society over the years, and not just during crises. Gatundu South deputy county commissioner Stanley Kamande urged well-wishers to involve administration officers “... so we are able to maintain the laid-down instructions on social distancing and distribute in an orderly manner rather than people crowding in one place as we have seen in some places”. Jane Wangui, adviser to the Gender CS, urged well-wishers to help vulnerable people. Edited by Josephine M. Mayuya
