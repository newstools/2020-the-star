As a way of cushioning their caddies from the effects of measures put in place to fight against the spread of coronavirus, Eldoret golfers have donated food rations to their aides. For the second time in two weeks, the 42 caddies received 8kg of maize flour, 24kg of dry maize, cooking fat and bar soaps. Eldoret Club chairperson Florence Murgor said it was important to take care of the caddies who are unable to earn a living following the closure of golf courses in addition to restricted movement. “When people travel, they may get infected and therefore we found it necessary that they stick to their current position ,” said Murgor. “We had to ensure that our caddies live a better life just like when they were guiding us on the golf course.” The distribution comes at a time when Kenya Golf Union (KGU) chairman Antony Murage called on clubs to help their caddies through these tough times. “At the club, we have 42 caddies and all of them got the rations. We also kept the government directive for social distance and we called the police to monitor our activities to ensure safety for both golfers, club management and our able caddies,” said Murgor. She added that the club is currently under a receptionist, manager and security guards.
