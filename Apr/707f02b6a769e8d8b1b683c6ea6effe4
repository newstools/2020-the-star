The Kenya  Rugby union has cancelled all league and cup competitions this season due to the coronavirus pandemic. This includes the Kenya Cup, the Championship, Nationwide leagues, Enterprise and Mwamba Cup. The cancellation means there will be no promotion or relegation in any of the leagues with all the teams retaining the current status in their respective divisions next season. A statement signed by KRU secretary Ian Mugambi read, "We are in challenging times with he worldwide breakout of the novel coronavirus.  The virus has caused untold disruption and presented us with a very challenging environment. The sporting activities have not been spared from its debilitating impact," said Mugambi. He added: ''This situation has affected our way of life- meaning there is no training and rugby events are feasible in the forseen future." At the point of disruption, the leagues were at the playoff stages and none of them had qualified winners. " The KRU board is particularly aware of the impact on clubs, sponsors and fans with the potential to be promoted or win competitions," noted Mugambi. Hardest hit will be Kabras, who were on course to win a second Kenya Cup crown having topped the group phase and Strathmore Leos who were the runaway league leaders in the championship with Shamas the favourites to win the Nationwide.
