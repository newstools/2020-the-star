Senate Speaker Kenneth Lusaka wants the Bukusu circumcision season postponed (see Page 28). The circumcision ceremony takes place in July or August of every even year. Luhya elders say it is premature to talk of postponing the event and that it would disrupt the naming of age-sets. People still seem reluctant to practice social distancing. They sneak into bars or secret social events despite the ban on gatherings. So far Kenya has been lucky with only around 50 cases but government has warned that this could easily rise to 10,000 by the end of April. Government might then introduce even more draconian regulations. This week Uganda has halted all public and private transport so virtually every business is closing – we don’t want that here! Kenya needs to maintain its more proportionate response to Covid-19. To avoid that extreme lockdown, Kenyans should voluntarily practice social distancing, minimise their social contacts, keep two metres away from other people, wear masks or bandanas, and regularly wash their hands. So let’s willingly postpone the Bukusu circumcision and all cultural events until the corona threat is under control.
