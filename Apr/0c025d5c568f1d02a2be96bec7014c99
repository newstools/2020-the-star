Kenyans should make the right choices come 2022 election, ANC party leader Musalia Mudavadi has said. He said Kenyans should choose leaders who are capable of reviving Kenya’s economy that is currently dwindling and leaving a huge population in poverty. Mudavadi said the current state of the economy with huge loans will sink the entire nation if Kenyans don’t vote wisely in 2022. Most Kenyans are currently struggling to put food on the table, with the Covid-19 crisis frustrating them. Speaking in one of the local radio stations based in Nairobi, he urged the Luhya community to register in large numbers. “We are the second largest population in this country but the problem is that we don’t register as voters. This time am appealing to you make sure you fully register and when that day come also come out in large numbers to vote,” Mudavadi said. More than 50 years since Kenya attained Independence, we are only being led by two communities it’s time we also rise and fight for that seat, he said. However, he reminded his community that they are not the only competitors for the top seat and that other communities have lined up and are nurturing their own. “It’s high time the Luhya community made a choice towards State House or remain led for the rest of life; we should stop moving blindly as if we have no future in politics,” Mudavadi said. The ANC party boss wants the community to stop demoralising their own leaders. He said the Mulembe nation has failed to embrace their brothers and sisters who have the capacity to fight for the top seat. Every individual has his weakness, even those great kings and queens have theirs but they are nurtured to come out for the leadership. “If we fail to reverse this culture of mocking and underrating our own leaders about the top seat we will never learn to nature our own leaders.” Edited by R.Wamochie
