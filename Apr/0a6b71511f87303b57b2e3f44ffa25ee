Mother Teresa, the Catholic nun and missionary, said: "If you can't feed 100 people feed just one". Kenyans are going through a difficult time because of the impact of the novel coronavirus pandemic. Vulnerable groups are increasingly finding it difficult to put food on the table. On 'good days', many live from hand to mouth. What with the restrictions that have limited their daily income streams? Any support is therefore welcome but this must be coordinated and well-intentioned. The Good Friday Kibera chaos that left several injured shows that many will risk life and limb to get food supplies. In the process, breaching a key safety measure of countering the spread of Covid-19—social distancing. Politicians are also using donations to gain mileage, a clear indication that their action is not philanthropic. Why plaster your portrait on state-supplied hand sanitiser? The ban on the uncoordinated direct distribution of food and non-food donations in vulnerable communities is therefore welcome. All support going forward will be channelled through the Kenya Covid-19 Emergency Response Fund, in Nairobi, and the offices of governors and county commissioners in the counties. However, those charged with this task must be honest and transparent in their work for the support to reach many Kenyans facing starvation.
