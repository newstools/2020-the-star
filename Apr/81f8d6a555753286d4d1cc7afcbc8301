Tanzanian rapper Mwana FA has been released from the isolation centre after testing negative several times. On March 19, the ‘Asante Kwa Kuja’ hitmaker announced he had tested positive for the virus. “I came from South Africa and after some days it was my birthday, so I don’t know whether I got it before going to South Africa, while there or after,” he told Clouds FM. “I have been tested eight times until I tested negative. They’d test me and find that I am positive and come back after 72 hours and test me and find I’m positive.” Mwana FA was kept isolated at the Temeke Isolation Centre together with Diamond Platnumz’s manager Sallam Mendez, who was released earlier than Mwana FA after he tested negative two times.
