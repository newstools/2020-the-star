Gospel artitste Ruth Matete's husband - pastor John Apewajoye - is dead. Matete confirmed the death on her Facebook page saying, "My Husband Beloved John Apewajoye has gone to be with the Lord ..I humbly ask for your prayers during this difficult time." Matete got married to her Nigerian husband in November 2019. Pastor John passed away on Saturday while receiving treatment at a local hospital. He succumbed to injuries after he was burnt while in the kitchen a few minutes after fixing a gas cylinder. Matete's friend and YouTuber Milly Chebby gave an account of the incident. She said, "Last week on Monday, Ruth and her husband John changed their gas cylinder and when they got to the house, he went to the kitchen to fix it. he noticed it was excess and he took the cylinder to the balcony and tried releasing some so that it would be okay to use." Chebby said John did not remove the clothes and some materials which were on the balcony. "After coming back to the kitchen he lit the gas without knowing that there was excess gas on the clothes outside. His clothes caught fire after immediately and it started spreading. The clothes on the balcony caught fire too. He ran to the sitting room screaming 'babe help me'." Chebby said Matete called neighbours who acted fast, put out the fire and rushed John to hospital. "He has been doing so well until yesterday (Saturday) night when he breathed his last. it's so sad and Ruth is in her first trimester. That's the hardest part," she narrated.
