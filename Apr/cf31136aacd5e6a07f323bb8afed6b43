The Mokowe Customs Jetty will be ready by December this year, eight months ahead of schedule, according to State Department of Public Works structural engineer Hillary Nyaanga. “Our main concern had been that the materials needed were being sourced from far away but now all that is sorted out and the works are progressing steadily," Nyaanga said. The sole connection between the Lamu Island archipelago and the mainland, was scheduled to be completed in August 2021. The construction of the Sh599 million jetty started in January last year. It is a national government project. Jetties are crucial in Lamu’s water transport system. They are the main entry and exit points for passengers and cargo destined for Lamu town and adjacent islands. Ninety nine per cent of Lamu residents use the facilities for transport. Nyaanga, who spoke in Lamu town on Wednesday, said the jetty was halfway complete. The Mokowe jetty will have a large waiting bay and a petrol station. It will also be mounted with a special ramp for use by wheelchair-bound and disabled persons. Other similar national government projects under construction are the Sh78 million Mtangawanda jetty in Lamu East, the Sh48 million Manda Airport jetty and the Sh35 million Lamu Mangrove Terminal jetty. The jetty is due for completion next month, Nyaanga said. Last week, the national government cancelled the commissioning of the Manda Airport and the Lamu Terminal jetties due to coronavirus fears.
