Makueni technical training centres have started making face masks to be distributed to the vulnerable to stop the spread of Covid-19. Health CEC Andrew Mulwa on Thursday said the county government had engaged 12 technical training centres that had started producing the face masks. The first batch of 12,600 face masks made in the local institutions was dispatched on Thursday at the county assembly premises to be distributed though MCAs and Ward Covid-19 Emergency Response committees. “Our target is 80,000 face masks to be distributed to our people who cannot afford to buy them to ensure they are protected from being infected with coronavirus,” Mulwa said during the dispatch. He was accompanied by majority leader Kyalo Mumo, minority leader James Mbalu and minority whip Jades Kalunda. Mulwa said the face masks have been approved and they meet the required standards. The county assembly approved Sh45 million for the Covid-19 fight. Mumo said part of the money will be used to empower the TTIs to manufacture the masks. “The identified technical institutions need additional machines and materials for them to be able to increase production of the face masks in the shortest time possible because of the emergency need to protect our people from the Corona Virus,” the Tulimani ward rep said. He appealed to well-wishers to engage the County Emergency Response Committee co-chaired by Governor Kivutha Kibwana and county commissioner Maalim Mohammed. According to Mulwa who sits in the committee, Makueni has not recorded any coronavirus case and there is no one under surveillance. Edited by R.Wamochie
