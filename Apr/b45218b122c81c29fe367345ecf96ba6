A Meru businessman has donated food stuff, face masks, sanitizers and other hygiene essentials to a centre that caters for children who are mentally and physically challenged. Lawrence Ngaruro donated the items to St Lawrence Day Care and Rehabilitation Center at Nkubu, South Imenti. Ngaruro said he decided to remember the needy children during Easter and now that the Covid-19 has made life difficult. “I want to urge businessmen and other able Kenyans to remember the vulnerable during Easter and Covid-19 epidemic,” he said. Sister Salome of Nazarene Sisters said the facility is now facing difficulties as many of its donations were from foreign from well-wishers in Italy and USA. “Due to Covid-19 we have stopped receiving donations and we are urging other residents like Ngaruro to come out,” she said. She said the facility that was housing 35 now has only 10 at the moment.
