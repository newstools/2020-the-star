Only Kenya Power and the Rural Electrification Authority will be allowed to erect or repair street lights under a proposed law. Kiambu MP Jude Njomo has said the bill he is to table in Parliament will curtail theft of street lights erected through NG-CDF. Njomo spoke at Kiambu police station on Monday after officers caught a man on an electric pole trying to vandalise and remove a street light. “We have been installing street lights in the villages but they are stolen hence undergoing huge losses to reconnect them,” Njomo said. The legislator said there were reports that the street lights were being stolen and then reinstalled through the county government street lighting programme. “There are some allegations that unscrupulous contractors contracted by the county government hire electricians to steal the street lights to fulfil their contracts,” Njomo said. The police said that they have a suspect who can lead them to where they sell the lights after stealing. Njomo commended Ndumberi chief and police officers who have been following up on culprits. Residents have been angered by increased burglaries especially in areas where street lights had been vandalised, leaving thieves to pounce on their victims. “We are in the rainy season and the lights installed by our MP have been stolen. When it is raining the police do not patrol especially past 2am and that is when the thieves are breaking into our homes,” resident John Muhia said. NGCDF chairman Stephen Mwaura said 104 street lights in Kanunga and Ndumberi villages are missing. “We are experiencing loss of streetlights despite our efforts to light our villages and now we need a solution to keep thieves at bay,” Mwaura said. Residents called for stern action against any culprits and a manhunt of those buying the street lights. (edited by o. owino)
