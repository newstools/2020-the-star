Kenya has reported seven new coronavirus cases, bringing to 303 the country's total number of confirmed cases, Health CS Mutahi Kagwe said on Wednesday. This was from 707 samples tested in the last 24 hours. The new cases are all Kenyans aged between 21 and 61 years with no recent history of travel. Six are from Mombasa while one is from Nairobi. Six of the cases are from targeted mass testing and one was picked by surveillance teams. Five are men while two are women. On a positive note, there were nine additional recoveries recorded, bringing the total of patients discharged to 83. A total of 15,124 samples have so far been tested. "There is nothing to celebrate when runaway impunity takes place at the risk of all of us," he said. "A slight lapse in behaviour could roll back the gains we have made and the destiny of our nation." The government has rolled out a helpline to help reduce stress and mental illnesses brought about by the effects of the coronavirus. Kagwe said mass testing is going on. There are 25,000 testing kits deployed. He said Kenya aims to conduct 250,000 tests by the end of June. For community based surveillance, the target is 100,000 households.
