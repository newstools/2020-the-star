Narok residents living in areas prone to floods and mudslides have been urged to move to safe grounds to avoid loss of life. Governor Samuel Tunai said everyone must take necessary precautions until the rains subside. He spoke on Tuesday after visiting flood victims at Olmeoshi Primary School in Transmara West. Also present during the visit was Transmara West deputy county commissioner Mohammed Hassan Noor. At least 114 families from Kimintet ward were displaced by floods on Sunday night after River Mara burst its banks following heavy rainfall. Their houses were submerged. The county disaster management team distributed relief food and an assortment of non-food items to the victims. The donations included 300 mattresses, blankets and mosquito nets, 100 bales of maize flour, 100 cartons of cooking oil and tents. The Health department also distributed masks, 40 litres of soap and medication to Emarti Health Centre. “As the heavy rains continue, we ask all people to heed the advice of the government to prevent loss of lives and property. Those asked to move to safe grounds should do so before disaster strikes,” Tunai said. The governor added that engineers from the county will assess the damage to the roads for immediate repairs. Schools affected by the floods will also be supported. “The county government will collaborate with the provincial administration to make replacements of birth certificates and other important documents lost by students during the floods,” Tunai said. The Kenya Red Cross team will help in the logistics of identifying affected families and distribution of relief from other well-wishers. Noor said a national government committee is mandated to handle disaster operations during the rainy season. “We will work closely with the local government administration to ensure those affected are assisted,” he said.
