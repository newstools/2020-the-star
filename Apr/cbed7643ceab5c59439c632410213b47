Kenya University Sports Association (KUSA) will have no problem changing their basketball calendar to conform with the international one. Tony Ochieng, who is in charge of Kusa basketball programmes, said they will adapt to the international calendar should Kenya Basketball Federation (KBF) make the change. “The idea is good. We have no problems if it is effected. What we will do is to adapt and realign ourselves to the international calendar,” he said. The Strathmore University coach appealed to the federation not rush the decision as there are some major things to take into considerations. Ochieng said it will be difficult to implement the change this year since it had not been planned. “Next year would be most ideal,” he added. “There are challenges that need to be looked into before finally being decided because teams have already done budget for the year,” he observed. He said the changes were effected in both football and rugby and things were running smoothly. The Kusa programme, he said, starts in September and runs up to December taking a break before resuming again in January to end in March. Strathmore University, United States International University and Kenyatta University are among their teams that also feature in the national league. Others are Egerton University, Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology, Zetech University, KCA University, Mount Kenya University and Riara University.
