Nine people from Mirangine in Nyandarua county have been quarantined for 14 days after they were found in a crowded bar past curfew hours. Nyandarua county commissioner Boaz Cherutich said on Sunday evening that the nine were among 20 people who were found drinking alcohol in a room at Paradise Bar at 7.15pm on Saturday. Acting on intelligence, police raided the establishment but 11 people managed to escape. The nine have been quarantined at Nyandarua High School. “As a measure to control crowding of people and to stamp out illegal sale and drinking of beer by notorious individuals, the county emergency response committee has directed that the nine individuals be quarantined for 14 days at their own cost,” Cherutich said. The administrator said after the quarantine period, the nine will be charged with violating directives. He said those disobeying government guidelines in the war on Covid-19 will be arrested and charged. Cherutich said they have planned another raid in Ndaragwa subcounty, where bar owners are violating government directives. Cherutich said in each of the seven subcounties of Nyandarua there is an isolation centre where those caught violating the law will be confined. “We have compiled a list of bars that are violating regulations and their licences will be revoked,” he said.
