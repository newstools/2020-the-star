Bungoma has started to distribute relief food to 6,000 vulnerable families. “We have begun with 500 families but target to reach 6,000 in the first phase. Each food pack is estimated to last at least a month,” Governor Wycliffe Wangamiti said. Families will receive 20kgs of flour, two litres of cooking oil, 2kgs of rice, 2kgs of sugar, one bar of soap and one litre of sanitiser. Wangamati said the county has planned to distribute food aid to an estimated 120,000 vulnerable households. The exercise follows a call by the national government to minimise movement and avoid crowded places as part of measures to control the spread of coronavirus. “Businesses and other sources of income in the county have suffered a great deal, exposing people to hunger and starvation,” Wangamati said. The county is distributing food in collaboration with Kenya Red Cross, the Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and the national government. The distribution targets Bungoma town, Webuye, Kimilili, Chwele and Kapsokwony in Mt Elgon. The governor said next week, the county will flag off another consignment of food to cover all the wards. He urged well-wishers to help the county take care of vulnerable residents. Wangamiti said the county will receive donations in kind but asked that cash be channelled to a committee chaired by the KNCCI through a/c 01141425861800 or Paybill 400200 #KNCCI BGM.
