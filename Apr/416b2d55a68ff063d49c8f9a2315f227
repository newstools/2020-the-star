Health CS Mutahi Kagwe has warned families against taking out stress on each other using domestic violence during these times of Covid-19. "The stress level in our country is going to increase, this is a challenge to overcome,” Kagwe said on Wednesday. He said parents should not be violent against children to relieve stress. “Let us not use our spouses, daughters, sons as a way of relieving our stress,” the CS said. The CS said domestic violence in homes has spiked in the country since the onset of the pandemic. "There are increases in domestic violence in homes and I urge religious leaders to intervene in this matter to counsel people," Kagwe said. At the same time, the CS lauded police officers enforcing dusk-dawn curfew. He said that the measure has been of benefit to the country since it was imposed and warned Kenyans against disobeying directives. “When the rule of law is broken, know that you are inviting anarchy. I plead with all Kenyans to observe the curfew. Let's corporate with the security forces,” He said. The country has registered nine more positive cases from over 800 samples tested in the last 24 hours. In his daily briefing on the virus in the country, Kagwe said that all the new cases are from Kenyans with no travel history. Kagwe said the nine are among the people that the government have tracked through contact tracing. Five of them are from Nairobi and the other four are from Mombasa and are aged between nine and 69 years. The CS said the country also lost one patient, pushing the number of deaths to 10.
