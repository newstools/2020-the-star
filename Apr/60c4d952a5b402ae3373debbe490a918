The dilapidated Mweiga police station, which was built 82 years ago, will be built afresh, Kieni MP Kanini Kega has said. The station was built by the colonial government in 1938. It will be rebuilt for Sh3 million and is expected to be completed in two months. Kieni NG-CDF chairman Maina Munene told the Star on Wednesday the money has been allocated. “To improve service delivery to my people, I have, through the NG-CDF, embarked on improving the police station," Kega said while laying a foundation stone at the station. "Today, accompanied by the deputy county commissioner and subcounty police commander Kieni West, we laid the foundation stone for Mweiga police station.” Kanini said the station was giving Mweiga town a bad image as it has gaping holes. All eight wards in the constituency will each have a police station to boost security, he said. “I am glad we will have a completely functional station with all the departments under one roof. We are also building a police station in all eight wards in the constituency,” he said. Edited by A.N
