A court has said the National Assembly overreached when it ordered the public prosecutor to charge city lawyer Hillary Sigei for money laundering. Justice Weldon Korir said the Public Accounts Committee usurped the power of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions over the matter involving the National Youth Service Scandal. The office of the Auditor General and PAC both concluded that Sigei had abetted money laundering and received funds stolen from the NYS. Sigei had allegedly withdrawn Sh500 million from the law firm of Sing’oei Murkomen and Sigei Advocates clients account. “What then is the role of the DPP? Is he a puppet of the National Assembly?” Korir asked. The judge quashed the recommendations in the PAC report, granting Sigei's wishes in the case filed in 2017. The Speaker of the National Assembly had opposed the petition, saying that the court has no jurisdiction to interfere with the internal workings of Parliament. The speaker urged the court to adhere to the principle of separation of powers between the arms of government. The judge said Parliament cannot violate the Constitution and other laws and expect its actions, once challenged to be upheld. He said Sigei and the law firm were well within their rights to sue for the violation of their constitutional rights. The judge declared that recommendations of the PAC report inquiring into the happenings at the National Youth service violated Sigei’s rights. Korir also set aside recommendations of the report that the DPP should prefer charges of aiding and abetting money laundering crimes. The judge said it is only the DPP who has the power to direct the Inspector General of Police and the Directorate of Criminal Investigations to probe an allegation of criminal conduct. He said the PAC should have said it found that crimes may have been committed and let the investigative agencies take up from there. (edited by o. owino)
