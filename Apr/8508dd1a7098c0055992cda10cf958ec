Some of the issues the committee will follow up on are provision of testing and medical equipment; provision of isolation centres, measures to ensure continuous supply of food, how learning will go on uninterrupted, safety of front-line workers and financial assistance of vulnerable groups. Other spheres of focus include measures to protect employees from retrenchment, policies for stopping spread of the disease and protection of residential and commercial tenants. Kenyans can submit their view through hand delivery to the office of the clerk of the Senate at Parliament Buildings or through an email to csenate@parliament.go.ke or covid19@parliament.go.ke.
