At least 69,975 health professionals applied for the posts advertised by the government to increase the workforce to respond to coronavirus. The Public Service Commission called for the listing of 5,550 health workers to fill various cadres. They include 500 registered clinical officers; at least 2,000 registered nurses and 200 pharmacists. There are slots for 200 medical laboratory technologists; 100 community oral health officers; 50 radiographers; 500 assistant public health officers; 500 enrolled nurses and 1,500 community health assistants. The jobs were advertised following President Uhuru Kenyatta's directive that the Health ministry hires more medics for Covid-19 emergency response. PSC chairman Stephen Kirogo, in a letter to Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe seen by the Star on Monday, wants the rest of the recruitment completed by Thursday, April 30. “The counties are required to fast-track the recruitment and placement process to enable the programme to take off,” the letter reads. The communication was copied to Head of Public Service Joseph Kinyua, Council of Governors chairman Wycliffe Oparanya and Catherine Omweno – chairperson of County Public Service Boards consultative forum. The PSC further revealed that it will conduct interviews for at least 10 counties – including Nairobi, for lack of operational Public Service Boards. Kirogo says the commission will conduct the recruitment for Mombasa, Lamu, Kitui, Kiambu, West Pokot, Baringo, Narok, Homa Bay, Migori, Kirinyaga, Machakos and Nairobi Metropolitan Services. “In this regard, the commission has sent the details of the 69,975 applicants in soft copy to the Health ministry to be forwarded to the respective counties. Nairobi had the highest number of applicants at 6,685; followed by Kiambu (3,023); Kakamega (2,820); Kisii (2,688); Kisumu (2,561); Nakuru (2,482); Homa Bay (2,320); Uasin Gishu (2,219); Siaya (2,214); Bungoma (2,173) and Nandi (2,165). Lamu had the lowest number of applicants at 184 followed by Taita Taveta (415); Samburu (419); Isiolo (524); Marsabit (560); Nyandarua (615) and Kirinyaga (636). Details of 1,865 applicants were forwarded to Machakos; Kajiado (1,759); Kilifi (1,711); Bomet (1,651); Elgeyo Marakwet (1,568); Baringo (1,481); Kericho (1,475); Nyeri (1,456); Turkana (1,456); and Trans Nzoia (1,415). Others are Meru (1,387); Busia (1,377); Mombasa (1,289); Tharaka Nithi (1,226); Nyamira (1,207); Narok (1,150); Kitui (1,109); Makueni (1,033); and Murang’a (1,028). Others with less than 1,000 applicants include Embu (965); Garissa (808); Vihiga (794); Wajir (790); Kwale (756); West Pokot (734); Mandera (696); and Laikipia (670). Before this, governors had protested the PSC involvement in the recruitment, saying health is a devolved function. The county bosses cited a contravention to the County Governments Act which provides that counties are responsible for functions set in the Constitution. They vouched for county service boards to conduct the listing of health workers saying the law assigns them the power to regulate the engagement of persons on contract, volunteer and casual workers. The boards are also in charge of staff or those seconded through joint ventures as well as the attachment of interns in public bodies and offices. The national government’s position was that PSC undertook the listing to fasten the process. Of concern was that some counties have weak public service management while others lack the requisite boards. Edited by R.Wamochie
