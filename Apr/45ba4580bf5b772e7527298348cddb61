 Kisumu county government will host the Africities summit at the Kisumu Showground in November next year. The signature event of the United Cities and Local Governments in Africa (UCLG-Africa) will be held in Kenya for the second time after the first one in 2006. Governor Anyang Nyong’o said the showground provides the best place to host the 2021 conference that is set to run from November 16 to 20. Nyong’o said the county government will allocate resources for the refurbishment of the ground. He said the showground has been underutilised for many years and only comes to life during annually ASK regional events. “We feel that using it for AfriCities Summit in 2021, we as a county and our partners we will be able to put enough resources to upgrade its facilities,” the governor said during the weekend. Nyong’o who toured the facility said the upgrading will soon start. Access roads, water, electricity and security are among issued to be addressed. The governor also announced that the construction to bitumen standard of Muhoroni-Chemelil-Mamboleo road will soon start to add impetus to the showground venue. He said they have to make sure that access to Mamboleo is improved. "The refurbishment will not destroy the heritage of the showground but will add value to the existing structures. We will work together with the institutions who annually exhibit for the ASK,” Nyong’o said. He said the showground will attract investments in terms of the hotel industry, saying there was enough land.  Edited by Peter Obuya
