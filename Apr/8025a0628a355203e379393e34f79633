Residents of Wasweta 2 ward in Migori are taking turns to repair an access road after a prolonged delay by the county government to begin construction. They claim they are forced to carry their dead on their backs to the mortuaries and burials because no vehicles can reach the village. Families along the three-kilometre stretch from Nyailing’a village through Kipasi Singa Primary School are on a morning and evening rota for the repairs. “We can’t access schools in the area and our agricultural produce is always wasted because of the poor state of the road which connects us with Bondo Nyironge and Nyabisawa centres,” Solomon Asembo said. Another resident, Damaris Anyango said politicians have pledged to repair the road in the last two election cycles but nothing has been done. “We lost faith in our leaders and decided to work on it ourselves,” Anyango said. The two said that after several attempts to seek redress at the Migori Roads department, they took matters into their hands. “We have been waiting for quotation and estimates of the road to be tendered to no avail,” Anyango said. MCA Patrick Aran told the Star on the phone that the residents' move is “political nonsense”. Aran said he secured a grader from the Ministry of Roads with Sh20,000 from his pockets but it was turned away. He said a woman on whose farm a section of the road passes through threatened to strip naked if work began. “I told the community to agree with the woman and let us start off the road, but they never came. They were incited to do what they are doing,” Aran said. He said residents action to repair the road was normal and insisted current heavy rains had stalled work which will resume soon.
