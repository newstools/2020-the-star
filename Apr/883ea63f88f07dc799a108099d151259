Traders in Kwale are frustrated by the extension of the curfew and cessation of movement saying it is a major hindrance to their businesses. President Uhuru Kenyatta on Saturday directed that the dusk-to-dawn curfew and the cessation of movement would go on for another 21 days. But the traders said the extension will further deteriorate their lives as prices of commodities rise. “Currently you have to send someone to Kongowea to bring the stock and that person is taking advantage of the situation to double the price,” Mohammed Hassan said. The vendors said both the lockdown and curfew had already affected their daily activities and stretching it will totally paralyse the sector. He said shorter working hours mean they can’t compensate for the loss incurred through purchasing and transportation. “Things like vegetables are fast-moving but because of limited time to operate they normally go to waste,” he said. He added that before the curfew, they used to work late nights and reaping profits from night shoppers. Dennis Otieno said the government’s decision on prolonging the lockdown period is not conducive for business. He said respective authorities could have formulated policies that favour the fight against the coronavirus, as well as economic activities. Otieno said people will continue to flout the rules in search of food. “There are colleagues whose businesses start and do well in the evening now those individuals will do what it takes to feed their families,” he said. Jackson Makori from Carlipso market in Ukunda said the government should look for alternative ways of mitigating the spread of the virus that will not interfere with the business industry. Hassan Rashid, however, commends Uhuru’s efforts of combating the disease saying they have helped in reducing the infection rate in the county, which has one case to date. Edited by R.Wamochie
