Clerics in Nyanza want the government to reopen churches, saying the nation needs to call on God now more than before. Bishop Philip Obuya of Christ Greater Exploits Church in Manyatta, Kisumu, urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to lift the ban, saying they are ready to conduct services in shifts of even five members. “We appeal to the President to open places of worship. If people humble themselves, God will hear them,” he said on Thursday. The clerics also want the government to provide them with sanitiser and face masks. Obuya said the government should work closely with the church to curb the spread of Covid-19. He said the church provides a good platform for the government to create awareness on the dangers of the virus and ways to prevent its spread. “The church can play an integral part in helping the nation to combat the spread of the pandemic,” he added. Obuya said the harassment meted out on a number of religious leaders found praying alone in their churches is uncalled for. Recently, some clerics through the Kisumu Clergy Fellowship appealed to Uhuru to order the reopening of the houses of worship. "The President during the national prayer day acknowledged the power of God that transcends science,” they said in a joint statement read by Episcopal Church of Africa Archbishop Joshua. They asked the government to uphold the freedom of worship. "The freedom of worship that is clearly outlined in our Constitution has since been curtailed because our sanctity to life has been endangered by the pandemic," the statement read. The clerics pledged to strictly adhere to the Ministry of Health's guidelines to prevent the spread of the virus if the government reopens churches. Koyo said they will ask congregants to wash their hands at the entrances, sanitise hands and wear masks. He said they will ensure worshipers observe 1.5-metre social distancing, increase number of services and minimise worshiping hours. They will also discourage handshakes and hugs. Edited by A.N
