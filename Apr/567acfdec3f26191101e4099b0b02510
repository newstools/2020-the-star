Residents of Vihiga’s Jivovoli village in Hamisi subcounty are in shock after two baby-sized coffins were found abandoned. One was placed at Mukuli PAG Church and the second in a homestead. Assistant chief Esther Mirenje said the coffins had blood stains and chicken feathers. They were also written Sh8,000. “The two coffins are for babies. We are yet to understand what this act means,” Mirenje said. We cannot speculate anything at the moment, she added. Mirenje said the coffins were most likely brought at night. “I have not heard any trouble in this area,” she said. She warned anyone with an evil motive to come out and solve their concerns rather than using such tricks to threaten the public. Edited by R.Wamochie
