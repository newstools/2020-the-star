More than 1,000 families in Funyula constituency have been displaced after floods from Lake Victoria and River Sio submerged their homes. The overflow of the lake and river witnessed in the constituency last week left residents of Mango, Sigalame, Hakati, Busijo and Bujwanga homeless. MP Wilberforce Mudenyo said apart from houses being submerged, crops and personal items were destroyed. Mudenyo said nine sub-locations in the constituency were affected and the families were in dare need of humanitarian support. "The affected families have been left with nothing apart from their dear lives," he added. The Funyula MP said his office was in consultations with the relevant authorities to speed up evacuation of the affected families to higher ground. "We have identified two rescue centres at Namasali Polytechnic and Muluanda but with the coronavirus, and to avoid congestion, we are only evacuating families to higher grounds near them," Mudenyo said. He said he wanted to step up stop-gap and long-term measures to avoid double tragedy in his constituency with the menace of coronavirus. The MP said it was unfortunate that the floods had hit them at the same time the world was struggling with the coronavirus pandemic. The MP said he would use the available resource to rescue the affected families. "So far, we have donated funds and food to over 500 households but we are going to make sure that all the 1,000 homesteads are supplied with food," the MP said. He advised residents to adjust to the new climatic changes to avoid further loss of property. "We have also talked to Devolution Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa and he has accepted to supply us with food to help the affected families.‚Äù The MP at the same time asked residents to continue observing government directive on measures to tame Covid-19.
