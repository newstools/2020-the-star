Three years ago, the comedy industry lost comedian Emmanuel Nyambane, alias Ayeiya. He died after his car hit a pole near the Catholic University of Eastern Africa on Magadi Road, while coming from a show at Carnivore. Godfather of laugh industry Churchill paid tribute to Ayeiya during the recording of the show. "Unfortunately, this is the week we lost Ayeiya," he said. "This is your anniversary. We still remember you Ayeiya and we pray you to continue resting in peace. "He was coming up very well. Ayeiya, we still love you so much." Ayeiya had many signature styles. His fans can vividly remember how he used to walk on stage. Ayeiya would come in with his signature beats and say, “Ayeiyaaa, poa poa!”
