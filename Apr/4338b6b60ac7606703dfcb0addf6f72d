Some human rights groups in Taita Taveta county have teamed up to campaign against the coronavirus. Their targets are remote areas where most residents know little about the pandemic. "Most people in rural areas have not been sensitised. We have joined hands to bridge the information gap," Taita Taveta Human Rights Watch chairman Hajji Mwakio said. The other groups are Sauti ya Wanawake and Action Aid. Besides the campaign, Hajji said they are distributing water to those who are unable to access clean water. "Clean water is an important commodity at this pandemic time. We are saddened by situations where people cannot access water," he noted further urging the county government to speed up the connection of clean water to all parts of the devolved unit, he said. Kishushe, Mlilo and Paranga are the most hit areas with a 20-little can selling at Sh25. Hajji said the water shortage has jeopardised the handwashing campaign. The lobby groups are also distributing sanitiser, masks, sanitary pads and other essential items to vulnerable people. The lobbyist underscored the need for a major grassroots campaign as a measure to prevent Covid-19. So far, Taita Taveta has not reported any case of the virus. However, three of the neighbouring counties - Kilifi, Kwale and Kajiado have confirmed cases. The county also neighbours Tanzania, which also has confirmed Covid-19 cases. Local politicians continue to support the fight against the disease. Newton Kifuso, the Wumingu/ Kishushe MCA, has funded a similar campaign in the ward. "We have a ward campaign team that has been leading sensitisation programmes. I have sponsored youths to record campaign songs that are being used to pass the message," Kifuso said. He urged residents to minimise movements and instead turn to their farms toÂ  ensure a food secure community, even after the pandemic.
