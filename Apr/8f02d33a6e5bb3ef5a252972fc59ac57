Police officers in Masaba North subcounty, Nyamira, on Sunday impounded rolls of bhang worth Sh300,000.  County commissioner Amos Mariba said the officers were on regular patrol when they suspected the vehicle that was ferrying the drug on Keroka-Metamanywa road, hence pursued it. "They managed to impound 1,000 rolls of bhang worth street value of Sh300,000," he said. The bhang was taken to Keroka police station. Two people in the vehicle were also arrested and detained at the station pending investigations. Mariba said they will not relent in the war on illicit drugs and brews and urged religious leaders to intensify the campaign. "The illicit drugs and brews are intoxicating and forcing some people to commit suicide. Some families have broken down due to drug and substance abuse,” he said. He also blamed some murder cases in the area on drug and substance abuse. The commissioner urged members of the public to volunteer information to help the police in fighting crime, emphasising that such information will be treated with the utmost confidentiality and the volunteers protected. Mariba also urged residents to obey the curfew order so they can protect themselves from contracting the coronavirus. He said "the disease is real," hence the government directive should not be taken for granted.
