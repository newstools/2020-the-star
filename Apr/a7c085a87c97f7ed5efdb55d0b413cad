Thirty-one people who tried to enter Garissa town from Nairobi have been quarantined for 14 days. Security officers acting on a tip-off arrested four of them in a car as they tried to enter the town on midnight Sunday. They were immediately quarantined. On Monday evening, an Emirates bus was impounded at the Tana Bridge with 27 passengers on board. The passengers were allegedly picked from Mwingi after being dropped off by cars from Nairobi. “I want to appeal to the people of Garissa that whatever measures the government is putting in place are for their own interest and that of the rest of the country,” Garissa Health county executive  Ahmednadir Omar said at the Tana Bridge screening centre. He warned that serious action will be taken against anyone breaking the rules now in place against the spread of coronavirus. “People should not try to beat the law. The hand of the government is long and its eyes see very far,” Omar said. The CEC said that anybody arriving from Nairobi, Kilifi, Kwale and Mombasa will be quarantined at his/her cost. “They can use whatever measures to come here. They  will be charged after the quarantine with trying to expose other people to the deadly virus,” he said. Garissa county commissioner Meru Mwangi said that the licence of Emirates bus company will be suspended. Mwangi said punitive measures will be meted out on bus owners or individuals defying anti-coronavirus rules. On April 6, President Uhuru Kenyatta restricted movement into and out of Nairobi, Mombasa, Kilifi and Kwale counties to limit the spread of the virus. The country had 281 Covid-19 positive cases on April 20. (edited by o. owino)
