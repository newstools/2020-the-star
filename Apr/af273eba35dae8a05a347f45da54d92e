Lawyers in Bungoma have urged the National Council on Administration of Justice to find an urgent solution so courts can resume their usual hearings. Led by LSK local chapter chair George Murunga, the lawyers said they were finding it difficult to hear clients' pleas through video link.Â  They said most of their clients are farmers who have no access to online services. He asked the state to allow the Ministry of Health to ensure tougher court inspections and allow sessions to continue with their operations. "Most of our clients are unable to access online services, which is a big problem," Murunga said. He said since the government banned all public gatherings, many lawyers are not getting cash to sustain their daily operations, including paying employees and rent. "Our courtrooms are big enough to accommodate five to six people provided the court indicates the correct time when a claimant or the accused is slotted to appear," Murunga said. He said reaching out to clients is very hard because sometimes getting their phone numbers and their emails is challenging. Murunga said the online hearing is not good because many law firms risk being closed down by the end of this month if the pandemic persists as they will lack the cash to sustain operations.
