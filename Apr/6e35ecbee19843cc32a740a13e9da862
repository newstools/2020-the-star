Homa Bay government has purchased equipment worth Sh3.8 million to be used by the medical practitioners against Covid-19. The county government also received two ambulances from development partners. The protective equipment include head gears, disposable gowns, thermometer guns, face masks, gloves, and hand washing gel among other equipment for handling a coronavirus patient. Homa Bay county director of medical services Gordon Okomo, director of disaster Management Eliud Onyango, Finance Chief Officer Noah Otieno and director of procurement Samson Okumu led the distribution of the equipment. The equipment was distributed to various health facilities in the county on Saturday and Sunday. Okomo said a batch of the equipment was taken to Malela Health Centre, which is the main isolation facility for Covid-19. Others were distributed to Homa Bay County Referral Hospital and eight sub county hospitals in the county. Okomo said the equipment will give health workers audacity in handling Covid-19 patients besides enhancing their safety. “These equipment will enable health workers perform their duties with confidence should there be a case because they prevent them from contracting the virus,” Okomo said. He said the two new ambulances will augment response in fight against the disease. “These ambulances have facilities for supporting life hence they are convenient for patients whose lives are in danger,” Okomo said. A number of medics have complained of lack of the equipment in the county health facilities. Onyango warned health workers against theft of the equipment. “We don’t expect any health worker to steal any of the equipment. Anybody found selling them elsewhere will be jailed,” Onyango said.
