Officials from the Ministry of Health inspected the Milimani law courts on Tuesday so they can advise the Judiciary on how to safely reopen the courts. They will make a formal report but in the meantime said the chief magistrate's court should have no more than 14 people. These people will most likely include a magistrate, clerk, lawyers, one witness, and accused persons for plea-taking. The National Council on the Administration of Justice (NCAJ) had requested the Health Ministry to recommend how some court proceedings can be opened. The Judiciary has downscaled its services and migrated to digital platforms where cases are filed online and heard through virtual apps to curb the spread of the coronavirus. Health officials will recommend the number of people to be safely admitted to court and waiting areas. They will recommend social distancing, infection prevention, disinfection of surfaces and waiting areas after hearings, among other measures. The officers also said they will advise all court clerks to wear gloves and provide sanitiser outside each court. However, they were concerned with the poor ventilation system at the court premises and said the courtrooms should have proper air circulation. LSK boss Nelson Havi had written to Chief Justice David Maraga asking him to reopen the courts. He said the closure of courts was not supported by law. The Judiciary has no infrastructure to enable remote working, he said. He said it was the responsibility of the Judiciary to ensure the safety of court users. (Edited by V. Graham)
