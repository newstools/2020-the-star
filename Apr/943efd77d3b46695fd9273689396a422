A Kwale rehabilitation centre could close because it is being overstretched by drug users unable to make ends meet because of Covid-19 control measures. Teens Watch director Cosmus Maina has asked the county government to intervene or the centreâ€™s operations will be halted. Maina said over 2,500 drug addicts and reforming prostitutes depend on the centre but the effect of the coronavirus is overloading the system. He said since various income-generating activities have been disrupted, the drug addicts on methadone flock the centre seeking food and shelter. "Previously, some of them used their means of getting money but now almost every activity is affected and I am their last hope," he told the Star on the phone. Currently, Maina said, hundreds of the drug addicts go for the three meals at Teens Watch contrary to the previous days when it was just a small number. Maina said the county should supplement them with essential commodities to help walk through the tough times. He said the drug addicts are vulnerable and he is worried if not well catered for they will relapse. "These people are transforming and you and I are lucky because we can go and eat somewhere but Teens Watch is more of their home. What happens if we can't provide for them?" Maina said. The director said the majority of drug users sleep on the streets which have become unsafe due to the curfew. He said the county government should set aside a safe house for the street and the homeless families to prevent and control the spread of the virus. Maina said sheltering drug addicts and the helpless will help reduce frequent conflicts with police. "We know it's a curfew time and officers manning the areas won't care if you have a home or not. What they want is nobody outside," he said. Meanwhile, Maina has asked the county to provide sanitiser and other equipment needed to enhance the fight against Covid-19 among street families.
