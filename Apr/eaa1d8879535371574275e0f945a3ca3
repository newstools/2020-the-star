My biggest challenge has been the extra hats I have had to wear and the balancing acts. Besides, meetings and editing stories and coming up with content, I am also the teacher of my daughter. I ensure that in addition to my workload, the little one has enough work to occupy her. The work has to be checked and posted in the online portal for grading. However, once the routine was set, everything fell into place. The benefits of working from home include wearing your comfy pyjamas all day, having editorial meetings as you gaze out at the sprawling green scenery and, above all, never having to deal with traffic or rude bus touts to and from work. The lessons I have learned from working from home is that you have to maintain a strict routine. Edited by Henry Makori
