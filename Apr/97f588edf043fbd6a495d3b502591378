Singer Mbosso unveiled his new car, a Toyota Land Cruiser Prado, to the public, but fans weren’t convinced that it is indeed his car. During Tanasha’s birthday, Diamond bought her and her mum similar cars. It seems like Mbosso has inherited Tanasha’s car. However, he denied the rumours in an interview with Wasafi media. He said, "I was told, if I’m not keen, my car will be seen to be that of Tanasha’s. This is my car that I started the year with," he said. The ‘Hodari’ hitmaker then showed receipts of ownership of the car. Speaking about her car in a recent interview, Tanasha said she left it in Tanzania. "I had no interest in taking it. I have my car here. I have my BMW it in the garage. I can get myself a car and what I need, that’s all that matters," she said.
