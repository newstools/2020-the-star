Mutahi Kagwe yesterday showered praise on the Kenyan media for the unprecedented publication of a national clarion call to action. The Health Cabinet Secretary publicly expressed gratitude for the decision of newspaper editors to publish "We Stand With Kenyans" an opinion piece published in the Star, Daily Nation and the Standard yesterday. The Editors made an urgent and passionate call to every Kenyan to contribute to the war against the pandemic because "all of us are soldiers" in the scramble for survival. "The battle for our lives today will not be won by a powerful, privileged few. Every man, woman and child in this country must become that great general. And our weapons are not necessarily guns and bullets; our weapons are social discipline, sacrifice and caring for the welfare and safety of those around you," the editors said in a page one commentary which was also carried by TV stations. In the daily briefing yesterday, Kagwe described the bold step as unprecedented. "I want to acknowledge the bold step taken by our newspapers and media houses today for their clarion call to fight the virus,” Kagwe said. He added: “This is unprecedented and it shows the unity of a nation, it shows the unity of different segments of our economy and the unity of our support. This further amplifies our call for unity against the pandemic.” He also appreciated the work being done by researchers in the country, saying they were spending sleepless nights to develop local solutions to the pandemic. He further appreciated corporates, philanthropists, volunteers, health workers, researchers and medical staff for their support. “From the young fashion designer distributing free face masks in Kibera slums to the corporate giants like Safaricom who continue to make huge sacrifices in this fight. The country is indebted to you.” Also on the list is Kitui county who are now producing an average of 30,000 face masks per day. The WHO has also recognized the county for their effort.
