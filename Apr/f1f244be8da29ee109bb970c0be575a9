Over sixty coaches are involved in a Fiba Level 1 online clinic conducted by national team coaches Ronny Owino and Cliff Owuor. Owino said they are doing the clinic in conjunction with Kenya Basketball Federation (KBF) with the blessings of the continental body, FIBA Africa. The clinic, the veteran tactician said involves two groups featuring 26 tacticians from Nyanza and another 23 from both Limuru and Naivasha. “It is a good opportunity to keep the coaches busy and thinking basketball during this time where every attention is on coronavirus pandemic,” said Owino. The clinic that started on Friday will run until April 30 with the practicals scheduled for a later date when it is all safe. “ I will look to get a window to do practicals in groups of 15 later on after sorting the logistics,” said Owino who is also a FIBA instructor. Owuor applauded the response from the coaches saying it was encouraging as it showed how eager they were to get the knowledge that will benefit their teams. “We are getting the coaches to do the studies online and then send us results via email after three days. It keeps them busy,” said Owuor. Meanwhile, FIBA have announced that women’s Afro-Basket will now be held from September 17-26 in 2021. The men’s version of the tourney has been set for August 24 to September 5.
