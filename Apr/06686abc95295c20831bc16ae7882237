The county government of Kakamega plans to boost its water supply to five million litres to ensure sufficient supply. The current supply stands at three million litres a day. The commodity is rationed for residents of Kakamega town. The county government has set side Sh87 million to enhance its supply capacity in the next two years. â€œWe are optimistic that the improved supply to eight million litres will meet the ever-growing demand by the population," said Barasa Wangwe, the county executive for water. He said the rapid growth of Kakamega town since introduction of devolution seven years ago had increased demand for water. The town gets its supply from the Tindinyo gravity water project in neighbouring Nandi county. During his re-election campaigns, Governor Wycliffe Oparanya promised to ensure piped water is connected to every household in the county before 2022. Oparanya has announced an ambitious plan to transform Kakamega town to city status before the end of his second term of office. Wangwe, speaking in his office, said that the county government was keen on investments in the water sector to meet the demand. "We are working on a 20-year water supply program for the town," he explained. He pointed out that a separate line from the project would be dedicated to the new Kakamega Teaching and Referral Hospital, adding that the facility would need a lot of water. He said other small projects will be set up within the township to supplement the supply from the main project to ease the pressure. Edited by Henry Makori
