The fight against the coronavirus in Northeastern on Friday got a shot in the arm after the Wajir Regional Referral Laboratory was opened. The regional hub, which will serve the counties of Wajir, Mandera, Garissa and Marsabit, has the capacity to test between 60-100 samples in 24 hours. Governor Mohamed Abdi said the laboratory is equipped with ultra-modern equipment. “This is a milestone because Wajir Regional Referral Laboratory will be designated a Covid-19 testing site in Kenya,” he said. Abdi, whose county has not yet reported any case, welcomed the 21 days lockdown of Mandera. Mandera has eight cases. Abdi was flanked by among others Deputy Governor Ahmed Mukhtar and county commissioner Jacob Narengo. He said they are aware of their susceptibility and they will not leave anything to chance. Abdi thanked Wajir Muslim Youth and Save the Children for partnering with the county government to educate the Muslim population about the disease. Edited by A.N
