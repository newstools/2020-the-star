Kilifi Deputy Governor Gideon Saburi has fully recovered from Covid-19, Health CS Mutahi Kagwe has announced. However, his joy will be cut short as he is due to be charged for failing to self-quarantine following a trip to Berlin. "In spite of all this, I'm pleased to announce that the Deputy Governor of Kilifi has fullyÂ  recovered after being subjected to the two tests and coming out negative," Kagwe said on Thursday. Saburi put many at risk after attending official county functions following his return from Germany. Governor Amason Kingi had to self-quarantine after being among those Saburi interacted with. There are now four complete recoveries from Covid-19. Others include Brenda Cherotich and Brian Orinda. Kagwe urged those who are in quarantine to keep social distancing. Kenya's Covid-19 cases have shot past the 100 mark to 110 with the confirmation of 29 new cases on Thursday. A total of 23 of the confirmed cases were detected in the designated quarantine facilities, while six are from suspected cases in isolation units. The ages of the confirmed cases range from 16-64. "Those in quarantine should keep distance. If you are in a quarantine facility, keep serious social distance," he said. Kagwe asked authorities to arrest social media users who mocked the two patients who recovered from Covid-19 and came out to share their stories. "The situation is not getting better but worse. This disease is a pandemic. As a government we are continuously improving response to mitigate rates of infections," he said.
