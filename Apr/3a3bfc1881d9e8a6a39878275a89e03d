Makueni will use Sh20 million of its Sh45 million Covid-19 budget for water trucking, training of health workers and community sensitisation. Governor Kibutha Kibwana has said the cash will also be used to buy personal protective gear for medics, ventilators, oxygen cylinders and to beef up ICUs. The Sh20 million had been queried by the county assembly on Monday. Health executive Andrew Mulwa failed to appear before the Budget and Appropriation Committee to give a breakdown of the funds. Finance Executive Mary Kimanzi did not have the answer to the committee's questions when she appeared before them without her Health counterpart. In a letter to the assembly Speaker on April 6, Kibwana sought to clear the air on the matter that had caused friction between the two arms of government. “The Covid-19 budget will continue to vary according to the severity of the pandemic. Consequently, I will continue to appraise the county assembly of the situation,” Kibwana’s letter reads. Mulwa said he hadn't received official communication from the committee over the Monday meeting. He told the Star on the phone he had responded to the committee's questions on the proposed Covid-19 budget through an official document. “They invited me over the phone and I was not available but they chose to invite the CEC Finance,” Mulwa said. During the special sitting on Tuesday, the committee’s chairman Denis Musyoka said Mulwa's response was irrelevant to the issues raised by members. Makueni speaker Douglas Mbilu dismissed Mulwa's argument as political drama. “I have previously served in the executive and I know the games played there, why is it that this is the only department giving us troubles?”  he asked.
