Four people were on Tuesday charged with stealing mobile phones and accessories worth Sh15 million in 750 cartons on April 9. The items belonged to Mohammed Abdi Gullet, a director of Rolling Cargo Ltd. The four - Mwangangi Kyalo, Newton Mwenda Njeru, Jacob Karuiru Waithaka, and Patrick Mwangi Irungu - are accused of the theft with others not in court. Kyalo is also charged with handling stolen goods. They all denied the charge before Makadara chief magistrate Heston Nyagah. The particulars of the case are that the accused stole the items from a transit lorry from Jomo Kenyatta International Airport to Eastleigh. Kyalo was allegedly found with 630 cartons of mobile phones valued at Sh12,600,000 in his rented Imara Daima Muimara estate house on April 13. Investigating officer David Kibaru of DCI Buruburu said Kyalo rented the house soon after the theft. “Your honour, we found the lorry which was transporting the goods abandoned along Masai Road off Mombasa Road with seven cartons containing the phones,” Kibaru said. Some 66 cartons of the assorted mobile phones were recovered from a house in Lunga Lunga. Kibaru said Kyalo had asked a friend, Mwiki Ndeti, to briefly keep the goods for him. Nyagah allowed the prosecution's application to have the recovered goods returned to the owner. "It will be unfair for the court to continue holding the recovered goods," he said. He freed each of the accused on Sh200,000 bond or Sh100,000 bail. The case will be mentioned on May 22.  - mwaniki fm
