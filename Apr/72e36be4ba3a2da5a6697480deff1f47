At least five officials of the defunct parties that merged to form Jubilee have revealed the President Uhuru Kenyatta initiated the contentious changes to the supreme organ. The officials, who were leaders of part of the 11 parties that were dissolved in September 2016, said they support the President's decision to make changes to the National Management Committee. The leaders included Albert Nyaundi (Ford People), Kalembe Ndile (Tip Tip), Osman Hassan (UDF), Benjamin Muema (New Ford Kenya), Pekay Miriti (United Patriotic Party). They spoke under the banner of the Jubilee Party National Advisory Council, an organ comprising leaders of the defunct parties. “We appreciate and fully support our party leader in his recent reorganisation of the party and wish to welcome the reconstituted party national management committee," they said in a statement signed by Nyaundi. They said the party formed under 'the able leadership of President Uhuru Kenyatta as leader' is alive and perfectly on course with its programmes. The leaders spoke hours after Deputy President William Ruto termed as “illegal and fraudulent” the move to make changes to the NMC of the party. Jubilee Party was set to replace Fatuma Shukri, Pamela Mutua and Veronica Maina with Lucy Nyawira Macharia, Prof Marete Marangu, Walter Nyambati, Jane Nampaso and James Waweru. The details were contained in a gazette notice by Registrar of Political Parties Anne Nderitu dated April 6. On Saturday, the officials of the National Advisory Council also welcomed the President's measures to combat coronavirus virus and rallied Kenyans to support the government efforts. They wished Jubilee secretary general Raphael Tuju quick recovery after he was involved in a road accident in February. Edited by R.Wamochie
