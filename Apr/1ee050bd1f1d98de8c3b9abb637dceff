Lessors of motorbikes to riders in Bomet should stop harassing those who fail to remit cash, Governor Hillary Barchok has said. Barchok said some dealers were auctioning properties of their clients for late or nonpayment of the amounts due. He said the merchants should be lenient and understand that the group was also facing challenges and "hard financial times" because of Covid-19 control rules. “For some individuals to chase defaulters around is totally insensitive and not acceptable at all," he said. Barchok said those found to be intimidating clients will have their business licenses revoked. “With the government's stringent rules on the boda boda operations across the country, they make little out of it at this time which cannot even be enough to fend for their families,” he said. The county chief said in Sigor on Friday that dealers should give the youth more time the same way banks had extended repayment periods for customers with credit facilities. His directive, he said, should not be an excuse for some individuals to escape from repaying the monies they owe. Meanwhile, screening at Mulot and other entry points to the county continued at the weekend. The exercise was led by Public Health chief officer Zaddy Chumo. (edited by o. owino)
