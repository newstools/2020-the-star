The Siaya priest alleged to have spread Covid-19 when he jetted back from Italy last month has been charged. Father Richard Oduor was on Thursday charged before a Milimani court with spreading the coronavirus. He denied charge and through his lawyer asked the court to release him on reasonable bail terms. Senior resident magistrate Martha Nanzushi released him on Sh500,000 cash bail. Nanzushi further directed that he goes into mandatory self-quarantine for 14 days. The defence had objected to the additional 14 days quarantine arguing that the accused has been discharged after testing negative. However, the court said he must self-quarantine, adding the priest does not know what self quarantine is and that is why the courts are there. Oduor told the court that he will quarantine at a facility in Adams Arcade run by Franciscan sisters. Oduor had been arraigned on Tuesday after being in custody since last Thursday after recovering from the virus. Oduor was nabbed by police after being discharged from Kenyatta National Hospital where he had been receiving treatment after earlier testing positive for the coronavirus. The prosecution asked the court to remand him for five days to allow the police to complete investigations. However, magistrate Martha Nanzushi allowed them to detain him for two more days at the Kileleshwa police station. The state had said Oduor is suspected to have had the virus when he arrived in Kenya from Italy. He travelled to Kisumu and Siaya, interacting with people.
