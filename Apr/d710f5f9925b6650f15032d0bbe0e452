Coronavirus, which continues to cause havoc across the world, is causing unease in courts, which have already minimised operations. For instance, a claim by a lawyer that his client had shown some Covid-19 symptoms caused panic among some officers at a Nairobi, who had handled him without protective gear. " Sasa kama huyu jamaa yetu ako na Covid-19 na unajua venye tulimpiga bila gloves kutakuaje ? (Now that it has been said this man might have coronavirus, and how we beat him up without wearing gloves, what will be the outcome?) I suspect the magistrate will order we go for mandatory quarantine,” one of the officers was overheard saying. A suspect at a Nairobi court almost removed his trousers to show a female magistrate how he was brutalised by police. She warned him not to show the court his private parts. “Please,  just show us your back. We are only interested in it but not your other serious parts,” she said. The suspect showed a 'tough face' as he turned to show the magistrate his back, which had been badly injured by strokes. There was a bitter exchange between a prosecutor and a suspect in a court in the Western region over a case. The prosecutor threatened the suspect that he would be jailed over an assault case. The complainant had openly bragged that he had paid the magistrate some money to have the suspect jailed. The Star mole is steadily following the proceedings and will tell us more once the judgment is done.
