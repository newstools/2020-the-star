Kenya Commercial Bank chess ace Joseph Methu is looking for tougher challenges and hopes the invite-only continental online showpiece materialises. Methu is optimistic that the Ugandan organisers will attain quorum for the online face-off to happen. The invitational tournament is capped for players with over 2,400 points from the continent and Methu expects a tough battle. "From the names I have seen on the list of the invitees, I expect interesting and fiercely contest. However, I have on many occasions battled players already on the list and many other top shots in Africa so it will be a good one for me," said Methu. Some of the players invited include four titles holders from Uganda who feature in the Chess Kenya (CK) national league. They include Equity Club's duo of board one player International Master (IM) Arthur Ssegwanyi and Fide Master (FM) Patrick Kawuma and KCB's pair of FM Haruna Nsubuga and FM Harold Wanyama. Ugandan chess ace Walter Okas is also in the fold. Methu is relishing a clash with Nigerian and Zambian aces and wishes compatriots Ben Nguku and national champion Mehul Gohil among others will get a chance to play at this level. "I wish some Kenyan players will get the invite to play at this top level since, with the current coronavirus pandemic, regional and international competitions have been shelved. We have to jog and sharpen our skills regardless," added the chess hotshot. In the meantime, Methu had a field day on Friday night when he trounced over 30 opponents to emerge winner of 2020 Easter Open online contest. The event attracted over 60 players and lasted two hours. "The trick with such a tournament is to play (and win) as many games as possible in the shortest time. That way, you beat the person who takes 20 minutes to win all his five games when you use the same duration to win seven of your 10 clashes," continued Methu. In the past three weeks, there have been 15 tournaments played in Kenya via the online platform in chess.
