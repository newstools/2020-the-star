Away from bustle and hustle of what she does best — running — three-time Vienna Marathon champion Nancy Kiprop is taking time to bond with her two children. Kiprop said she is restricted to just a little workout and thus spends most of her time bonding with her son and daughter as she hopes for a quick end to the coronavirus pandemic that continues to ravage the globe. “I am doing little exercises here and there even as we remain optimistic that the world will soon be free from COVID-19. I had good plans this year after making my debut in the world marathon majors in New York,” said Kiprop, a former teacher. The Iten-based runner was to compete at the New York 10km race in June, which has been cancelled. She was to use the race as part of her preparation to return to the New York City Marathon in November. “We are just indoors having time with kids and getting closer to each other. I could get close to my school to play with the kids but unfortunately, it is also closed. Now I have very little to do,” she said. As a teacher by profession, Kiprop decided to put the chalk and blackboard aside to concentrate on running as well as small scale farming back in the village. “As part of making sure that we are bonding, we watch movies and compete on the play station with my children. That is a serious bonding way since there is nothing more to do now that our movement is restricted due to this pandemic,” she added.
