Sweden-based defender Joseph Okumu has followed the path of his international teammates Victor Wanyama, Johanna Omollo and Francis Kahata among others in providing a helping hand to the needy in society during this global health pandemic by donating household necessities. The UF Elfsborg centre-half, who recently resumed training in partnership with Kahawa Sportive Soccer Academy and Magongo Kenya, came up with an emergency food programme aimed at helping sporting families adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in Roysambu Constituency. “Our target was to feed 100 families with a food bag worth Sh1,500 each but we surpassed our target and we now have to 160 families. We have now partnered with Cleanshelf Supermarkets to give out shopping vouchers for families to do their own shopping,” said Okumu. He added that alongside his partners, they will continue the process as they seek to fully reach the 160 identified families. “I’m so grateful to everyone who has been part of this programme,” he said.
