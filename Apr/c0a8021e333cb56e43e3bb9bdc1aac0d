The Kiambu county government has donated Sh35 million maize and beans in a food security project. The county gave 71,000 tonnes of maize and a similar tonnage of beans to more than 36,000 farmers through the Alliance for Green Revolution Africa, an initiative of the Rockefeller Foundation. Governor James Nyoro, while flagging off the seedlings on Wednesday, said they are new hybrid varieties tested in Kiambu for two years and ideal for its soil. They will perform better in our soils and mature earlier," Nyoro said. Nyoro said that AGRA has trained village advisers who have identified farms in the village to be given four kilogrammes maize and four kg beans. "Because of coronavirus, we have to register farmers so we as the county can reach out to them directly without their having to come to county offices and avoid commotion,” Nyoro said. The seedlings are not for sale. The government aims to reach more than 100,000 farmers. They are only expected to deposit Sh50 for the facilitation of village advisers who will be visiting them with the seedlings. Nyoro said the government will spend another Sh12.5 million to procure 62,500 avocado seedlings and 11,000 mango seedlings. “The government will be spending Sh48 million annually in the food security project and we expect the farmers' food returns after maturity will be for their own consumption," Nyoro said. "But if they decide to sell, they will make more than Sh266 million with all the seedlings we have donated." He said that the county and national governments will be giving farmers subsidised fertilisers tested to suit the county soil. Coffee and tea seedlings will also be distributed at no cost. The governor said government will ensure that food security is the priority as the country v fights the coronavirus. (Edited by V. Graham)
