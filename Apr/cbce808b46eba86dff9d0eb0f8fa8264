A team of volunteer divers on Wednesday found the body of a teenager in River Tana after a three-day search. Jillo Ali Abdallah, 17, a form one student at Hola Township Secondary School went missing on Monday at Mashroom area on the outskirts of Hola Town. Police said Ali was standing on the banks of swollen River Tana with a friend when a crocodile attacked him and dragged him into the river. Police and Red Cross and volunteer rescuers searched for the body and found it trapped at Majengo bridge along the river with a missing left arm on Wednesday. Police reports indicated the body had visible bite marks. The body has been moved to Hola Hospital Mortuary awaiting a postmortem. Tana River police commandant Fredrick Ochieng called on members of public to be careful near the river. “It is my general appeal to the members of public, especially those residing close to the river banks to prevent their children from playing or fetching firewood near the river because it has increased its volume due to ongoing heavy rainfall,” he said.
