Security officers in Northeastern have been urged to maximise the use of temporary military camps in Qarsa and Konton to deal with terrorism threats. Wajir East MP Rashid Kassim on Monday said officers stationed in border towns had the best opportunity to deal with militants with the help of the military bases. He was speaking in the border town on Konton during a sensitisation meeting with locals. He urged for cooperation saying it will defeat the purpose of the camps if insecurity persists. His Wajir East constituency is among those that have been raided by terrorists. The MP said more temporary camps will be opened in the hotspot areas to strengthen security. On Tuesday last week, suspected al Shabaab militants killed National Police Reservists in Khorof Harar in Wajir East. Local leaders led by Governor Mohamed Abdi who attended the burial condemned the attack. Kassim urged residents to cooperate with the security officers, saying residents have "an even bigger role to play" in the wake of intensified attacks by al Shabaab. “I want to make a humble request to members of the public to cooperate with the security forces and agencies in order to fight these militants who are out to kill our people and destabilise our country,” he said. He said county leaders will be steadfast and will always denounce al Shabaab. “As residents of Wajir, we are patriotic and want to have peace because when there is insecurity, we bear the biggest brunt,” the MP said. Northeastern regional commissioner Nicodemus Ndalana on Saturday said the government was determined to wipe out the militants and called for continued cooperation between the security officers and the public. “I am happy to report that we have made tremendous progress in securing our borders and region at large. I may not tell you everything that we are doing on the ground to completely eliminate them (terrorists) but I want to assure Kenyans that our officers are not sleeping,” Ndalana said.
