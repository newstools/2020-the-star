At least 455 people have been placed in mandatory quarantine at their own cost for defying the government's national curfew regulations. Health CS Mutahi Kagwe said the individuals were found outside their homes between 7 pm and 5 am going against the stipulated curfew hours. "Once you are out during curfew hours, it is assumed that you have now been exposed and therefore you will be taken to a quarantine site at your own expense,' he said. Kagwe was speaking during the daily Coronavirus update presser on Monday where he announced 11 new confirmed cases in the country. This now brings to 281 the total number of Coronavirus cases in the country. He reported two new discharges, bringing to 69, the number who have recovered in the country. The CS said currently, only 33 quarantine centres are active after some sites were closed down in the past weeks. A total of 483 people are in the facilities other than those 455 forced into isolation for defying curfew rules. Kagwe sent out a special appeal to people in Machakos, Kajiado, Kiambu and Muranga counties to be extra careful to avoid being infected due to their proximity to Nairobi. "Coronavirus is not a Nairobi disease, it's something in the neighbourhood carried around by your brother, sister or friend," he said, Out of the 11 new cases, four were from Nairobi's Ruaka area.
