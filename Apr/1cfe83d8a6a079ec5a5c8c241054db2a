The two were arrested in Roysambu area on Wednesday in what appeared to be an inebriated state as the reportedly bragged about their escape tactics. They are being held at Kasarani police station. Kasarani subcounty police commander Muthuri Mwongera told the Star the two will be arraigned in court for defying quarantine rules. “The majority of these people (who escaped) are well known. The area chief reported sighting of the two and we pounced on them,” Mwongera said. On Tuesday, at least four people were captured on camera climbing over a wall at Mbagathi KMTC quarantine facility. Its not clear the number of people who escaped. During daily coronavirus updates on Wednesday, Health CS Mutahi Kawe urged those who escaped to surrender. "It is for their enlightened self-interest for them to report back to the quarantine facilities. We can't have 47 million policemen following 47 million. It is not for the police to go searching for these persons. People need to police themselves in a matter such as this one," he said. Last week, 32 people put under quarantine at a facility in Elwak, Mandera, escaped under unclear circumstances. CS Kagwe wondered how suspects successfully escaped a quarantine facility with 24-hour security, hinting that security officials at the facilities where suspects have escaped have a case to answer.
