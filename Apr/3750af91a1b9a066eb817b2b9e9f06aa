Rev Lucy Natasha, the founder and overseer of Prophetic Latter Glory Ministries Internationals, says she could marry a broke guy. Speaking in an Instagram live conversation with comedian MC Jessy, Natasha said the only person she would not wish to marry is a mama's boy. "I don't have a problem with any man who treasures their mums, but a mama's boy will always be attached to their mothers, and you as the wife, you will always be the number two in his life," she said. Natasha said she is a gold carrier and not a gold-digger. "I don't judge their financial status but they should have a vision," she said. "Finances are not a major description on who to marry, but that does not mean he should be lazy." Edited by T Jalio
