Operations at the Ruiru Law Courts were disrupted and a road leading to the town cut off after Mukuyu River burst its banks due to heavy rains. The courtrooms and the local NG-CDF offices could not be accessed following an overnight downpour. Suppliers of farm produce from the rural villages and boda boda operators were left stranded for hours on the Ruiru-Kwa Maiko road MP Simon King’ara blamed a Chinese contractor who built a makeshift diversion bridge for the mess. “I do not understand why the contractor left the road in that condition when construction of the main bridge was completed over four months ago,” King’ara said. The new bridge should have been opened before the onset of the long rains, he said. Deputy county commissioner Geoffrey Kithinji asked motorists to be cautious while using the section of that road. Residents and boda boda operators appealed to the government to open the new bridge to avert a tragedy. (edited by o. owino)
