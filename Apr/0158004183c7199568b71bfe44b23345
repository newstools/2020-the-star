It’s been a month since we started operating remotely in line with the work from home concept. My experience has been a mix of convictions, that it is a workable system and also one that presents challenges. The biggest difficulty is the sourcing of news, especially one that involves sensitive material. Apart from a few sources with whom one has a working relationship, others tend to be uneasy with phone conversations. Others have challenges of sharing documents - bulky ones. All the same, working from home offers one more hours at the workstation – mostly lost in traffic, with minimal disruption. Apart from a few calls and messages that need attention, there is little room for that banter that will take your 15 minutes of work. There is also convenience in conducting meetings. In terms of cost, working from home has meant more units of electricity and Internet hours but the experience from this is more of an opportunity to carve out a new way of doing journalism. I would encourage that the current mode of operation be viewed as a step towards a new future for the industry. Edited by Henry Makori
