The Nairobi Metropolitan Services will hire at least 1,000 inspectorate officers to replace those heading for retirement and invigorate the department. The Public Service Commission announced the vacancies through an advert on Tuesday, requesting applications. They include 300 enforcement officers and 700 enforcement constables. The deadline is May 19 at 5pm. Public Service Commission chairman Stephen Kirogo told the Star on Tuesday the county had advertised earlier before four key functions were transferred to the national government, but that recruitment was cancelled. The four functions are health, transport, planning and development, and public works. “We and the Nairobi Metropolitan Services (NMS) are planning for inspectorate succession and putting in place a new workforce," Kirogo said. Seventy-five per cent of City Hall workers are headed for retirement, the commission said. “We decided on another advert because if we don’t recruit early enough, there will be a huge gap,” Kirogo said. The newly recruited inspectorate officers will undergo training and get experience before they take over from retiring officers. County of old workers A biometric report by City Hall released in November last year showed that despite the acute youth unemployment in the country, only 14 per cent, or 792 of the 11,603 county workers were young. The workforce has 6,118 women and 5,485 men. Of the 11,603, some 5,709 are aged 50 and above; 19 are above the retirement age of 60. A total of 2,712 workers are aged between 55 and 59, 2,978 are between 50 and 54 years and 2,663 are between 45 and 49 years. The report says 1,757 are 20 to 44 years; 1,4474  are below 40; 682 are between 35 and 39 years. Out of the 792 young people, 621 are between 30 and 34 years and 171 are below 30. The April 2019 register indicated City Hall had 11,988 employees. However, 385 of them were not registered during the biometric listing. Of these, 200 retired between April and November 2019, 85 were training overseas, 58 were on suspension due to disciplinary issues and 23 had died. Another 11 employees resigned during the review period. The biometric registration was launched by Governor Mike Sonko in May 2019 to week out ghost workers and imposters. (Edited by V. Graham)
