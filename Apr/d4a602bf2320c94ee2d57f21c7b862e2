The number of deaths in Tuesdayâ€™s landslide at Kipkelion West has reached four after two more bodies were retrieved from houses that were washed away. In the initial stages of the rescue team, bodies of two children were retrieved from the house they were sleeping in. They died on the spot after their house was washed away by mud that slid from Kunyak slopes after the downpour between 2am and 3am. The two are Standard 4 and 8 pupils at Victory Academy in Lelu village, Kericho county. Their parents escaped with minor injuries and were taken to Lelu dispensary. Scores of homesteads were also swept away, with hundreds of people being displaced during the heavy rains that have hit the area in the last two weeks. Kericho county commissioner Moses Mbaruku visited the affected areas and urged residents to move to safer grounds to avoid a similar disaster as the government seeks an alternative. Mbaruku told journalists to hold on as he and security officers evaluated the magnitude of the damage before releasing a comprehensive report. This is the second time the area has been hit by a landslide. The first time, then county commissioner Muktar Abdi and Kericho Governor Paul Chepkwony distributed food to the affected who were camping in schools. Edited by R.Wamochie
