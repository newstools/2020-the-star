Kenya Airways CEO Allan Kilavuka has been appointed to the International Air Transport Association board of governors on an interim basis. This follows a vote by the board on the nominations received for the position. “It is a great honour to be part of the IATA board of governors and I look forward to contributing meaningfully towards the advancement of the aviation industry not only in Africa but across the world,” Kilavuka said. Kilavuka has more than 22 years of professional experience in executive management in the private and public sectors. IATA is the trade association for the world’s airlines and represents 290 airlines, or 82 per cent of global air traffic. “It gives me great pleasure to advise you formally of your election to interim membership and I look forward to working with you as part of IATA’s board of governors,” said IATA director general and CEO Alexandre de Juniac. Kilavuka will be on board until the close of the 2020 Annual General Meeting. Edited by Josephine M. Mayuya
