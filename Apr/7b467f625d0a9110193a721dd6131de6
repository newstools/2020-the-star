All meetings involving more than four individuals must now be conducted online, head of Public Service Joseph Kinyua has directed. This follows a breach of social distancing orders by some government officials who in the past weeks conducted mass meetings exposing the public to the risk of contracting Covid-19. "It has been decided that all meetings of more than four individuals will be conducted through available online platforms. Whereas the ministry of ICT can advise on these platforms, Webex and Zoom have proved appropriate and are currently in widespread use across the public service," he said in a letter on Monday. Some politicians have been put on the spot for conducting packed meetings across the country. On Thursday, Meru Governor Kiraitu Murungi came under criticism for allegedly violating directives set by the Ministry of Health and holding a crowded meeting in Maua town. Igembe North MP Maoka Maore said miraa traders from all over the country met in Maua town. “Why would Inspector General of police Hillary Mutyambai and CS Fred Matiang’i put under quarantine a miraa driver with two passengers but allow a crowd of hundreds with impunity?” he asked. However, Kiraitu refuted claims he caused crowding failing the social distancing rule meant to curb Covid-19 spread. He blamed his nemesis for “hiring goons to cause the commotion leading to crowding”.
