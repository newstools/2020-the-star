Turkana Governor Josphat Nanok has offered to take a Sh50,000 pay cut as his contribution to the Covid-19 emergency response kitty. Governors had last month resolved to take a 30 per cent pay cut. Nanok's offer is equivalent to 5.4 per cent of his salary. Governors earn Sh924,000 each month and a pay cut of 30 per cent is Sh277,200. "The senior staff of Turkana government have offered a voluntary salary reduction as follows; governor Sh50,000, deputy governor Sh30,000, county executives Sh20,000, chief officers and other officers in Job Group S Sh20,000, county directors Sh10,000," Nanok told journalists on Thursday. In March, Council of Governors chairman Wycliffe Oparanya announced that county chiefs would take a 30 per cent pay cut for April, May and June. Deputy governors, county executive members and chief officers salaries were to be slashed by 20 per cent. Directors were to take a 10 per cent cut. The governors rejected a proposal to slash their salaries by 50 per cent, terming it “too much”. Oparanya said the decision was is in line with President Uhuru Kenyatta's plea for leaders to join the Executive in taking a voluntary pay cut. Last month, Uhuru and DP William Ruto said they will take an 80 per cent pay cut. Cabinet secretaries will take a 30 per cent pay cut, as will Chief Administrative Secretaries. Edited by A.N
