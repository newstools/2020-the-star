President Uhuru Kenyatta advisers misled him to lock up five counties,  Kenya Chamber of Commerce and Industry Vihiga branch chairman Billy Nyonje says. Nyonje was addressing the press in his office on Saturday in Mbale town. He said the head of state should have given people time to prepare. “Nairobi is the Kenyan’s economic heartbeat. It can’t be locked just like that and if that was meant for the safety of Kenyans, then he was late for that directive," he said. He said the majority of people fled the city. "We had people who had traveled up country for their business activities. They should have been given time, just like coast region did,” Nyonje said. “We have business people who have been locked up in Nairobi with perishable goods; they are going to count huge losses than ever," he added. Nyonje further said police brutality will kill Kenyans more than Covid-19. He said the law enforcers have taken an advantage of curfew orders to militarise the entire process. However, the KCCI chair  applauded Governor Wilder Ottichillo for waiving tax rates  in the county. He said most businesspeople were over pressed due to economic challenges they are encountering. Ottichillo last week said he has suspended all revenue collection in the county for 30 days. Bankers should suspend their loan payment until the situation is reverted, Nyonje said.
