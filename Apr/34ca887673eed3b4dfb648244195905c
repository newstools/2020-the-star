Kenya Cup clubs meet today to chart a way forward following the cancellation of the 2019-2020 season by the Kenya Rugby Union. The Kenya Cup caucus had given the union up to last Friday to rescind that decision but the union is yet to effect those demands. Among the options available for the clubs is to appeal the decision at the Judicial Committee, which the union annulled due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. A Kenya Cup chairman who spoke on anonymity said they feel they have been short-changed by the union, accusing them of failure to consult before making the decision. “As far as we are concerned, the Nationwide and Championship clubs have appealed to the union to rescind the decision but we are looking at all the options available to us and we are confident we will win,” said the official. Various club chairmen who spoke to The Star insisted that they will not allow their investment in players and other resources to go to waste. “We can wait for the pandemic to end and look at a timetable for concluding the season. I believe the union acted in haste,” noted one official. The Kenya Rugby Union canceled the 2019-2020 season owing to the Coronavirus pandemic. In their statement, KRU said there will be no promotion and relegation and all matches thus declaring matches played so far invalid. The union was hopeful that a new season would start in July with the start of the Sevens circuit. HoMeboyz were due to play Menengai Oilers with Impala hosting Mwamba in the Kenya Cup playoffs. League leaders Kabras were to host the winner of the Impala v Mwamba encounter with champions KCB hosting either Homeboyz or Oilers. The Championship and Nationwide had also entered the playoff stage.
