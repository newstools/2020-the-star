The global pandemic caused by the spread of COVID-19 has changed lives across the globe. In Kenya, many people have been compelled to restrict their movements in order to protect themselves and limit the spread of the disease. As a leading brand for smartphones in the country, the smartphone company cares about its consumer's safety and health. The brand has launched a few new initiatives to support Kenyans staying home and staying safe. “Coronavirus continues to pose unparalleled challenges to our way of life around the world. This is a time for solidarity and cooperation together.” said Benjamin Jiang, Managing Director of Infinix Mobile. “The brand aims to provide practical supports to Kenyan people, including both our consumers and staff, and will spare no efforts to enable Kenyans to maintain their usual daily lives at home as much as possible, and stay connected and safe through our smartphone products during this unprecedented period .” Attention to the Importance of “Stay Home, Stay Safe” According to WHO(World Health Organization[1]) , maintaining social distancing is one of the best basic protective measures against the novel Coronavirus. Staying at home can reduce the spread of the virus and limit its long-term health effect on society. To raise awareness about the virus and advocate for public safety measures, Infinix launched a “STAY HOME, STAY SAFE” campaign online and offline, including a billboard in downtown Nairobi today, which conveys the care for all Kenyans and encourages them to stay home and stay safe.
