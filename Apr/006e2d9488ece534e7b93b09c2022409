Tigania residents have been warned against sharing face masks. Tigania West MP John Mutunga said some villagers were sharing face masks and warned it could hurt the war against coronavirus spread. The MP said those going to the market were borrowing face masks from those at home so they are not arrested by police. He said it was the culture of Meru people to share but warned that things like face masks are not for sharing. The lawmaker spoke on Tuesday at the NGCDF offices when he launched the distribution of 25,000 free face masks to residents. The masks were bought by the MP's funds and not cash from the local development kitty. Mutunga said the Ameru culture of generosity might hamper the war on coronavirus and put many lives at risk. “I have heard some people are borrowing face masks from their neighbours when going to the market or to town. This is not encouraged, stop. Practice good hygiene. Live abnormally so that you help fight and not jeopardise. I am optimistic the disease will vanish,” Mutunga said. He said Meru people are fond of sharing anything within their reach including miraa, cigarettes, salt and farm produce, not because those being given do not have but because it is a cultural behaviour and belief. The lawmaker said people needed to sacrifice to aid the fight against Covid-19 pandemic. Mutunga said many governments were strained and the economy of the country will be deeply affected by the pandemic. He urged wealthy nations and people to help third world countries. “We don’t want a situation where our health care facilities are overwhelmed and health workers are left confused. Let’s be disciplined, obedient and obey all the government directives. If you have more, complement leaders and the government in distributing face masks, sanitiser, soaps and water tanks,” he said. Last week, Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe said, “If we treat this disease normally, it will treat us abnormally.” Edited by P.O
