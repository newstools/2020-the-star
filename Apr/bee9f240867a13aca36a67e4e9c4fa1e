Far East Basketball Association (FEBA) youth programmes that were to run in April will now resume in August due to the current coronavirus pandemic. Feba chairman Moses Musosi yesterday said their plans for the youngsters during April holidays will now not be possible. "As always, we had everything in place for the juniors during this month but unfortunately nothing will happen due to the situation in the country,” Musosi said. He added: “No parent would want a child out during this time. Realistically, we should now plan for the activities in August.” “I know how they feel. But we will have to wait until activities resume. It will be a relief for the juniors if they can have some action. It will cheer them up when they return to school,” he said. Feba runs one of the most successful youth programmes for school going kids in the county. The programme features age groups between 7-19 years and also U 23 that involves high school. The league covers a dozen estates namely- Kayole, Dandora, Umoja, Huruma, Mathare, Kibera, Choka, Kamulu, Donholm, Zimmerman, Komarock and Jericho. Moses said the April programme included clean up, school coaching, street league exposure, young basketballers league and women’s empowerment league.
