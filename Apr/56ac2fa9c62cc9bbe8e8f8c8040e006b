Health CAS Mercy Mwangangi has asked MCAs to stop fighting governors and instead focus on fighting coronavirus spread. This was after Kirinyaga MCAs vowed to impeach Governor Anne Waiguru for gross violation of the Constitution by not delivering the annual State of the County address to the assembly. But speaking on Friday on behalf of CS Mutahi Kagwe, Mwangangi urged all members of the County Assemblies to halt their conflicts with governors during this period. "... and focus their energies in equipping the county health facilities in order to aid in fighting the disease," she said. Mwangangi said this should not stop the MCAs from scrutinising their leaders. "This is not to say that proper scrutiny and accountability measures must be overlooked," she said. "In fact, to the contrary, the County Assemblies must ensure everything is done within the law, but the processes must not be delayed at the expense of procuring services in our county hospitals." On Thursday,Â  Waiguru insinuated that powerful hands are behind the MCAs' move to impeach her. "As for those pulling the strings from outside the assembly because of the 2022 politics, time will find you out," Waiguru said.
