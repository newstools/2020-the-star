The Health CS Mutahi Kagwe on Tuesday said that the increase in the number of cases of Covid-19 in Kenya's neighbouring countries is worrying. The CS said the country could also find itself in a similar situation if measures set by the government are not keenly observed. "This past week alone, we have seen significant changes in infections in our own neighbourhood. Covid-19 cases in Somalia have multiplied nine-fold in a single week from 26 cases from April 13 to 237 by yesterday.," Kagwe said. He added that the cases in Tanzania have increased seven times from 32 to 254 during the same period. The CS said that gone are the days when the people depended on the government for everything. "The days when everything was left to the govt are long gone," Kagwe said. Kagwe said the neighbouring countries have seen significant changes in the spread of the virus. The CS said 707 samples were tested in the last 24 hours, where seven turned positive. The seven people have are all Kenyans At the same time, the CS condemned a number of people who have been going against the set measures. He urged Kenyans to report to the authority people who escaped from the quarantine facility. "It's not possible for people to walk out of a facility that has adequate security. If you know of a person who was in quarantine kindly report to the authorities," he said. The CS has also asked Kenyans to fully take responsibility in flattening the curve. "There is nothing to celebrate when runaway impunity takes place at the risk of all of us," he said. He added that "aÂ slight lapse in behaviour could roll back the gains we have made and the destiny of our nation."
