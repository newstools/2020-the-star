Churchill Show comedian YY is disappointed with fans who feel entitled. He took to his YouTube Channel to speak for himself and other creatives who have been trolled on social media. This is after comedian Mulamwah threatened to quit comedy over depression, which was caused by being trolled online. YY said, "I respect each fan who treats me with respect. However, there are disrespectful fans out here. I was in Nanyuki, I met fans that wanted to take selfies and told me I should cross the road, but I told them to cross instead. "Because of that, they insulted me. They said I have an ego. That Iâ€™m supposed to go to them, to bow. I will never bow before a fan or go under a fan. I only bow to God and no one else."
