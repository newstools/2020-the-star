The Kwale county government is losing Sh3 million through illegal water connections every month, executive Martin Kuya has said. Kuya said illegal connections had led to the loss of revenue that could have been used to offer services for residents. “If we are using more on maintenance and electricity bills than what we collect, then it means we are losing. Actually it is the main headache for revenue collections,” Kuya said on Wednesday. The latest report from the Water Services Regulatory Board says Kwale losses around Sh38 million on non-revenue water annually. According to the executive member, illegal connection tops the causes followed by leakages and malfunctioning water meters. The official said they have realised so many clients were still possessing broken meters while others flouted the legal procedures for connectivity. The minister said measures have been put in place to reduce the non-revenue water to less than 30 per cent. Several people have been arrested and fined for using unaccounted for water in a crackdown conducted by Kwale Water and Sewerage Company. Kuya blamed the defunct county council for the thriving illicit connections. “The illegal connections were prompted by the reluctance or unproductive board that came before me which I am about to address permanently,” he said. The executive said the water crisis had been resolved and that pumping had been stabilised to boost the fight against coronavirus. He said water bowsers were supplying in places like Kinango where challenges were rampant. Kuya said boreholes have been drilled to supplement water supplies in the region. He said the Energy ministry has negotiated with Kenya Power not to interrupt power flow to ensure continued pumping and supply. Edited by P.O
