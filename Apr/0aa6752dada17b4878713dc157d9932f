Former Ford-K nominated MP Patrick Wangamati has told party leader Moses Wetang’ula to stop the feuds so it does not lose its popularity. Wangamati, who is the father of Bungoma Governor Wycliffe Wangamati, accused Wetang’ula of ruling the party with an iron fist and failing to consult elders. He made the remarks even as the party dismissed claims of infighting pitting Wetang'ula against Governor Wangamati. Wetang’ula has been at the forefront of criticising Wangamati for failing to tame corruption in his administration. He recently took a swipe at the county chief "for purchasing 600 20-litre jerrycans for Sh10,000 each". The governor has rejected the allegations that his officers inflated the cost of the jerrycans. He said they were donated by well-wishers. His supporters also defended him against the claims and accused the senator of fighting a governor from his party. The senior Wangamati said Wetang'ula has to ensure leaders and members forge common ground to protect the party's popularity in the region. "Wetang’ula has not consulted me and other elders so we can come up with an elaborate plan to revive the party. With the ongoing trend, we are losing it out to other parties, which will eventually outshine us,” he said. For his part, however, Bungoma branch secretary Chrispinus Wachana said the party leader has only been doing his oversight role as the Bungoma senator but not fighting the governor. "Wetang'ula is only doing his oversight role but has not engaged in any fight with Wangamati," he said. Speaking in Bungoma town, the secretary asked the supporters of Wetang'ula and Wangamati to stop creating bad blood between the two. he said the party will hold national elections when the war on Covid-19 is over. "We are going to hold our national elections immediately after this pandemic, so those willing to contest are free to participate," he said.
