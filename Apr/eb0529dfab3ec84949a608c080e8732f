Uganda's Ministry of Health on Tuesday confirmed two more Covid -19 positive cases: one case from 929 samples tested from truck drivers at border points of entry and one from 248 samples taken from the community and quarantine centres. A total of 1,177 samples were tested atÂ the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI). The total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases now is 58. This includes the two Kenyans truck drivers who are currently being treated in Uganda. The International Health Regulations (IHR) requires that every case that is tested and confirmed for a particular disease should be registered as the host country's case. It is therefore against this background that Uganda will capture all Covid-19 positive foreigners including truck drivers as part of its confirmed cases and treated in Uganda.
