About 16,000 needy households from all the 10 wards in Isiolo county will benefit from relief food from the county government. The donations are to cushion them from the effects of Covid-19 control measures. Several businesses have closed down and thousands of jobs lost, hence rendering many households vulnerable to hunger. Governor Mohamed Kuti said the food, mainly maize flour, will be distributed to families identified as needy. “We will also distribute cereals such as beans as well as cooking oil to the same households next week,” Kuti said. He spoke at the police grounds when he launched the relief food distribution exercise. “The second delivery will ensure that the vulnerable members of the community have access to a balanced diet,” he said. The foodstuffs were transported to Bulapesa, Burat, Wabera, Sericho, Kinna, Garbatula, Ngaremara, Oldonyiro, Chari and Cherab using 20 trucks. Balaf Darimo, a resident of Bulapesa ward and a beneficiary, lauded the move by the county administration to provide food. “Most people who used to earn little money every day from casual jobs to feed their families are going through hard times since they can no longer work as usual,” he said. She, however, asked the governor to ensure the needy get a variety of foods that will enable them to balance their diet as promised. Maendeleo Ya Wanawake Isiolo branch chairperson Asli Fayo and secretary Asha Abdurahman praised the drive. Fayo said mothers are the hardest hit as they struggle to feed their children every day. She urged the county to ensure the food supplies are frequent to help the vulnerable families overcome the tough times. (edited by o. owino)
