Nairobi businessman Gor Semelang'o on Friday distributed foods and other basic provisions to needy families in Mathare and Huruma slums, Nairobi County. Semelang'o said that despite being a weekend where families are supposed to be enjoying the Easter holidays, most have nothing to rejoice about after losing their jobs coupled with the uncertainties brought about by the coronavirus pandemic. "The situation is not easy for most families in Nairobi," he explained. "Most of them have been struggling even before the coronavirus, but now, there are less opportunities to earn daily bread. We have to remember them at this time and also hope that the situation improves," he said. Mabatini MCA Wilfred Oluoch and his Ngei counterpart Redson Otieno led the distribution exercise in Mathare and Huruma. "This is a timely move by one of our own and we have to thank Bwana Semelang'o for that. We have a way of distributing the rations, starting with the most vulnerable, especially those living with HIV and cancer," Otieno explained. Kenya had by Thursday registered 182 positive coronavirus cases and consequently President Uhuru Kenyatta this past week announced a dusk to dawn curfew on Kenyans. He also banned both public and private travel into and out of Nairobi and Mombasa in a move aimed at curbing the coronavirus pandemic. Semelang'o says this distribution program which is worth Sh25 million, will go on for the next two weeks.
