ODM leader Raila Odinga has sent a passionate appeal to Kenyans, urging them to personalise the war against the coronavirus in order to defeat the disease. Raila called for a 'new breed of patriots' to rise up and fight this new war. He warned that the window is slowly shutting and called for a people-for-people movement against the pandemic. "If we don't take personal control now, there will be no control to take later. You remain in my thoughts and prayers," he said. In a statement on Saturday, the AU envoy said this war was not for the armed selected few but for every Kenyan. "I am calling on every Kenyan to use his or her existing personal social connections and ask them daily to protect themselves from the coronavirus," he said. The ODM leader urged the citizens to do a daily follow up on each other to find out if they are complying with government directives or if they have challenges in adhering to them. "Do not focus on strangers. Focus on people you have a personal relationship with," Raila said. He challenged the country's youth to be Kenya's new soldiers and saviours. "Use the advantages of technology and social media to encourage your friends to stay safe and to keep them company from a social distance," the AU envoy said. He also praised Kenyans' strong faith and determination during grim situations. Raila's statement comes hours after Deputy President William Ruto assured Kenyans that he, together with President Uhuru Kenyatta and senior government officials, was working on how to deal with the pandemic. The DP called on all Kenyans not to panic and assured them that the country would pull through and overcome the disease. He also urged Kenyans to comply with the government directives which include the stay at home order especially during the curfew as well as social distancing.
