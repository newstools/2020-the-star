 The government on Saturday warned Kenyans against bribing their way out of quarantine facilities. Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe said they were aware of suspected coronavirus patients who had been allowed out of quarantine after giving bribes. "In Mandera, there are people who bribed their way out of isolation," Kagwe said. The CS has urged them to be patient as the government continue to monitor their condition. "To our brothers in isolation centres, we know what you are going through. We appreciate the sacrifice and understanding from you," Kagwe said during his daily updates on the pandemic. At the same time, the CS said Kenyans should treat Covid-19 as a deadly disease. Kagwe urged Kenyans to adhere to the measures set by the government in order to curb further spread of the virus. "We have noted that some of you are not adhering to the cessation of movement in and out of Nairobi directive. We put truck drivers smuggling people on notice," he said. The CS said there were 16 new cases in the last 24 hours, pushing Kenya's Covid-19 tally to 262. Of the 16, 15 are Kenyans and one is a foreigner. At the same time, the CS said seven more people have been discharged after recovering from the disease. Total recoveries stood at 60 while deaths moved to 12 after two more people succumbed.
