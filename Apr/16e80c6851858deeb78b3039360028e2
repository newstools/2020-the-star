US-based Kenyan producer Waithaka presents 'Akia', featuring Kenyan songstress Serro. Off the soon to be released all-female album ‘Odes By Queens’, 'Akia', Dholuo for ‘uncertainty’, is a melodious track laid on heavy percussive rhythms accompanied by flamenco-style guitar lines. Alternating between Dholuo, English and Swahili, Serro sings of walls that she’s built high out of wounds from past relationships. She expresses her desire to release all inhibitions and share love intimately with her suitor. In the video directed by Callivan Creative’s Ivan Odie, a waitress’ beauty has her workmate enchanted. She is, however, too guarded to accept his romantic gestures as endearing and genuine as they are. Her fears are seen to stem from a past experience, whose glimpses we see through intense flashback scenes.
