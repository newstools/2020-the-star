Kagwe on Wednesday said counties were put in notice and a high-level team was dispatched to Siaya county led by Ministry of Health director general Dr Patrick Amoth. The team inspected the isolation units. It also delivered supplies for health workers. "This battle will be won by Kenyans working together... it's not a government task," Kagwe said. The government received 18,900 swabs, protective clothing, thermometer gloves and equipment from the Jack Ma Foundation. Another consignment of gowns and other equipment was also received from WHO. "We are not out of danger," Kagwe said. The CS hit out at Kenyans not cooperating with the police. "This is akin to anarchy," he said. The CS urged human rights organisations not only to defend citizens, but also the police. He commended the police for ensuring the curfew is adhered to.
