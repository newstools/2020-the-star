Minnows Koyonzo will represent Kakamega County in both the 15’s and 7’s rugby competition when the Western region secondary schools Term One games will be held at St Mathias, Busia. Koyonzo coach Eliud Okwemba says he is using YouTube and Whatsapp to train the boys following the indefinite closure of schools following the coronavirus pandemic. “We have a YouTube channel where we post-training sessions and drills. We also have a Whatsapp group which we use. It’s not easy but we must now embrace technology. We had to be innovative because we have to keep the players busy with training when they are at home,” said Okwemba. He added: “So far, I’m happy with what they are doing. I keenly follow them and I pray that this coronavirus pandemic is contained. The boys are driven by 3Ds which stand for determination, dedication and discipline.” Okwemba said his team is targeting a double at the regionals even though he cited  East Africa champions, Kakamega High as their main threat. “We narrowly lost 6-3 to Kakamega in the county final. It was a game we dominated but didn’t take our chances. We have lost to them in three consecutive finals and I believe that this time around, we shall emerge victorious,” said a confident Okwemba. In  Sevens, Koyonzo and Mukumu Boys will represent Kakamega County after the former emerged 15-10 winners in the finals. Earlier, Koyonzo had beaten favourites and 2016 East Africa champions St Peter’s Mumias 10-7 in the quarter-finals. “We are now a force to reckon with,  in the region. Kakamega and St Peter’s Mumias’ dominance is now under threat. They are a worried lot. We are now national material,” said Okwemba. Okwemba guided Bungoma High School’s 15’s side to the East Africa Secondary School games in Eldoret in 2016 after lifting the national title. During the East Africa championships, Bungoma finished third.
