Even as we celebrate Easter, today we are in a storm, President Uhuru Kenyatta has said. "We have refused to give up and we will see the end of Covid-19 pandemic in Kenya," Uhuru said in a statement on Friday. He urged Kenyans to come together during these tough times to pray and 'come together by staying apart'. "We have always found inspiration in ourselves and each other to find the sunshine after the storm. We must come together by staying apart and breaking the chain of infection," he said. By Thursday, Kenya had 184 reported cases of Covid-19. " I urge all Kenyans, both at home and abroad to reflect on the resurrection story and remember that all things, even suffering, come to an end through unity and faith." Uhuru said Kenyans have been tested many times before and have always done what is necessary to pull through. "There may be difficult days ahead but let us remember that suffering is temporary but triumph is eternal. We will be triumphant if we all do our part," he said. "The circumstances under which we find ourselves during this yearâ€™s Easter holiday are unusual. Our world is going through a period of intense trial. " Noting that Easter is being celebrated with close friends and family, Uhuru said this year the celebrations must be different. "...due to the preventative measures we have put in place for our own safety and for the safety of our loved ones.," he said. "The circumstance of the present however, should not blind us to the spirit and intention of Easter and the message inherent in the resurrection of Jesus Christ." The government has put measures on how to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus. A person risks being arrested and jailed for six months or fined Sh20,000 if found travelling with more than two people in a five-seater car. In the case of a taxi, only one passenger and the driver are allowed to travel together. The aim is to maintain social distancing and prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
