On February 25, Governor Mike Sonko signed a deed of transfer with Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa at State House. He transferred responsibility for transport, health, public works, and planning to the new Nairobi Metropolitan Services authority. Now Sonko is crying foul. He claims that President Uhuru Kenyatta began the process with good intentions but that it was hijacked by "greedy officers" (see P2). He wants the transfer deed reversed. What triggered Sonko's change of heart? Was it that he was upset when KRA took over revenue collection for Nairobi County or that 6,000 county staff were transferred to the Public Service Commission? In any case, it has now dawned on Sonko that the position of Nairobi Governor is much less powerful and controls far fewer funds than before. This was inevitable after the creation of the NMS and his signing of the deed of transfer. That he did not know what he was doing is the clearest indication that Sonko is out of his depth as a governor. It is time for him to go. He should either resign or be impeached by Nairobi MCAs.
