 The Catholic Church in Kisii wants ill-gotten wealth stashed in offshore accounts by corrupt individuals to be repatriated and used in the war against the coronavirus. Vicar-general Jeremiah Nyakundi said on Sunday that there were colossal amounts public money stashed in foreign countries that the government should demand for use in nation building. Nyakundi said Kenyans with illegal foreign accounts can do no better charity than surrendering the ill-gotten wealth voluntarily to the state to boost  efforts to control the spread of Covid-19. He called for "rare sacrifice in desperate times" by the rich to finance the treatment and management of the coronavirus which had by  Sunday killed more than 90,000 globally, eight of them Kenyans. Kenya had 197 confirmed cases. "This is the time that those rare sacrifices should be made. The message of Easter is love," Nyakundi said. The vicar-general welcomed President Uhuru Kenyatta's decision to channel funds recovered from graft suspects by the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission to  the vulnerable in society "but more is needed to stem the tide of graft in the country". He said Kenyans want a more robust fight against the vice and told the EACC: "This is the money that could help the country when it is fighting Covid-19." The priest faulted the political class for not being committed enough to help the poor. He told worshippers to stay at home and keep social distancing rules. "There are deaths deep in some counties, an indication that we should be worried. Let's continue to keep sanitation and social distancing directives," Nyakundi said. In his Easter homily, Nyakundi  asked Christians to remain focused on their love for Christ and each other. "There is no better call than to love one another ...  and this is the message of the cross that we show love to one another especially in times like these," he said.
