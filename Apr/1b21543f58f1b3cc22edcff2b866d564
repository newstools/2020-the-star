Bahati says his fame has made his wife Diana always trend for the wrong reasons. Announcing he was closing down EMB, Bahati said his enemies have gone beyond that by trolling his wife. "Right now Diana is in the public eye because of me. She has been abused because of me. She is hitting a million followers for the wrong stories," he said. Many a time, Diana Marua has been trolled by many who claim she is older than Bahati. She recently recounted just how hard the adjustment from a nobody party girl to dating one of Kenyaâ€™s biggest celebrities was and what a culture shock she faced in her own country. "I remember sometime back negativity used to get to me. You know cyberbullying, people who say trash about you and I remember it got to a point when I used to cry myself to sleep," she said.
