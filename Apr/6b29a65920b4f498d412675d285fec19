An MP wants the Health ministry to consider testing patients for coronavirus only after they develop the symptoms for the disease. Pokot South lawmaker David Pkosing said that would be a sure way to curing the problem of tests turning negative just because the virus is on incubation. If need be, the MP said the priority should be given to people who have come into contact with positive cases or those with history of travel from countries with cases. The politician said the haphazard testing has given room to speculation, coming in the face of word that 17 members of parliament tested positive for Corona. “Even if I am negative now, my status may change in a matter of time. Unless you are suspected, it is useless to take such tests,” Pkosing said. “If you say someone is negative, then does that mean they are immune and will therefore be safe from the virus. Unless you develop symptoms, there is no need to take the test,” he added. The National Assembly Transport committee chairman backed the calls for social distancing – as implemented in the transport and logistics industry. Kenya has 179 positive covid cases, results from 5,278 samples since the first covid19 case was declared in the country. He spoke even as the ministry of health announced it would begin mass testing today to be conducted by health workers. CAS Mercy Mwangangi said more cases are likely to emerge during the scheduled mass testing. “One of the measures we are looking to deploy for mild cases is home based care,” the CAS said. This was even as Kemri rolled out a system which can process and get results for at least 35,000 samples in a day. The research firm has employed the use of machines used to test viral load and those used for tuberculosis diagnosis.
