Veterinary professionals have petitioned Interior CS Fred Matiang'i to include them as providers of essential and critical services. Union of Veterinary Practitioners Kenya secretary general Dr Miheso Mulembani expressed their concerns in a letter to the CS. “The veterinary professionals are worried that the failure by government to list veterinary services as essential and critical services will endanger their lives by being arrested," the letter says. "For example, the veterinary officers carry out antemortem inspection of animals to be slaughtered to as late as 9pm while meat inspectors start their duties by 4am  to enable the meat to be dispatched by 6am to various locations. This is a similar case for milk and fish inspectors.” The union has over 40,000 practitioners in the country. Among the measures is a 7pm to 5am curfew which started on March 27. Mulembani said the Labour Relations Act, 2007, defines critical services as services that if interrupted will endanger the life of a person or health of the population or any part of it. Following the increase in the number of coronavirus cases, the government has instituted some measures as a way of curbing the spread of the virus. Through the Legal Notice No 36 of 2020 titled Public Order Act (Cap 56), the government listed 20 essential and critical services that won’t be affected by the curfew. They include medical professionals and health workers, national security, administration and coordination officers, public health and sanitation officers, pharmacies, broadcasters and media houses. Kenya Power Company, food dealers, distributors, wholesalers and transporters of farm produce and supermarkets are included. Mulembani said veterinary professionals were always called at night to relieve animals from pain in cases such as calving or fractures. Mulembani said their services are not only critical and essential but directly affects human health. Edited by Henry Makori
