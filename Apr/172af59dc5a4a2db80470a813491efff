Mwangangi said one of the patients is a Kenyan, while the other is a foreigner. The CAS also said two more people have been discharged, bringing the total number of recoveries to 24. During the daily briefing on Covid-19, the CAS on Saturday said, "To relent on government directives is to invite mass deaths." She said the government has boosted the amount of sanitiser being produced. Saturday marks Day 31 of efforts to stop the spread of the virus. On Friday, CS Mutahi Kagwe warned Kenyans against handling of cash which could hurt efforts to curb spread of the virus. He said many Kenyans were not heeding advice of using mobile money. Kagwe also acknowledged the problem of disposing of face masks.
