Health CS Mutahi Kagwe has urged individuals who escaped quarantine facilities to surrender themselves lest they be dealt with by angry citizens when discovered. Mutahi on Wednesday warned that the individuals should face the full force of the law for endangering lives of Kenyans. This follows a viral video of at least four men escaping the Mbagathi KMTC quarantine facility by jumping over a wall. "It is for their enlightened self-interest for them to report back to the quarantine facilities. We can't have 47 million policemen following 47 million. It is not for the police to go searching for these persons. People need to police themselves in a matter such as this one," he said. "It's just not in KMTC that people escaped. Mandera had the first case and it is not easy for people to escape a place that has security". Kagwe reiterated that quarantine facilities are not prisons and people should have a more positive outlook on them. The CS was speaking during the daily Covid-19 update presser on Wednesday where he announced seven new cases. This brings to 303 the country's total number of confirmed cases. Earlier today, President Uhuru Kenyatta said the government is pursuing 50 individuals believed to have escaped from quarantine at KMTC in Nairobi. The 50 had been arrested for failure to adhere to curfew regulations. They are believed to have escaped on Monday night, taking advantage of the heavy rains to scale the walls. Their absence was realised on Tuesday morning when their colleagues went for breakfast. Sources said they had been overheard complaining about the high rates they were expected to pay for the 14 days they would be at the facility. This comes barely two weeks after 32 people mysteriously escaped quarantine in Mandera.
