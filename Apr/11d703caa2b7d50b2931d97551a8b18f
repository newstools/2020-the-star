Efforts by Kilifi deputy governor Gideon Saburi to be released on police bond have proved futile yesterday. The DG was arrested on Friday, hours after he was discharged from the Coast General Hospital and taken to the Port police station where he is being held. He has recovered from coronavirus. A contingent of about 20 DCI officers in four cars arrested the Saburi, who kept the detectives waiting at the hospital for about five hours. On Sunday, his lawyer Otiende Amollo spoke of his frustration in efforts to secure the release of his client on police bond. "There is no progress. He is still in," Amollo said. He said he could not understand why his client was denied police bond. "We have been denied police bond without explanation," Amollo said on Sunday. Saburi is likely to be charged for refusing to self-quarantine upon arrival from an official trip to Germany on March 6. Health CS Mutahi Kagwe said the government would use Saburi as an example for those who refuse to adhere to the anti-coronavirus measures. On Saturday, leaders from Rabai defended Saburi saying he had already suffered enough punishment. Philip Mbaji, a vocal opinion leader in Rabai, said the DG had suffered enough psychological torture. "He is human. He made a mistake and was remorseful. We should forgive him," Mbaji said. He said talk of impeaching the DG should be shelved for the moment. "Let everyone finish their their term and then in 2020 everyone will get a chance to vie for whatever seat they want," Mbaji said. Saburi is faces a fine of up to Sh30,000 or a jail term of not more than three years. Edited by Henry Makori
