Lakeview MCA Karanja Mburu died on Sunday after his car veered off the road and crashed into a tree at View Point near Gilgil town. The MCA who was a close friend of DP William Ruto and Senator Susan Kihika was alone and heading to Nakuru from Naivasha when the accident occurred. Hours after the accident, Nakuru Governor Lee Kinyanjui, county speaker Joel Kairu and a host of MCAs visited the scene of the accident. Gilgil OCPD Emmanuel Opuru said that the tree fell on Karanja's vehicle covering it and making it impossible for other motorists to see it. "There was an accident early in the morning in which Lakeview MCA in Naivasha lost control of his vehicle which rolled and hit a tree and in the process he passed on," he said. The vocal first-time MCA was a member of the Disaster committee which has been distributing food relief to families affected by Covid-19 pandemic. The news of his death was met with shock and disbelief by area residents who described him as a fearless man who did not shy from criticising the county executive for poor service delivery. Naivasha MP Jane Kihara termed the news as shocking adding she was trying to come to terms with the death of the astute leader. “We have lost a promising leader in Naivasha and I take this moment to send my condolences to the family and people of Naivasha,” she said. Viwandani MCA Eric Gichuki said that they had spoken with Mburu the previous day about issues of development. “Karanja never shied from telling any leader how they were performing and this is one of the saddest days for the people of Nakuru county,” he said. Former Naivasha MP John Mututho who was among the first to send his condolences called Karanja a youthful leader who had a bright future. "Karanja kept the county government on its toes and it’s a sad day that we are mourning him when he was at his peak," he said. The body has been taken to Gilgil mortuary while the wreckage of his car was towed to Gilgil police station.
