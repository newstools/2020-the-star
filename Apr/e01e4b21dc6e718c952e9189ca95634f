With the sporting world at a virtual standstill as countries battle to bring the coronavirus threat under control, Kenya has not been left behind. Kenyan swimming legend Jason Dunford is the latest sports personality to lend his contributions towards the government measures to bring the pandemic under control. Dunford has urged individuals to take responsibility for their health and the well being of their families. “I call on all of us to pull together during this crisis that we are facing, this pandemic,” said Dunford. “We need to take it seriously and ensure we wash our hands regularly. I call on the government to provide facilities to enable everyone do this,” Dunford urged. The 2008 Olympian reiterated that this is the moment that the State needs to come through for the people. “The State needs to build infrastructure to allow people to be safe during this pandemic,” said Dunford, who is currently in the United States, the country with the most cases of reported coronavirus infections.
