Kimilili MP Didmus Barasa has bought 200 bags of maize to be distributed to poor families in case the state announces a total lockdown to combat Covid-19. Barasa said the outbreak has made it difficult for many families to afford food because most of them depend on small businesses to survive. Each of the four wards in the constituency — Kibingei, Kimilili, Maeni and Kamukuywa — will get 50 bags. “My office will be working closely with the local administration and other leaders to identify deserving cases and modalities of distribution when the time comes,” Barasa said. The consignment will be handed over to the deputy county commissioner for safe custody. Bungoma county has closed all open markets for 30 days to fight the coronavirus, even though most residents depend on them for survival. Governor Wycliffe Wangamati also ordered the dead to be buried within 24 hours to stop big gatherings, which might endanger residents. “Even though we hope for the best, in the event of a lockdown, the national government must find us somewhere,” Barasa said. The lawmaker said that more consignments of food will be delivered soon if the situation escalates. “I urge the private sector and philanthropists to come forward and share whatever they can manage with the community. Any donation of whatever kind will be appreciated,” he said. (Edited O. Owino)
