The Kwale government on Friday launched a fully fledged Covid-19 unit at Msambweni Subcounty Referral Hospital worth Sh78 million. The centre has 60 beds. Governor Salim Mvurya said more equipment will be installed to enhance the fight against the disease. The facility has been subdivided into three sections to offer quarantine, isolation and treatment services. According to Mvurya, the county is set to go as it can handle the pressure occasioned by the coronavirus crisis. "We are now prepared for anything, any suspected patient shall be accommodated and given required services in the county, " he said. The governor said they are working with the national government for the hospital's laboratory to conduct testing. "Our laboratory has been certified by ISO and we are working on establishing the screening services here," he said. Mvurya said the county has maintained one positive case of the virus but more testing is conducted to ensure the safety of the people.Â County commissioner Karuku Ngumo advised residents to follow government directives. He warned that Covid-19 treatment is expensive and if cases rise the county Health department will be overwhelmed. "We had an experience with one patient here and it cost us around Sh1 million," he said. Ngumo said more preventive measures are being taken to flatten the curve of the rate of infection.
