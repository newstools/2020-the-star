Outgoing Division 2 champion Issa Amwari hopes more Kenya National Rally Championship races will not be distracted as a result of COVID-19. The third round of the national championship in Kilifi in early April was postponed following a government’s directive to ban all public gatherings due to coronavirus outbreak. The now KNRC Premier Class driver, who topped last year’s Division 2 drivers’ standings, is also hoping to compete in the WRC Safari Rally on July 16-19. “If Safari happens in July, then there is a realistic chance of completing the season in good time but if it doesn’t, then organisers will have a hard time trying to find new dates for the postponed events, just in case the COVID19 pandemic escalates to August,” the Keihin Racing driver said. “At the moment, we have stopped our preparations for the car, meaning if this problem persists some of us drivers will be hit hard economically and we would have no choice but to skip most of the races,” added Amwari, who pilots a Mitsubishi Lancer Evo 10. Amwari fears some races may be affected because of the impact of COVID19 in the economy. “I pray that this problem ends soon to enable us to have more races though one can never be certain,” he added. Kenya Motor Sports Federation (KMSF) postponed all it’s calendar events for 30 days last month and promised to review the decision as it closely monitors the situation. Mombasa-based reigning KNRC Division One navigator Champion Victor  Okundi said: “Our car (Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution 10) has been ready from the first KNRC. Corona is just messing what’s left of the year. We hope and pray that this COVID 19 pandemic comes under control before Safari,” he remarked.
