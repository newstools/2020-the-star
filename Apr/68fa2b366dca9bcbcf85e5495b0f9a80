In the wake of coronavirus pandemic, Africans in China have been crying for urgent help as they spend long nights in the cold, facing racial discrimination in malls and attacks on public transport. The world openly knows how Chinese authorities have been harassing Uyghur Muslims using all brutal tactics such as preventing them from practicing rituals and putting them in concentration camps. This is total brutality from the Chinese authorities that should be condemned in the strongest terms possible. Sadly, African states have not yet taken bold steps to rescue their citizens. The actions by the Chinese authorities show racism is still dominant not only at the lower level of societies but also at high levels of state authorities. Western and Eastern nationalist politicians have been constantly inciting animosity and enmity with their anti â€“Africa statements. US President Donald Trump once referred to African states as shithole countries. Within Africa, the politicians are known to stir up tribalism and ethnic chauvinism as a means to achieve their political objectives Racism is the sin for those who want to keep alive the spirit of Sykes-Picot agreement, which resulted in the creation of political boundaries hence propelling hostilities and hatred among nations. The world should stop racism for it is detestable. Shabani Mwalimu is the writer and media Rep Hizb ut-Tahrir Kenya. Mail: binmwalimuo@gmail.com
