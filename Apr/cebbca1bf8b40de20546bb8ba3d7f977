More than 15,000 Nyandarua residents have had their water supply reconnected after the county cleared Sh1.5 million water bills. Water chief officer Benedict Kimani said Governor Francis Kimemia wants to ensure safe and clean water for every resident to help fight Covid-19. “This way we have taken a giant step in fighting Covid -19 in Nyandarua and helped Kenya to fight this pandemic,” he said. The community water projects which were reconnected are in Kipipiri, Ol Kalou, Ol Joro Orok and Ndaragwa constituencies. Mugumo Water Project in Rurii, Ol Kalou, owed KPLC Sh151,000 while Kandoro project in Leshau Pondo ward had Sh89,000 arrears. Other water projects were Malewa (Sh51,000), Weru (Sh121,000), Kariko Sh420,000 and Ex-Jacob Dam (Sh121,000). Kimani said families who depend on the water projects failed to raise enough money to meet their daily needs and pay electricity bills. Some projects, however, failed to raise enough to meet their power costs due to water theft which leads to loss of revenue. “Some people put diversions away from the water meters hence consume the water but don’t pay for it,” Rurii MCA Mburu Githinji said on the Mugumo Water Project. Githinji thanked Kimemia for paying the bills but said the administration should take over and manage all the community water projects. Weru MCA Mbogo Mburu said the Githinji's proposal will ensure uniformity across the county. Mburu urged all project committees to ensure their members are reconnected to water. “Also urge them to continue paying their bills. After we are done with Covid -19, we shall sit and explore the way forward,” he said. (edited by o. owino)
