Health CS Mutahi Kagwe has lauded Kenyans for abiding by the measures put by the government to mitigate the spread of the novel coronavirus. The CS in his daily briefing on the virus at Afya House on Thursday said more gains will be registered in the coming days if Kenyans continue to comply with the measures. "We must jealously guard any gains we make," Kagwe said. The CS said Kenyans have been inside their houses before the curfew time set by the government and that most of them have been wearing masks. He added that Kenyans are using sanitisers frequently which is a good move contributing to flattening the virus. The CS said the government will continue to monitor the types of masks being sold in the streets in order to protect Kenyans from using unauthorised products. Kagwe warned those who are still yet to comply with the government directives and cited those in the jua kali sector and boda boda operators. "We will not allow any Kenyan to die because some people fail to adhere to the set guidelines. All business people, barbershop, salon attendants must follow the guidelines to; fumigate, observe social distance wear face masks, wash hands," he said. The CS spoke on the day he confirmed the country had registered five new cases in the last 24 hours, bringing the country's total to 184. He said four people have been discharged for testing negative. One person died in Mombasa adding Kenya's fatalities to seven. The five new cases were out of 308 samples tested in the last 24 hours. Out of the five new 13 cases, two are female and three are male.
