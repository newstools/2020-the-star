The government has banned uncoordinated direct distribution of food and non-food donations following the chaos witnessed in Kibra yesterday. Kibra residents on Friday scrambled for the food - which was donated by ODM leader Raila Odinga among other well-wishers - and in the process broke social distancing rules. Raila donated Sh15 million worth of food to help communities as livelihoods continue to be negatively affected by the coronavirus pandemic. The residents crowded outside the commissionerâ€™s office to receive the food. Many had no face masks on, despite the government making it mandatory to wear the gear when in public.
