Thousands of workers in Meru flower farms are likely to lose their jobs due to the spread of coronavirus. Layoffs are imminent at Kisima, Flamingo, Lolomarik, Ibis and Uhuru farms where some employees have already been sent on compulsory. Others were given their dues without any communication whether their jobs are secure. Some farms have retained a few permanent employees. The farms major in floriculture and horticulture for export. The flowers include red roses, florinca, scented garden roses, alstromeria, Anais, red Naomi roses, sweetness roses, airforce, cape red, ice bear and Karina. The Star has established that some farms have started picking flowers and throwing them into huge bins because they cannot export them to Europe and other markets now in lockdown due to the contagious coronavirus. Employees contracted for under a year were told to go home and if need be they will be contacted. “About 3,500 employees may lose jobs. Only Timaflo has retained some of its employees. Those who work in packing houses are on leave. Some of those who work at PJ and Disa are on unpaid leave,"one of the workers who sought anonmity fearing vicitimisation said on Monday. According to him, many of his colleagues at Batian, Oldonyor, Protea, Loberia, Siraji, KikwetuBig, Bemark,Tripple A and Uhuru are similarly affected. The workers appealed to the government to intervene saying they solely rely on the farms to sustain themselves and their families. Efforts to reach to flower management were futile as their contact numbers went unanswered. - mwaniki fm
