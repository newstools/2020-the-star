Kenyans will from this morning pay the lowest petrol and kerosene prices at the pump since 2015. In the Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority’s monthly review, petrol and kerosene prices have dropped by Sh18 and Sh18.18 while a litre of diesel will cost Sh4.09 less. This means in Nairobi, a litre of super petrol will retail at Sh92.87, diesel at Sh97.56 and Kerosene at Sh77.28 for the next month. In February 2015, Super Petrol retailed at Sh84 in Nairobi while diesel and kerosene sold at Sh75 and Sh52 per litre. “It is worth noting that the diesel cargoes used in the computation of this month’s prices were procured in February 2020 when the crude oil price was relatively high,” EPRA director-general Pavel Oimeke said. This means, the recent crash in crude oil prices will not be reflected in this month’s diesel pump prices but will be felt in the coming months. The country is now benefiting from an ongoing oil production spat between Russia and Saudi Arabia that has seen global crude prices drop by nearly 50 per cent to $31 per barrel yesterday from an average $56.1 per barrel in February. This even after members of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, collectively known as OPEC+ on Sunday, agreed to cut overall crude-oil production by 9.7 million barrels a day starting on May 1 through June 30 of this year. This as global oil prices have been under pressure, with reduced demand as a result of coronavirus-driven economic shutdowns. As a result, the average landed cost of imported super petrol dropped 34.61 per cent from $472.59 per cubic metre in February to $309.03 per cubic metre in March. Diesel decreased by 9.89 per cent from $480.21 per cubic metre to $432.70 per cubic metre while kerosene decreased by 37.7 per cent from $421.24 per cubic metre to $262.44 per cubic metre. Over the same period, the shilling weakened against the dollar, depreciating by 2.75 per cent to Sh104.05 in March compared to Sh101.27 the previous month. A summary by EPRA shows for every Sh92.87 consumers will pay for a litre of petrol this month Sh45.07 will go to the government in form of taxes and levies, higher than the Sh32.22 cost of the product. Distribution and storage get Sh3.19 from the litre while oil marketers and distributors are allowed a margin of Sh12.39. For a litre of diesel costing Sh97.56 at the pump, Sh36.74 will go to the government with the product costing Sh45.41. Margins for the commodity are valued at Sh12.36 while distribution and storage cost Sh3.05. For every Sh77.28 paid for a litre of diesel, Sh34.36 goes to the state as taxes and levies while the product’s actual cost is Sh27.56. While introducing measures aimed at cushioning Kenyans from the impact of the coronavirus last month, the President left out measures to reduce the cost of fuel, with social distancing measures forcing public transport to charge commuters double the fares.
