Kisumu All-Stars coach Andrew Aroka says the Kenya Premier League should resume once the COVID-19 pandemic is contained. Aroka said it could be unfair to cancel the league with nine matches to go. “My opinion is that we should resume the league from where we left. We are ready to play the remaining matches even if it means two matches a week,” said Aroka. He added: “I have heard proposals that the league should be cancelled and Gor Mahia handed the title. That could be unfair to teams like Homeboyz and Tusker who are also seeking the KPL title. Even in the relegation, some teams feel that they have a chance of survival if the league is concluded. ” He said he is confident the team will survive relegation. The club is 16th on the log with a paltry nine points same as last-placed Chemelil Sugar. “The morale of the boys is high and we have five matches at home,” said the tactician who took over from the late Henry Omino. Aroka bemoaned the coronavirus pandemic, saying it came when the team was peaking. “The indefinite suspension of the league came at the time when the team was starting to show some improvement. We narrowly lost 3-2 against Ulinzi and held Tusker to a 2-2 draw. This was a good show for the boys and I’m upbeat that they will do well when the season resumes,” added the tactician. He, however, noted that the indefinite postponement of the league has seen the return of Steve Otieno and Dan Otieno to full fitness. “I’m happy that the players are back. These are key players in the team,” Aroka added. He further noted that he is happy with the training of the players. “We gave them a training program when all sporting events were indefinitely postponed and we make follow-ups daily on how they are training on their own,” he said.
