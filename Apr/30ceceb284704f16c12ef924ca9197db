In April 2013, James Kibor walked into their family land shouting that he would shoot somebody with an arrow. Minutes later, he was dead of head injuries. His brother Abraham Chebukwa was seen running away, holding an axe and saying he had killed his brother. The siblings fought over land Kibor had leased to a friend. The crime occurred at Kamaram village, Chepsiro location within Trans Nzoia County on April 7, 2013. Chebukwa was arrested and charged with murder. In his defence, the accused testified that he had leased two acres of land to a friend, Samson, and he went to assist Samson to prepare the land for farming. “At about 6pm, the deceased, who was angry because Samson had also leased the land, came towards me armed with a bow and arrow. Sensing danger, I ran away and left the two arguing,” Chebukwa testified. He said a few minutes later he heard screams but didn't find out why. The High Court in Eldoret considered the circumstances, acquitted him of murder and convicted the father of two of manslaughter. He was sentenced to 15 years behind bars, which he appealed. Chebukwa accused the judge of imposing too harsh a sentence, disregarding his age and the circumstances under which the crime was committed. Presiding judges Hannah Okwengu and Amina Mohammed, however, found the sentence was neither harsh nor excessive. “We are satisfied the learned Judge considered all the relevant factors in meting out the sentence … we have no reason to interfere,” the duo directed.
