Covid-19 has left the hotel industry on its knees countrywide, with about 250 workers losing jobs in that sector in Vihiga county. Most of hotel owners have had to send away staff because of lack of business. The government directed that people should not gather in hotels and restaurants, which should only serve take way meals. Hotels that have heavily downsized their staff include Roddy Hotel Emuhaya (112 workers), Triple T (40), Oasis (26), Harms (20), Sosa Cottage (40) and Samaritan (14). Rodrick Oware of Roddy Hotel along Kisumu-Busia highway said the industry was currently going through hard times. “We regret that most of the hotels had to send some of their staff home on compulsory unpaid leave and pay those retained half of their salary," Oware told the Star. Majority of hotel owners said they were not able to sustain the current labour force as business had totally dropped. "The hotel industry heavily relies on outside catering in public functions. With the state orders in place, we are out of the game," Henry Asava told the star. Oware said the idea of take away meals was impractical as no one would buy readymade food from a hotel to take home in a rural set up. Most of the hotels depend on foreign visitors and long distance travelers but now they have no bookings. “Most of these hotels you are seeing we are only opening our doors to remind people are still existing but there is nothing we are doing in real sense,” Hadson Owase, owner of Triple T hotel in Luanda, said.
