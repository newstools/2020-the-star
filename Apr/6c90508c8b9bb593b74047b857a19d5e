The government will not back down on local sourcing of materials and production of goods, Interior CS Fred Matiang’i has said. “A while ago, our overalls (coats) used to be imported from China but never again. These coats are made locally and they are warm enough," Matiang'i said. He spoke at his Harambee House office after receiving a donation of jungle green police jackets from Kenya Association of Manufacturers chairperson Sachen Gudka and United Aryan Limited chairperson Pankaj Debi. All coats, gear and boots for the National Police Service will be made locally. "We have to promote local businesses and create employment,” he said. The CS said the government is determined to improve the economy and not allow the exportation of jobs. He thanked those who have donated handwashing units, masks and sanitiser to police stations. “I am happy that people have learnt to say thank you to the security personnel. I was impressed by the women in Tala who cooked for our police officers manning a roadblock.” Matiang'i reiterated that the government will not back down in the fight against contraband goods to protect local manufacturers. “We have taken very ruthless measures. Whenever we impound trucks ferrying contraband goods like sugar, the seizures are destroyed immediately. That is how we can protect local industries,” he said, adding: “Protecting Kenyan jobs and businesses is now a national security issue. We can longer allow our businesses to go south.” Interior PS Karanja Kibicho said the NYS, who exclusively sourced local fabric and knitted police uniforms in Ruaraka, will henceforth be assisted by the private sector to hasten the process. “This week, we signed contracts so that the uniforms will be ready by June 30,” Kibicho said. The occasion was attended by Inspector General of Police Hillary Mutyambai. Edited by A.N
