Two more bodies including a foetus were recovered from the scene of the Chesogon trading centre mudslide, bringing the total of deaths to 15. Rift Valley regional commissioner George Natembeya said at least 22 people including learners were still missing following the Saturday night tragedy that left more than 4,000 families homeless after their houses were swept away by floods. Speaking to the press at the scene of the incident, Natembeya said the recovery teams on the ground had intensified efforts to find the missing bodies trapped in the mud along Chesogon River. Also still missing were eight guns and 1,200 rounds of ammunition after Chesogon police post was washed away. The administrator said the recovery teams, which comprise security personnel and the Kenya Red Cross Society, were facing a challenge accessing some of the areas where the missing bodies were believed to be trapped as roads were destroyed. “The search and rescue mission for the bodies is still going on despite some challenges related to the impassable road network and pounding rains,” Natembeya said. The regional coordinator hinted that they might call off the search and rescue operation if the ongoing rains didn’t subside. He warned the political class against interfering with the national and county governments efforts to address the plight of displaced families camping in primary schools from both Marakwet and Pokot sides. “It has come to our attention that some politicians have started to politicize the manner in which the governments are handling the distribution of relief food and non-food items to the victims of the landslide in Kerio Valley,” he said.
