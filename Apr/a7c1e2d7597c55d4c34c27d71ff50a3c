Some MCAs in Kilifi have vowed to impeach Deputy Governor Gideon Saburi for exposing over 130 people to the coronavirus after failing to self-quarantine following a trip to Germany, only to test positive. Saburi was arrested on Friday after recovering from the virus and taken to court yesterday for prosecution. He is facing a fine of up to Sh30,000 or a jail term of not more than three years. Kakuyuni MCA Nixon Muramba said the deputy governor "wanted to kill thousands of people", despite knowing he had come from a coronavirus-hit country. He said once everything settles and they go back to the assembly, a motion will be moved to impeach him. Some leaders, however, want him to be forgiven as he may not have known the impact of going to public places after returning from Germany. The MCAs were tested on Saturday for the coronavirus and are expected to return to the assembly to debate the proposal by the governor to approve a supplementary budget of more than Sh200 million to fight the pandemic. It's not clear whether the impeachment motion will be tabled, now that the deputy governor is in court, or the legislators will go ahead to impeach him. Impeachment or no impeachment, the deputy governor's actions have hurt the livelihoods of Kilifi county and the economy at large. Kilifi has become among the hotspots with at least seven cases after Nairobi, whose numbers keep rising, and Mombasa and Kwale counties. Life has returned to normal in Kilifi after locals learned that the deputy governor is now negative. What gives hope is the fact that the numbers have been constant for the last few days, but it's not clear where they would increase or not, with the manner in which locals are behaving with ignorance. For instance, some boda boda riders are still carrying more than one passenger without any masks. Edited by T Jalio
