The Nyeri government has banned hawking of face masks in town streets over poor hygiene. Governor Mutahi Kahiga said on Friday those found selling them will be arrested. Kahiga said most of those selling the masks are not known to the local residents as they do not come from the area. He said the hawkers allow a customer to try out the masks until they find one that fits them. Kahiga said this may lead to the spread of Covid-19. “It has come to our attention that masks being hawked are handled unhygienically and this poses a serious risk in the transmission of the virus,” the governor said. He said masks should not be sold by every Tom, Dick and Harry. Going forward, he said, all masks must be packed well before being taken out for sale. Edited by A.N
