Tension is high in Makindu town, Makueni, after a truck driver was discovered to have Covid-19. According to a police report, a truck driver and his co-driver were travelling from Tororo to Mombasa. Maurice Wambua, 25, and Julius Muema were tested for Covid-19 in Uganda on Sunday. They underwent another test at Malaba on Monday before proceeding. They received a call while in Salama informing them to report to the nearest health facility. They reported to Makindu Referral Hospital. "One is a confirmed case but the other one is isolated because he is exposed," said a source at the facility who sought anonymity because he is not authorised to speak to the media. Investigations by health and police officers handling the two indicate that the two interacted with other people on their way. The report says the two revealed that they slept in the vehicle in Eldoret but had a take away lunch purchased using cash at a hotel in Salgaa and later had contact with colleagues on their way before they reached Makindu. "The two cases have been taken over by the medics and follow up is in progress for another three contacts," the report says. Makueni County Corona Virus Emergency Response Committee chairman Maalim Mohammed said the information on the two will be confirmed by the Health ministry.
