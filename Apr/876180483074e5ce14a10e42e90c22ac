Two brothers drowned in a seasonal river in Embu county while rushing home to avoid security forces a few minutes after 7pm. John Simolo, 33, and Joseph Kioko, 17, drowned in Kakindu River in Mbeere South subcounty on Sunday. Makima ward administrator Samson Mwonga said the siblings were using a footbridge to cross the river which is swollen following a downpour when they were swept by the deluge. The search could not be carried out at night, he said, hence the bodies were recovered on Monday in separate spots. Police took the bodies to Embu Level 5 Teaching and Referral Hospital mortuary pending interment. Mwonga sent condolences to the family. He advised residents to seek somewhere to sleep ifÂ they are caught up by the curfew or when it starts raining heavily at night to avoid such tragedies. Edited by R.Wamochie
