Stanbic Bank Kenya in partnership with Base Titanium, Centum, Gulf Power, Valar Frontier and Africa practice, have donated 192 ventilators worth Sh134 million to combat the coronavirus pandemic. “The fight against coronavirus is a task that requires us to pool our resources together to ensure that Kenya comes out of this situation stronger and more resilient,” said Stanbic chief executive Charles Mudiwa. The mechanical breathing devices play a vital role and are in high demand globally due to their critical role in managing severe cases of patients who develop breathing complications, offering the best chance for survival. According to the World Health Organization, one in six Covid-19 patients becomes seriously ill and can develop breathing difficulties. In dire cases, the virus causes a buildup of fluid in the lungs, causing the body's oxygen levels to drop and making it harder to breathe. To alleviate this, a ventilator is used to push air, with increased levels of oxygen, into the lungs. Kenya on Monday recorded eight new cases of coronavirus, bringing the total number of Covid-19 cases to 363, with 114 recoveries and 14 fatalities. Healthcare systems all over the world are under pressure to fight the virus.
