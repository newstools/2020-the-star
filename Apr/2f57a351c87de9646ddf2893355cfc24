Twenty people including former Marathon world record holder Wilson Kipsang and an MCA are under mandatory quarantine in Elgeyo Marakwet. Kipsang who is a policeman, Kapchemutwo MCA Ambrose Kiplagat and eight others were found drinking after curfew hours on Thursday in Iten. They were charged in court and fined Sh5,000 each but the government ordered that they be quarantined because they were crowding contrary to directives to contain the coronavirus. “We have ordered that they be quarantined for 14 days and to undergo coronavirus tests before being freed,” Elgeyo Marakwet county commissioner Omar Ahmed said. Kipsang claimed he had travelled from Eldoret to Iten and was in the process of shutting down his hotel when police arrived. “Your honour, I am very sorry for the offence,” the policeman told the magistrate. Kipsang owns Keelu Resort which has now been permanently shut by the county commissioner. Omar said police would intensify patrols and enforce the curfew. Any restaurant, bar and other businesses found contravening the curfew would be shut. He warned that they would revoke licences for such places so that they do not operate again. Ten other people arrested in parts of the county for defying the curfew were also placed under quarantine at government facilities at their own cost. Health executive Kiprono Chepkok said they will take all necessary measures to ensure all residents comply with measures to control the spread of the coronavirus. (edited by o. owino)
