A man was on Wednesday charged with disobeying the order of restriction of movement by attempting to transport passengers to Eldoret from Nairobi. Benard Muchiri was charged before Kibera senior principal magistrate Boaz Ombewa and denied the charges. Muchiri was charged with failing to adhere to public health restrictions in the Nairobi  metropolitan area by driving the vehicle heading to Eldoret. He was charged with another count of driving a motor vehicle on a public road by carrying fare-paying passengers using a private car. The charge read in court said he committed the offence on April 15 along Waiyaki Way within Nairobi county. But Muchiri told the court he was ferrying his passengers to Kikuyu, not Eldoret as charged. “Your honour, I was ferrying them to Kikuyu but not Eldoret. I was only driving within Nairobi when the cops arrested me at Kabete,” he said. Magistrate Ombewa recorded the plea of not after the accused insisted that he was carrying his passengers within the Nairobi metropolis. “No, I have not pleaded guilty. I was driving but within Nairobi,” Muchiri said. Ombewa ordered him to pay a Sh15,000 bail with a surety of a similar amount. “We shall listen to you and make a fair ruling. You don’t need to be worried, “ he said. He directed the case to proceed on May 27. Edited by Henry Makori
