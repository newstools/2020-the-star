Clinical officers in Turkana have trained 40 healthcare workers on how to handle Covid-19 patients. Kenya Clinical Officers Association secretary general-elect Joseph Chebii said the majority of those trained are members of the association. “We have trained at least 40 healthcare workers in Turkana to compliment efforts of the county government on the war on Covid-19,” he said. Chebii said healthcare workers had little knowledge of how to handle coronavirus cases and protect themselves against the virus. Among the things healthcare workers have been trained on is how to properly wear and remove personal protective equipment and collect samples. “It’s a new pandemic in the world, and we are also learning new ways of protecting ourselves by using personal protective equipment,” he said. Hawa Maganga, a medic at Lodwar County Referral Hospital, said, “Healthcare workers are at high risk of getting infected.” Edited by A.N
