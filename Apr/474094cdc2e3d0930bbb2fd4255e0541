Commercial International Bank, Egypt, has completed its 51 per cent acquisition of Mayfair Bank Limited following approval by the Central Bank of Kenya. The Egyptian bank will now hold majority stake at the local bank as it establishes its presence in the Kenyan market and expands into the East African region. The transaction took place under Section 13 (4) of the Banking Act and approval by the Cabinet Secretary for the National Treasury and Planning on April 8, 2020, pursuant to Section 9 of the Banking Act.

It is categorised as a small bank with a market share of 0.17 per cent as at February 2020. CIB will provide MBL with the requisite skills, resources and infrastructure to scale up its business. The acquisition will also strengthen trade and investment ties between Kenya and Egypt. The bank was licensed by the Central Bank of Egypt on August 13, 1975. It is a leading private sector bank in Egypt, with a total asset base of approximately $24.18 billion (Sh2.45 trillion).
