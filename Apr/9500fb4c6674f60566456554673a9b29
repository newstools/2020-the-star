Kenyan low-cost carrier, Jambojet has temporarily put on hold operations up to May 20, following the government’s extension of cessation of movement to curb the spread of the coronavirus. The Government of Kenya last week extended the cessation of movement order in and out of Nairobi, Mombasa, Kilifi and Kwale counties for an additional 21 days. “We regret to inform our customers and business partners that all the flights for the said period are cancelled with immediate effect,” it said. The airline flies to five local destinations including Malindi, Ukunda, Mombasa, Kisumu and Eldoret from its hub in Nairobi. The dusk till dawn curfew started on March 27 to combat the fast-spreading coronavirus pandemic as the country on Monday recorded eight new cases bringing the total number to 363. “We would like to encourage all passengers scheduled to travel in the period up to 20th May 2020, to consider rescheduling their travel to a later date at no extra cost. The value of these tickets will remain valid for a period of 12 months from 1st May 2020.” The firm also urged the public to abide by the Government directive, exercise caution and adhere to the guidelines provided by the Ministry of Health and WHO. “Now you can’t fly, but we look forward to welcoming you onboard once the situation gets back to normal,” Jambojet said.
