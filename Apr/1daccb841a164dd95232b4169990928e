More than 200,000 people in Nyeri county risk starving because of the coronavirus measures, unless enough food is gathered and distributed soon. Nyeri Governor Mutahi Kahiga asked people who can afford three meals a day to skip at least one meal and donate the equivalent in money or food to the needy. He said Nyeri town will be the hardest hit as businesses have been closed. They include hawkers and kiosk operators as well as larger businesses and casual workers. “The hardest hit is in this town, where we had hawkers and kiosk operators who are now doing nothing and are just at home. Even if they had savings, in the next two weeks, the savings will need replenishing,” he said. The governor said the county has set aside about Sh10 million to purchase food and called on well-wishers to donate more food. “At no other time have we been called upon to show who we are and our humanity than now. So I call upon every individual in Nyeri to bring us what they can, be it in kind, money or food," he said. The governor asked farmers who had a bumper harvest during the short rains to store food properly as it will be needed. The county boss said his government will also give sanitiser and 100,000 face masks to more than 50,000 people to help prevent the spread of the virus. The face masks have been bought from the Nyeri National Polytechnic. “We want to ensure they get to every other person. But Nyeri has more than that number and so we welcome MPs to come and focus on saving our people by getting rid of Covid-19,” he said. Edited by V. Graham
