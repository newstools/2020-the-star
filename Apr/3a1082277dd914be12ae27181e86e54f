A hotel in Athi River, Machakos, has been closed for defying the ban on social gatherings to stop the spread of coronavirus and hosting more than 140 youths. The youths were on Wednesday quarantined in the same facility - Lukenya Getaway Resort - for 14 days at their own expense. Machakos county commissioner Esther Maina declared the indefinite closure of the resort. The youths are aged between 22 and 28. "This is a continuation of what happened yesterday (Tuesday) at Maanzoni Lodge. The 140 youth are part of the 720 quarantined yesterday. We have also quarantined them to determine their health condition for the next 14 days and from there we will know what to do with them," Maina said. She ordered the youths to undergo coronavirus tests for before they are evacuated from the private facility. She said the DCI was investigating why they were ferried to the two hotels. Two people arrested yesterday were released on bail until court operations resume. According to the administrator, it was against the law to accommodate so many people in one place. Maina,  who was accompanied by Machakos county security team, ordered the hotel’s closure and tests to be done on the young men by health officers from Nairobi. Reporters were denied access into the hotel. "The hotel will be in total lockdown so that nobody gets in or goes out until the 14 days are over. We will deal with those breaking the law accordingly," Maina said. On Tuesday, the commissioner closed Maanzoni Lodge and declared it a quarantine area. The Ministry of Health officers are overseeing the 14-day forced quarantine in both facilities. Edited by Henry Makori
