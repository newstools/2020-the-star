A couple has been allowed to adopt a child after three years of trying to conceive. DNM, 42,  and MIC, 34, contracted their marriage under Gusii customary law. They solemnised their marriage at the registrar of marriages on August 2, 2017. The husband is a nurse at Kenyatta National Hospital while his wife operates a hair parlour. The couple, according to the court records, has not been able to have a child of their own owing to medical complications of the man. Judge John Onyiego, in determining their suitability, said they are both Kenyan citizens aged between 25 and 65, the mandatory age bracket for adoptive parents in compliance with section 158 of the Children's Act. “They have understood the consequences of adoption and that it is permanent in nature. They have fully bonded with the child who fondly refers to them as dad and mum and they are also financially stable, hence the ability to provide for the basic requirements,” Onyiego said. The child was born on March 16, 2017. Four days later, the mother gave it up for adoption, saying she was doing it due to financial constraints, lack of a permanent place to stay, unemployment and that she had another child under the care of her mother. The minor was subsequently declared free for adoption by the Kenyan-to-Kenyan peace Initiative Adoption Society Care committee. The child is now three years old. Onyiego said technically, the birth mother surrendered her parental responsibility relating to the child when she expressed her inability to look after it. “People in society have various capacities and abilities to do certain things. In this case, the child was exposed to social and economic challenges which would affect his growth and development.” The judge said that the baby, in the hands of the applicants, is assured of basic provisions such as education, food, clothing, medical care and shelter. "It is in his interest that I rule the adoption be allowed,” Justice Onyiego said. Edited by R.Wamochie
