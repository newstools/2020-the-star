Health officials spent the better part of Saturday fumigating streets and shopping malls in Eastleigh, bringing to a near halt activity in the business hub. Fumigation of the busy city area for the second time followed confirmation of the death of Imam from coronavirus. Reports indicated other positive cases had been living in Eastleigh but the Star could not independently confirm the claims by press time. A Nairobi county fire fighting engine sprayed chemicals outside shopping malls as other vehicles moved inside the narrow streets and inside shops. On First Avenue, police blocked roads to pave way for the fumigating team. On Friday, Eastleigh business community secretary general Omar Hussein announced closure of all malls and shops to stop the spread of coronavirus. Despite increasing numbers of positive cases in the country, life had been going on as usual in Eastleigh, where thousands crowd streets and malls for legitimate and illegitimate business transactions. “Obviously, this is going to have negative impact on my business, but it's necessary. We don’t want to die,” said Abdullah Abdi who has stall at Medina Mall. Health officials were accompanied by contingents of uniformed and plain clothed police officers to facilitate the exercise as the area is known to have illegally armed residents. Police had a hard time dispersing small scale traders who continued with their businesses oblivious of the dangers. Edited by Henry Makori
