The government in Rwanda has extended rigid lockdown restrictions imposed last month to April 19. The lockdown that began on March 21 banned people from leaving their homes unless when going out to shop for food or buy medicine. The government deployed police to enforce the restrictions to prevent the spread of coronavirus. The initial lockdown was to end this weekend but has now been extended by two weeks. The cabinet, during a virtual meeting on Wednesday, agreed to extend the lockdown as confirmed cases of coronavirus cases continue to increase. Rwanda now has 82 confirmed cases of the virus. During the extended lockdown, the borders will remain closed and only the entry of Rwandese citizens will be allowed. Goods will continue to be allowed into the country. Shops, schools and places of worship will remain closed and employees will continue working from home.
