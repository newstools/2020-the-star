Makueni county has received 20,000 face masks purchased from Kicotec in Kitui county to prevent the spread of Covid-19. The face masks packed in brown cartons where delivered by Kitui Trade and Cooperatives director Fedelis Mwaniki. They were received by the Health Products and Technology director of Makueni James Kanyange. Mwaniki said Makueni was one of many clients, including private and public entities, who have ordered for the masks from the factory in the last two weeks. “We are making 30,000 pieces per day working in 24-hour shifts to meet the rising demand," Mwaniki said. Kicotec is playing a major role in management of Covid-19 in the country, he added. The manufacturing facility, one of Governor Charity Ngilu’s flagship projects, has attracted attention around the world in its significant contribution to the fight against Covid-1. Makueni Health chief officer Patrick Musyoki said the face masks will be supplied to all the medical facilities in the county. “The masks will be used by our health care workers. It is part of our efforts in the health department to ensure they are protected against infection by coronavirus,” Musyoki told the Star on Tuesday. Health workers had been complaining of insufficient supply of masks in the facilities. A medical officer who spoke to the Star in confidence for fear of reprisal said there was a brief g- slow at the county referral hospital before a senior officer in the department assured them that masks would be provided. “There were only a few that were provided sparingly but the authorities argued that the shortage of masks was felt countrywide. We felt at risk when you have to see a patient without the mask because we know how health workers lost lives after contracting the virus in other countries,” the medic said. Edited by Henry Makori
