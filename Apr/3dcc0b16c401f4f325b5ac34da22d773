An MP from Kiambu has urged residents to obey government directives to avoid contracting to the coronavirus. Peter Mwathi of Limuru constituency on Tuesday urged residents to reduce movement and make themselves busy at home to minimise exposure to the virus. Confirmed cases have been on the rise and the Ministry of Health has called for behaviour change if Kenya is to win the fight against the virus. Of the 11 confirmed cases announced on Monday, six were from Kiambu county — one each from Ruiru, Githurai 45, Thindigua, Waithaka, Ndongoro and Ting'ang'a. In line with the foregoing, Mwathi said it would be improper to allow the disease to spread, as it is no one's wish to get infected. He appealed to Kiambu leaders to provide face masks, sanitiser and handwashing soap. Mwathi's office has been supplying sanitiser, water tanks, face masks and soap in marketplaces. He pleaded with the government to fast-track its food and relief programme to the needy, adding that many people need urgent help. "We are sure there are no casual jobs, so many people are not hiring casuals, while many businesses have been closed down," Mwathi said. "I'm sure some leaders have extended their generosity to ensure hygiene is observed, I included. This is not enough. Hygiene is part of human life and people should observe it every minute. People's role is ensuring they obey the instructions of observing hygiene." Health CS Mutahi Kagwe urged people to be vigilant and treat every individual they come across as an infected person so the country can protect itself. And emphasising Kagwe's statement, Mwathi appealed to residents to exercise extra caution to combat the disease. (Edited by F'Orieny)
