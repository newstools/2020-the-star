The gesture by different groups to distribute food to the vulnerable groups during the Covid-19 outbreak is commendable. However, there needs to be a structured way to do this in order to avoid the risk of spreading the disease further as well as ensuring they are distributed equitably. For this to be achieved, it is my opinion that all these resources should be directed to the Covid-19 Emergency Response Fund for onward distribution to the vulnerable groups with the help of the local leadership. This will not only lead to fairness in distribution but also accountability in the mobilisation and distribution of the resources. Similarly, politicians must desist from using this pandemic for political mileage. For instance, the leaders must from branding whatever donations they distribute to the citizens. This is the time for all of us to put aside any differences and support each other towards the fight of this disease as it does not know age, religion, political status or wealth. If we do not act responsibly we will be wiped out. In this regard, we must support the government in all the efforts it has put in place to win this fight. Let us all keep social distance, wash hands and sanitise. God bless Kenya.  Associate Member, Public Relations Society of Kenya, Nairobi
