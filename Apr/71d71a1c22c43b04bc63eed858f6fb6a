A woman in Kisumu county has been charged in a Maseno court with arson and assault. Donnet Rose Odhiambo is accused of torching a Sh3,288,600 family house after disagreeing with her husband. Steve Sande allegedly refused to allow her to attend her relative's funeral with their four-year-old child amid fears for their safety in the wake of Covid-19 infection. The two have been married since 2015 and have one child. The charge sheet says she committed the offence on April 3, at Kapuonja location in Kisumu West. In the second count, she was charged with causing Sande bodily harm. Odhiambo denied the charges before principal magistrate Christopher Yalwala. She was granted Sh80,000 bond and alternative Sh40,000 bail. The case will be heard on June 15. Odhiambo, a lawyer, has been pursuing a master's degree in Regional Integration-EAC under the DAAD scholarship progamme. Kisumu West deputy OCPD Henry Wesonga said she was arrested on Friday. “She was taken to court and it is now a matter before the court,” he said.
