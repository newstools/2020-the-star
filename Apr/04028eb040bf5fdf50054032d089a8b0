Police have gunned down two robbery suspects in Mombasa. The two were killed at Nyali bridge after a chase from Makupa area where they had stolen cash from a shop on Wednesday, police said. They were riding a motorcycle with no number plate. Confirming the incident, Nyali subcounty police commander Daniel Masaba said the suspects were killed during a shootout. “My officers had been chasing them following a tip off from members of the public. We have been having a spate of robberies and we are investigating where else these arms might have been used to commit crimes," Masaba said. Police recovered several mobile phones, a fake AK47 rifle and Sh10,000 hidden in the underwear of one of the suspects. The suspects threw a pistol into the ocean before being killed. “They steal in Majengo but run to hide in Likoni. Others commit the crimes and run to Nyali. We are sending a warning to others out there,'’ he said. The bodies have been taken to the Coast General Hospital mortuary. Some parts of Mombasa have recorded a spate of robbery cases during curfew hours. At Bombululu, thugs are reported to have stolen goods worth Sh300,000 after breaking into a hardware shop.
