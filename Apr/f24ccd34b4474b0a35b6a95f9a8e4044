Controversial singer Akothee has advised side chicks to go back to their parents once their sponsor screens their calls during this quarantine period. She reminded them the reason most of them are not picking their calls is that they are now on lockdown with their family, leaving them out in the cold. “So if I were you, if this idiot is not picking up calls, Madam, start parking,” she said. She added, “Madam, if you know you don’t have a job and you are depending on someone to pay your rent, that money is not coming between now and June.” “I don’t know what you will do with the house because this person has a family and every little money everybody has now, they are keeping it for themselves.” She, however, said she is not advocating for any woman to date a married man.
