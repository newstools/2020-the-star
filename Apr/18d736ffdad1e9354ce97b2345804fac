A flower farm worker in Naivasha's Karagita Estate died in unclear circumstances at the weekend, raising fears of Covid-19 as he had difficulty breathing. Stephen Kuria said the man had been complaining of chest pains and breathing problems before he collapsed and died. “It happened very fast. He was confirmed dead on arrival at the hospital,” he said. “There are so many stories going around following the sudden death but only a postmortem will determine the cause of death,” a senior police officer said. The body is at the Naivasha sub-county hospital mortuary. Meanwhile, the Kenya Wildlife Service Training Institute in Naivasha is now a quarantine centre, according to the Ministry of Health. The government recently directed health officials to identify institutions which can be used as quarantine centres in case the number of those with Covid-19 overwhelms hospitals. Health officials in Naivasha have hastened the screening of those using the Nairobi-Nakuru highway. Sub-county public health officer George Ndichu said they are targeting all PSVs using the highway. “In the last couple of days, we have seen the number of passengers using the highway drop significantly and this is good news in the fight against the coronavirus,” Ndichu said. Naivasha has tens of high class hotels. According to Ndichu, the wildlife training institute meets all the set criteria. He said the identification of the institute as an isaltion centre  was part of mitigation measures to deal with the outbreak. No coronavirus case has been reported in and around the town. He urged residents to exercise social distancing and wash their hands to forestall the spread of the disease. “We have trained our security officers on this disease and we shall continue to dispense more information to the public." Ndichu is leading the virus response team in Naivasha. Edited by R.Wamochie
