The government has announced new measures to curb the Covid-19 spread in the country. Health CS Mutahi Kagwe has directed that persons visiting any supermarket or an open-air market to wear a face mask. "Any person visiting a supermarket or any other open-air market should immediately wear a face mask immediately," Kagwe said during a press briefing at Afya House on Saturday afternoon. On Friday, the CS for Trade and Industrialization said already more than one million masks had been manufactured and were at various levels of the distribution channel. “From the indication we have received from the manufactures and the retailers and based on the volume expected, we don’t expect any of these masks available for sale to sell for more than Sh20,” Maina said. “I am sure people will be able to be very innovative about it and I am certain some prices could even come as low as Sh5.” She, however, called on Kenyans to ensure the masks they buy have three layers as the others are only capable of protecting them from dust and not the coronavirus.
