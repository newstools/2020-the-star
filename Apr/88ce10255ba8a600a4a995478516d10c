The Ministry of Devolution through the Kenya Devolution Support Programme will release Sh4 billion to counties for emergency response. The money is expected to be used in capacity building at the county level in the wake of Covid-19 pandemic. Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa said on Wednesday the government will utilise schools to create enough space for families displaced by floods. Eugene said that as of Wednesday, 116 people had died due to floods, with more than 100,000 households displaced. Some 29 counties have been affected, including Elgeyo Marakwet and West Pokot. The government released more than 40,000 bags of rice and other food and non-food items to assist victims of floods and mudslides. Eugene, however, emphasised that the food should be donated within the Ministry of Health guidelines to ensure the virus is not devolved to counties and camps. “We want to assure Kenyans that we have enough food in the country, and we will support all those who have been displaced,” he assured. The CS said Covid-19 is not a local issue and as the country fights to contain the  pandemic, there are other challenges such as floods. “As you remember, the year started with drought, then we had floods and locusts. Our resilience has been tested over the last year.” Eugene said the food donated should be distributed through county emergency teams co-chaired by governors and county commissioners.
