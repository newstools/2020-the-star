The Ministry of Health and Kebs are yet to determine whether the cloth masks being used by Kenyans are suitable for combatting the coronavirus, Health acting director general Patrick Amoth has said. During the briefing on the Covid-19 situation on Friday, he said that while standards have been set for other medical masks, the ministry and Kebs are yet to determine whether cloth masks do the job. "Even though we don't have clarity, it's better to deploy them as we develop standards because we are dealing with a formidable enemy," he said. Amoth said the N95 masks should be left to health care workers. The government has urged Kenyans to wear masks while in open spaces. Speaking on Friday at Afya House, Health CS Mutahi Kagwe said that the government has noted that people are disregarding the measure. "This measure is very important and everyone should wear masks in open areas, especially in markets places," Kagwe said. He added that the ministry is working with the counties to prepare guidelines for disposal of the masks. Kagwe also advised Kenyans to avoid using coins and notes as a way of curbing the virus. Kenya has reported five new coronavirus cases bringing the country's total number to 189. They are all Kenyans and one has a history of travel from the UAE. Three are from Mombasa, while Nairobi and Nyandarua have one case each. They are between 27 and 58; three are male, two female. Another 10 individuals have recovered, bringing the total to 22. Kagwe during his daily briefing on the coronavirus on Friday at Afya House said the five new cases were out of 504 samples tested. Friday marks Day 30 of efforts to stop the spread of the virus.
