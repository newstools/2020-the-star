The Prisons department has directed warders to limit movement within the facilities and placed those who live outside on leave to contain the coronavirus. Motorcycle operators have been banned from the facilities while warders' family members who work outside the prisons have also been told to stay at home. The latest directives are in addition to the prohibition of prison visits ordered two weeks ago. A notice from the Prisons headquarters directed medical staff to visit all penal institutions and establish if a total lockdown had been effected. “All prison medical staff are instructed to visit stations in their regions and conduct a daily monitoring and evaluation exercise,” the notice reads. The notice further orders the officers to contain their children within their houses. However, Prisons director of operations Duncan Ogore downplayed the lockdown adding that the officers were free to leave their camps. Ogore said they were keen to make sure none of their officers was infected by the virus as this would lead to a major crisis within the prison. “The new measures are meant to make sure that we contain the spread of the virus,” he said. Ogore said that the inmates were vulnerable to Covid-19 and they were not taking chances as they fight against the outbreak. At Naivasha GK prison, all motorcycle operators were banned from accessing the facility until the disease is contained. A junior officer from the prison confirmed the lockdown saying that this had affected even their family members who worked outside the prison. “We have been forced to stay within the prison grounds following the directive and even our relatives who work in Naivasha town have been locked in,” the officer said.
