Drunkards are at high risk of coronavirus infection because their judgment is impaired and they worry more about the next drink than handwashing, social distancing and wearing face masks. Chief John Koskei of Waseges location, Subukia subcounty in Nakuru said they have tried to educate heavy drinkers about the dangers of Covid-19 but they have an ingrained 'don't-care' attitude about the pandemic. Koskei was speaking on Friday, during a tour of his location, where a number of drunks were passed on on village footpaths. The chief said much as they have tried to arrest and create awareness, their efforts are ignored with contempt and many drinkers strongly believe the disease only infects urbanites. They dismissively refer to Covid-19 as "a Nairobi disease". One alcoholic, who refused to be named for fear of arrest, shouted, "We are so far away from the disease, please leave us alone. Nobody comes here to solve our problems. "Why do you want to make us part of your disease issues? Breathing with those ugly masks is difficult !‚Äù Koskei said the general attitude in the villages is that Covid-19 is a remote disease unrelated to them. Koskei said alcoholics don't practice social distancing, they share the same drinking cups and pass out next to each other. The chief appealed to urban dwellers to avoid going to the villages. If Covid-19 gets to rural areas, it will spread like wildfire and drunks will be especially vulnerable, he said. Nakuru has reported five cases, at least two have been discharged. About 20 people in quarantine have been discharged. The county has made preparations with isolation beds and purchased protective gear for medical staff. The number of confirmed cases in Kenya has risen to 336. (Edited by V. Graham)
