Mbaitu FM presenter James Malombe, 36, is sickly and requires financial support to get the lifesaving medical attention he urgently requires. The Ukambani king of the airwaves, popularly known to his fans as 'Musungu Kyumbe' (the real white man) due to albinism, has been diagnosed with kidney failure. Malombe has already been put on renal dialysis twice weekly at the Kenyatta National Hospital since mid this month. He depends on the support of fans, friends and other well-wishers to see him through the costly treatment. Speaking to Word Is, the journalist said he had initially been admitted at KNH  with a blood clot and high blood pleasure. This was after he was involved in an accident in Katangi on the Machakos-Kitui road as he drove home on March 7. A week after the accident, and after being treated for minor injuries at a Katangi hospital and discharged, Malombe developed difficulties in walking. He had to be supported to walk about, he said. “I then visited KNH and was admitted for a check-up, and the medics established that I had suffered kidney failure,” said Malombe, who is currently on indefinite sick leave. He said the treatment has accumulated a huge bill so far and it is soaring. “I am appealing to all big-hearted individuals to help raise the money to cater for the high medical cost,” he said. Support may be sent to Mpesa pay bill, business number 400200 and account number 01109553840500, or direct Mpesa payment to 0728587358.
