Transport operators in Uasin Gishu risk a total ban should they continue disregarding directives to contain coronavirus pandemic, Governor Jackson Mandago has said. Mandago told matatu and boba boda operators to ensure social distancing or risk ban until the coronavirus pandemic is over. “We asked our boda boda riders to observe sanitation rules and carry only one passenger but I am sad that they have largely ignored this call," Governor Jackson Mandago said. "I am therefore giving the last warning. Follow these rules or risk a total ban," Mandago said. He asked the operators to learn from Italy, where people ignored calls for social distancing and are now among the worst-hit countries by the Covid-19 pandemic in the world. The governor thanked the majority of matatu operators who have implemented the rules, but said those flaunting rules will have their vehicles seized until the pandemic is over. He told residents to adhere to curfew rules or risk being taken to quarantine at their cost. “I am putting all administrators on notice that they shall be considered to be abating crime should residents in their jurisdictions ignore rules set to help curb the spread of coronavirus in the country,”  he said. Mandago also put on notice those operating illegal bars and illicit brew dens, especially in the rural areas, saying that they will face the law.  Edited by E.Kibii
