Gospel singer Bahati has shut down his record label EMB and unveiled a new recording studio. Speaking on his YouTube channel, Bahati said the decision is as a result of frustrations in the gospel industry. "Most gospel artistes have been so jealous of my success," he said. "Some felt like the artistes I was signing are the ones who were making money for me." Bahati said his main purpose of opening the label was to support artistes and that EMB has never been a business. "I wanted to help someone to be successful so that some day they will be in a position to support themselves, but unfortunately, people have misunderstood that," he said. He said most of the artistes he took in were later used by other gospel artistes to bring him down. "After a successful four years in Kenya, I have become one of the most talked-about artistes, with the highest hate from people," he said. "Hate is not bad but what is the need of me receiving hate for other artistes who I'm helping from scratch?" Closing down the record label means that he will have to terminate all the contracts with the artistes he has signed. "That is Weezdom, Denno and other new artistes I was to support this year," he said. Eastland's Most Beloved (EMB) Records has been at the centre of drama for the past several months. Almost all artistes who have been signed under the label, as well as employees, have left the label at some point, in what ends up being a messy affair with back-and-forth accusations in the media. Bahati then called out gospel artistes for living a fake life and failing to support even those in need. "Wickedness is what is eating the industry and let this gets to the fathers of the industry if they are there. The industry is not doing good," he said.
