Two married men fought each other to death in Oljorai in Gilgil over a woman they were both seeing secretly. A witness said neither man knew about the other until Wednesday morning when one found the other having breakfast in the woman's house. “The two went for each other using pangas inflicting deep wounds as members of the public screamed for help,” Alex Kirchir, a witness, said. Kirchir said that at one point the two who were bleeding profusely due to the injuries collapsed on each other before members of the public came to their rescue. One of the men who had a deep cut on his neck and died on the spot while the other was confirmed dead on arrival at a nearby health centre. Relatives and friends of the two cattle traders aged over 40 years are yet to come to terms with the incident. Gilgil subcounty commissioner Ndambuki Mutheki said that police had moved in to investigate the matter. He termed the incident as odd adding that the investigating officers were seeking the woman at the centre of the incident. “We had an incident in which two men attacked and killed each other over a woman in Oljorai area and the bodies have since been collected,” he said. Meanwhile, a group of illegal fishermen in Lake Naivasha escaped death narrowly after they were attacked by a hippo near Karuturi farm. This is the same place that a bloat of hippos attacked another group last week killing two of them in two different incidents. In the latest incident, two of the illegal fishermen escaped with minor injuries after managing to swim to safety. According to David Kilo from Lake Naivasha boat owners association, attack cases involving the hippos were on the rise. “We are asking KWS to intervene as the hippos attacks are rising by the day putting to risk even tourists visiting the lake,” he said.
