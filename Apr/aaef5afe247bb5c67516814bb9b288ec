Nurses in Vihiga county are on strike to demand overdue March salaries. The strike will compromise the preparation and measures put in place to fight the coronavirus outbreak. Through their union, the health workers said it is difficult to serve residents when their bosses are not ready to pay their salaries on time. Kenya National Union of Nurses Vihiga branch chairman Zadock Miheso said medics were unable to travel to work and pay rent. “We can’t even afford food. We have kids at home and they need to eat. We are asking the Vihiga leadership to tell us where is the problem,” Miheso said. Vihiga Deputy Governor Patrick Saisi appealed to the health workers to resume their duties. Saisi said that they have already received money and payments are being made. “If you love your county, please come back on duty as we factor your payments. As from Monday, you will be receiving your salaries,” Saisi said. The deputy governor said they have had problems with the Controller of Budget due to pending bills. The medics began a salary parade last Wednesday to get the attention of the Vihiga government. “Because the government has issued regulations suspending public gatherings due to coronavirus, we will not breach that by going to streets but we shall remain indoors until our cry is heard,” Miheso said. Union officials said an agreement with the county for timely salary payments had been broken by county officials. A source said the delays were messing with their loan repayment plans. “We are demanding for March salary which will be paid in April so the bank will slash off their dues for March and then April. What I will have in my account will be negative,” the source said. (edited by o. owino)
