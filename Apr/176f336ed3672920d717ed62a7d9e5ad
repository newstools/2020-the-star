Recruitment firm BrighterMonday Kenya has launched an initiative that offers free job listing services for individuals or companies seeking to hire as the country battles coronavirus. Dubbed, Unity In Adversity, the campaign seeks to boost the continuity of businesses efforts by enabling organisations to recruit the right people to steer them during and beyond the current challenging times. “For the next 90 days, we will give organisations seeking to recruit professionals  countrywide free job listings on our website as a response to the current challenging business conditions brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Emmanuel Mutuma, Chief Executive Officer, BrighterMonday Kenya. This comes days after the government issued a directive to recruit at least 5,000 health workers across the country. Hospitals are also expected to hire an additional 1000 in the coming days. “The initiative will enable county hospitals, healthcare facilities and other essential services providers to hire qualified candidates in the shortest time possible,” said Mutuma. Under the initiative, employers will be able to fast track the recruitment process with some of BrighterMonday’s innovative products like the firm’s newly launched proficiency Assessment Tool that tests a candidate’s core competencies and hard skills required for a specific role beyond what is captured on their CVs during the hiring process. Additionally, hiring managers will be able to view a candidate's scores alongside other filters like education and experience levels with the use of BrighterMonday’s Applicant Tracking System
