@robertomollo3 Catholics solemnly observed Good Friday at home and there were no Stations of the Cross processions to mark the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. In the past, believers conducted the adoration and exaltation of the cross to remember the suffering of Jesus Christ. Many go home early from work to reflect. Many do not eat meat. There is no mass on Good Friday though there used be to services and Holy Communion. St Paul’s Homa Bay Catholic Church, which is the diocese of South Nyanza, was silent. Streets where Catholics usually conducted processions were also empty because of the government ban on gatherings to stop the spread of coronavirus. Father Francis Leso who is in charge of the cathedral, and his assistant Romanus Ageng’a prayed privately. The cathedral has three priests, three brothers and six sisters who all live within church. “We also encourage our faithful to pray as they stay at home to stop the spread of coronavirus. We prayed here because we all live in the church," Leso said. Speaking to journalists at the church on Friday, the clergy said they hope to conduct the carrying and adoration of the cross should the pandemic end by September. “The situation has disappointed many believers. But we pray it ends so we continue serving God as before,” he added. “Pray at home and stay safe. This is not only happening in Kenya but across the world. Let’s close our doors against the spread of Corid-19 but open our hearts God,” Fr Leso said. Ageng’a told believers to obey government orders to avoid possible transmission of the coronavirus. “Stay at home and maintain social distance. Maintain personal hygiene to beat the virus,” Ageng’a said. (Edited by V. Graham)
