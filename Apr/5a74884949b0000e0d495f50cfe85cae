The National Police Service has contributed Sh650,000 to the coronavirus fund but also asked for allowances for its police officers. “All the commissioners in the National Police Service Commission, including the IG, the NPS and the DIGs have made a voluntary personal contribution of Sh650,000 towards the Covid-19 Fund,” NPSC chairman Eliud Kinuthia said. He spoke during a press briefing at the commission offices in Westlands on Wednesday. “The commission appeals to all police officers and civilian staff to voluntarily join the commissioners in making individual donations,” he said. At the same time, Kinuthia said the commission had reached out to the Salaries and Remuneration Commission to have all officers “considered for uniform extraneous allowance for all ranks and additional responsibility allowance for commanders commencing March 2020 up to the appropriate time when the country returns to normal enforcement of law and order”. The allowance discussions are being held in collaboration with the National Development Implementation and Communication. The commission has appealed for allowances at a time when many workers are taking pay cuts. “As the employer, we have a duty to ensure all our employees enjoy a safe work environment, motivation and are continuously committed to the delivery of services with the utmost exercise of police discipline,” he said. He said the coronavirus work environment has put the police at a greater risk. Kinuthia added that the commission had initiated a proposal to have police officers supplied with personal protective equipment in the temporary roadblocks and operations units to protect them from the risk of contracting the virus.
