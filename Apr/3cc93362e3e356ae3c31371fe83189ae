The  Kenya Cup caucus has formally written to the Kenya Rugby Union (KRU) Judicial Appeals Committee to have the decision to cancel the 2019-2020 season rescinded. Following a conference call with 11 other clubs yesterday, the caucus said they opted for the move after their ultimatum to KRU last week fell on deaf ears. Caucus’ chairman Xavier Makuba said in accordance to KRU regulations, the appeal should be heard and determined within the next seven days. Rugby legend Edward Rombo, former Quins player and chairman Paul Nyamodi and Charles Hinga are among members that sit in the Judicial Appeals Committee. Makuba expressed confidence that the Appeals Committee will make a favourable ruling not only to the Kenya Cup clubs but also to clubs in the Nationwide and Championship. “I am strongly convinced beyond reasonable doubt that we have a solid case and the appeals tribunal will rule in our favour,” noted Makuba. The KCB chairman said clubs had invested heavily in the clubs and there should be a better way of handling things rather than cancelling the season. “I want to reiterate what I said last week. The union should have at a bare minimum, consulted with us and then postponed the season like what other big sporting events are doing. I still believe there is time to finish the season in good time and then we can start our Sevens circuit,” he added. Last week, the KRU received an appeal from the Nationwide and Championship clubs which will be heard by the fixtures committee before it is heard and determined by the board. A fortnight ago, KRU cancelled the entire 2019-2020 season due to the coronavirus pandemic. The cancellation means that there will be no relegation/promotion with all results this season declared invalid. The Kenya Cup, Championship and Nationwide leagues were all entering the playoff stage.
