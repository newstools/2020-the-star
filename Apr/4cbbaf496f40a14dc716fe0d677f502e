An MP wants the government to set aside Sh100 billion to help Kenyans living on less than two dollars a day. Thika Town MP Patrick Wainaina said the effects of the coronavirus outbreak has seriously affected millions of Kenyans living from hand to mouth who are finding it hard to put food on the table. The MP said each vulnerable household should receive Sh1,000 every week to enable them to meet basic needs. The first-time MP said the government stipend should run for three months to enable the majority to comply with the stringent measures put in place by the government to curb the spread of the Covid-19. “It is time the government must come up with a strategy to ensure the poor who cannot afford a meal are supported even as we battle the coronavirus,” Wainaina said. He lauded President Uhuru Kenyatta for reducing VAT and corporate tax but noted the same might not benefit the majority of Kenyans because of job losses. The MP also urged the Kenyan government to move with speed and address the plight of desperate Kenyans stranded in China. He urged Uhuru to engage his Chinese counterpart to ensure an immediate stop to any harassment of Kenyans and other African nationalities. “Most of them are either holed up in motels and those who cannot afford are in the streets. Worse still, even those with money are being denied essential services, which include buying food from a supermarket,” he said. “The Kenyan government should urgently provide a plane to airlift all Kenyans willing to come back home. It is their right. We need also to revisit all their visas and deport all who are here illegally or doing jobs that Kenyans can do.” Edited by R.Wamochie
