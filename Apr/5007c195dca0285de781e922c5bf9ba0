Nairobians are generally haughty and cynical about instructions put out by the government. Nothing illustrates this perilous attitude than the reckless group of eight people who decided to play Russian roulette with the lives of relatives and friends. In their detestable mischief, they decided to hire a vehicle and a coffin and set off for a trip to Homa Bay under the guise of dashing for a funeral. This in the face of overwhelming evidence in Kenya and the world that the coronavirus kills and spreads like bush fire. They must have felt very happy with themselves with each police roadblock they passed. But thanks to village folk aware of the danger visitors from Nairobi pose in light of the pandemic, the group was rounded up and quarantined. And to illustrate their folly, their driver has been tested and found coronavirus positive. Their misadventure must be a lesson to thousands of others. But the whole ruse could not have gone on without the help of hospital staff who handed out the paperwork that helped this group to beat the Nairobi lockdown. Whoever played part in this drama must be arrested and charged. We congratulate the Homa Bay villagers and Governor Cyprian Awiti for acting fast and exposing the fake funeral party. We call on the police manning roadblocks into and out of Nairobi, Mombasa, Kwale and Kilifi to up their game and help save lives. Nairobi is the epicentre of the virus in Kenya, let's obey the stay-at-home directive.
