Kenya Hockey Union (KHU) are likely to revert to a one-legged Premier League owing to the current coronavirus threat. According to sources, the governing body is planning to introduce playoffs with top four teams after the first leg battling for the trophy should the coronavirus situation persist beyond May. Butali Warriors captain Kennedy Nyongesa said his charges are well equipped and ready for any decision by KHU with the focus on since retaining the title remains as their sole objective. Butali won the title last season after an unbeaten run. “The union face a real test should the situation persist. Playing one leg and the top four teams meeting in play-off kind of format to decide the winner would be a possibility. It is something we are used to because it was there previously. Though I cannot speak for other clubs, we will go by any decision by KHU in regards to the league,” said the defensive maestro. “The only irony is that teams will require more time to regain fitness and this further complicating matters,” observed the former international. The Strathmore University Gladiators captain Paul Omariba, who is now at Butali said it will be a herculean task to recover the lost time. “We are supposed to have two legs but it will be impossible considering we have lost almost two months and we are still not sure when the situation will normalise. Any ruling will be adhered to in the best interest of the sport,” Omariba hinted. The KHU league was expected to end before November. Deputy match and fixture secretary Moses Majiwa assured KHU’s decision will be free and fair once normalcy returns. “The league commenced on February 29 and was to end on October 31. It will be virtually impossible if this situation goes beyond June,” he noted.
