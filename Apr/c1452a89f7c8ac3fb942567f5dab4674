Kericho County Governor Paul Chepkwony has directed mandatory screening of persons entering or leaving the county. The screening which the governor said is a precautionary measure to arrest possible cases of Covid-19 will be conducted at five major entry points in the South Rift county, a major route to Western part of Kenya. “Our teams will be stationed at Kipsitet (Kericho-Kisumu highway), Roret (Kericho-Kisii highway), Daraja Sita (Kericho-Bomet highway), Londiani (Nakuru-Kericho/ Kericho-Eldoret highways) and Sondu," He said in a statement. He added that "This exercise will target those going through these points to detect any persons with symptoms associated with the Coronavirus disease for appropriate follow-up action." The exercise started on Friday and the governor said the screening will be conducted by county officials from the department of health who will be accompanied by police officers. Besides the locals and those on transit being screened, the governor has also directed the county officials to check to passenger manifests to ensure that Public Service Vehicles are maintaining the correct records of passengers as directed by the national government. “This is intended to ease the process of contact tracing should such a need arise. I call upon everyone who will be involved in this exercise to fully cooperate with our officers to support all efforts to curb the spread of the Coronavirus disease in Kenya,” he said. The governor said medical officers will continue with surveillance across the vast county and also carrying out public awareness campaigns. He also said that his administration is doing all it can to protect the residents. “I urge everyone to continue adhering to the already provided precautionary measures to continue protecting themselves and others from this virus,” he said.
