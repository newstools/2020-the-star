The High Court has temporarily barred retired Judge Erastus Githinji from assuming office as chairperson of the Tax Appeals Tribunal. Justice Hellen Wasilwa on Wednesday stopped his swearing-in until the case filed in court by a lobby group is heard and determined. Chama Cha Mawakili had moved to court seeking to bar the retired judge from being sworn into office. They argued that Treasury CS Ukur Yatani did not follow the laid down procedures when he appointed him for the position. Earlier this month, the Law Society of Kenya also wrote to the CS wanting Githinji's appointment revoked. In a protest letter to Yatani, LSK president Nelson Havi said the appointment was unlawful as the judge does not qualify on account of his age. Havi wanted the CS should commence a competitive recruitment process failure to which, the matter would attract a lawsuit. Section 4 (3) of the TATA requires that the chairperson be a person qualified to be appointed as a judge of the High Court. Githinji is a retired judge of the High Court. According to Havi, the specialised nature of TAT would require that an advocate with academic and professional qualifications and experience in tax law and procedure be appointed. He says there is no shortage of such advocates in the membership of the LSK and such an appointment ought to have been done competitively. Githinji was born on December 30, 1949. He was appointed a judge in May 1987 and a judge of the Court of Appeal in June 2003. In a Gazette notice dated April 15, the CS appointed him to the position for a period of five years.
