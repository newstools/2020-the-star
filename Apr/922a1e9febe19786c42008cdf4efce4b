A nun has lamented rape and other injustices meted out to persons living with physical and mental disabilities. Sister Winfred Nkanya of Nazareth Sisters, who works at Jesus Mary and Joseph Rehabilitation Centre, spoke when donating foodstuffs to hunger-stricken families in Tigania West. She was in the company of Athwana MCA Victor Karithi. They distributed maize, maize flour, beans, oils, flour, soaps, sanitiser and other Covid-19 protective gear to people living with disability and the less fortunate. Nkanya said the families suffer rape, abuse and related insecurities. “They are not at their homes as you can see. Some are chained while others are locked in their houses to avoid being raped," she said. "Three months ago, we had a mentally challenged girl who gave birth. It was not possible for her to get justice because chiefs cover up such crimes. "God loves them and we are here to enlighten them of the pandemic. I ask county and national governments to get a home for PWDs." Karithi said many foreign donors are no longer available to provide for needy homes because of the coronavirus outbreak. He said the families, some living along the Isiolo-Meru border, are forgotten and have no one to provide for them because they are constrained by their physical or mental illnesses. Nkanya said PWDs are the worst affected as they still face stigma from the community. She appealed to Meru and Isiolo governments to map out and register such families for stipends and other provisions. “We have big trouble. These families do not have water in their homes, no electricity, food, radio, or TV to get daily updates or know exactly what is happening in the world. They need more aid, not only from well-wishers but the government too,” she said. She said the strategy is to reduce the burden for the families and help them continue with their daily lives despite the setbacks. Edited by R.Wamochie
