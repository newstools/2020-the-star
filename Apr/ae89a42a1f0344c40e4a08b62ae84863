Taita Taveta has begun the fumigation of major towns and markets to tame the spread of coronavirus. Also targeted are prisons, bus parks, matatus, taxis, boda bodas and tuk tuks. Presiding over the launch at Voi bus park, Governor Granton Samboja said his government is committed to ensuring the safety of everyone. "This exercise is one of the measures we have put in place to overcome this disease," Samboja said. Over 35 youths have been trained and shall carry out fumigation in collaboration with officials from the department of Health services. Samboja urged residents to adhere to the government's directive by putting on face masks while using public transport and when visiting public places. "Let us continue washing our hands, sanitising and keeping social distance," he said. He directed boda boda riders to carry only one passenger and warned that those found flouting the directive will be arrested. Earlier, Samboja had ordered the closure of all salons and barbershops from Monday to curb the coronavirus spread. Three of Taita Taveta's neighbouring counties including Kilifi, Kwale and Kajiado, have confirmed cases of Covid-19. The county also neighbours Tanzania, that has also confirmed cases of the disease. Samboja asked his counterparts under the Jumuiya ya Kaunti Za Pwani to impose similar measures to reduce chances of the virus spread. The county has also started a mandatory screening at the county's entry points. All passengers using the Mombasa-Nairobi highway will be screened at Voi junction, Miasenyi and Manyani while those entering through Loitoktok will be screened at Njukini. Mandatory screening has been ongoing for all people visiting hospitals. Health Services executive John Mwakima said the county has set up two isolation units with a 10-bed capacity in Voi and Taveta. He said disease surveillance and rapid response teams are identifying more isolation and quarantine centres in schools and colleges. (edited by o. owino)
