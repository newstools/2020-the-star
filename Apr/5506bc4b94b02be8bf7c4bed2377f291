Early this year, Tanasha Donna launched her debut EP 'DonnaTella'. Diamond Platnumz and Mbosso were to perform at the event. The two only came for the press conference but left that night. Mbosso in an interview with Sam Misago last week said their management asked them to return to Tanzania with immediate effect. "I remember we went to Nairobi, there was a show we were supposed to do and it didn't happen. We came back," he said. "I was told I had to go back to Dar es Salaam with immediate effect. There were things that were not right. Who am I to argue with manager Babu Tale, Sallam and Mkubwa Fella? "I went back home with my brother, Diamond. We were even seated next to each other. That's when I started writing the script to my 'Tamba' song."
