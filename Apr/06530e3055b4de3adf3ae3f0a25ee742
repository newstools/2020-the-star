Bura MP Ali Wario has asked the government to provide for street families as part of measures to cushion wananchi from the effects of coronavirus. Wario on Wednesday said street families are vulnerable to Covid-19 and asked the state through the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare to assist them. The MP, who chairs the National Assembly's Committee on Labour and Social Welfare, said the ministry was allocated Sh10 billion in the last budget "but nothing so far has been set aside for street families." “I am so disturbed that there are no programmes and other intervention measures for street families. They have no roof over their heads and at this time of the coronavirus pandemic, they also need to be protected like the rest of Kenyans,” Wario said. He spoke in Madogo town. “I have seen nothing so far towards this end. The ministry should move with speed to ensure this vulnerable group receives the necessary assistance.” The lawmaker said the committee will continue to put pressure on the ministry until such a time the MPs are satisfied with the intervention measures to protect the street families. The MP also appealed to the government and other well-wishers to provide relief food to hundreds of families displaced by floods in Tana River and Garissa counties. He said the families had heeded government advice to move to higher grounds and should be supported. “Some families are camping by the roadside and have not received any food assistance so far. There are no toilets, running water and other basic hygiene services in these camps. With the threat of coronavirus, these victims are at risk of contracting this deadly disease,” Wario said. “I want to appeal to the ministry of devolution and other aid agencies to urgently airlift relief food to these families who are suffering. Some have no tents and are spending nights in the cold with their children and the elderly.”  Edited by Peter Obuya
