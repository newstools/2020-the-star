Rarieda MP Otiende Amollo has donated maize in all 23 sub-locations of his constituency in a bid to contain hunger caused by measures to contain Covid-19. "This is in mitigation for the most vulnerable in Rarieda - the elderly, orphans, ondoanyasi widows, the needy and those with disabilities," he said. Via Twitter on Friday, Amollo said the exercise cost Sh1.1 million. "It was done in conjunction with DCC, chiefs and assistant chiefs," he said. The donations are meant to cushion the families from the economic effects of the countrywide dusk-to-dawn curfew. Amollo thanked Siaya Senator James Orengo for donating 230 litres of sanitiser. The dusk to dawn curfew began on March 27. All Kenyans, apart from those listed under critical and essential services, are required to be indoors by 7pm. But cases of police brutality have marred the curfew with at least two dead from wounds inflicted by security officers at the Coast and in Nairobi.
