Muslim clerics in Lamu have urged the government to adjust curfew hours during the holy month of Ramadhan. Many Muslims in the county commenced the 30-day fast on Saturday. Their plea comes after President Uhuru Kenyatta announced the extension of the dusk-to-dawn curfew for another 21 days. The curfew starts at exactly 7pm and ends at 5am. Speaking in Lamu town on Monday, the clerics led by Mohamed Abdulkadir proposed that the curfew should start from 9pm and end at 5am to allow Muslims to pray in mosques. Abdulkadir, who chairs the Coast Interfaith Council of Clerics, said the same will also allow traders to cook and sell to faithful who break the fast in the evenings. “Let it be clear that this doesn’t in any way mean we will stop observing all Covid-19 guidelines. The only problem is that the curfew is greatly hampering and interfering with our Ramadhan schedule as most prayers happen at night,” he said. Another cleric, Mohamed Mwalimu, urged the government to allow small groups of people into mosques for prayers during Ramadhan as long as they observe social distancing. He said clerics are willing to prepare rotational prayer shifts to ensure only small groups of people go into mosques. “We respect the curfew. But let them also allow us to make special arrangements for prayers in mosques,” Mwalimu said. The clerics called on Muslims across the country and the globe to pray to Allah to defeat the coronavirus. Edited by R.Wamochie
