Kesses MP Swarup Mishra has called for total lockdown in  regions  that   have recorded the highest  number of  coronavirus cases. He said lockdown will help curb the spread of Covid-19 that has hit the entire world. Mishara addressed the press in Eldoret  on Sunday  after flagging off food supplies to the elderly  worth Sh40 million. The relief targeted over  12,000 vulnerable households. Following the government's strict movement restrictions, the MP urged  the government to support the elderly so they do not die  of hunger . ''We are distributing the food  door to door  to the  entire constituency to the elderly who are 60 years and the needy who have no food to eat,"  he said. Eldoret business man Joseph Wainaina said it was good to work together and carry out sensitisation to the grassroots level. Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago warned public transport operators to follow the rules of social distancing or risk penalties. “We asked our boda boda operators to observe sanitation rules and carry only one passenger but I am saddened that they have largely ignored this call. I am therefore giving a last warning to them to follow these rules or risk a total ban,” Mandago said. He asked transport operators to learn from Italy where people ignored the call for social distancing and ended up pictured throwing out money in the streets because it was not helpful.
