A team of pastors from Budalang'i is to begin a drive to sensitise the public on measures to stop the spread of the coronavirus. Led by William Musumba of Seed of Abraham Christian Centre in Ruambwa and Salvation of Spirit Ministry's Patrick Ojanji, the team said they want to support efforts by county and national governments. Speaking to the Star on Sunday, the pastors said they plan to reach residents of Bunyala South, Bunyala West, Bunyala Central and Bunyala North in three weeks. “As pastors from churches in Bunyala subcounty, we have resolved to go to the grassroots and sensitise the public on the coronavirus,” Musumba said. Musumba said they will emphasise the need to strictly follow the directives of the Ministry of Health to contain the spread of the virus. The clerics said they will extend their outreach programme to the neighbouring Samia subcounty in Funyula constituency. Ojanji called on their counterparts from five other subcounties namely Matayos, Butula, Nambale, Teso South and Teso North to follow suit. “Fellow pastors from the remaining five subcounties should take this up to ensure the public is well informed,” Ojanji said.
