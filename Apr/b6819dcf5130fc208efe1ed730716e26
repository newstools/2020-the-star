Willy Paul has finally responded to fellow artiste Ringtone for always criticising him, claiming his music is not gospel. In the past, Ringtone has publicly come out to denounce Poze as not fit for the gospel industry. He said there is a certain standard that gospel musicians have to uphold, seemingly assuming the role of determining that standard. Ringtone has many times called out Willy Paul, saying he feels Willy Paul has disrespected Christians. It all started when Willy Paul dropped a song featuring Nandy from Tanzania, 'Halleluja'. In a scathing post on Instagram, Ringtone went hard on Willy Paul. "So Willy Paul today I just want to address you over your song because I feel that you have disrespected our God," he wrote. "Willy Paul, Nandy is not your wife. You’re touching her private parts, she is twerking at you and you’re saying hallelujah." He also claimed that Nandy aborted Willy Paul’s baby. Ringtone claimed the story originated from Willy Paul. In another instance, he shared a photo of a shirtless Willy Paul and branded him a dark force in the gospel industry. This time, he has again called out Willy Paul for his new song with Nadia Mukami, 'Nikune'. In a video, Ringtone says he is angry with the singer because of the type of songs he has been doing. "Christians are not happy with you, what are these you are singing?" he said. Willy Paul has always avoided the question about the numerous time's Ringtone has called him out. He said he is not ready to entertain idlers, as he is fully focused on making good music with no time to consume negativity from critics. On Instagram today, he warned Ringtone against using his name. "The faact that nimetulia isifanye uone kama mimi ni your fellow woman! Bloody leave Nadia Mukami out of this, concentrate on your music," he said.
