Nyamira Governor John Nyagarama has reconstituted his executive committee nearly six months after he dissolved it on October 1, last year. The county executive committee member's contracts had expired. The governor appointed five new executives and reappointed five who served in the previous regime. Those not considered for reappointment are Johnstone Obike, Gladys Momanyi, Samuel Maiko and Peris Mongare. The county chief reappointed John Omanwa to the Roads, Transport, Disaster Management and Public Works. Omanwa will also act as the Agriculture and Fisheries executive. Douglas Bosire continues as the Health Service Executive. He will also serve as the acting executive for Water and Energy. Bernard Osumu retains the Public Service Management docket and will also act in the Education department. Peter Muga Omwanza remains as the Finance and Economic Planning executive and will also serve in acting capacity in the Trade department. Zablon Onchiri was reappointed as the Housing, Lands and Physical Planning executive. He will act in the Youth department until a substantive executive is vetted and sworn in. The five will not undergo fresh vetting in the assembly. The new nominees will, however, be vetted. Shem Kiage is the nominee for Environment, Water and Natural Resources while Stella Omari will handle Trade, Tourism and Cooperatives Department. Stella Nyamorambo has been nominated CEC for Gender, Youth, Sports, Culture and Social Services. Samson Barongo was nominated to head the department of Education and Vocational Training while Pauline Kerubo Oyugi to oversee Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries. Nyagarama praised previous officeholders for a job well done in spearheading his flagship projects. He wished those not considered for reappointment well in their future endeavours.
