Kenya Handball Federation (KHF) western branch secretary Akaka Shisoka wants proper procedures initiated in order to deliver free and fair elections following the ruling by Sports Disputes Tribunal asking them to hold polls. Shisoka, who is a KHF presidential candidate, accused individuals in the federation of malice aimed at locking him out. “I’m not against the elections in any way as long as the process is democratic. I only want the due process followed," he noted. He said he also wants an independent body to be put in place to oversee the elections in accordance with the Sports Act—something the federation has been reluctant to do for quite a long time. “This is what has delayed the elections and not me as it is being alleged. In other words, the federation has failed to meet the standards and requirements set out by the government and this has seen them extend their stay in the office illegally since 2017,” Shisoka reiterated. He said he is against the same incumbent organising and overseeing elections in which they are also participants.  “The federation's constitution  must be amended to conform to the Sports Act 2013 and the Kenya Constitution 2010, which are both  clear on what is required to comply,” he said Shisoka also wants the stakeholders’ meeting called before the elections to agree on several pertinent issues including the irreducible minimum requirements to enable the process to take off on a level playfield. Shisoka moved to the SDT seeking to stop the June 30, 2018 exercise. His prayers to the SDT were to have the counties system adopted in line with the 2013 Sports Act as opposed to the branches system. The current eight branches include Nairobi, Western, Coast, Rift Valley, Central, Eastern, Armed Forces and Nyanza. The federation has never held elections since 2013 but with the ruling by the STD,  various candidates are already preparing to contest for various seats later this year.
