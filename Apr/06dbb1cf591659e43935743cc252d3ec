Ten suspects linked to the murder of two boda boda riders in Kisumu will take plea this week. The suspects George Olwanda, Lawrence Omondi, Michael Otieno, Kevin Otieno, Jerim Otieno, Evans Ochieng, George Onyango, Stephen Omondi, Stephen Onyango and Shaban Shida were arrested last week. They are suspected of being members of an illegal community-based organisation that has been terrorising residents and boda boda operators in the disguise of providing security. They have also been accused of purporting to enforce executive orders on daily curfews with a focus on boda boda operators carrying more than one passenger. The suspects were last week detained for 10 days by a Kisumu court after the prosecution asked senior resident magistrate Fatuma Rashid for more time to complete investigations. The prosecution had asked for 20 days to detain the suspects but the accused pleaded with the court to reduce their period of detention arguing that they were at risk of contracting the coronavirus in the cells at Kondele police station. In an affidavit, detectives said they are still investigating and have scheduled an identification parade. The officer noted that members of the public might take the law into their own hands if the suspects are released. A week ago, chaos erupted in the town following the killing of two boda boda operators. This move led to the disbandment of all boda boda associations by Governor Anyang Nyong’o’s administration.
