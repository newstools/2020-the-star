Police shot and injured two people during a demonstration by Lumakanda residents in Lubari subcounty, Kakamega, on Friday evening. The two were admitted at Lumakanda subcounty hospital with bullet wounds on the head. The residents were protesting against what they termed as constant harassment by officers who demand bribes from them. Demonstrations violate the social distancing health order by the government to prevent Covid-19 spread. The demonstrators chanted anti-police slogans and engaged officers in running battles. In response the officers lobbed teargas canisters and used live bullets on them. The angry residents claimed some police officers used a gang of youths to harass them, sometimes extorting them. They named the youths in their memorandum. The residents presented their complaints to Lugari deputy county commissioner William Lenaremo. While a meeting between the residents and the administrator was going on, police engaged them in running battles and lobbed teargas canisters to disperse them. Lenaremo appealed for calm and promised investigations into the incident. “I want to tell you we are not going to leave any stone unturned. I have handed the list to the DCI to commence investigation and I assure you that the law will take its course,” Lenaremo said. Edited by Henry Makori
