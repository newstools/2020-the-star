A Busia man who attacked his neighbour's cow for loitering in his compound has been lynched by fellow villagers. Alex Papa is said to have cut off the tail of the animal, which was grazing in his compound. He was cornered as he attempted to run into hiding after the cow's owner raised the alarm. The killing took place at 4pm on Sunday. Kakurikit senior chief Jim Karani told the Star that police officers who picked the body from Kaejo village in Katotoi sublocation have begun investigations. By Monday morning, no one had been arrested. “The matter has been taken up by officers from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations,” Karani said on the phone. “We are also trying to find out if the neighbours had a grudge against him because ordinarily injuring a cow should not attract such a punishment.” Some witnesses have intimated that the villagers who lynched Papa might have been harbouring a grudge against him.
