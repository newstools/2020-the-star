President Uhuru Kenyatta has listed miraa trade as one of the activities permitted during the 21-day containment period. Uhuru said movement of cargo trucks and transportation of food supplies, including miraa, will continue despite measures to stop the spread of coronavirus. “A cargo truck will have a designated driver and assistants and who are assigned by the truck operator or owner,” he said on Monday. Before the President's directive, Garissa Governor Ali Korane and his colleagues in Wajir and Mandera had banned the sale and transportation of miraa, saying the stimulant would facilitate the spread of coronavirus. The ban was met with resistance from traders and consumers, who complained that the decision was made without consultation and yet miraa is their source of livelihood. Speaking to the press in Garissa town, Korane, when asked about the latest order, said Uhuru's directive overrides his own. “As you are aware we had banned the transportation and sale of the substance. I want to assume that we will take the position of the President. Now that in his own wisdom he has given the go-ahead of its sale, we have no choice but to abide by it,” he said. “However, we shall closely monitor the way miraa is packed, transported and distributed to ensure hygiene standard are observed.” Some of the traders welcomed Uhuru's directive and said the last few days were tough for them. “We thank the President for recognising miraa as a cash crop. The last two weeks have been like hell on earth, with police officers and county officials harassing us,” said one of the traders, Amina Mohamed. Korane urged residents to heed to the preventive measures such as social distancing, frequent handwashing and avoiding crowded places. “We will invest in setting up more handwashing facilities in all sub-counties and distribution of masks to the public,” he said.
