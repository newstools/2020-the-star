Health CS Mutahi Kagwe has ordered passengers in matatus and tuk tuks to wear a face mask to contain the spread of Covid-19. "...all tuk tuk drivers, matatu drivers and passengers should begin wearing masks. We will distribute them," Kagwe said. He also announced 29 new coronavirus cases, bringing the total number of infections to 110 patients. "This number I must say is going to rise and rise exponentially. It is important to note that the virus does not move by itself..we must change our behaviours and attitude..," he said. Addressing the media on Thursday, Kagwe said had the government not put people in quarantine, they could have infected others. "Even when you are in Nairobi, unless there is something that you are doing, stay at home. It is important for that you start training yourself to do so," he said. Kagwe further noted that there will be no travelling upcountry  to curb the spread of Covid-19. "Those who planned to travel for Easter... don't. Even when you are in Nairobi, unless there is something that you are doing, stay at home. It is important for us to start training yourself to do so," he said. On March 30, boda boda operators were ordered to wear face masks amid efforts to contain the spread of Covid-19. Kagwe said the move is among the new intervention measures being put in place to allow continuity of livelihoods. He said the current trend of spread of the Covid-19 has been established to be through community transmission and not imported.
