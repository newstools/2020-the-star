On Monday, President Uhuru Kenyatta announced a serious lockdown for three weeks for Nairobi metropolitan area, Mombasa, Kwale and Kilifi. Many Kenyans feel frustrated and powerless before the economic and social dislocation being caused by the coronavirus. But they should remember that it is possible to protect yourself against coronavirus. You catch Covid-19 by getting the virus on your hands and then touching your face. If you keep your hands clean and don't touch your face, you are extremely unlikely to catch Covid-19. The President rightly asked all Kenyans to wear masks when they are outside. The biggest protection provided by masks ( or bandanas or other face coverings) is that they stop your hands touching your mouth or nose, and hopefully remind you not to rub your eyes. The President started his speech by asking Kenyans to wash their hands regularly and to wear masks whenever they are outside. If we follow those simple requirements and also cooperate with the curfew and the lockdown, we can confidently expect the virus to be isolated and controlled in the next three weeks.
