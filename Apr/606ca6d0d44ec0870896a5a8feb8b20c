Education Cabinet Secretary George Magoha has ruled out the postponement of national examinations for now. The CS said on Monday that the current Covid-19 situation in Kenya has not necessitated the postponement. He, however, said that the government is preparing for all possible scenarios in case the situation gets worse than it is at the moment. "We have still not reached the stage where we are saying we are going to postpone this or we are going to postpone that. Don't put words into our mouths," Magoha added. The CS has also added that his ministry has been working in the backroom and will come up with all possible scenarios. This came as the country reported new cases of Covid-19 bringing the total to 208. However, the number of active cases went down to 159 after 15 more people recovered and one died from the virus. Magoha said it will be hard to tell when children will resume their classes as it will depend on the situation which he said will be advised by the Ministry of Health. The CS noted that the government is putting in measures to ensure that students are accessing online education. Magoha said that more children are studying through online platforms that have been put in place by the ministry. "We are working on various modalities to ensure students have access to online education," Magoha said. He said that schools had utilised 10 weeks of its first term before the closure. "The only time that we have lost so far is three weeks. Right now, my children are enjoying their holiday until the end of the month," Magoha said. The CS added that the ministry is working on the issues raised concerning the lessons being offered online. Magoha has asked parents to remain calm and not to worry as to when the schools will be reopened. "If we are to worry, we should be worrying as to when shall we be able to control this pandemic phenomenon," Magoha said. He added that the government is currently using education facilities as quarantine centres.
