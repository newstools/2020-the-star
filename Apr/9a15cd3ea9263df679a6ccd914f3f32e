A need to concentrate on her health and the well-being of her son Muraya Jr are what drove singer Size 8 to shut her beauty parlour. ‘Friends_nail_parlour_barber’ was a gift from her husband DJ Mo on her birthday last year. Speaking to Word Is, Size 8 said her health comes first before anything else. "I released it to someone else since I realised I could not manage it. My son was born at 34 weeks, and so I just wanted to focus on his health," she said. Size 8 had a gruesome experience while giving birth to her second child with husband DJ Mo. The baby had to be born through C-section after she developed complications. She was rushed to hospital weeks before her due date after she started convulsing and experiencing pain in her uterus while at her house. "I also had to surrender some of my other responsibilities. I mean anything that I could live without, I left it because I was very sick. Even after I was discharged, I was still not okay. My blood pressure was still high and I needed to rest," she said. Her beauty parlour was launched together with Friends Car-wash, which is managed by DJ Mo in Kilimani at Dennis Pritt Road, opposite St George's Girls High School. DJ Mo said he loved dealing with cars and that encouraged him to open the car wash. "I have been frustrated the many times I have taken my cars to a car wash because of bad services," he said. On whether she will consider opening another business in future, Size 8 said she is eyeing a partnership business. "I now do not want to do something that I'm specifically supposed to be there all through. I want something I can only be coming in as a partner because this one is taking a toll on me," she said.
