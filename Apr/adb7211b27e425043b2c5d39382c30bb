Media personality Terryanne Chebet admits she once played the game some angry ex-spouses are hell-bent on playing, which is using your child to manipulate the ex. On her YouTube channel, Terryanne addressed a question from a fan who wanted to know how she made co-parenting work successfully. She first admitted it wasn’t easy at the beginning over what perhaps were deep issues between her and the ex. "Try to be in a place where you respect each other, so you have to get there first," she said. "Respect takes a long time to grow, especially after trust has been broken or there are feelings of distress that have caused problems." The mother of two advised that fighting fire with fire only puts children in the middle and makes them victims of a dispute between their parents. "It’s easy to co-parent, but I don’t think it’s 100 per cent easy. But it had to get to a place where we put the child first. I always say you don’t have to be best friends with your co-parent," she said. "Have a cordial relationship that they can call and talk to the child or pick the child." She also shares other tips on managing the situation and confesses how she had a hard time in the beginning. "Make sure you both understand the child is more important than what you are going through," she said. "I have seen women use the child to revenge on the man. I have done that because you’re upset with the father, but with time and maturity and wisdom, and speaking to older people who have been there, the advice they gave me is that it’s not you who will suffer in the end by denying the child access to the father. "So let’s put our egos aside and focus on what is best for the child."
