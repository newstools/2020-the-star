Residents of Kitise in Makueni were on Wednesday searching for the body of a man who drowned after the rubber dinghy he used to ferry people across the River Athi overturned. Chief Patrick Kisambo said the deceased was alone when he died. “He was on his way back to the other side of the river, after ferrying people to Monguni village in Kitui county, when the rubber boat overturned in the flooded river. He tried to swim but he was swept away,” he said. Family members and villagers from Matheani in Kitise, Kathonzweni subcounty, have searched for his body with no success. “We are yet to recover the body but we may be forced to involve experienced people to help us,” said a relative. Residents from both sides of Makueni and Kitui counties use the hand–peddled rubber boats, popularly known as Ndombolo, to cross the river inhabited by hippos and crocodiles. The first rubber dinghy was operated by Captain Musyoki Masivo, alias Kativui, who ferried passengers at a cost of Sh50. “I used to operate a dinghy to transport charcoal and livestock across the river during market days at Kitise in Makueni and Monguni in Kitui county,” Musyoki said. He stopped the dangerous business after his dinghy was deflated by a huge log in the river during the rainy season. Despite the dangers posed by the trade, Musyoki’s business attracted more men, including the deceased, who bought rubber boats and placed them at strategic crossing points along River Athi, which is at the border of Kitui and Makueni counties. Musyoki, aged 55,  attributed the deceased's death to lack of experience in operating the dinghy. Two bridges link the two counties, one at Wamunyu in Machakos and the other at Athi Kiaoni market along Kibwezi-Kitui road about 100km away. Residents rely on the rubber boats for transport across the river. Edited by Frank Obonyo
