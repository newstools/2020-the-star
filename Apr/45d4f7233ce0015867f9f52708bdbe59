The Covid-19 control measures issued by the government are not being followed by Kakamega residents. Governor Wycliffe Oparanya said it is difficult to stop people from going to the market and that is why they lifted the ban. Oparanya said the traders are free to sell their wares on condition that they wear face masks, observe social distancing and sanitise. Kakamega has two Covid-19 cases and both patients have a history of travel. A spot check revealed that mining is still going on despite the county emergency response committee banning it two weeks ago. At Masiyenze village, children ferry stones on wheelbarrows to a crusher. On Saturday, a miner died inside the famous Rosterman at Ikolomani, a clear indication of disregard for the measures. While announcing the closure of mines, Deputy Governor Philip Kutima said they are a potential avenue of coronavirus spread. "There are people from different countries in the mines and we have no option but to close them for now,” he said. Despite the government closing all public mortuaries, bodies are still held at the county referral hospital morgue. It has emerged that supervision of burials is done selectively. Wealthy families are allowed to exceed the 48-hour requirement for burials, and food is served during the ceremonies. Poor families are forced by administrators and police to bury within 24 hours. The parents of three-year-old Viona Shantel, who died at the referral hospital on Monday, were forced to pay Sh23,000 before they were given their child’s body. There were four bodies when we visited the mortuary. But on Monday, Kutima said only unclaimed bodies and those with police cases are still lying at the morgue. He admitted that enforcement of the regulations remains a challenge. On mining, Kutima said that it was the police who should enforce the ban because it is their mandate to arrest suspects and take them to court. Edited by Frank Obonyo
