The Chesegon mudslide death toll rose to six after two more people died on Monday. Pokot Central sub-county commissioner Simiyu told the Star that the bodies were that of a police officer and a woman. Four people are still missing since Saturday evening when heavy rains pounded the region, leading to the mudslides. Simiyu said a combined rescue team comprising the Red Cross, Kenya Defence Forces and residents was on the ground. On Sunday, four bodies were recovered. Some had not been identified yesterday. "Those missing might be among those not identified,” the administrator said. The weekend rains rendered roads impassable but the rescuers are providing the much needed assistance to victims. A command centre has been set up to coordinate rescue efforts. “The military has already delivered food and non-food items to those affected,” Simiyu said. Last year, floods hit West Pokot, leaving more than 50 people dead. Leaders who toured the region on Sunday, among them Governor John Lonyangapuo, appealed to residents to move to safe areas as more rains were expected. "Those are your homes but we need to be flexible. Those residing on the escarpment should move,” Lonyangapuo said.
