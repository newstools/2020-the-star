Security agencies will work with Nyumba Kumi leaders to monitor activity along the Kenya-Uganda border during the Covid-19 outbreak. The collaboration is meant to stop illegal cross-border movement between the two countries until the border is reopened. Interior Chief Administrative Secretary Hussein Dadho said some people were illegally crossing the borders but security agencies will ensure tighter enforcement. “This puts Kenyans at risk of being infected with the coronavirus,” Dadho said. The CAS spoke after touring the Malaba One-Stop Border Post accompanied by CASs Chris Obure (Transport and Infrastructure) and Rashid Aman (Health). Governor Sospeter Ojaamong had earlier raised an alarm over the influx of Ugandans into Busia. Ojaamong said Monday security agencies should probe how Ugandans freely cross into Kenya despite the border being shut. The county chief was addressing a stakeholders' meeting at the Busia Agricultural Training Centre. “Security apparatus should ensure that is stopped with immediate effect. The Ugandan government has barred Kenyans from crossing into Uganda. We are very lenient with Ugandans who are allowed to stream into the country oblivious of the Covid-19 pandemic which is ravaging the world,” he said. The governor said the illegal movement trend is worrying because Uganda has also recorded several coronavirus-positive persons. Ojaamong said the movement, if not checked, may put at risk the lives of many Busia residents. Most of the foreigners coming into the border county use illegal border points which are not manned by Immigration and Port Health officials. (edited by o. owino)
