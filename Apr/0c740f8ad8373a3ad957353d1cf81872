During this Easter period, Health CS Mutahi Kagwe has urged Kenyans to stay at home or at the very least in their specific estates. Kagwe reiterated that by doing so, people will not only be helping the government but also protect themselves from contracting Coronavirus. "Because people are not going to their jobs, no party, no bar, where are you going? stay at home," he said. Kagwe noted that the travel restrictions imposed by the government should be enough justification to keep people indoors. "We have proposed that you stay with your families, stay indoors and you do not party as is our usual," he said. Kagwe noted that people are still abusing the directive by finding all means to get into other counties, even using boda bodas. The CS cited a case where some Kenyans were caught using an ambulance to go to parties past the curfew. "Those who planned to travel for Easter... don't. Even when you are in Nairobi, unless there is something that you are doing, stay at home. It is important for us to start training ourselves to do so," he said. The CS was speaking during the daily Covid-19 update briefing on Thursday where he announced five new coronavirus cases bringing the country's total number to 184. The government banned all upcountry travel on April 2 to curb the spread of Covid-19. The travel ban has further been strengthened with the restriction of movement into and out of four counties for at least 21 days. The government outlawed entry into and out of Kilifi, Kwale, Mombasa and an expanded Nairobi Metropolitan Area. In his address to the nation Monday, President Uhuru Kenyatta said the Nairobi metropolitan area comprises Nairobi city county, all parts of Kiambu county surrounding Nairobi along Thika Road up to Chania River bridge, Rironi, Ndenderu and Kiambu town.
