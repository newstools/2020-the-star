Gospel artiste Ruth Matete spent three hours yesterday at the DCI headquarters on Kiambu Road, as investigators probe the death of her husband. Matete, 34, popularly known for the song ‘Eloi Eloi’, presented herself to the detectives at 8am, moments before her lawyer walked in. The 2012 Tusker Project Fame winner was interrogated by the DCI-based homicide unit following the death of her husband John Apewajoye. "We are waiting for the postmortem and then decide what next," an officer privy to the investigations told the Star. 'The postmortem is supposed to be today [Tuesday]." Matete had said Apewajoye, a Nigerian, succumbed to burns he sustained in their house at Wall Gardens Estate in Athi River on April 11. A close family member and DCI officials told the Star Matete was interrogated for two hours before she was asked to record a statement. The gospel singer, who is two months pregnant, last week confirmed the news of her Nigerian husband's death via social media. She said John died while undergoing treatment for burns at a Nairobi-based health facility. "My Husband Beloved John Apewajoye has gone to be with the Lord ..I humbly ask for your prayers during this difficult time," she wrote on Facebook. Pastor John succumbed to injuries after he was burnt while in the kitchen a few minutes after fixing a gas cylinder. Matete's friend and YouTuber Milly Chebby later gave an account of the incident. "Last week on Monday, Ruth and her husband John changed their gas cylinder and when they got to the house, he went to the kitchen to fix it," Chebby said. "He noticed it was excess and he took the cylinder to the balcony and tried releasing some so that it would be okay to use." Edited by T Jalio
