David Munyao, a 22-year-old self-taught artist is using his talent to create awareness about coronavirus . Munyao, who hails from Mulango ward in Kitui Central, cleared high school at Yumbisye Secondary School in 2016 but didn't manage to join university due to lack of school fees. Since then, he has been doing street art and as Kenya grapples to fight the Covid-19 pandemic, he has taken the initiative to sensitise the local community on how to curb the spread of the virus. He has painted the buildings on the streets of Kitui town and Wikililye, his home village, with sensitisation messages. Some of the awareness messages include social distancing, don't shake hands, don't touch your face, sanitise frequently, wear a face mask, and words of hope. Some of the messages are in the Kamba dialect to assist those who cannot read English or Swahili understand the message. "Out of passion for my talent, I took this initiative to protect our local communities and I have received a positive response so far," Munyao said. Munyao is not earning anything from this initiative but does it for the benefit of the locals. He, however, wishes to further his art studies and called upon well-wishers to help him achieve his dreams. He was to pursue his artistic course at Buruburu Institute of Fine Arts but did not manage due to poverty. “I plead with Good Samaritans to help me actualise my dream of becoming an international artist,” Munyao said. Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe has urged the youth to use their energy to help the country in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic. Edited by E.Kibii
