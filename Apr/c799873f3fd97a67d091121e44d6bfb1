A man has denied defrauding a Pakistani of Sh14 million in a fake gold scam. Court documents say Dute Mwanje obtained $114,000 (Sh14 million) from Asif Mohamed by pretending he could sell him genuine gold. Mwanje allegedly committed the offence jointly with others who are still at large between February 16 and March 3 in Nairobi. The matter was reported at Kileleshwa and Makongeni police stations and was taken up by officers at the Makadara Directorate of Criminal Investigations offices. Mwanje was also charged for possession of fake currency of $200,000 (Sh20 million) at Kobil Petrol Station near Belle Vue on Mombasa Road. Mwanje denied the charges before Makadara senior principal magistrate Anjelo Kithinji Kithinji freed him on a Sh2 million bond. The case will be heard on July 28. (edited by o. owino)
