Free transitions are Equity to Equity Mobile bank transfers, all bank to mobile wallet transfers, customer payments using Equity cards, mobile payments for bills, utilities, shopping, fuel and mobile balance and limit enquiries. “These are challenging times and we empathise with and appreciate the unprecedented scale of social and economic disruption to the daily lives of our members and fellow Kenyans,”  Equity said in a notice. Short-term personal and microloans will now be processed digitally on mobile phones, the internet and credit cards. Limits for personal and micro customers will be pre-marked for easy and automatic access for existing account holders by March 31, 2020. Customers with existing loans who may require accommodation can engage the bank through its contact centre (0763 063 000), on email, or speak to branch managers and/or relationship managers. The bank has also activated a digital account opening and management on digital channels, including its mobile app and internet. “The Board and management of the Bank, therefore, wholeheartedly welcome the clear directives and advisories issued by the Government and CBK to help alleviate the pain being felt across the country. Equity will fully support these initiatives," the bank said.
