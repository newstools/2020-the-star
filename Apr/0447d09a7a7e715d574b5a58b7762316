Motorists can now breath a sigh of relief as fuel prices dropped in the latest Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority monthly review. Super Petrol, Diesel and Kerosene have decreased by Sh18, Sh4 and Sh18 per litre respectively in the latest EPRA monthly review. Super Petrol will now retail at Kshs.92.87 down from Sh110.87, Diesel will retail at Sh97.56 down from Sh101.65. Kerosene will now retail at Sh77.28 down from Sh95.49 in March. All these prices will be effected from midnight. "The changes in in this month's prices are as a consequence of the average landed cost of imported super petrol decreasing by 34.61% from US$472.59 per cubic metre in February to US$309.03 per cubic metre in March," the statement from EPRA read. Diesel decreased by 9.89% from US$480.21 per cubic metre to US$432.70 per cubic metre while Kerosene decreased by 37.70% from US$421.24 per cubic metre to US$262.44 per cubic metre. Diesel cargoes used in the computation of April's prices were procured in February when the crude oil price was relatively high. Accordingly, the effect of the recent crash in crude oil prices will be reflected in the retail price of diesel in subsequent reviews.

Over the same period, the mean monthly US Dollar to Kenya shilling exchange rate depreciated by 2.75% from Sh101.27 per US$ in February to Sh104.05 per US$ in March.
