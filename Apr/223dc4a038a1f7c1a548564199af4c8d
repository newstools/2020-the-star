Nine Intensive Care Unit machines will be installed at the Bungoma County Referral Hospital, the facility’s medical superintendent Dr David Wanikina says. He said the equipment was donated by First Lady Mama Margaret Kenyatta in 2018. “All the machines are intact, the main problem was the lack of space where to install them but now that we are almost completing it, we shall be installing it in the next one to two months times,” he said. Addressing the press at the paediatric ward, Dr Wanikina refuted rumours that the machines had been hired out to Bungoma West hospital in Kanduyi, a private facility. “Those are just rumours, let them die flat-faced. As you can see they have been covered with dust and they have been safe and in secure place in this container, those propagating lies have their own agenda,” he said. Wanikina said they received nine ICU beds, endoscope towers, gynae coaches, orthopaedic beds, and anaesthetic machines among others. He said the installation of the machines will help them carry on with advanced surgeries like neurosurgery and heart surgeries to reduce referrals to other hospitals. Wanikina said they have been referring majority patients to Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital in Eldoret.
