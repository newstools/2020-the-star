Singers have paid tributes to celebrated gospel artiste Peter Kaberere on the sixth anniversary of his death. His death was caused by an electric fault while he was washing his car. Kaberere, aka Qabbz, started his music in a group called Zaidi Ya Muziki and later decided to do solo projects. He released songs like 'Just a Way' featuring Mr Vee, 'Natamani' featuring Eunice Njeri and the famous 'Mwanake' with Benachi. His song with Benachi, ‘Mwanake’, was one of the last songs he did before he died. Kaberere left a young family and at the time of his death, his wife Njeri, well known as Njesh Wa Qabbz, was expecting. Njeri gave birth at the time they were laying Kaberere to rest. Paying tribute to him, singer Wahu wrote on Instagram on Monday, "Time surely does fly. Qabbz....you truly did leave your mark on this earth. 6 years on you are warmly remembered and celebrated. Njesh Wa Qabbz you are highly favoured of God. May He continue to give you wisdom and joy as you raise your Angels." Mercy Masika described him as a supportive friend. "Kaberere lived a life of love... His was truly a life well lived. I still remember when I hadn't produced music for years, he kept telling me, Mercy rudi studio, and when he died, I woke up to his call. I know heaven is a beautiful place but we miss you." Music director J Blessing wrote, "It’s been 6 years since you left us and your impact on us is still felt till now. You’ll always be remembered not only on this day but through all your deeds in our lives." Singer Pitson is still blessed by Kaberere's work before death. "6 years on, no one can fill your shoes I loved your music, and I still do," he wrote.
