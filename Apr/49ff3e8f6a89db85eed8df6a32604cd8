Rising water levels in Lake Victoria will continue following the commencement of long rains, Lake Victoria Basin Commission executive secretary Ally-Said Matano has warned. “It is therefore strongly recommended that those people living in lowland vacate to avoid further disasters because there is an unprecedented rise of water levels since October last year,” Matano said in a statement. “We have witnessed flooding in Nyando and Budalangi. Lakeside hotels have been submerged in Kisumu, in Entebbe in Uganda, in Mwanza in Tanzania all due to the rising lake levels. This has caused uncertainties to communities.” Matano noted that the current rise of water levels was the highest witnessed since 1964. He said between 1960 and 1964, the water levels rose 2.5 meters. “At moment, the level in Jinja, Uganda, is at 1135.8 meters above mean sea level while in Mwanza Tanzania it’s at 1134.28 and Kisumu it’s at 1132.11 meters above mean sea level. These elevations are very important because they provide a snapshot of where a specific area is below or above the lake levels,” Matano said. He explained that the rising water level of Lake Victoria is premised on the water balance. The water balance of Lake Victoria is largely determined by the inflow and outflow, he noted. “The inflow into the lake is primarily from rainfall which accounts for over 80 per cent and the remaining 20 per cent is from drainage systems into the lake. Outflow on the other hand is primarily from evaporation which accounts for 76 per cent and outflow into the Nile which accounts to 24 per cent. From the foregoing, it is apparent that rainfall plays a great role in determining the water levels in Lake Victoria,” Matano said. He said the Lake Victoria Basin countries of Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania have been receiving abnormally heavy rainfall from October and November last year to date.
