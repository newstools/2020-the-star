Fear has engulfed Bunyala Central in Busia’s Budalang'i constituency following allegations of arrival of an unknown number of Chinese workers in the area. They had been managing Lower Nzoia Irrigation Scheme at Ugunja site in Siaya county and are now believed to have been transferred to SynoHydro construction company site at Mukhobola. Led by Andrew Okoba, the residents told the Star on Thursday they would take the law into their hands should the government fail to take the Chinese for coronavirus screening. “We are worried about our safety from coronavirus. We want the government to order them to go for screening for coronavirus or else we shall be forced to take the law into our hands,” a resident said. A worker at Mukhobola construction site who sought anonymity confirmed the presence of the Chinese engineers at the site, but denied the allegation by residents that a big number of Chinese had arrived. Bunyala Central MCA Felix Omanyi appealed to the national government to take prompt action to ensure their safety. “The national government should not take this matter lightly. Urgent action ought to be taken to ensure the Chinese nationals based at Mukhobola construction site are screened against the coronavirus to ensure the safety of our people,” he said.
