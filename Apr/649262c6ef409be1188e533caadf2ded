BBC journalist Anne Ngugi has released a 'Uko Nami', a song inspired by Psalms 91. The song is a prayer for protection against any plague and circumstances. Speaking to Word Is yesterday, Anne said the song has always been one of her prayer points since long ago. "The words in this song are powerful and it’s a spiritual weapon when praying against pestilence that is stubborn," she said, citing corona and any other stubborn evil spirit. She said she took over five years to memorise the whole chapter of Psalms 91, and she has been using it as her daily prayer. "Anyone can sing and pray with it because it is the living word of God! I love the song because it gives me hope and assurance if my defender and my fighter and deliverer," she said. Having been hurt in the past, Anne said in a past interview she thought of how she had been bitter with people but got to a point she asked God to give her peace to love everyone. "I now find it easy for me to even pray with a clean heart. At that time when my heart was bitter, I was not at peace," she said. Anne has spoken on numerous occasions about how people she termed friends gave her a cold shoulder after she was fired from her media job years ago. She recalled how her bosses refused to pick her calls every time she called them, and she was forced to sell one of her family's cars, a Mercedes Benz, because she and hubby couldn’t maintain it. She has since moved on and is content with her new workplace, saying the past was a learning experience for her career. “I lost people I thought were my friends. I even called former colleagues to hook me up with jobs, but they ignored me. That was hard to believe. People change a lot, especially when you have nothing to give anymore,” Anne said.
