Kwal, Diversey EA and KPC are spearheading the national governmentâ€™s efforts to take the war against coronavirus to the grassroots. Speaking to journalists after receiving over 40,000 litres of hand sanitisers from Diversey EA, KPC managing director Macharia Irungu thanked Kwal and KRA "for ensuring we have sufficient amounts of ethanol to produce these sanitisers".
