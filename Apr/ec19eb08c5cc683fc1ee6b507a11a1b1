Embu speaker Josiah Thiriku has adjourned sittings indefinitely—only life-threatening matters will be discussed, he ordered. The assembly has taken the step to postpone plenary and committee sittings to prevent the spread of coronavirus. “...unless in exceptional circumstances where an urgent matter, if not addressed, would jeopardise the lives of the common population of the county," Thiriku said. In a memo to the MCAs and employees, he also said visitors will be restricted from entering the assembly. Those allowed into the compound must wear face masks and wash or sanitise their hands. The precautionary procedures are to be observed in the event a committee meeting is authorised. Thiriku directed employees in non-essential departments to work at home. Edited by Josephine M. Mayuya
