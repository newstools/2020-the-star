 The national government should give poor people a monthly stipend of Sh2,000 to cushion them from the effects of Covid-19, an MP has said. “Coronavirus has messed up all businesses, hotels are empty, hardware, transport industry are all grounded as people are only buying foodstuffs," North Imenti MP Rahim Dawood said. Dawood said the economy is at a standstill and landlords should consider reducing rent charges for their tenants for two to three months. He said the country was doing well in its fight against coronavirus as projected cases have not materialised. The MP said the measures put in place by the state were working. “However, we should be very specific what trucks are allowed to supply foodstuff because people were hiding in the vehicles,” he said. He said all people transporting foodstuffs need to be tested at least once in two weeks. Dawood said counties that have Covid-19 cases should be put in lockdown. He said county bosses should not ban miraa but should ban congregations in markets. Dawood said miraa does not cause coronavirus but people should not congregate when chewing it. “Khat is the lifeline for Meru people and remains a gazetted cash crop,” the MP said.
