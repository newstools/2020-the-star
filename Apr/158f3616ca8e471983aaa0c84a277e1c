Last week, David Oyando, alias Kendrick Mulamwah, announced he had quit comedy due to online trolls. Celebrities came out to sympathise with him, but not Kiss FM's Kamene Goro. The breakfast show presenter revealed that Mulamwah had body-shamed her. "First of all, personally, Mulamwah is the biggest bully I have ever met! I have been in this industry for eight years, very few people can bully me," she said. "Mulamwah bullied me online. So I posted a picture with Ronoh and we were sitting at the swimming pool rooftop at my place. "Mulamwah comes to the comment section and said if the two of us get into the pool, all the water pours out. "And I am like, what? I look at that name and I am like, who is this? So I go to his DM and I am like, what is this nonsense? Because you do not know me like this.” Now, Mulamwah has come out to ask for forgiveness, saying back then, he did not know better. Speaking on his YouTube channel, he said, “I just want to tell her sorry about that, and I see we are good. Hajaniblock sijamblock, tunalike maphotos, so thank you so much.” He said back then after he realised his remarks hurt Kamene’s feelings, he DMed her his apologies. "I went to her direct messages and apologised. I look up to those big people, so when I know I have done wrong to any of them, I usually feel bad."
