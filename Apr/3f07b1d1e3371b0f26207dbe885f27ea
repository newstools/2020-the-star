Budget regional carrier, Jambojet has extended its temporary suspension of operations to May 20, 2020. This follows the extended cessation of movement in and out of Nairobi, Mombasa, Kilifi and Kwale for an additional 21 days by the government. “We regret to inform our customers and business partners that all the flights for the said period are cancelled with immediate effect,” the firm said in a statement. The firm encouraged passengers scheduled to travel in the period up to May 20, to consider rescheduling their travel to a later date at no extra cost. The value of the tickets will remain valid for a period of 12 months from May 1, 2020. Jambojet suspended flights to Rwanda and Uganda mid-last month due to the virus. The aviation industry stares at a possible Sh10 billion or more in lost revenue with the coronavirus taking a heavy toll on the industry. The International Air Transport Association(IATA) estimates the global air transport industry will make losses of between $63 billion(Sh6.67 trillion ) and $113 billion (Sh 13.78 trillion) in 2020 on passenger business alone.
