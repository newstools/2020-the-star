Despite numerous calls to toss his hat in the ring for the forthcoming Football Kenya Federation (FKF) polls, former Kenyan international Boniface Ambani says he is not interested. Ambani is among the former players, who are under pressure from football stakeholders to give the presidential seat a stab. However, the former Tusker man argues that the playing ground is not level thus he will not vie. The former AFC Leopards Youth coach said the delegates to participate in the elections remain a secret, leaving room for the possible rigging. "I am not interested. To vie means I will be fighting a battle I am sure I'll lose. I have received numerous requests from various stakeholders but the playing ground is not level," said Ambani. "We do not know the delegates who will vote in the polls and this leaves room for manipulation should any of the candidates have these identities. " However, the former Yanga striker, said he might consider contesting in future elections, adding that he doesn't have a preferred choice from the hosts of candidates who have declared their interests in taking over the reign at Kandanda House. "I will vie in the future polls for I believe I have the leadership qualities needed at FKF. I have seen a number of candidates who want to lead football but I am not supporting any. The number of candidates keeps growing every day but I will only support the individual who is scandal-free," he added. Similarly, Gor Mahia chairman Ambrose Rachier says he is yet to single out his preferred candidate from the many who are muscling for the top seat. He also insisted that he had no intention of running again, having lost to Nick Mwendwa in 2016. "We do not know when the polls will be held and neither do I have a candidate in mind who I will throw my weight behind. I am not interested in FKF politics but I urge the delegates to vote wisely when the time comes," said Rachier.
