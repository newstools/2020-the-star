Iftin MCA Mohamed Gabow wants the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission to investigate the stalled tarmacking of the Sh27 million Lamu Road in Garissa. Documents seen by the Star show that work on the 7km stretch that was being done using the constituency Equalisation Fund was to start in March 2018 and be completed last year in October. The Kenya Rural Roads Authority (Kerra) was to oversee the work that was to be done by Aligalo Traders Limited. Speaking to the press, Gabow regretted that members of the public were now suffering as a result of “failure on the part of the contractor”. In January, Gabow together with Roads executive Abdi Omar visited the Kerra offices to protest the delay in completion of the works. “Unfortunately, no answer has been forthcoming. Wananchi, on the other hand, think we are not doing anything to address their plight. The whole situation is very frustrating and annoying,” he said Gabow said he would soon mobilise residents to protest the same, noting that the other available option was to move to court to compel the contractor to finish the work. Residents are now complaining over the poor state of the stretch that they say is making their lives more difficult. Speaking to the press, residents led by Mohamed Abdi said the sorry state of the road has not only led to increased accidents but was also posing a health risk by holding stagnant water when it rains. A spot check by the Star on Sunday revealed potholes full of water. Motorists, boda bodas and pedestrians are now forced to use one side of the road to avoid getting stuck which has, in turn, led to several accidents. Abdi said the last time they saw any activity in the area was mid last year. A heap of hardcore ballast that was to be used for construction still sits on the road. Efforts to get a comment from Kerra officials were unsuccessful as calls went unanswered and text messages were not replied. Edited by R.Wamochie
