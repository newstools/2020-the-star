The government has changed tune on the issue of payment of bills for individuals quarantined at Pride Inn Hotel. The Health ministry had earlier said it would intervene and assist quarantined individuals on a case by case basis after several Kenyans quarantined at Pride Inn Hotel said they were denied lunch over nonpayment. "We are aware of the matter and we will handle it on a case by case basis," Health CAS Mercy Mwangangi said during the daily Covid-19 briefing on Saturday. However, government spokesman Cyrus Oguna, in a statement, later said that individuals had the choice to stay at government facilities at the beginning of the quarantine. "Choosing to be in a private facility was equivalent to having entered into a private engagement with the hotels. As such, the individuals in these private hotels, particularly Pride Inn Lantant, must pay bills they incurred during their stay," he said. Quarantined individuals were to stay at specified facilities for 14 days at their own expense in the war against Covid-19. However, when the government extended the quarantine period by another 14 days, those staying at the facility said the state committed to pay. In a notice on Saturday, the Pride Inn management said it has been providing services for the extended quarantine period without pay. "As it stands, please be advised that you will be required to pay up all your bills before leaving the hotel." "For us to be able to continue providing services, you need to settle current bills as we also need to settle our suppliers. This therefore means we will only provide any service to those who will have paid up by noon."
