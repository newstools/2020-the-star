Talks over the negotiation of a new Cricket Kenya constitution have grounded following a division among members of the Constitution Review Committee. The developments come less than a week since a draft constitution was made public. The Review Committee has been in place for one year and was hoping to come up with a new constitution in a bid to end the current leadership impasse. A section of the committee members has rejected the draft released by Samuel Muthomi, accusing him of doing that without their authority. Muthomi is accused of having taken the decision to send out the draft constitution without following the proper channel despite his mandate having ended. Committee member Edward Tito Odumbe wondered why Muthomi opted to do so without consulting the committee and also omitted them in the mailing list. “As a member of the Review Committee, I want to believe the said letter and copy of the constitution did not originate from Muthomi. But if indeed it did, let him clarify why members were not consulted,” Odumbe said. Odumbe said the draft was sent out to the public without the knowledge of other CK executive committee members and members of the Review Commission before being recalled. “CK board met in Mombasa last year in the presence of Ekuru Aukot and made some changes to the previous draft and asked the experts to go and amend it and get back to us with the final draft, However, CK were surprised that the draft had already been released to the public,” a source revealed. The source added: “When CK received the draft in a later meeting in Nairobi, a number of clauses were different from what had been agreed on in Mombasa.”
