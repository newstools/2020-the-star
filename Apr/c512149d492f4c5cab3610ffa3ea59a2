Six individuals who had been quarantined at the Mpeketoni Hospital in Lamu county over suspected coronavirus have all tested negative and been discharged. The announcement was made by Lamu Health executive Anne Gathoni on Thursday. Speaking in Lamu town, Gathoni said the six, including a mother and her child, had visited the hospital between March 19 and April 8. They had flu-like symptoms — high fever, dry cough and difficulties in breathing — and were quarantined immediately. All six also had a travel history from either the counties or countries hit by the coronavirus. Their samples were sent to the Kemri lab in Kilifi. “We have received their blood results from Kemri and they are all negative. After observing all health protocols, they have been released back to their families," Gathoni said. "We urge the public to stay safe and follow all the precautions to keep this disease out of Lamu.” The executive said her department is educating the public on the need for social distancing, hand washing and basic hygiene at all times. The county has distributed water dispensers, sanitisers and hand washing equipment in public places. Gathoni said the county is also widening its surveillance to manage any suspected Covid-19 cases. Lamu has since set up a coronavirus isolation ward in case of any eventualities in each of the three major hospitals — the King Fahad Hospital in Lamu island, Mpeketoni and Faza subcounty hospitals. Gathoni further warned against stigmatisation of persons suspected of suffering from Covid-19. Lamu county has not recorded any case of the coronavirus since the first outbreak in the country on March 13. Edited by E Kibii
