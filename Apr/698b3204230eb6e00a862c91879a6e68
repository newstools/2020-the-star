 Some 59 people are self-quarantined in Baringo county, Health executive Mary Panga has said. Panga noted that most of them landed from foreign trips. “We identified them through our contact with the local chiefs and urgently told them to ensure a must self-quarantine,” Panga said on Thursday. She said they are being monitored closely in their various homes as they adhere to the 14-day quarantine. They are drawn from Mochongoi, Baringo South, Baringo Central and Eldama Ravine. "We have all the data of the people who were away and once they arrive, we shall quickly link with the local administrators to present them to our quarantine centres," she said.  Elsewhere Baringo Central Covid-19 isolation centre at Kaptimbor Dispensary received a donation of two electronic beds worth Sh1 million from MP Joshua Kandie on Thursday. While receiving the beds the nursing officer-in-charge of the facility, Pauline Kandie, said it will help the event a case is reported in the area. The MP's personal assistant, Roy Yator said the beds, imported from Germany, are "highly specialised". “A patient can operate personally by just pressing buttons to rotate or lift it up and down,” Yator said. He added that the MP is keen on providing provide more to various health facilities across the county “Covid-19 is a global pandemic and it calls for support from the government, individuals and various humanitarian groups,” he said. Pauline further appealed for more protective equipment for health officers. “We realised we are the soldiers at the front and we never know when we shall come in conduct with a coronavirus patient,” she said.
