Meru MCAs want to be included in the county committee mandated to fight Covid-19. The assembly passed a motion paving the way for their demand. Majority leader Victor Karithi said the move will compel Governor Kiraitu Murungi and county commissioner Allan Machari to co-opt them. "We want the county to use the Sh36 million set side prudently. We want, for instance, medical workers to be given protective clothing and allowances,” Karithi said. Romano Mwito (Kangeta) urged residents to abide by the guidelines set by the government. “We want boda boda operators to be given masks as most cannot afford them,” he said. Martin Muthuri (Nyaki West) said the personal protective equipment should be given priority and distributed across the county. The MCAs seek to oversight how the money allocated for the drive is spent. Many residents have complained that they are yet to feel the impact of the money. Abothuguchi Central MCA Ayub Bundi said the county government should be accountable and tell residents how they are using the funds. But Deputy Governor Titus Ntochiu said they are using the funds well and equitably, including those received from the national government and donations from private agencies and individuals. Some MCAs have opposed the slashing of their salaries to aid the Covid-19 fight. Bundi said they would rather used the money tp personally help residents fight the virus. “We are not opposed to the setting aside of funds. We want to see money being put to better use like other counties,” he said.
