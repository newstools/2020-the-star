Isiolo county commissioner Herman Shambi has dismissed claims that a group of people who allegedly escaped from a quarantine centre in Mandera are in Isiolo. Shambi termed reports doing the rounds on social media as a hoax. He noted that the Blue Prado vehicle in question (suspected to have ferried some of the escapees) belonged to a senior police officer, who was going back to his work station in the Rift Valley after completing leave at his home in Mandera. Shambi said the vehicle had five occupants, including the driver, with the rest of the occupants being people from Moyale and not Mandera. He asked residents to desist from posting and sharing unverified information on social media as this causes unnecessary panic. The administrator said the vehicle was only allowed to cross into Isiolo since the officer was an essential service provider. Thirty-two individuals on Tuesday mysteriously disappeared from a quarantine facility in Elwak. They were part of the 66 who were put on mandatory quarantine after two travellers tested positive for Covid-19 last week. The county Covid-19 response team resolved to close entry points from Garissa, Wajir and Mandera last week after cases were reported in Mandera. He cautioned residents of Isiolo against welcoming and hosting visitors, especially those coming from affected areas at a time people are being discouraged from unnecessary travelling.
