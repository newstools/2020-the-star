A Tanzanian radio presenter said to be dating Ali Kiba has now claimed the rumours are true. Even before Kiba met his Kenyan wife Amina Khalef, Diva The Bause was said to have been the one who separated Ali Kiba and his former girlfriend Jokate Mwegelo. In April 2018, Kiba walked down the aisle with Amina. Bause says she has been dating with Kiba even after he got married. She decided to end things with him this year on February 16. Diva wrote on Instagram on Tuesday, "Me and Ali, we came a long way since his return to the music world, and yes, both as friends and low-key lovers for a long time now. I have evidence to prove. "This is just relationship drama and someone is truly hurt that a woman made a decision to move on. Everyone has a right to move on, and I'm sorry I hurt your feelings, but it is what it is. By the way, I ended things on 16/2/2020." She says she has been in an on-and-off relationship with the 'Chekecha Cheketua' hitmaker. "I ended everything peacefully, just a woman who is fed up with on-and-off,  I always love and respect him and his talent, but I have a life to live." She exposed Ali Kiba after she was accused of being the one who chased away signees from his record label, King's Records. "I want peace, that's all, and I have it all. I just don’t like a bully because no one knows anything apart from me and him. I did everything to protect him. I was there for him, he was my ride or die." "But I think this is too much." To prove Diva wrong, Kiba replied by posting a photo of his wife Amina Khalef kissing him on the cheeks as he wished her a happy birthday.
