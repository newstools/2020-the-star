Former Kenya Basketball Federation (KBF) chairman Agina Wesonga called on the national governing body to change the national calendar of events to conform with that of Fiba. He said it is unclear when this year’s national league will tip-off due to the uncertainty occasioned by the coronavirus pandemic. “Nobody knows when all this will end,” Agina said. “We need to be focused and the best way to go about it is to adapt to the international calendar.” Agina, who is also a Fiba Commissioner pointed out that if this is done, clubs and national teams participating in continental championships will be able to adapt accordingly once action resumes. The Fiba international calendar runs from September to June while KBF starts their league programmes in March. He said there is need for KBF to engage team managers and discuss this as soon as possible. “I do not see the leagues starting next month and that will be two months late already. With over 40 teams involved, the season will not end on time,” he said. But KBF will have to consider if the changes will affect the university teams. Seven varsity sides are involved in the leagues.
