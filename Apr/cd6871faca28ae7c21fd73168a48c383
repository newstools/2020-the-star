The government will begin targeted mass testing in high-risk Covid-19 areas from this weekend. President Uhuru Kenyatta said on Wednesday that the government has scaled up its testing capacities and will target specific areas. He said the government will also focus on certain areas and personnel such as the Kenya Ports Authority employees and the health care workers. The President said the testing capacity will rise to up to 2,000 per day. The number of tests per day reduced drastically on Tuesday to 545 from 1,339 samples collected on Sunday. According to Health CAS Mercy Mwangangi, the lower number was due to the lack of sample kits used in delivering Covid-19 results. Mwangangi said kits such as nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs are in short supply even though there are several laboratories for testing. The CAS, however, said that the country has enough testing laboratories. The president asked Kenyans to adhere to the measures set by the government in order to reduce further spread of the virus. Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital in Eldoret has now been approved to test the virus. The hospital received reagents and other requirements from the Kenya Medical Supplies Authority and will be carrying out about 960 tests every eight hours.
