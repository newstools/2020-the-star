The financial crisis occasioned by the coronavirus pandemic has led Butali Warriors goalkeeper Linus Sang has resulted in working in a vehicle showroom in Ngong as an alternative source of income. Sang has also established a poultry farm in Limuru but the government’s directive restricting movement in and out of Nairobi County means the 30-year old cannot access the project. With all sporting activities suspended, it means no playing allowances can be paid to players, making the experienced shot-stopper to be innovative. Warriors are sponsored by Butali Sugar Company in Kakamega County but no player is on contract. “Survival is for the fittest. Working in the showroom is a relief at this difficult moment. It is where I get my daily bread. As an IT expert, I deal with insurance and I am also careful with the security of the showroom,” said Sang. He, however, thanked team manager Kamal Sambi for standing with the players during the crisis. “Kamal is one person who understands our needs and his assistance has been important all through.” Sang previously played for United States International University-USIU-A Mashujaa for three seasons. Meanwhile, the undisputed first-choice keeper had rescinded his decision to quit the national team after being overlooked during the Olympic qualifiers last year.
