Makueni MP Daniel Maanzo has threatened to sue Education CS George Magoha over inequality in candidates' preparation for KCSE and KCPE exams. Maanzo said even though the government has not postponed the exams, the online learning directive by the CS has left many candidates disadvantaged as they cannot access learning materials and facilities. He cited those in rural areas or from poor families without electricity, smartphones, or other electronic devices that support online learning. "The CS should show Kenyans and parents how there will be equality and adequacy in preparedness for the exams by all candidates. If he doesn’t, I will team up with other lawyers to stop the exams,” Maanzo told the Star. The legislator expressed concern that some public schools may not complete the syllabus, hence it will be unfair for them to be examined with those in private schools who have the advantage of online learning. The second-term lawmaker, however, supported the government’s decision to put off the reopening of schools, saying the move will ensure pupils and students are protected from the coronavirus. “There would have been danger if the schools were reopened when the disease is still threatening Kenyans, but I appeal to all candidates to continue preparing for the exams at home,” he said. During the Covid-19 briefings on Sunday, Magoha announced that the reopening of schools and colleges had been postponed for another one month. But speaking on Citizen TV on Monday, government spokesman Cyrus Oguna said the Ministry of Education is working on a strategy to ensure the syllabus is completed before candidates sit their exams. He said the ministry was planning weekend learning programmes to help candidates recover the lost time before the exam is administered.  Edited by F'Orieny
