A man who was stabbed by his closest friend with a sharp knife has died after two days. Joseph Muriki had demanded from his friend a balance of Sh50 from their ballast sales for the day. They had sold ballast worth Sh1,000 but his friend who is still at large gave him only Sh450. Witnesses who helped take Muriki to hospital in the company of the suspect said trouble ensued when he demanded his complete share. Joshua Mururu, the young man’s landlord, said Muriki returned two days ago complaining his friend had stabbed him. Mururu said the two young men were both from Muthara in Tigania East but worked in Igembe North. He said the suspect had started catering for the medication of Muriki and also bought him some food. Igembe North subcounty police boss Apolo Ambuya confirmed the incident and asked residents to desist from the taking law into their own hands. He said police have launched a manhunt to arrest the suspect. Pastor Zakayo Mung’athia, said Muriki was a calm and diligent church member. “I am saddened by his killing. They should resolve the matter amicably. I condemn this act. The suspect should be arrested and charged to be deterrent to the rest such kind of heartless people,” he said. Meanwhile, Patrick Kailemia and his wife Kaari of Kithangene in Igembe Central were assaulted by his brother in a dispute over the care of their ageing and blind mother.
