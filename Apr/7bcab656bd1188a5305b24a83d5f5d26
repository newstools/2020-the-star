For a long time now the importance of efficient online and mobile banking compared to that of face-to-face meetings and physical branches has been debated. For many accustomed to physical locations, digital banking has always been an option, one that worked for most but just isn't for them. Some may even go so far as to claim that digital banking has been over-hyped and that people will always prefer a human touch. However, while that may have worked for yesterday, in today's world, online and mobile banking is not only a matter of personal convenience, but is also a matter of personal safety. There was initial scepticism on ease of use as well as security when online and mobile banking were initially introduced to consumers, however in recent times, consumers have positively embraced the convenience offered, as banks continue to improve efficiency and innovate on their digital channels. Mobile banking in particular has become incredibly popular due to the widespread use of smart-phones across all socio-economic groups. NCBA in particular has embraced this by releasing their newest initiative dubbed #GoCashless aimed at educating consumers on the use of digital banking channels. Their outstanding app, for example allows you to manage your accounts, make payments via Pesalink, RTGS, EFT and M-Pesa, it also includes airtime purchase services, bill presentment and payment options, domestic tax payments as well as business tools including forex rates, stock prices, currency converters and loan calculators. While we look forward to a time where we can move free-er and interact with more people, it would be naive to think that digital banking will go back to a place where it will be optional. It is a long-run change that we need to adjust to. And that banks like NCBA are ensuring that the transition is made easier for both their existing and new customers.
