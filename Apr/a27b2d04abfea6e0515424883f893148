This hygiene isn't about keeping safe from the coronavirus. It's about keeping data safe. The ICT ministry has urged all government staff working from home to observe 'cyber hygiene' - tight security - and ensure sensitive information is secure. In a letter dated March 19 to all ministries, departments and agencies, ICT Principal Secretary  Jerome Ochieng said the ICT Authority is mandated to establish, develop and maintain secure ICT infrastructure and systems. “Staff in all government agencies who are logging and accessing government systems should use secure Wi-Fi and VPN connections. All remote connections to critical government systems shall be via secure VPN connections and where possible, limit and monitor the staff connections continuously,” he said. Ochieng said all government communications and employees shall use secure connections, and ICT officers are advised to be extra vigilant and continually monitor their infrastructure and security systems. “Any unusual and strange activity on the networks they manage must be flagged and reported using the respective escalation lines. Access to all critical government systems/data shall be restricted to the designated VPN link/connection by the relevant ministry, department and agency," he said. All government agencies are to activate a clear screens policy to ensure screens for teleworking devices are locked at all times of inactivity. This is to ensure that confidential, restricted or sensitive information is kept out of unauthorised access, the letter read. Ochieng said government employees must be vigilant and not divulge sensitive government information "through coercion". "Compliance with these instructions and initiatives for both the staff and agencies will greatly enhance the safety and hygiene of our systems across government,” Ochieng said. (Edited by V. Graham)
