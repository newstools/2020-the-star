Fifteen people were arrested in Meru on Monday for violating directives put in place to curb the spread of Covid-19. Seven were arrested in an entertainment joint drinking beer while eight mitumba traders were found without masks and were not observing social distancing. The mitumba traders were arrested at Mikinduri market. They were released on police bond. They will later be charged. Meru county police commander Patrick Lumumba said they raided the pub after receiving a tip-off from members of the public. Lumumba said it was unfortunate for people to disobey government directives by locking themselves inside a bar to drink. Tigania Central deputy county commissioner Obed Mose urged traders to observe social distancing, wear masks and maintain good hygiene. “Those violating the Covid-19 guidelines will face the full force of the law,” Mose said. Governor Kiraitu Murungi has banned people from going to recreational parks and has ordered the closure of nightclubs and all stadiums for 30 days. He has further cancelled market days on Fridays, Wednesdays and Mondays. Health Chief Administrative Secretary Mercy Mwangangi has warned Kenyans that the government would no longer go easy on those breaking the 7pm-5am curfew rules. “From now on, all those who will break the curfew rules will be assumed to have been in contact with suspected cases, hence will be quarantined for a period of 14 days,” she said.
