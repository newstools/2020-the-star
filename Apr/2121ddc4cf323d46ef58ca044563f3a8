The Liberal Democratic Party has said the government is to blame for ignoring Covid-19 early warnings. Spokesperson Abuta Ogeto said the situation would have been arrested had the government taken early warnings seriously since last year November. He said the spread had been fueled by government inaction after leading international experts warned of possible infections. “The government had enough time to stop international flights especially from China to stop the virus from entering the country. And even after its discovery in the country, the government would have come up with sound stringent measures such as locking up the 47 counties in the country to avoid unnecessary movement of the people to avoid the spread of the virus,” Ogeto said in a statement to newsrooms. “Restrained movement could have been done as early as a month ago. But then, they were so engrossed in BBI rallies and political settling of scores.” The party wants the government to cushion Kenyans from both the social and economic shocks during this economic tough times. “At no better time do we need their leadership and commitment to public interest than now. Besides, LDP is wondering where the members of parliament, senators and governors are during this trying moment when Kenyans need them most and are yearning to hear from them as the pandemic is threatening to wipe out the population,” Ogeto said.
