Health CS Mutahi Kagwe has dismissed calls that he is only the minister in charge of the coronavirus insisting he oversees the whole Health Ministry as a whole. Ever since the first coronavirus case was reported in Kenya on March 13, Kagwe has been on the front line in updating the country on the new cases and dissemination of government measures aimed at containing the pandemic. Since then, almost all updates on the coronavirus has largely been associated with him. On other occasions, Health CS Dr Mercy Mwangangi has held the fort for him and only recently, the other top health official Rashid Aman has also made media appearances at the briefings. Kagwe's numerous briefings have earned him the new title 'Waziri wa Corona'. "Some children are calling me 'Waziri wa Corona'. The ministry is carrying out normal activities and must continue with other efforts to conclude reforms to be able to achieve our goals," he said. Kagwe was speaking at Afya House on Monday when he announced that Kenya on Monday recorded eight new cases of Coronavirus. The Health CS confirmed Nairobi and Mombasa recorded four cases each. This brings to 363 the total number of Covid-19 cases in the country. Kagwe at the same time announced the reopening of restaurants across the country. The CS was, however, quick to note this was not a licence to start opening bars and sale of alcohol across the country. Kagwe said that the restaurants will operate only between 5 am and 4 pm even as the country grapples with coronavirus. Kagwe said that all workers must be tested within the food joints and social distancing be practised at all times.
