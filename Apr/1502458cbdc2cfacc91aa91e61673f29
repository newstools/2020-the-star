The ban on travel into and out of Nairobi and Mombasa is to blame for a no show in court by a man charged with firearms fraud, a Kibera court has heard. Lawyer Robert Odanga told senior resident magistrate Renee Kitagwa that his client Anthony Mwangi was in Mombasa and cannot move till the ban is lifted. Odanga said that his client had attended a business function in Mombasa without knowing that President Uhuru Kenyatta would announce the stiff measure. He requested the court to move his case to a date after the lockdown. Mwangi was on April 1 arrested for allegedly contacting Kenyan firearm holders and directing them to send money for renewal of their certificates. A probe by Directorate of Criminal Investigations officers found that Mwangi posed as senior chief firearms licensing officer and made calls to firearm holders. Mwangi told the people he called that there was no need for them to go to the licensing office due to the coronavirus outbreak. Detectives then traced and arrested him in Ngong as no such order had been advertised. In the charge sheet, Maina has four counts of obtaining money by false pretences and two other charges including the possession of military attire and impersonating a person in a public office. He also obtained the following amount of money by false pretence from the following people as per the charge sheet: David Wangombe Sh3,200, Stephen Ng’ang’a Sh5,100 and Hassan Ole Naado Sh7,100. He was arrested by Kilimani DCI detectives and he was released by Sh30,000 police bond. The case proceeds on May 27.  (edited by o. owino)
