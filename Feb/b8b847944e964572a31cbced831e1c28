Embu Governor Martin Wambora has dismissed claims that Moi Stadium has been closed to block Deputy President William Ruto from using it on Sunday. The governor said the stadium has been closed for renovation. Wambora said residents had for a long time been complaining that the facility gets flooded in rainy seasons. The governor said this is the best time to renovate it since the rains have ceased. The modernisation involves drainage improvement, landscaping and the trimming of grass. Wambora said that Sports chief officer Samuel Wachira had, in a February 4 memo, announced that the facility would be closed for renovation. At the time, no one had expressed interest to use the stadium. "The CO brought to my attention a memo he had written to the effect that the stadium will be closed for renovation from February 10," he said. Ruto is expected to tour Embu county on Sunday, with the focus being Gatunduri Full Gospel Church at 10am. The stadium function is for a Muslim fundraiser. Wambora advised the organisers to find an alternative venue "as no one is allowed access during renovations, even myself". Politicians allied to the DP have been claiming on social media that the county government had deliberately closed the stadium to block Ruto from using it. Wachira said there are several other playing grounds being renovated including Gatinda, Makengi, Kathambaiconi, Kathari, Kathanjuri and Kathande in Runyenjes constituency. In Manyatta, the Iveche, Karurina, Kiandundu, Kagumori, Kigari Primary and Gituri Primary grounds will be improved for better use. Set for renovation in Mbeere are Gategi, Marimari, Mashamba, Kirie, Riandu, Kauraciri and Kiogogo. Edited by R.Wamochie
