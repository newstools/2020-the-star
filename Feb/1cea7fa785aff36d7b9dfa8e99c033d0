President Uhuru Kenyatta is at the White House to hold bilateral trade talks with his US counterpart Donald Trump. The Thursday meeting marks the second time Uhuru is meeting Trump, the first time being in 2018. The two will discuss ways to improve cooperation in trade. Asked if he plans to sign a trade agreement with Kenya, Trump said: "probably". Uhuru said, "We'll start looking into that". During the 2018 meeting, US firms made investments in the energy sector. Earlier on Thursday, Kenya and the US revised their bilateral air services agreement, facilitating the expansion of air freight services. The new move strengthens the already existing passenger traffic rights that allows national carrier Kenya Airways direct flights between Nairobi and New York. The new deal, which revises the initial agreement signed in Washington on June 18, 2008, was signed by Transport CS James Macharia and US assistant Secretary of State for Economic and Business Affairs Manisha Singh. “The revised bilateral air services agreement between Kenya and the USA will facilitate the expansion of air freight services, by allowing airlines from both countries to set up and operate air cargo hubs in either country,” CS Macharia wrote on Twitter. On Wednesday, Uhuru gave a talk at the Atlantic Council Forum where he addressed the issues of opportunities for the youth, dealing with terrorism and adopting homegrown solutions to issues. He cited the BBI as a homegrown solution.
