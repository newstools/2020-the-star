The government has been asked to construct a bridge at Ortum on the Kitale-Lodwar highway to ease transport. The bridge was washed away last year when a landslide hit the area and business people say they have incurred huge losses. A drift slab at a diversion that motorists have been using has also been washed way, rendering the road impassable. Road users from and to Kitale and Lowdar were stranded for several hours. West Pokot Governor John Lonyangapuo yesterday camped at Ortum to ensure the road was repaired, alternative passages opened and motorists stuck on the road proceeded with their journeys. Lonyangapuo urged the national government to prioritise reconstruction of the bridge at the highway, saying the losses incurred were massive. “There is no alternative road that links Kitale and Kapenguria towns to Lodwar and this has forced the business fraternity to incur huge losses,” he said. The governor also asked residents living in areas marked as unsafe during this rainy season to move to safer places. “There are several places that were marked unsafe for settlement and I urge people residing in the regions to move since the rains are expected to continue until the end of this month," he said. Passenger Mary Nekesa said they were forced to spend over six hours at Ortum after the drift was washed way. Nekesa, a fresh produce trader  in Lodwar town, said she might incur huge losses if she did not  proceed to Lodawr town. “I am from Kitale to buy my produce to sell on Monday in Lodwar. If I spend another night here, I will incur huge losses and I will not be able to repay my bank loan,” she said.
