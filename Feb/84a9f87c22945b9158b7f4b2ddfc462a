Bomet County will soon roll out a feeding programme for nursery school children, Governor Hillary Barchok has said. Barchok said the executive was closely working with the assembly to have more funds allocated to education department to cater for the programme. He said inasmuch as the county was keen on having better learning facilities, nutrition for children was essential for their development. “Early childhood development cannot be complete without the school feeding programme. Education is an aspect of development and so as we develop them physically, socially and emotionally we also have to ensure they get nutrition which is  for their health,” the governor said. Barchok spoke during the issuance of confirmation letters to 619 ECD teachers who have been on contract for the last six years.  He did not, however, state the amount of money they intend to set aside for the programme. Some 437 of the EACD tutors were placed under permanent and pensionable terms while 182 who are above the age of 45 years will have their contracts renewed. The education department has, however, failed to disclose the whereabouts of 281 teachers who had been hired alongside the group in 2013. The teachers are classified into three sections of certificate, diploma and degree holders and they have all been earning a flat rate salary of Sh10, 000 despite their qualifications. Certificate holders will now earn Sh 13, 100, diploma Sh 16,100 while those with degrees will get Sh21, 100.
