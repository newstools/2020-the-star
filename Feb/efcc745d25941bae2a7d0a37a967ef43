Eldoret town and environs have been hit by water shortage, something new to residents who have been enjoying services without rationing. But Eldoret Water and Sanitation (Eldowas), through managing director Paul Murgor, said the shortage and rationing will soon come to an end as they are building Sosian dam to provide 9,000 cubic metres. They are also building a Kesses water system to the Kesses area and environs, including part of Nandi county. He was addressing golfers during Lady Captain Prize Day at Eldoret Golf Club. Murgor said the company now depends on only two dams that supply the town and its environs — Chebara Dam in Elgeyo Marakwet county that provides about 24,000 cubic metres and Naiberi with 15,000 cubic metres. Demand is about 63,000 cubic meters within Eldoret but we are able to provide about 46,000 cubic meters gives a difference of 14,000 cubic meters. To breach that gap the Kipkaren water supply project under construction, providing an additional 24,000 cubic meters for the entire town. That is because that short of 14,000 there is rationing in some areas," Murgor said. However, Murgor said water bills will go up as they review tariffs every five years. “Tariffs are usually applied every five years. Then we apply to the regulator for our tariffs depending on the kind of development we want to do, expansion programs, operation and maintenance cost,” Murgor said. “After we get the green light, we go for public participation through the customers or consumers," he said. 'They give us feedback and I assure you that most consumers have no issues of the service they want, the incremental amount is very minimal,” he said. (Edited by V. Graham)
