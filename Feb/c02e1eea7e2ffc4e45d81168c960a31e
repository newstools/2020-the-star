A new swarm of locusts that has invaded most parts of Mwingi North is highly destructive. Initially, the swarms that flew into the vast Kitui county through Tseikuru in Mwingi North did not leave massive destruction on farms as they mainly fed on tree leaves. Following a change of pesticides by the government to a more effective chemical, the desert locusts have begun to die in Mwingi, Kitui. The government had been using a chemical which had no immediate knockdown after spray. It took between one and 72 hours for the insects to die, prompting the change. However, farmers of Ngungi area in Mumoni, Kitui, are still disappointed after the locusts invaded their farms and fed on all their crops. Esther Paul said her 20 acre-crops have been destroyed. She appealed to the government to compensate them for the losses. "The locusts invaded my farm when I had not yet harvested and everything has been destroyed," Esther lamented. Rose Kalunda said the invasion occurred on Thursday and has left all her crops destroyed, causing her untold mental anguish. "Following the heavy rains, I hoped to have enough produce to sell and feed my family but now the locusts have fed on all my yield," she said. Village elder John Mutemi said residents stand to suffer if the government does not step in to compensate them. But Government Spokesperson Cyrus Oguna said the government will only give people money to buy food once there is a shortage. "The government will first ensure there is plenty of food before issuing money to farmers who will be highly affected so the money issued will buy the food," Oguna said. He clarified that the government will not be issuing food but money. Oguna spoke on Thursday at Masinga airstrip where he inspected the chemicals used in tackling the locust problem.
