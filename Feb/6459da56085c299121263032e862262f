Kenya Under- 18 rugby have pulled out of the Capricorn Sevens slated for Namibia this weekend due to lack of air tickets. Kenya Rugby Union (KRU) director of development, Kikechi Kombo, confirmed that the team was to leave Nairobi yesterday but could not travel as there were no funds. The tickets were to cost Sh1.3 million. Namibia Rugby Union had promised to take care of accommodation and meals for the two-day tournament. Kombo said they had pinned their hopes on the government to meet their side of the bargain. "We were hoping to get the tickets from the government to facilitate the trip but this did not materialise,” added Kombo. He said they will focus on playing other age-grade tournaments in South Africa and Zimbabwe later in the year if funds are available. "It's discouraging for the boys but it's out of our control and we must focus on the future tournaments,” added Kombo. The Kenya Sevens U-18 head coach Paul Murungahas been in training with the team for the last two month. Among Countries confirmed for Capricorn show are Australia, South Africa, Botswana and hosts Namibia. South Africa won the 2019 edition of Capricorn tournament after beating Germany 29-5 in the final. They won all the six matches and amassed 294 points.
