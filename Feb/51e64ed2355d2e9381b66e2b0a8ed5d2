Central Organisation of Trade Union secretary general Francis Atwoli has told off critics suggesting that he had turned his back trade union affairs and instead stuck his neck in politics. Atwoli said he supports BBI because the report will create a peaceful environment for workers who are a soft target for electoral violence. "When an election is over and police are shooting people during protests, those are children of workers, those are families, and labourers," Atwoli said. Speaking in Kitui County on Saturday during the fourth BBI Consultative Forum, Atwoli said the document’s aim is to create an inclusive system of government which will represent the face of Kenya. Atwoli called for the dissolution of SRC to leave salary negotiation an affair of the employer and employee. The Cotu boss hit out at those opposed to the BBI pinning political violence and bloodshed at the centre of the country's problems. "The propaganda that BBI is just about creating positions for those in high places is ill because it is corruption at the top that is denying young people jobs, the theft in public offices is the cause of poverty," he said. He also underscored the need to expand the executive to reduce power conflict. "This arrangement where two people gang up in an election and they 'run away' with power has to come to an end... BBI has to expand the executive," Atwoli said.
