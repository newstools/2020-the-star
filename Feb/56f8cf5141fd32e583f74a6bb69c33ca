Chemelil Sugar factory is to resume operations on Thursday following a one-year closure. This is according to a circular from the acting head of agriculture signed by J.O. Osewe and dated February 21. The company stopped crushing cane in March 2019 because of financial challenges. The closure affected more than 20,000 contracted farmers from Nandi and Kisumu regions and businesses in neighbouring towns. Farmers have welcomed the decision, saying it was long overdue. Kenya Sugarcane Grower Association secretary general Richard Ogendo said they had been struggling following the closure. The management, led by managing director Gabriel Nyangweso, had in the past sought to assure workers and farmers that they were working round the clock to see the factory back on its feet. The company met with contractors, transporters and farmers on Monday and Tuesday.Â Its nucleus estate was expected to cut and deliver its cane from Tuesday in readiness for milling and that will go on until Sunday. By Monday next week, out-growers will start delivering their cane. For years, businesses have boomed in centres such as Chemelil Roundabout, Miwani, Kibigori, Kopere and Awasi owing to the firm's operations. Things took a turn for the worse when milling was stopped. With the latest announcement, residents have heaved a sigh of relief as they expect their businesses to bounce back. The circular was directed to cane farmers, transporters and contractors, among other stakeholders, and copied to the managing director and heads of departments. "This is to inform all our esteemed stakeholders that we shall assume milling operations on Thursday, February 27, 2020," it read. "I wish to thank you for your continued prayers and support for the success of Chemilil sugar company."
