 Residents of Sigomere ward in Siaya have welcomed the move to recall area MCA Eric Odawa who is facing abuse of office accusations. Led by Julius Owino, the ODM delegate in the area, the residents said they have been let down by their ward representative. Odawa has been accused of using his position to win tenders at the county government. He denied wrongdoing saying he only got tenders before he became MCA. “Yes I have done tenders with the county government but that was in 2014 before I was even elected as the Sigomere MCA,” Odawa said. Residents insist he should be recalled. “I always find it difficult to explain why the MCA I campaigned for has failed to deliver,” Owino said. Jared Opiyo said he was among the first person to sign the petition to recall the MCA. The process to recall Odawa was initiated by Siaya youth leader Kevin Dooso on Saturday. Opiyo said residents were only waiting for a by-election after signing the petition. “We want to ensure that Odawa is sent home as early as this year to serve as an example to many MCAs not performing their duties as expected," Opiyo said. Opiyo said they have no business with someone who is always absent from his ward. “That is not a leader. Must we die for him to visit us?” Opiyo said.  edited by p. obuya
