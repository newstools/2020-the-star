ODM party leader Raila Odinga has arrived for the public viewing of former president Daniel Arap Moi. Moi who died on February 4, 2020 has been lying-in-state in Parliament since Saturday. "Mzee was a freedom fighter, him and my dad were among the team of first Africans to be elected in 1957. I came to know him for the first time in 1958...he has done a lot of things for Kenyans," he said. Raila said he knew about the passing on of Moi while he was in the United States. "I have been at the AU and informed a number of states about the loss. and they will come. Mzee has lived a long life. Even the last time I met him, he was cheerful," he said. Raila arrived at 2:25 pm on Monday in Parliament Buildings accompanied by his wife Ida and Raila Junior. He carried his fly whisk which he used to pay his last respect. The AU envoy has not been in the country since public viewing of the body began on Saturday. Today is the last day for Kenyans to view the body of Moi. President Uhuru Kenyatta led the nation in the viewing with Cabinet secretaries gracing the occasion. The body of Moi has donned a different suit each of the three days it lied-in-state at Parliament Buildings. On Monday, which was the last day of public viewing, Moi’s body was dressed in a navy grey suit, brown shoes, a white shirt and a mustard yellow checked tie. Moi’s baton, famously known as Fimbo ya Nyayo, was in his right hand, unlike the previous days when it was placed beside the body together with a bible. On the first day of public viewing on Saturday, the body was dressed in a grey suit, a white shirt, brown shoes and a flowered tie.
