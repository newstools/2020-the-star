The Parliament has extended the viewing of Mzee Moi's body for an hour. The viewing was to end at 5pm on Monday but the Parliament extended the timing to 6pm. "The time of viewing the body by the public has been extended to 6pm...that is the reason why we have this sitting," Speaker Justin Muturi said on Monday during a special sitting in Parliament. Earlier, ODM party leader Raila Odinga arrived for the public viewing of former president Daniel Arap Moi. Moi who died on February 4, 2020 has been lying-in-state in Parliament since Saturday. Some Kenyans could not hold back tears and were overcome by grief and shock after viewing the body of the former President outside Parliament Buildings on the third day he lay in state. Some wailed uncontrollably while others fainted after queuing to view Mzee Moi's body on the last day of public viewing. It took the intervention of officials from St John Ambulance to help those who were engulfed in shock. Moi's son Baringo Senator Gideon Moi was seen later thanking those who were in the long queue as he made his way to his car outside Parliament Buildings.
