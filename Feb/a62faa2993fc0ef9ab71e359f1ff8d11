House committees have approved the nominations of Cabinet and Principal Secretaries appointed by President Uhuru Kenyatta in changes unveiled last month. This means that Health CS nominee Mutahi Kagwe and his Trade counterpart Betty Maina are only a step away from assuming the roles. The same is the case of PS nominees Enosh Momanyi (Physical Planning), Johnson Weru (Trade), Simon Nabukwesi (University Education and Research), Julius Juan (TVET), and Solomon Kitungu (Transport). The report of the Committee on Appointment chaired by Speaker Justin Muturi will be debated in the assembly this afternoon for subsequent voting by members. If the report is adopted, the nominees would be deemed as appointed and would be sworn in hence get the mandate to execute their roles. There were no petitions filed against the candidates ahead of the vetting. They were also cleared by the EACC, KRA among other state agencies. A key highlight of Kagwe’s vetting was the call for state officers to seek services in public hospitals as a way to prioritise their development. He also backed the idea of private wing at the Kenyatta National Hospital and promised to streamline the management of NHIF. In this, he revealed his intention to push for higher NHIF rates to expand the schemes’ reach and also the compulsion of state agencies to fully subscribe. For her part, Betty Maina claimed credit for the expansion of cotton production – the introduction of BT cotton and revitalisation of Rivatex. She says her mission in the ministry if approved, would be to root for value addition for various products for maximum earnings by farmers. Maina also pledged to bring more clarity on the contentious issue of tax refunds for manufacturers, said to be stifling the growth of industries. The Trade nominee further pledged to root for micro industries growth as opposed to the thinking that manufacturing is just about the big names.
