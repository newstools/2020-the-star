  A fisherman is feared to have drowned in Lake Oloidien in Naivasha on Monday after a hippo attack left their boat capsized. Three of his colleagues swam to safety. Last week, a hippo attacked and killed a hook and line fisherman at the Karagita beach.  Five fishermen have died in the lake either through hippo attacks or drowning. Lake Naivasha Boat Owners Association chairman David Kilo said the four were setting their nets when the hippo attacked. He said the hippos have of late become violent and were attacking without any provocation. “We have seen an increase in the number of foot-fishermen around the lake and in the process many have lost their lives due to hippo attacks,” Kilo said. Two weeks ago, a German tourist was attacked by a hippo around South Lake and seriously injured. Earlier, another foot-fisherman was attacked by a hippo near Kihoto estate. He died while undergoing treatment at the Naivasha Subcounty Hospital. Naivasha assistant county commissioner Mathioya Mbogo said the increase in attacks were worrying. He said his office was organising a meeting with KWS and other stakeholders to address the matter. “We had an incident over the weekend where an international tourist was seriously injured while other locals have been injured or killed in the past by the wild animals,” Mbogo said. Mbogo attributed some of the attacks to increased human activities around the lake, especially illegal fishermen.  edited by peter obuya
