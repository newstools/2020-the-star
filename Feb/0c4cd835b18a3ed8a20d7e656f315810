China's ambassador to Kenya Wu Peng has said Kenyan students or any residents currently in China are better off staying there. Wu Peng said this would ease the ways of monitoring , control and medication to ensure the spread of the coronavirus is contained. "This does not only apply to Kenyans, but it is easier to manage the spread of the virus if those in China stay put," he said. Wu said a World Health Organisation evaluation has established that all foreigners, including Kenyans in China are so far safe. He was speaking during Kenya Editors Guild meeting in Nairobi on Thursday. Wu said Kenyan traders who source their merchandise from China should not be in a hurry to go to China and could instead use various E- Commerce platforms to place their orders for shipment. The envoy said the country has allocated 67 billion Yuan(Sh964.7 billion) to tackle the virus with 20 tonnes of medicine delivered each hour. "The good news is that the newly reported cases have been on the decline since February 12," Wu said. Last week, Kenya's Ambassador to China Sarah Serem said Kenya will not risk further infection by jetting citizens from China due to theÂ coronavirus scare. Serem said it is better if Kenyans in China are monitored and protected as China finds a way to terminate the highly infectious virus. Deaths from coronavirus have hit more than 1,300. A case was confirmed in London on Wednesday. There are at least 90 Kenyan students in China. They had requested for help to return to Kenya, however the government said they would not be evacuated.
