Kenya Teachers Training Colleges Sports Association (KTTCSA) Nyanza region have hand picked teams to represent them at the national ball games. Nyanza region vice-chairman Timothy Atuti said they decided to handpick the teams due to lack of funds to hold the regional championships. “We did not admit the first years this time and this affected our budgets and the  regional championships. However, we hope things will improve next year because we are admitting first diploma students in September,” said Atuti, who is the principal of Borabu Teachers Training College in Nyamira County. He said Asumbi will represent the region in netball women, men's basketball men and hockey. Other representatives will be Migori (soccer men), Borabu (handball women) and Kenyenya (handball women). “We hope  the selected teams will represent us well. We have asked the respective colleges to use neighbouring schools and the ongoing tournaments to prepare their teams,” said Atuti. The national colleges ball games will be staged at Kagumo TTC in Nyeri County from March 28 to April 5. Kigari TTC will host National Paralympic and athletics championships from May 8 to 16. At the same time, the 4th edition of the Mbita High School tournament will be played this weekend in Homa Bay County. The tournament's coordinator Kennedy Atanga said Nyanza region boys' basketball champions Agoro Sare and hockey kings Homa Bay School are among 30 teams that have confirmed their participation. “So far, 30 teams have confirmed participation. However, we expect more than 50 teams to take part in the tournament,” added Atanga. Separately, the annual Ochieng Okumu tournament will also take place this weekend. The venues will be Maranda School, Nyamira Girls and Akoko secondary Bar Kowino. The the tournament will feature soccer, volleyball, handball, basketball, hockey and racquet games for both boys and girls.
