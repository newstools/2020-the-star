The Kisii county government is renovating Kisii Stadium for the national celebrations of Madaraka Day on June 1. Governor James Ongwae told the Star that shoddy work will not be tolerated. “My administration has embarked on serious renovations,” Ongwae said. He also said that major roads and streets in Kisii town will be recarpeted and street lighting improved ahead of the celebrations. “The opportunity to host the national event should not be taken for granted. We are going to do our best in improving some roads and streets,” the governor added. He also said that all garbage must be collected to ensure the town and environs are clean to ensure the health of residents. “I urge hotel owners to ensure that the environments of their premises are clean and attractive for guests," he said.
