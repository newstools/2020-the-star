Residents of Enabelbel area in Narok North subcounty will soon forget their water problems after the government put up a Sh8 million project to supply the commodity. The borehole sunk by the EwasoNyiro South Development Authority can serve 1,200 households daily, two schools and a milk cooler. Devolution PS Charles Sunkuli said the water project will boost livelihoods and reduce poverty as the time wasted searching for water will be used for economic gains. Sunkuli spoke during the commissioning of the project at Ntimama Mixed Secondary School on Friday. He was accompanied by county commissioner Samuel Kimiti. “We all know that water is a basic need and that our mothers would waste a lot of time and energy looking for water in long distances,” Sunkuli said. He said the availability of the water will help reduce cases of early marriage and pregnancies as young girls were exposed to evil men in their search for water. “The girls were travelling up to three kilometres looking for water hence endangering their lives,” he said. Kimiti said that the state is using a multi-agency approach to resolve critical challenges facing the mwananchi. “We involve everybody in identifying our challenges and engage all the relevant departments in resolving them,” Kimiti said. Margaret Sankale could not hide her joy, saying she would spend over three hours a day looking for water. She added that during drought, the situation becomes worse as they would travel up to five kilometres in a bid to get the precious commodity. “We are short of words on how to thank our government. This is a double honour to have clean water near our homesteads. We can now sleep for longer comfortable hours knowing that the struggle to look for water is a gone story,” she said.
