A motorist accused of running over and killing a traffic police officer was yesterday charged at a Milimani court and released on bail. After a seven-day detention, Edward Njoroge was charged with causing the death of Peter Rerimoi by dangerous driving. The charge sheet says Njoroge, a matatu driver, knocked down Rerimoi and ran over him along the Southern Bypass within Nairobi county. Njoroge was carrying plastics when he was flagged down by Rerimoi on January 28 at around 4pm on the Southern Bypass. Langâ€™ata OCPD Gregory Mutiso said the officer signalled the 14-seater matatu driver to stop and asked him to hand over his license while holding onto the door handle. The suspect refused to hand over the document and a tussle ensued, during which he engaged his gear and began to drive off. Njoroge is also charged with failing to stop after an accident. He is further charged with failing to comply with the conditions for the issuance of a license contrary to the law. Court papers say Njoroge drove the matatu at a maximum speed of 103km per hour while carrying plastic goods in contravention of the law. Under a road service license issued by the NTSA, he was authorised to drive the motor vehicle at a maximum speed of 80km per hour while carrying fare-paying passengers. An additional charge indicates that Njoroge drove the motor vehicle while it was unroadworthy as per the certificate of examination and the test of the vehicle. Njoroge denied all the charges preferred against him and sought for lenient cash bail and bond terms. Magistrate Martha Nanzushi released him on a Sh600,000 bond with an alternative cash bail of Sh300,000. The matter will be mentioned on February 20 for further directions on hearing dates.
