World 3000m steeplechase record holder Beatrice Chepkoech smashed the Kenyan Indoor 3000m record in Dusseldorf, Germany on Tuesday night. Chepkoech clocked 4:02.09—the fastest in the world this season— to slice 0.12  seconds from the national record she set in Glasgow in 2018. She also took more than two seconds from the meeting record she set the  same year. Ethiopia's Axumawit Embaye finished second in her season's best of 4:02.96 thus  earning her enough points to maintain her lead in the Tour standings. Uganda's Winnie Nanyondo was third in 4:06.13, a national indoor record for her country. Bouncing back from a disappointing fourth-place finish in Karlsruhe, Chepkoech clearly  dominated the race, upping the tempo as she broke away from the pacesetter with three-and-a-half laps to go. Only Embaye, the winner in Karlsruhe, tried to give her a chase. However,  Chepkoech was relentless, clicking off nearly identical laps of 32.07 and 32.05 over the fifth and sixth lap. The seventh, nearly a second quicker at 31.25, cushioned Kenya's lead and ultimately put it out of reach. Vincent Kibet finished a distant third in the 1,500 meters in 3:39:49. The race was won by Norway's Filip Ingrebrigsten in a dominant performance. The Norwegian clocked 3:36.32 ahead of Belgian Ismael Debjani, who was a distant second in 3:39.05. Kenya's Bethwell Birgen finished third in the 3000m.  Birgen was involved in a titanic battle with Ethiopia's Selemon Barega, forcing him to drop to third in 7:36:21. Barega powered past Birgen on the home straight in another world lead, indoor personal best and meet record of 7:35.71. His Ethiopian compatriot Getnet Wale sneaked in for second place in 7:36.03 Filip Mihaljevic produced the finest indoor competition of his career, dominating the shot put and wrestling the world lead from Tomas Stanek in the process. Competing in his 2020 debut, the towering Croat threw beyond 21 metres on four of his five measured efforts, capped by a 21.52m effort in the second round to break the national record. He was fairly consistent as well, hitting 21.37m in the second round and 21.43m in the sixth. Mijahalovic, the world indoor bronze medallist in 2016, wasn't far from his 21.84m outdoor best set last year. Poland's Konrad Bukowiecki was second with 20.92m, just ahead of Stanek, who reached 20.89m in round three.
