 The construction of the 135-kilometre Lamu-Garsen road has resumed a few days after the contractor suspended work following an attack by al Shabaab militants. Four militants torched H-Young construction company's excavator and a lorry on February 9 at Milihoi, a notorious terror hotspot along the road. The torched lorry was ferrying cement from Mombasa to the construction camp. Both the excavator driver and the truck driver escaped unhurt and hid in the bush from where they were rescued by the Kenya Defence Forces personnel. The Sh10.8 billion road is a national government project. Workers had since the attack vowed not to return to the base until their security was assured. On Tuesday, Lamu county commissioner Irungu Macharia confirmed that work had resumed. Macharia said he and H-Young management had discussed the issue of security and assured workers of adequate security. “They have agreed to go back to work and we have assured them of their security. We have made adequate plans to top up what we had in place. Their safety remains paramount,” Macharia said. The KDF and other security agents have intensified patrols on the road. China Communication Construction Company sent over 2,000 workers on compulsory leave after the January 7 attack on the Manda-Magogoni naval and US military bases by al Shabaab. Work has since resumed. CCCC is involved in the construction of a LAPSSET project in Lamu.
