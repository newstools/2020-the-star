Impeached Governor Ferdinand Waititu has suffered yet another setback after a magistrate's court declined to bar two crucial witnesses from testifying in his Sh588 million graft case. Magistrate Thomas Nzioki on Tuesday said the court would not be promoting the rule of law if it shut out the evidence without a hearing. "All state organs and public officers need to promote the rule of law as it's among the national values and principles of governance. In my view promoting this can't be attained when we shut out the evidence," he said. Nzioki said whether a person is competent to give evidence is a question of fact and for the court to decide during trial. Waititu wanted Faith Njeri Harrison and Justus Bundi Kinoti expunged from the record of prosecution witnesses. He argued that they held senior and influential positions at the county government of Kiambu as director of supply chain management and chief officer in charge of finance department respectively. “The state witnesses have duly acknowledged in their respective witness statements that they played fundamental roles in the transactions touching the substratum of the suit. They made the final decision or approval in their respective docket. They should be here as accused persons not witnesses,"  Waititu said. He was apprehensive that the evidence adduced by the state witnesses shall be skewed and designed to infringe on his constitutional rights, culminating in an unfair trial.
