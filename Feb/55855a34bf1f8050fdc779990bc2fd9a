Communities living in more than 80 Coastal villages have pleaded with the national government to overrule the mangrove harvesting ban in Kwale county. Villagers say it has been two years since the ban went into effect and their livelihoods are dying. Speaking on Monday at Gazi in Msambweni, the villagers said the ban has put their livelihood at stake. They said it was unfair that the ban was lifted in Lamu 'while the locals in South Coast who have largely invested on mangrove forests are sidelined'. Makongeni resident Juma Zubeir said they offered land wholeheartedly for the mangrove trees to be planted "but are now regretting their generosity because they are not getting benefits". “We won’t ever again give land for any project because we have seen the consequences,” he said. He said their efforts to conserve and protect mangrove trees — planting new ones to replace those they cut —  have been wasted as they earn nothing from it. Ali Kikambala said he lost Sh180,000 when the ban was imposed. “I had my cargo ready at the harbour waiting to be dispatched, but we were forced to leave logs there to rot,"  he said. Residents accused the Kenya Marine and Fisheries Research Institute of misleading them. Kikambala said the institute had promised to talk to the government to ease the ban. KMFRI officer Dr James Cairo said they don't have the mandate to authorise cutting of mangrove trees. He said, however, a government letter has ordered them to partner with KFS in looking at the status of the mangrove. Areas affected by the ban include Makongeni, Shirazi, Vanga, Majoreni, Gazi, Bodo and others. Msambweni MP Suleiman Dori urged the national government to hasten the process of assessing the mangrove. "There are those who had their cargo ready to transport before the ban, such people should be authorised to sell them," he said. .,"he sad. " Edited by R.Wamochie
