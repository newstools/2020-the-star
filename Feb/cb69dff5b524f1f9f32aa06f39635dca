Debutants Makueni Bees need defensive improvement to scale high up the table in the Kenya Handball Federation national league, coach Gerald Juma has said. The Bees, who are students of Mbooni Boys High School in Makueni County, have popped up with some impressive performances to rank ninth in the 25-team league. Last weekend, they won three out of their four fixtures, but Juma still believes they have a long way to go in their pursuit of a top 10 finish. "Our focus now is to upgrade at the back. The team is leaking goals and we need to control that. We have so far proved that we can compete against quality teams," said Juma. "We narrowly lost to Strathmore because of inexperience last weekend although this season is all about testing the waters. Next season will fight for a top-six finish to play in the Super Cup." Juma, who doubles up as Rangers' coach, added:Â "The team is composed of players who played in the International Handball Federation IHF trophy. Others are in the National Olympics Committee of Kenya NOCK elite under-15 team. In three year's time, it will be a super team with the capacity to compete with the likes of Egypt on the continental front." Juma is banking on the Bees' experience in the league to win county competitions beginning today.
