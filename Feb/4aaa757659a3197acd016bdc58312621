A man at a Nairobi court attempted to use a walking stick to attack a certain female magistrate. When he was arrested by the police officer guarding the courts, he shouted that he must "beat her whether it rains or not". “I must beat her any day even if you block me from doing so now. My stick, my protection!" he shouted. Some officers had initially spotted the man at the gate and tried to block him, accusing him of being drunkard but he convinced them and proceeded to the courtrooms. “I am not a drunkard, my legs are shaking. ow can I be drunkard and I used my alcoholic dose at 8am?" he posed. A man bragged of having bribed a magistrate at a Western court with Sh100, 000 so that he convicts his step-brother. A mole told the Star that on Monday, the head of prosecution at the court insulted the suspect in front of the complainant, his step-bother, and told him he was going to be jailed. In a rejoinder, the suspect told him that he was aware of the money his brother was distributing in court. The Star is now waiting to see how the case will end. Go home but avoid disturbing the court sessions, magistrate told a Rasta man in a Nairobi court. This came  after a loud Mix Me Down reggae song played in the court room, as the session was on going. Upon asking whose phone was ringing, a short but energetic man stood up and said that it was his. “Stand up! Do you have a case in this court?" The magistrate asked. In his response, the man said his brother was in police cells, and was he was waiting for him to be charged with possessing 11 rolls of bhang. “Stand up and go home or I make join your brother in the cells. Never come and disrupt the peace of the court again,” the magistrate said.
