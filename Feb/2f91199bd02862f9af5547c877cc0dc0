In 2017, Unilever sold its margarine and spreads business to US private equity firm KKR for $8.04 billion (Sh824 billion) to concentrate on faster-growing products in a deal that was closed mid-2018. The capital firm invests in various sectors across the world. Five years earlier, the global fast-moving goods consumer goods firm sold its Kimbo and Cowboy cooking fat brands to rival Bidco. Kenya is the first country to expand Blue Band into new categories of all the markets Upfield operates Upfield which has a manufacturing plant in Nairobi purchases over 2000 tonnes of rapeseed for its Blue Band Cold Press Canola oil from 3,400 Upfield accredited small scale farmers in Mt Kenya Region. This number is expected to increase to over 7000 farmers in the coming years as demand for Canola oil drives increased production.
