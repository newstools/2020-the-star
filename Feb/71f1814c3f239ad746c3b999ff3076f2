The DCI has held two more people in connection with the murder of a woman suspected to have been killed by her husband and his brother in Nairobi on February 5. They are lab technologist Wilson Wawire and Nicholas Otieno — picked up on suspicion of conspiring to kill Priscila Cherono on Wednesday night. Their arrest has raised the number of suspects seized to three — widower Washington Onyango, his brother Otieno, and Wawire. A motive has not been established. Priscilla was killed inside a rented house in Kioi area where she lived with her husband and his brother. In an affidavit filed before the Makadara courts, detective corporal Nickolas Gikundi of Kayole DCI offices said Wawire travelled from Kaloleni to the deceased’s house to administer first aid “and for reasons known to him failed to report the matter to the police”. He filed the affidavit in support of an application to detain Otieno and Wawire at the Kayole police station for 10 days. Corporal George Wamai on Friday obtained an order to detain Cherono’s husband until February 17 to conclude investigations. The two brothers were the last to be seen with the deceased before she was taken to Avenue Hospital in Greenspan Estate for treatment, but she was pronounced dead. He had injuries all over her body. A postmortem has not been carried out nor has a mental assessment of the suspects. (Edited by V. Graham)
