The prospect of losing five players will not affect the performance of Lakers, according to coach Austin Tuju. Lakers have lost players through transfers while others have academic and work commitments to look up to. The Kisumu-based side who will be in their second season in the top tier league, remain confident that the playing unit has an obligation to maintain the high standards previously set. Lakers finished fourth in their inaugural season in the top-flight. "Lakers have been a developing wing for other clubs but we are not worried about such breaks and outflow because it does create room for constant development of future players." " We are used to this situation because last year we lost seven and in 2018 we had lost eight," he said. This year, the club has brought seven new players on board. Meanwhile, Lakers have declared their intention of challenging for the women's Premier League title this season after winning three trophies in pre-season. The Kisumu-based side won the Eregi, Kisumu school and Nyamira tournaments in a span of three weeks. "There is still work to be done even as the team tries to harness the girls' potential," said the coach. The team is working on different formations as they prepare to counter their tough opponents. "We are going for the crown because the team has the ability to compete. We are also working on various aspects of our game.  We are bound to make a few changes in tactics because the squad we have is adaptive."
