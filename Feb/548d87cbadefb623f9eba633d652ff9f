A showdown looms after Embu Governor Martin Wambora closed all stadiums ahead of a visit by Deputy President William Ruto. Ruto is expected to hold a meeting in Moi Stadium in Embu on Sunday and has already confirmed the function. But Wambora who learnt about the meeting immediately closed the venue and all other possible venues for 'renovations'. A source told the Star that the  Stadium has been closed for renovations as efforts to modernise the facility are still in motion. "The stadium will be open for use from the second weekend of March this year," the source said. However, Wambora dismissed reports that Moi stadium has been closed to block Ruto from using it. "I am surprised that some individuals are saying that I have closed Moi stadium to block some individuals from using it. This is not the case.The chief officer in charge of the stadium has brought to my attention a memo he had written to the effect that the stadium will be closed for renovation, from 10th February,” Wambora said. Embu County's Chief Officer for Youth Empowerment and Sports, Samuel Wachira said the stadium has been closed to allow the construction of a proper drainage system to avert flooding whenever it rains. "We are also landscaping and trimming the grass," he said. The county government has maintained 20 playgrounds to encourage and nurture talents among the youth. The playgrounds being maintained include Gatinda, Makengi, Kathambaiconi, Kathari, Kathanjuri and Kathande in Runyenjes Constituency. In Manyatta, Karurina playground, Iveche, Kiandundu, Kagumori, Kigari primary and Gituri primary playgrounds are being maintained. Kiogogo, Kirie, Riandu, Kauraciri and Munyori playgrounds are also in the process of maintenance. Others include Gategi, Mashamba and Marimari playgrounds.
