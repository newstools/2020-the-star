Kisii MCAs have urged the national government to fund the repairs and maintenance of donor projects. Bobaracho MCA Ibrahim Ongubo said for the sustainability of any donor-funded project, the exchequer should inject money for their maintenance. “It is an utter waste of donor money if there is no corresponding effort to repair and maintain any of these projects,” Ongubo said. He spoke when he presented a report by his Lands, Physical Planning and Urban development committee in the assembly. The MCA said there is a constant need for proper evaluation of all projects against the conditions set for them to avoid missing out on future grants. The committee further proposed that donors also fund projects beyond the municipalities. It said more towns outside the municipalities like Kisii deserve attention to stem migration. “If done it will enhance development in the grassroots and stir the economies in those areas too,” Ongubo said. The committee wants private developers who have encroached road reserves across the county to be evicted to allow road expansion. The committee observed that some works were behind schedule due to wanton encroachment by private developers. The team said some delays were unacceptable and accused contractors of dragging their feet. “There were many municipality roads that are behind schedule and it is unacceptable if they will not be reprimanded,” Ongubo said. He urged the county government to pay contractors based on the work done and involve experts to evaluate the projects and ensure quality before paying. “We found some contractors were paid fully before they completed projects while others were paid little, leading to the slow progress in implementing projects,” Ongubo said.
