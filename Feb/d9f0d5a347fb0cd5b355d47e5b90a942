Mombasa residents have been hit by water shortage after the Coast Water Services Board cut supply. CSWB chief executive officer Jacob Torrut said the Mombasa county government owes them millions of shillings in pending bills. Torrut told the Star water supply to Mombasa was disconnected due to non-payment of bills by Governor Hassan Joho’s administration. “The only reason Mombasa does not have water supply is because of non-payment of bills. We need that money to pay for the electricity, cost of operations, our staff and many other things,” he said. However, the CWSB boss did not give the exact amount of money Mombasa county owes them. “I’m not in the office. I’m away on leave. I cannot say the exact amount of money that Mombasa county owes Coast Water. However, they need to pay the debt before water supply resumes,” Torrut said. He said Kilifi county had a similar problem but the county government has since paid part of its debt and water supply has resumed. “It does not mean they have to pay the entire debt, but they can go to the office and discuss with us on what they are able to pay and water supply will definitely resume,” Torrut said. Mombasa Water and Sanitation Company managing director Anthony NJaramba confirmed that CWSB disconnected water supply. “It is being sorted. We expect water supply to resume in the county by end of this week or early next week,” Njaramba said.
