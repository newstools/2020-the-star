The Building Bridges Initiative meeting that was to be held in Meru on February 14 has been pushed to February 29. The Mt Kenya leaders have heeded to President Uhuru Kenyatta’s directive to postpone all BBI forums after the death of former President Daniel Moi. Moi died on February 4 and will be buried on Wednesday, February 12, 2020. Meru Governor Kiraitu Murungi said they were ready to host the forum but had to call it off to mourn the former head of state. "The BBI meeting will be held on February 29 at Kinoru Stadium. We will have a Central Kenya conference the day before the BBI forum with all leaders from Embu, Meru, Tharaka Nithi, Nyeri, Laikipia, Kirinyaga, Nyandarua, Nakuru, Nairobi, Kiambu and Murang’a for a final declaration,” Kiraitu said. Kiraitu said Meru, Tharaka Nithi and Embu leaders have already had consultative meetings and came up with some resolutions to present during the forum. “We must ask ourselves what should be in the BBI, this is the Kinoru declaration, entailing our issues that need to be tackled and catered for as Mt Kenya leaders,” he said. Last month, Agriculture CS Peter Munya drummed up support for BBI, saying it would end bloodshed witnessed in the country after general elections and help build peace and inclusivity in leadership. “Will BBI prevent someone from vying for President? I wonder why some MPs say BBI is meant to block one person. It will even create more seats.” “We will not be intimidated not give genuine opinion on constitution changes only because I do not hold a political seat.  I have a constitutional right,” Munya said. BBI forums championed by former PM Raila Odinga have been held in Kisii, Mombasa, Kakamega and Kitui.
