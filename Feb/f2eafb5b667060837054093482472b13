Swarms of the desert locusts have been spotted in North Pokot sub-county and parts of of Sigor sub county in West Pokot County. Yesterday, the locusts swam through Akuronoi, Mbaru, Akiramet , Kamula as they headed to Uganda. Locals, who are now living in fear, have raised concern that the invasion is a threat to pasture and food security in the arid area. North Pokot  Deputy County commissioner Martin Mbae confirmed the infestation of the locust saying that the insects were spotted on Sunday and Monday in the region. Mbae said the insects have caused no mass destruction in the region since they swam toward Uganda. “We have urged residents to immediately report even they spot them flying in the sky,” he said. Most farmers in the region have expressed fear that their animals may lack pastures if the locust invade the region. One of the farmers from Kamula, Peter Akuroni, said they were happy when the locusts did not land in the region. “We have some pastures in this region and we have not migrated to Uganda  as compared to past years in search for pastures  since we experienced rains this year. When we saw the locusts we had lost hope but we thank God they passed,” he said. County Executive Member for Agriculture Joel Ngasia said that county officers are on the ground to establish the real condition. “Our officers are on the ground to establish the affect areas. We have urged our farmers to immediately report exact location they see the locusts so that immediate intervention can be taken,” he said.
