An Embu court has canceled 9,232 title deeds issued to individuals in the disputed Mwea settlement scheme and ordered fresh distribution. Land and Environment judge Yuvinalis  Angima declared all the titles issued for over 44,000 hectares were null and void. Fresh allocation of the scheme will be conducted under the supervision of the county commissioner in consultation with the community, the court directed. The allocation was done in 2016 by the National Land Commission in conjunction with the county government of Embu. But the distribution sparked violence that led to the death of one man and maiming of eight others. The judge's ruling followed an application by a section of the Mbeere Council of Elders (known as Ngome) who contested the distribution. They went to court  after Interior CS Fred Matiang'i  and his Lands counterpart Faridah Koroney suspended settlement of the beneficiaries of the land following the fatal chaos that erupted in 2018. The elders applied for cancellation of the title deeds of beneficiaries who had more than five hectares, saying during the allocation they were allocated large chunks of land against the initial agreement. The elders welcomed the ruling, saying it opened the way for fair distribution of the land. Makima MCA Philip Nzangi whose ward covers a section of the scheme and his nominated counterpart Edna Muisyo welcomed the ruling. Nzangi said most of his residents had been displaced following corrupt subdivision of the land.He would ensure all genuine residents benefitted, he said.
