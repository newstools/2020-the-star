The Directorate of Criminal Investigations is holding a woman suspected to be part of a theft syndicate targeting M-Pesa shops in Naivasha, Kiambu and Nakuru towns. Eunice Njoki Macharia was taken to the Kamukunji police station after Serious Crimes Unit officer Damaris Matiri obtained orders to hold her for five days. Matiri said in an affidavit that Macharia is suspected to have committed the offences jointly with others who are at large. She said Macharia has information concerning the incidents which happened between February 5 and 10 in seven shops in the three towns. Macharia was arrested on February 18 in Githurai 44 on suspicion of having committed several offences and stealing from Mpesa shops in the counties. “At the time of the arrest, the respondent was found with mobile phones which are suspected to have been involved in the commission of the offences,” Matiri said. The affidavit was filed at Makadara courted presided over by magistrate is Heston Nyaga. But Macharia said she owns the three phones. The suspect is wanted in several police stations where the thefts have been reported. Matiri said the suspect is likely to interfere with the ongoing investigations if released on bail. Nyaga allowed the suspect to be detained for five days.
