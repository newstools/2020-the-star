Cutchi Leva will be seeking their maiden win over Kanbis and Swamibapa when they face two powerhouses in the Nairobi Invitational Twenty20 Cricket League this weekend. Since being promoted to the top local league over a decade ago, the Nairobi West-based Cutchi Leva haven’t been able to win against the two arch-rivals. As they play away at Nairobi Jefferys and Eastleigh High School today and tomorrow respectively, skipper Niraj Vekaria believes it’s time they ended their poor run against the two giants. He said the availability of all his players will be a key factor in the two matches. “I think this is the time to end our poor run. It’s not a good feeling to keep losing. We have all our players available and with that, we should be able to be competitive,” Vekaria said. He added: “Last year, we came close to winning even without some of our players. With their availability, I am confident we can pull a surprise,” he said. Swamibapa and Kanbis return to action on the back of opening wins last weekend against Kongonis and Ruaraka respectively. Emmanuel Bundi, who was the star player in Swamibapas win over Kongonis, expects a tough match despite their visitors getting into the match as underdogs. “We should not underrate them in whichever way. We have to stay focused and throw everything at them. We want to maintain a good run and any slip up will cost us,” Bundi said.
