The government has declared Tuesday a public Holiday. "This is to allow Kenyans to attend the memorial service of the late president Daniel arap Moi," Head of Public Service Joseph Kinyua announced. The memorial service will be held at Nyayo Stadium. Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiangi is expected to gazette the holiday to that effect. Addressing journalists on Thursday, Kinyua said Moi's body shall lie-in-State in Parliament from Saturday, February 8 to Monday, February 10, 2020. President Uhuru Kenyatta will lead the nation on Saturday in the viewing of the body, as well as the paying the last respects. The public viewing at Parliament Buildings will be done on Saturday, Sunday and Monday between 8.00 am to 5.00 am. On February 4, 2020, Uhuru announced a period of national mourning. The Head of State ordered the flag of Kenya to be flown half-mast as an expression of sorrow. Baringo senator Gideon Moi told Kenyans that Moi died peacefully at 5.20 am.
