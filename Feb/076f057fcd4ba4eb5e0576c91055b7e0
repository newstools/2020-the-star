Residents and leaders of west Pokot County wIll remember former President Daniel Moi for three things: Security, education and Christianity. West Pokot Governor John Lonyangapuo said the former president played a major role in uniting communities in the North Rift region. Lonyangapuo said that many warriors reformed and abandoned cattle rustling after the former president intervened. "The former president helped in ensuring that there is peace along our major borders in North Rift counties. Many warriors abandoned cattle rustling and are now Christians because of him," he said. The governor said that Moi was a strong Christian and every time leaders visited him, he would pray before any meeting. "Even after his retirement there were two Bible's on his table, the Kiswahili version was always on his right hand and the English version was on his left hand. He was a prayerful person,” he said. Lonyangapuo said Moi was his mentor in politics. “Moi has played a major role in my political career, he coached me since I joined politics,” he said. He said a lesson he learnt from Moi was forgiveness. “As leaders, we should always be ready to ask for forgiveness. A real leader should always ask for forgiveness,” he said. Masol MCA Ariong’o Lopurina said Mo played a major role in ensuring children from pastoralist communities attended in school. “The President helped pastoralists realize the importance of education,” he said.
