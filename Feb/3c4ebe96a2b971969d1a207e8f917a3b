Retired President Daniel Arap Moi might have died at the age of 102 or 103. This is according to his press secretary Lee Njiru. Speaking to Citizen TV on Tuesday, Njiru said Moi told him not to go by what was in his ID. "Let me clarify that mzee Moi was not 96 years old. He was about 102 or 103 years. He started walking using a walking stick. Then a wheelchair. I have seen a steady decline in his health since then," Njiru said. Njiru added that Moi took care of him and protected him. Earlier,Â  President Uhuru Kenyatta issued a presidential proclamation announcing the passing on of the retired President on Tuesday. Last month, doctors at the Nairobi Hospital were forced to put Moi back on life support machines. His health situation has not been stable since he was rushed to the facility in October last year.
