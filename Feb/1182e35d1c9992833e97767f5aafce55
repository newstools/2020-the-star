Global payments solutions provider Flutterwave is seeking to open up international markets to local businesses by eradicating payment hurdles that make companies shy away from pursuing deals abroad.

Last year, the payment gateway processed 107 million transactions worth $5.4 billion. Speaking in Nairobi where he hosted CEOs meet, the firm's CEO Olugbenga Agboola said their aim is to make it easy for businesses to make and collect payments. ''What we want is to empower African businesses to trade internationally and not have to worry about how the payments will be processed by leaving that to us,”  Agboola said. He revealed that the company will work to empower SMEs to access more markets and individuals to remit and receive money from anywhere in the world. The company is looking to increase its partnerships in Kenya by offering a reliable payment infrastructure that will connect local businesses as well as individuals to the global economy.
