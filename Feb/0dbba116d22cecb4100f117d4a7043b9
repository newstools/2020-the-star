Director of Criminal Investigations George Kinoti has gone to the scene in which a police officer was found dead. The cop's body was on Thursday discovered inside the servant quarter he lives in at Imara Daima's Villa Franca estate by his house help. The cop is suspected to have been attached to Harambee Annex and have been on duty when the Sh39 billion fake military arms deal was being signed by former Sports CS Rashid Echesa and two businessmen. A Ceska pistol was recovered from the single room the officer lived in. The bullet that killed the cop hit the cheek and exited through the head, officers at the scene said. The body had started decomposing and it is suspected he died a day or two ago. The officer's body was moved to City Mortuary.
