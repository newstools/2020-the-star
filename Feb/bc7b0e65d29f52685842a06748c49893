Turkana Deputy Governor Peter Lotethiro has urged the national government to add more planes to spray locusts. He lamented that swarms of locusts have invaded all subcounties, depleted pasture and ruined livelihoods. Turkana is the second-largest county after Marsabit, covering 77,000km square. Its subcounties are Turkana Central, Turkana North, Turkana East, Turkana South, Turkana West, Loima and Kibish. "We thank the national government for providing a plane that is currently spraying locusts in the region. But Turkana is a vast county and one plane may not be able to cover all regions," he said at his office in Lodwar. Lotethiro said the desert locusts are a threat to food security as they ravage pasture. Pastoralism is the economic mainstay of residents. He said the swarms must be dealt with before they cause devastating losses. Agriculture executive Christopher Aletia said the county has been infested with both tree and desert locusts. He said they spent Sh30 million last year to spray tree locusts but the government did not give any support. "The desert locusts were spotted in Elelea and other parts of Turkana East. When our team reached the ground, they had left the region to neighbouring counties," he said. The county minister said they later learnt that the swarms of desert locusts split in two directions to Katilia in Turkana East and Kerio in Turkana Central. The mature yellow desert locusts have been spotted in all parts of Turkana, he added. â€œWe were told not to fear the yellow locusts because they fly with winds, but they have been laying eggs that hatch. The nymphs are now on the ground and they are dangerous," he said.
