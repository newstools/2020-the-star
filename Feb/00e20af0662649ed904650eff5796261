The Football Kenya Federation Electoral Board on Friday closed the window for submission of delegates who will vote at the upcoming Elections. The board is going full-steam with plans for the polls in spite of a looming ruling on March 17 by the Sports Disputes Tribunal on a petition lodged by the Football Kenya Federation challenging the Sports Registrar's demand that elections can only go on after full compliance with the Sports Act. The eligible clubs list was published earlier this month by the Kentice Tikolo-led board on the boardâ€™s website. Branches were expected to submit details of delegates set to vote before the Friday deadline. The Board will thereafter scrutinize the list and publish a preliminary register on February 29. "A two-day window for disputes in regards to the voter register will then be opened until March 1 and if need be, aggrieved appellants can further seek recourse at the Appeals Committee on March 2," read a board statement. The final list of delegates is set to be published on March 3. County elections have been scheduled for March 14 while the national exercise is slated for March 27.
