The world is mourning 'Queen Of Katwe' actress Nikita Pearl Waligwa. The 15-year-old Ugandan actress died after battling a brain tumour. Nikita played the role of Gloria in the film, while Oscar award-winning star Lupita Nyong'o played Harriet, mother of Gloria's best friend, Phiona. Lupita spent a lot of time with Nikita during the shoot and when the news got to her on the young girl’s death, she paid tribute to her on Instagram. “It is with great sadness that I post about the passing of Nikita Waligwa, the sweet, warm, talented girl whom I worked with on the film, 'Queen Of Katwe'. She played Gloria with such vibrancy. In her real life, she had the enormous challenge of battling brain cancer," Lupita wrote. "My thoughts and prayers are with her family and community as they come to terms with having to say goodbye so soon. May she truly rest in peace. May it be well with her soul.” 'Queen of Katwe' was screened at the 2016 Toronto International Film Festival. The film had a limited release in the US on September 23, 2016, before a general release on the 30th the same month.
