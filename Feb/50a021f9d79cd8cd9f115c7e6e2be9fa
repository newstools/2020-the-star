Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni has eulogised the late, former President Daniel Moi as a great leader and lover of East Africa. Museveni, during his tribute at Nyayo National Stadium on Tuesday, said patriotism, love for East Africa and capacity to reconcile are the traits that enabled Moi to be a great leader. Museveni reiterated that Mzee Moi, together with first president Jomo Kenyatta, had a remedy for Kenya's ailing problems. "Mzee Moi na wale waliokua katika Kadu  walijiunga na Kanu  mwaka wa 1964 wakafanya chama chimoja hii inamaanisha walikua wameshagundua umuhimu wa umuja," he said. (Mzee Moi and fellow Kadu members joined Kanu in 1964 to form one party meaning they had discovered the importance of unity). Museveni reiterated Moi's participation in ensuring peace and unity in Kenya. He said that Moi had disclosed to him that he was eyeing leadership of the East African Federation. "He has gone, but we who have remained behind should take some of those useful lessons," Museveni said. President Uhuru Kenyatta in his tribute applauded Moi's efforts to improve the education sector as well as the Nyayo free milk programme. Uhuru said Moi's active promotion of the place of women in society and efforts to promote environmental conservation were second to none. He recounted how Moi burned ivory worth millions of dollars to show his dedication to conservation. Uhuru also recognised Moi's fearless pursuit against terrorists, saying he drove to the scene of the attack in 1998. "We have far more in common than we do in differences. It is this that made Moi to team up with other Presidents such as Benjamin Mkapa to spearhead the revival of the EAC," Uhuru said.
