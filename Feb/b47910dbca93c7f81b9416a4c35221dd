Comedian Churchill and the Laugh Industry have partnered with Khanga Festival to nurture talent. Addressing the press on Thursday, Churchill said they will increase opportunities for comedy acts during the festival, which will be held in April in Kilifi county. "There is a lot of talent in the local market but it needs to be nurtured. The festival will showcase the talent to the world, not only in comedy but in music and arts," he said. "We want to create a wholesome festival that will be a tourist attraction to the world." The festival will run for three days. If good content is generated, some of it will be used on the Churchill Show. "This is a yearly event and we hope to make it a meeting point for acts in the world, hoping one day to bring Kevin Hart to the festival," he said.
