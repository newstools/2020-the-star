The Kenya Bureau of Standards on Friday challenged the Standards Tribunal’s decision that recorded a consent allowing the release of New Italycor Limited's impounded goods. Before Justice Francis Tuiyot, Kebs argued that the tribunal did not have the jurisdiction to allow the two parties to agree on such a decision. It also said it was not sure if a valid consent was recorded. In November 2018, New Italycor imported goods — spaghetti, Tomato Puree and Macaroni. It had been issued with a certificate of conformity on October 15, 2018, after the goods were tested and duly analysed by an authorised agent in Italy, the country of origin. However, Kebs declined to clear the goods into the country on grounds that they did not meet the Kenyan standards. The company requested that the goods be resampled and retested, a move that was initially rejected by Kebs. Italycor, therefore, made a formal appeal with the Standards Tribunal in Nairobi. Kebs was directed to resample and retest the goods in the presence of an authorised representative of the company within 14 days. On April 5, 2019, Kebs, through an advocate, confirmed that fresh tests showed that the applicant had complied with the standards. The dispute was termed settled and the two parties had to file a written consent with all the charges directed to New Italycor Limited. Italycor later requested that its goods be released within 24 hours following the decision of the tribunal, failing which Kebs was to be liable for demurrage and any other charges that would accrue over the illegal detaining of its container. A verdict on Kebs application will be delivered on May 15, 2020.
