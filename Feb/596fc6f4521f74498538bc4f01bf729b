Raymond Moi on Wednesday gave family leadership rungu to Baringo senator Gideon Moi. The rungu which came from Kalenjin elders was given out during the funeral service of Mzee Daniel Moi which is taking place in Kabarak. "Jogoo mwenyewe amelala..na kama amelala..nimempea huyu ile rungu... na yeye akiregarega..si mimi niko hapa.. kwani mimi ni statue," Raymond, who is Rongai MP said as he handed it over to Gideon. (The cock himself has gone. And if he is gone, I will give Gideon this baton. If he plays with it, I will be here. I am not a stature) The rungu which is known as the 'political baton', was handed over to Gideon who was asked to make KANU great again. "I was not expecting this...hata kushika hii rungu...nitashika and i will do my best ..so help me God," Gideon said. Raymond said KANU is behind president Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM Party leader Raila Odinga on issues BBI. "We want to create a better Kenya..We are ready," he said. The rungu was not the actual one that Moi used but a copy. Mzee's rungu was taken to Parliament during the public viewing of former president Daniel Moi's body. 'Fimbo ya Nyayo' was a symbol of power, leadership and national cohesion. The rungu was made of ivory and gold. Kenyans were used to see it when the president carried it but never saw it one on one. This was the first time many Kenyans saw the symbol of power alongside the body of the late. The rungu, almost remained glued to his right hand for the 24 years he was in power.
