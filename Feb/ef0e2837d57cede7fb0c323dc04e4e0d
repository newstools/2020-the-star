  Some Embu county Health committee members no longer oversight medical facilities because their wives work in those institutions, an MCA claimed on Wednesday. Mbeti South MCA Murithi Kiura accused deputy Speaker Steve Simba, Health committee chairman Muturi Mwombo and Gaturi South MCA Paul Muchangi of conflict of interest as their wives were county government employees. But Speaker Josiah Thiriku ruled him out of order for introducing matters that he could have brought up at the Selection Committee level. Kiura complained that the health department was on its deathbed due to the negligence of those supposed to oversight it, fearing that their wives might be implicated in the poor state of the health facilities. Some of the other MCAs are suppliers of goods to hospitals and health centres from where they earn millions of shillings, he said. The house business was brought to near standstill as MCAs engaged in shouting matches. Some rubbished his allegations while others defended him. The Mbeti South MCA stood his ground and called for the disbandment of the health committee. Nominated MCA Margaret Lorna Kariuki urged the Speaker to declare the committee redundant. She said patients had died due to the committee's failure to address basic healthcare issues. Muminji MCA Newton Kariuki asked Kiura to substantiate his allegations as they tainted the assembly. If he cannot, he should withdraw them and apologise, theÂ  MCA said. His Mwea colleague, Harrison Mwaluko, asked why Kiura did not point out the anomaly yet he was a member of the Selection Committee. He said the MCA should be disciplined.
