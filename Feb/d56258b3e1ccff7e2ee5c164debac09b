The pursuit of greener pastures abroad forced Vihiga Queens midfielder, Cynthia Shilwatso to withdraw from the Harambee Starlets squad that is preparing for the Turkish women tournament set for next month. Shilwatso had been included in the initial squad by coach David Ouma but excused herself from the squad and has since been replaced by Foska Nashivanda from Zetech Sparks. “I have not withdrawn from the team.  All I did was to ask the coach to give me some time off as I continue to finalise my deal with my soon to be club in Spain,” said the Queens' playmaker who is still in the country despite the mooted move to Spanish top tier side, Logrono The  Starlets team started training at Camp Toyoyo grounds on Monday ahead of their departure for Istanbul next week. Ouma’s charges who will be taking part in the AWCON qualifiers later this year have been pooled alongside Chile, Northern Ireland and Uzbekistan. Other countries who will participate in the Turkish tournament include Hungary, Venezuela, Hong Kong, Romania, and Turkmenistan. The final squad comprising of 21 players will be released a few days before the team jets out to Turkey on Monday next week. A friendly match against the national boys' U16  team has been lined up for tomorrow.
