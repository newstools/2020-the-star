Tech giant Google’s plans to buy a 12.5 per cent stake in Africa’s largest wind farm have been canceled after delays to the project, Danish wind turbine maker Vestas has said. The 310-megawatt (MW) Lake Turkana wind farm in Kenya was initially set for completion 2017, after which Google had committed to buy the stake from Vestas. But the delay led to the cancellation of the deal with Google in 2019, Vestas said. “Due to delays relating primarily to the transmission line, the Vestas agreement with Google was canceled in 2019,” a Vestas spokesman told Reuters, adding that it was in talks with other potential buyers of the stake. Google was not immediately available for comment. The Sh70 billion wind farm located in Loiyangalani, Marsabit County  comprises 365 turbines, each with a capacity of generating 850 kilowatts of energy.
