Deputy President William Ruto has described as propaganda, claims that he has been sidelined in the burial preparations of the late and retired President Daniel Moi. Ruto said the claims are a creation of the media. “The truth is that we are together (with the organising committee). This is not a time for politics or time for anyone to be seen as doing this or that. We are all grieving and we are using this moment to give our last respects to a leader who worked for this country for a long time,” Ruto said. He spoke on Thursday, during an interview with Citizen TV. Speculation about Ruto being left out of the in the planning of the State funeral of the former president emerged on Tuesday when the DP cut the image of an isolated man when he called the press to read the government’s condolences. The DP was alone as he read the statement at his office while the military and other top government officials involved in the planning of the funeral were at Lee Funeral Home. However, Ruto said, “These are petty issues and are not supposed to be playing out at such times in this arena of the last journey of the former president.”
