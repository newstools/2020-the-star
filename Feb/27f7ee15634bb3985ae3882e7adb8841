The Fifa Disciplinary Committee has slapped three Kenyan footballers with a four-year ban from all football activities for allegedly being involved in match fixing. The three featured for Kakamega Homeboyz last season, where claims of predetermining the outcome of their matches rocked the club, prompting their chairman Cleophas Shimanyula to sack Ugandan head coach Paul Nkata. Besides sacking Nkata,Homeboyz launched internal investigations to unearth the custodians of the vice after it emerged that the entire back line conceded goals in a questionable manner. The matter was taken by up Fifa who on Tuesday found three defenders guilty of match manipulation contrary to article 69 of the disciplinary code The three are Moses Chikati,Festus Okiring and Festo Omukoto who will be barred from playing at both the club and national team level. “Moreover, the following individuals have been banned from taking part in any kind of football-related activity at national and international level (administrative, sports or any other) for a period of four years,” read a statement from Fifa. Ulinzi Stars had reportedly signed Okiring during the January transfer window and were willing to offer him the opportunity to undergo military training while Omukoto had been cashed to Western Stima. While the three will serve a four-year ban, their former teammate at Homeboyz and Ugandan was handed a life ban. “In particular, given his central role in the conspiracy, the player George Mandela, the Ugandan has been banned from taking part in any of football-related activity at national and international level (administrative,sports or any other ) for life," said the statement
