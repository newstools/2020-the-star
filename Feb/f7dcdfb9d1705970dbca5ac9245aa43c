Environment CS Keriako Tobiko has told off those politicising efforts to restore the country’s forest cover. Speaking at the BBI rally in Narok on Saturday, Tobiko further put on notice those polluting the environment; rivers, lakes and oceans in particular that they will be dealt with. He noted that the environment is a vital issue that touches on the lives of the people including the children and the great-grandchildren. “As a ministry, we will ensure the environment is prioritized because there is no life without the environment.  If we kick people from forests and kick out those messing with our rivers don’t say it is politics or tribalism,” Tobiko said. He praised Opposition leader Raila Odinga for having stood his ground in 2009 on the matter of evictions and restoration of water towers, saying it was because he knew the importance of Mau. “In 2009 you stood and said people should leave Mau. You said those were your people who voted for you but you were ready to lose your seat.” Tobiko noted that rivers some flowing all the way to Tanzania, Lake Victoria and the Nile come from Mau. “Since we restored Mau it has been raining every day. We are not just moving people from the Mau but also those in other forests like Embobut, Cherangany, Mt Elgon and all those who have encroached and are interfering with water towers,” Tobiko emphasised. The CS further dismissed those all who were calling on Cabinet Secretaries and government officials to steer clear from BBI rallies, saying BBI is about inclusivity, devolution, shared responsibility, security and safety and resource sharing. "We must follow our general who has given us the job and our general in Uhuru Kenyatta and he is holding hands with baba in the handshake so if the two have said handshake and BBI we the employees are in.”
