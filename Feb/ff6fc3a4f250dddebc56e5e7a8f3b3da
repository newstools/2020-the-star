East Africa equipment sharing platform, Quipbank Trust Limited, is set to open hubs in 47 counties by the year 2022 to meet the growing demand across the country. Currently, the equipment renter has branches in Nairobi, Meru, Kiambu, Narok, Kajiado, and Nakuru among other counties. It also has subsidiaries in Uganda and Tanzania. The expansion will involve a combination of branches expansion, strategic partnerships, and diversification of service variety leveraging on technology to meet growing clients’ needs. For instance, the firm is planning to open its Kisumu branch in March, which will serve Siaya, Busia and entire Western Kenya. It is expected to strengthen its presence in the vast Western region as well as coordinating operations in neighbouring counties. The expansion will cost at least Sh15 million. “We are moving closer to the clients. They will no longer have to travel to distant hubs to access our services and equipment. Our aim is to reduce the cost of doing business in Africa,’’ Quipbank commercial director, John Mogire said. The firm is now eyeing business with the devolved government units and the rising mechanized farming in the region. In 2018, the equipment bank collaborated with Narok County to construct at least 300 dams. It has also previously worked with Bomet County to repair several feeder roads. ‘’The advent of devolution has led to a dramatic change in various counties hence attracting various investors,’’ Quipbank commercial director, John Mogire said. According to Mogire, plans are underway to have the first North Eastern Kenya branch at the heart of the town, along Kisimayu Road.
