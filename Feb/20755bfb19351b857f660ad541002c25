More than 300 girls who dropped out of school in Kakamega because of pregnancy can now get back to school and pursue their career dreams. This comes after the National Affirmative Action Fund released Sh5 million to support their education. County Woman Representative Elsie Muhanda, through Ngaaf, said the Tumaini Scholars and Eagles Scholars initiative will support young mothers to go back to school. The programme also covers boys from poor backgrounds. The programme covers fees and basic support materials such as sanitary pads in efforts to keep beneficiaries in school. It also has mentorship programmes that have successfully kept girls in schools. It targets day school students to create an enabling environment for mother-child interaction, hence promoting mother-child care and love. Muhanda presented the cheque at Friends Church Samitsi ground early in the week. She expressed the need to give the girls a second chance to attend school and empower them to seek employment and fend for their younger ones. “Gone are the days when girls dropped out of school due to pregnancy and their education ended there. It’s just an accident that may need healing after which life has to continue. I just want to sound a warning to men who take advantage of such young girls..., the law will catch up with you and you will suffer the consequences,” she said. Some 300 girls attended the event with their babies. Muhanda urged communities to guide and counsel children as was done in the old days and not to leave the responsibility to parents and teachers. She said an educated girl is of greater national importance and called for a joint war on early pregnancies, early marriages and defilement. She recommended that a bill be introduced in the National Assembly to make life values a subject in schools.
