Veteran tactician Gilbert Selebwa has joined Football Kenya Federation (FKF) Division Two side, Kiendege Jets. Selebwa put pen to paper with the Nyamira County-based side on Wednesday evening at the team's base at Kiendege Secondary School. He signed a one year contract during the ceremony which was witnessed by the club's president Dennis Mokaya. Selebwa's task will be to guide the team to Division One which they narrowly missed last season. The coach has been handling the team's training sessions for a month and impressed the club management. On Sunday, Selebwa was on the touchline as Jets battled to a 2-2 draw with Ndhiwa FC. “Selebwa is a very experienced coach. We are impressed by his tactical knowhow in the one month he has been with us. We believe he will take us to the next level and nurture our players,” he said. Mokaya added that Selebwa, who has coached the Betika National Super League side Shabana for two years understands local players. Speaking after his unveiling, Selebwa said he was happy to join the side. “I'm confident that I will guide the team to Division One. Kadiege have youthful players and I want to help them realise their dreams,” said Selebwa. Selebwa, who helped AFC Leopards back to the Kenya Premier League, said his decision to coach Jets was not out of desperation but for his love for the game and nurturing talents. The club sits on top of the Central Zone table standings with 20 points from 10 games. On Sunday, Jets will be in Siaya where they will face off with Back Diamonds as they seek promotion.
