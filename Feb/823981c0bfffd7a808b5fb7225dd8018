Kenya airways has suspended a staff indefinitely for sharing a video clip of 239 passengers aboard a Chinese flight that arrived in Kenya. "Following a report of video of China Southern flights arrival at JKIA and circulation of the video clip widely on social media and your alleged involvement in the matter, it has been decided that you be suspended from duty with effect from Feb 27," Chief human resource Evelyne Munyoki said. In the letter addressed to staffer Gire Ali, Munyoki said the suspension is in line with the company policies. "This is to pave way for further investigations into the matter. During the period of suspension, you will be required to avail yourself to the investigating team," Munyoki said. She asked Gire to avail himself to his manager or any other person in authority when required. "You are therefore required to remain contactable and within reach during the period. Also note that the suspension period will be on full salary," she said. This comes after the step taken by the government to allow China Southern flights to land at the JKIA caused an uproar among Kenyans. TheÂ China Southern Airlines Flight touched down on Wednesday with 239 passengers on board. The Embassy said that all the passengers were advised to quarantine themselves for 14 days, a prevention method used in China. So far, 17 suspect cases have been recorded in the country and all have tested negative. On Thursday, a section of MPs demanded that all the Chinese airlines be suspended from landing at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport. Led by Minority leader John Mbadi the MPs said it was a careless move for those responsible to have cleared a China Southern Airline plane on Kenyan soil despite the scare of the coronavirus outbreak. Mbadi said it was laughable that the Health ministry cleared all the 239 passengers and asked them to 'self-quarantine' without proper monitoring mechanisms.
