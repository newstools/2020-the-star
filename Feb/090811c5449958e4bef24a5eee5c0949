The High Court has suspended the deportation order issued by the Interior CS Fred Matiang'i on four Chinese nationals. The move came after one of them was seen in a viral video canning a Kenyan at Chez Wou Restaurant in Kileleshwa. High Court judge Luka Kimaru issued his ruling on Wednesday. The same court has given the DPP until Friday to file responses on the matter. The matter has been certified as urgent and directed that the case be heard on February 25. The CS had issued a deportation order on February 13 after the court directed that the four be detained for 15 days pending a police probe. “The court has considered the fact that the suspects are a flight risk and they will abscond court if released. I allow their detention for 15 days,” principal magistrate Hellen Okwani ruled. The prosecution was seeking to detain the four suspects for 21 days. The video of one of the suspects, believed to be Deng Heilan, whipping a waiter for reporting to work late in Kileleshwa went viral on Saturday. The other suspects are Ou Giang, Yu Ling, Chang Yueping. Chinese Ambassador to Kenya Wu Peng condemned the actions by the suspects, saying all their citizens must abide by the Kenyan laws.
