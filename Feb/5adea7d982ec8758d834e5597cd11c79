Kenya Secondary Schools Sports Association (KSSSA) western region secretary-general, Quinto Omusugu, has warned coaches who engage in age-cheating  ahead of a three-day coaching clinic at St. Mathias School in Busia County. Omusugu revealed that the event will take place from February 1-21 and will coincide with schools' mid-term break. "We would like to see sports taken to a higher level in the secondary schools games and that is why we are coming out with this program," he noted. He said the participants will be taken through vigorous coaching exercises that will involve both theory and practicals. " They will also be acquainted with the latest rules governing various disciplines. We understand the potential we have in terms of talent and we want to ensure we remain dominant in sports," he said. He added: "I am also urging all the schools preparing to take part in school games  to ensure they send representatives in this particular exercise." ‘’This year we shall be strict with the coaches handling various teams and also referees who are not qualified. These are kind of people we want to root out of the game,’’ Omusugu warned. He went further and explained that they are expecting guidelines from the head office on the way forward on the age cheating vice that has remained a major threat to secondary schools games.
