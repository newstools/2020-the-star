ODM leader Raila Odinga on Saturday strained to address the BBI rally in Meru because of a hoarse voice. As he spoke, his voice kept on fading away as the podium charged. He was addressing residents in Mt Kenya. "..nashindawa na sauti... lakini jana nilikuja hapa nikalala hapa..nilikuja na vijana. Wakaniambia baba hapa Meru nobody can stop reggae..," he said. Raila took the microphone and started inviting other leaders who had accompanied him to the rally. Raila was dressed in a unique-designed green, white and orange patterned shirt paired with navy blue trousers and black shoes. Earlier, Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria and Elgeyo Marakwet Kipchumba Murkomen stormed out of the BBI rally in Meru. The leaders, who were accompanied by Chuka-Igambang'ombe MP Patrick Munene, left when EALA MP Mpuru Aburi was speaking. It was not clear why they left, but they had earlier missed seats. Only Murkomen and Linturi were allowed to address the gathering after requests from the public. The Mt Kenya region has presented a 10-point demand to the Building Bridges Initiative task force. Nyandarua Governor Francis Kimemia read the resolutions during a BBI rally at Kinoru Stadium in Meru on Saturday. Kimemia is the chairman of the Mt Kenya governors' caucus.
