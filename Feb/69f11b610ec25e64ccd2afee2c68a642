There are no confirmed cases of Coronavirus in the country, government spokesman Cyrus Oguna has said. Oguna said there was no need for alarm as the national government has put proper measures to ensure Kenyans are safe. Speaking on Thursday at Masinga airstrip in Machakos county during his tour to the areas invaded by locusts, Oguna said there is only one suspected case which is still under scrutiny at Kenyatta National Hospital. He said samples have been sent to the US and South Africa for analysis and that once the reports are out, Kenyans would be informed. The government said thorough screening is being done in all entry points in the country in order to ensure nobody who is infected enters the country without the knowledge of the government.
