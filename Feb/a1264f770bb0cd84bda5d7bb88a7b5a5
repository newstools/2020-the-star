President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga took a break from their hectic schedules and danced the night away during the UB40 concert on Saturday night at the Carnivore grounds in Nairobi. The two leaders surprised many when they joined revellers at the Carnivore to attend the legendary UK reggae band's s Real Labour of Love 40th-anniversary tour of Kenya. Uhuru had earlier on Saturday attended various functions in Kirinyaga and Meru counties while Raila had spent the day in Kitui county leading a BBI consultative forum. In videos posted across social media, Uhuru was seen in high spirits mingling freely with Kenyans as he struck some moves while the band performed. A few years ago, hosted on Churchill show, Uhuru revealed his deeply rooted love for reggae music, with all the names on his list falling in that genre of music. "I'm stuck in a certain age, my favourite musicians are UB40, Gregory Isaac and Bob Marley..." he said. Raila, who of late has also shown his new-found love of reggae, was seen in a jovial mood as he danced to UB40's popular tracks. The ODM leader was later seen on the stage dancing to the tune of the new BBI 'anthem' Nobody Can Stop Reggae made famous by the late Lucky Dube. The UB 40 band known for hits such as Red Red Wine, was formed in 1978 by two brothers Ali and Robin Campbell before differences over managerial issues emerged between them, leading to a split in 2008. Speaking during a presser on Friday, Ali a member of the band said they were glad to be in a country of diverse cultures, adding that Kenya was the place to be. “We may have different traditions, cultures and languages among others but we are all the same. We should treasure that,” Ali said. Sports, Culture and Heritage Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohamed welcomed the band, saying their presence and performance in the country was an inspiration to local artistes and youth with ambitions in the entertainment industry.
