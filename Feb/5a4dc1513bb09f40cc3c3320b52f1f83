The State Department for Shipping and Maritime and State Department for Youth have entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to facilitate training and skills development for youth seeking employment as seafarers. The partnership to be signed today will ensure skills development and linkages to job opportunities within the shipping and maritime sector. “The Government is in the process of undertaking various activities aimed at revamping the Blue Economy, in order to improve the social and economic wellbeing of Kenyans” PS Shipping and Maritime, Nancy Karigithu said. According to Karigithu, the collaboration between the two departments will ensure skills development and linkages to job opportunities within the shipping and maritime sector. She added that through the MOU, Kenya aims to move closer to the “realisation of sustainable blue growth, maritime skills development and access to employment opportunities for Kenyan youth. The PS hinted that the MOU would also ensure access to financial support to eligible seafarers, who experience a lot of challenges in meeting mandatory ship pre-embarkation procedures. In July last year, President Uhuru Kenyatta commission the refurbished and equipped Bandari Maritime Academy, after handing over the running of the Sh30 billion Second Container Terminal to the Kenya National Shipping. He said the deal will see thousands of Kenyan youth employed by the Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) which is the second-largest shipping line in the world.
