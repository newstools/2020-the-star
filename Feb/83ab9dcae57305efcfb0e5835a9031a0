Typing error? Kiambu Governor James Nyoro on Friday gave a tribute to former President Daniel Moi, who died aged 95, through an advert in the dailies. The message extolled Moi's virtues but the typos and confusion of his words caught the attention of readers. "His Nyayo philosophy which meant following in the footsteps of Mzee Jomo Kenyatta coupled with his philosophy of Love, Peach and Unity made Kenya a great nation," Nyoro said. Moi's Nyayo's philosophy indeed followed in the footsteps on Kenyatta. Peace (not peach) Love and Unity (in that order) were its tenets, but not a different philosophy as Nyoro's message insinuates. He added: "May Almighty God Rest his soul in internal Peace". Perhaps he meant "eternal peace?" Former Kiambu Governor Ferdinand Waititu was largely criticised by netizens whenever he spoke in English. At one point he had to defend his mastery. "Most of you might have heard so many stories about me. Some of them indicating that I cannot even express myself in English,‚Äù Waititu said. It appears his former deputy is following in his footsteps.
