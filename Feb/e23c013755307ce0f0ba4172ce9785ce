DP William Ruto has mourned Sergent Kipyegon Kenei as a disciplined young police officer. "Deeply saddened by the death of Police Sergent.. . I urge the relevant authorities to conduct a thorough investigation to ascertain the circumstances surrounding his death," Ruto said. "My heartfelt thoughts to the family, colleagues and friends. Rest In Peace." Kenei who was attached to Ruto's Harambee Annex was found dead after missing for two days. He was on duty when the Sh39 billion fake military arms deal was being signed at Ruto's office. Ruto had written to IG Hillary Mutyambai to speed up investigations into the role of former Sports CS Rashid Echesa in his involvement in the arms deal. Echesa was charged with conspiracy to commit a felony by conspiring to make a document with intent to defraud. Sergeant Kenei's body was found with a bullet wound in his head at his house in  Imara Daima's Villa Franca estate. The officer, who was expected to record a statement, had not been seen for two days.
