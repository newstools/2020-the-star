Kenya’s fight against the doping menace received a reassuring nod as the ADAK director of education and research, Agnes Mandu, was appointed to the World Anti Doping Agency (WADA) education committee. In a letter confirming the appointment, WADA director general, Olivier Niggli, thanked Mandu for her contribution and commitment to the committee and her work to protect the clean athlete. “Following the review and approval of the 2020 Committees, we have the pleasure of advising you of your selection to the Education Committee,” read part of the letter addressed to Ms Mandu and copied to the Cabinet Secretary of Sports Amina Mohamed. The appointment will be effective immediately and will run-up to December 31, 2022, upon which Mandu will be eligible to apply for re-appointment. “Committee terms are 3 years, however, this current term is slightly less by two months due to the roll-out of new governance reforms in 2019 which had an impact on the timing of Standing Committee appointments for 2020. We thank you in advance for your contribution and commitment to the committee and our work to protect the clean athlete,” concluded the appointment letter. The process of determining committee composition involves the WADA President Witold Banka, the director-general Niggli and committee chair Ms Kady Kanoute Tounkara.
