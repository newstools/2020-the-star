The Kenya Civil Aviation Authority is looking to enhance air traffic management data by signing service level agreements with aeronautical data providers. Over the next 30 days KCAA will collaborate with institutions including the Ministry of Health, Kenya Revenue Authority’s Customs Division, Kenya Plant Health Inspectorate Service (Kephis) as well as the Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Interior and Co-ordination of National Government. Others are operators of private airstrips, Kenya Wildlife Services, Kenya Forestry Services, Kenya Airports Authority and the Kenya Meteorological Department. The partnerships are aimed at ensuring the credibility and integrity of data being used in the aviation industry is up to par with global standards. “The purpose of these Letters of Agreement is to define a working relationship between the information originators as a means to ensure credibility and integrity of data being used for aeronautical purposes meets global standards and is compliant with ICAO Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPS),” KCAA director-general Gilbert Kibe said. He said the process of establishing new standards and practices to provide air traffic information is complex since the aeronautical data chain involves numerous actors and transaction points. All of whom play a critical role in producing and transmitting quality data, in the appropriate format to meet the intended user’s requirements. “It is important that data received by KCAA’s Aeronautical Information Services for further processing and/or distribution, is in compliance with the provisions of International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) Annex 15,” Kibe said.
