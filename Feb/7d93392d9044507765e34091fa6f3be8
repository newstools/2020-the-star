Despite not making a single appearance for Harambee Starlets, Wadadia goalkeeper Monica Odato has expressed her desire to play professional football overseas. Odato wants to follow in the footsteps of Harambee Starlets players who ply their trade in Europe. Anneth Kundu and Ruth Ingotsi, who played for Eldoret Falcons are now based in Cyprus with Lakatamia FC. The duo is a goalkeeper and defender respectively. Fast-rising midfielder Corazon Aquino made her dream a reality after penning a  deal with Portuguese top tier side Atletico Auriense. Vihiga Queens' Cynthia Shilwatso turns up for Spanish side EDF Longrono. All the deals were sealed last month leaving the goalie hopeful. "Everything is possible if the move of the four players abroad is anything to go by. I feel inspired and through hard work, I too can make it," said Odato. "They demonstrated their ability on the pitch and that is what  I need to do. To train harder hoping that one day, fortune will smile upon me." Odato is yet to make her bow for the national team despite receiving cal-ups. She was part of the Starlets squad for the Olympic qualifiers as well as coach David Ouma's team for the CECAFA tournament. She is the third choice goalkeeper but has promised to battle for 'Kenya One' role in the upcoming assignments. Kundu, who won the golden glove in the CECAFA tourney has been indispensable in the department, deputised by Gaspo's Judith Osimbo. Wadadia finished seventh last season and the shot-stopper reckons that a top-three finish is achievable this season and will not be a mean feat. "Our aim is to be among the three best teams at the end of the season. The team is beefed up and we are good to go," added Odato. Wadadia open their 2020 season next weekend against Eldoret Falcons.
