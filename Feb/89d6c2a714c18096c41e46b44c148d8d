The ceremony was witnessed by Deputy President William Ruto and most governors from the North Rift region led by the host Jackson Mandago of Uasin Gishu and Turkana’s Josphat Nanok. Kimengich was serving in Turkana before he was appointed by the Pope to take over in Eldoret. President Uhuru Kenyatta who had been invited at the event was not present. All the close allies of the DP led by Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi were among those at the event in Eldoret which comes at a time of heated politics around the BBI and divisions within Jubilee. Catholic Bishops and other church leaders were also present at the event that attracted more than 10,000 people. Bishop Dominic Kimengich has been installed as the new Bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Eldoret replacing the late Bishop Cornelius Korir who died two years ago. The elaborate and colourful ceremony on Saturday at the St Peter’s Seminary was led by Cardinal John Njue who took bishop Kimengich through a process of taking vows to serve the diocese. Kimengich kissed the crucifix as part of the acceptance process. “I accept to serve the diocese of Eldoret as bishop”, said Kimengich when he was asked by Njue if he was ready to serve the faithful in the region.
