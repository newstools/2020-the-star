A locust extermination campaign has started in Kitui targeting an estimated 1.5 billion nymphs (immature locusts). The one and half week campaign was launched on Monday at Maseki in Kyuso, Mwingi North by Deputy Governor Wathe Nzau. The department of Agriculture has suspended all other activities, according to Agriculture executive Emmanuel Kisangau. “My department has suspended other activities to effectively manage the nymph menace or else it turns into a disaster. We might end up becoming a county that, ominously, will produce future swarms of locusts if the nymphs are not decimated,” Kisangau told the media at the launch of the spraying campaign. He identified breeding sites as Maseki, Kyoea, Kyandali, Magara, Mbarani and Kaivirya – all in Mwingi North. Some 100 National Youth Services trainees are helping in the ground spraying of the immature locusts. Kisangau said that six swarms, each with about 50 million locusts, have invaded the devolved unit. Each swarm has produced nymphs five times its number. “The eggs have started hatching. Every swarm is estimated to produce 300 million nymphs which we must wipe out before they become adults,” he said. Nzau said they have acquired 14,000 litres of pesticide to spray the voracious creatures within the one and half week timeline. He said youths have been recruited and equipped with motorised hand-held sprayers to kill the insects. Individual farmers have sprayers and have been provided with the pesticide. Kyuso Ward representative Stephen Musili welcomed the campaign but pleaded with the national government for food assistance since the crops have been destroyed. The locusts invaded Kitui a month ago.
