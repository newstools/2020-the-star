Mombasa Sports Club (MSC) cemented their place at the summit of the Coast NCBA Bank Twenty20 league with a 39 runs win over Jafferys Sports Club yesterday. Defending 173 for 5, MSC restricted the visitors to 134 thanks to 4 for 14 from Puru Sharma. The second change bowler cleaned up Jafferys’ middle order after they had briefly bounced back to 63 for 3 after finding themselves in trouble at 1 for 1 and 34 for 2. Nairobi based Thomas Ochieng and Talha Khan tried hard to see their side to victory with 54 and 22 runs respectively but that wasn’t enough as MSC’s bowlers didn’t give them much breathing space. Earlier, former national U19 player Sagar Karia and former Stray Lions wicket keeper Abraham Vadada led MSC to the final total with 71 and 50 runs respectively. After linking up in the second over with the scores on 17, the two hanged up to add 67 for the second wicket. Sushil Sharma and Dev Hirani then added 19 and 17 runs respectively. The two linked up after Zahid Abbas had clean bowled Shukan Mehta for three. After Ochieng ended the Vadada-Karia stand by dismissing Vadada, MSC were three wickets down immediately when Ochieng added his second by having Sharma caught for a golden duck.
