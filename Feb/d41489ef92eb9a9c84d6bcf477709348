Medanta Africare head of marketing and sales Christabel Seda has dismissed claims that Micheal Mukaya and Jaron Chaboya are part of their team. In a letter to the Star dated February 19, Seda said the two visited their South C clinic and conducted an inspection claiming to be officials from the Kenya Medical Laboratory Technicians and Technologists Board. This was in response to an article published in the Star on February 5, saying the two (Mukaya and Chaboya) were directors at Africare Limited in South B and that they had been summoned to appear before the Nairobi county court to face charges of administering expired drugs to unsuspecting patients. Seda said Mukaya and Chaboya found expired reagents packaged and stored awaiting disposal as per the laboratory standard operating procedures and claimed the laboratory technician was using the expired reagents. “They used this claim to intimidate her and tried to extort money from Africare Ltd demanding a bribe of Sh750,000 but were later willing to settle instead for Sh150,00,” the letter reads. Their behaviour, Seda said, raised concern, prompting one of their staff named Norman Maundu to call the board for clarification. Upon clarification, Seda said it was confirmed that the two were not employees from the board. A Mr Kinyanjui, the board official who was contacted, advised that the process of apprehending the two be activated. “They were later arrested and a statement was recorded at the police station Nairobi area by both Maundu and Martin Fondo, the laboratory manager,” she stated in the letter.
