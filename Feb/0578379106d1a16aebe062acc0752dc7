The National Land Commission has asked Mandera residents to register the vast communal parcels for mutual benefit. Speaking in Mandera on Wednesday during a one-day workshop, land adjudication and settlement deputy director Eustace Kithumbu asked stakeholders to help residents register their land. Dr Kithumbu said registration will enable acquisition of title deeds so owners have a say over their property. He said land ownership will reduce perennial conflicts over boundaries that have left many people dead, property destroyed and huge populations displaced. Land in Northeastern is communally owned, with only a few individuals having possession documents. Participants at the forum warned against land-grabbing, which they said was on the rise as individuals fenced large tracts that have not been surveyed or adjudicated by Lands ministry officials. County Lands executive Adan Hussein said the county government is committed to helping residents acquire title deeds. He said the department had started with urban areas before rolling out the exercise to rural areas. Hussein noted that only less than 1,000 title deeds have been processed for residents all over the county since Independence. Mohamed Abdi, a resident of Rhamu, said having titles will go a long way in solving disputes. Rhamu is one of the areas that have witnessed land-related clashes. "As we all know, land is a very sensitive and emotive issue. In the past, we have seen lives lost and properties destroyed after communities disagreed over land,” he said.
