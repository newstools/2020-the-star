Kevian Kenya ltd, a juice maker has distanced itself from a consignment of juices dumped at a dumpsite in Nairobi. Managing Director Kimani Rugendo on Monday said the juices under the brand name Afya are not made by his company. Rugendo's remarks follows viral photos of people seen scavenging on the expired juices thrown in a dumpsite with fears that they might find their way to the shop shelves. But he said the brand name for the company's product is Afia and not Afya. "Those are not our products at all. We have no connection with them. Those are cheap imports trying to ride on our good name and using a name almost identical to ours, " Rugendo said. He said there is no way his distributors would dump products like that since they would simply return them to the company. "No distributor would dump such a consignment and risk losing money. They would return it us for proper disposal and compensation," he said. The Manager said his products are high quality and move fast. He said it is clear whoever dumped the juices had imported them and had no idea how to dispose them. He called on regulatory authorities to be on the look out for such unscrupulous traders and take action.
