A magistrates Court has issued ordered compelling the Assets Recovery Agency to immediately unfreeze five bank accounts belonging to Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko. Chief Magistrate Martha Mutuku on Tuesday said the agency failed to approach the court for an extension when the orders expired in December last year. "The agency was riding on expiry court orders. They should give approached the court for the extension as required by the law upon expiry of the December orders," she said. The governor's accounts were frozen last month. Sonko had said he was grounded and could not support himself or his family and was not even able to withdraw his salary as governor. The Assets Recovery Agency asked the court to freeze the accounts following claims of suspicious money transactions believed to be proceeds of crime “as a result of theft from Nairobi county government”. The Assets Recovery Agency had asked for the freeze order and access to the accounts to carry out investigations. The agency had told the court that it received information on October 5, 2019, that the accounts received suspicious deposits believed to be proceeds of crime. However, in his application before court Sonko says there is no evidence showing that monies held in his bank account are proceeds of crime and as a result, the order by the Asset Recovery Agency to freeze his accounts hampered his family life. Sonko learnt of the order on December 24 when the banks informed him that his accounts have been frozen by a court order dated December 11. The order was given to the agency by senior resident magistrate E. Riany. Sonko said the move by the Assets Recovery Agency is informed by malice because there are no proceedings or charges of money laundering preferred against him in any court. Sonko and his associates are accused of misappropriating Sh357 million of public funds. He denied the charges and is out on bond.
