National Olympic Committee of Kenya (NOC-K)  has approved the appointment of Wangui Kibe and Caroline Akinyi Okoth as  Team Kenya executive Officer and chief medical officer respectively ahead of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games. Kibe is currently serving as a board member at the Kenya Rugby Union. She has previously held managerial positions in sponsorship, marketing, product development and enterprise marketing at Safaricom PLC. Kibe is also experienced in events management, which she continues to practice as a volunteer at KRU. Akinyi, on the other hand, is expected to assume her new role immediately as the chief medical officer. She will be tasked in delivering appropriate medical services to the Team Kenya delegation. With Kenya being on red alert internationally on doping, all eyes will be on Akinyi, whose responsibilities stretch to ensuring that the team meets the threshold set by IOC/NOCK. Beyond this, she sits in the Nock  Medical Commission and has a wealth of experience with travelling teams having served in previous Games. Nock’s secretary-general Francis Mutuku said the two will help manage the team in a professional way. He reiterated their commitment to ensuring everything is rolling on time. “NOCK is in the process of putting in place all systems in preparation of Team Kenya to the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. The NOCK Executive Board’s main vision for these Games is to professionalise the management of the team,” he said “All national federations had the chance to nominate qualified candidates and through rigorous progress, the executive board settled on Ms Kibe. In her role, she will be  responsible for the coordinating and aligning the many departments of the Team Kenya preparations and drive seamless execution of this project,” he added
