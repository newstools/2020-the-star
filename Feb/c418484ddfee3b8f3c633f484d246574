 A circular by NHIF outlining new regulations on registration and contributions last month was leaked to the public before it was finalised. National Assembly's Health Committee chairperson Sabina Chege on Saturday urged Kenyans to ignore the circular, saying MPs have given the national insurer two weeks to finalise the document and present it to the House. The National Hospital Insurance Fund last month announced increased charges for new registrations and contributions before President Uhuru Kenyatta reversed the move. Chege said the new terms were going to punish Kenyans who are already grappling with hard economic times. “We need to ensure those who pay for one year get some motivation. Members should also not have to wait for three months to pay, it can be reduced to a maximum of one month,” Chege said. The January 7 circular also increased the waiting period for new entrants to three months in which time one is expected to have paid Sh6,000 upfront for a whole year. Chege said the committee wants NHIF to digitise its operations to curb the many cases of fraud in health insurance where some hospitals have been accused of making fictitious claims. “You get treated for something but they bill NHIF for something else. Why not get members’ biometrics to reduce the amount of money being lost to insincere practitioners,” the MP said. She warned private hospitals against commercialising health insurance saying exploiting patients only gives them ‘blood money’. “When a patient dies just because an institution wanted to take advantage of their situation or when they hold a patient for more days to make more money, is very unfair. That money will not be blessed.' She said it is only a matter of time before those engaging in the fraud are caught.
