President Uhuru Kenyatta has sent a message of condolence and comfort to the family, relatives and friends of Kenya's ambassador to South Sudan Chris  Karumba Mburu who died last night. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Mburu died on Sunday night after suffering a heart attack. Uhuru described the late envoy as a distinguished career public servant and a great Kenyan diplomat who was committed to building strong bilateral ties between Kenya and South Sudan. “Death has robbed us of a great public servant who served his country with distinction. Since his appointment as our envoy to Juba, Mburu has worked hard to ensure the free flow of trade and investment between Kenya and South Sudan,” he said. He added, “Kenya has lost a brilliant public servant whose star was shining bright and whose service shall be dearly missed". Through a statement on Monday, the Head of State eulogized the fallen diplomat as a shining star whose service to the nation shall be dearly missed. He prayed to God to give the family of the late Mburu strength and fortitude to bear with the loss of their beloved especially in this difficult period of mourning. “I deeply sympathize with each one of you as you mourn and pray that God will give you the grace to accept his will,” Uhuru wrote in his message to the family. Mburu was appointed Kenya's Ambassador to South Sudan by Uhuru in 2018. According to the Ministry, the envoy left the country Sunday headed back to Juba before the incident. "For now, all we know is that the envoy suffered a heart attack. We are trying to get finer details and we shall communicate in the due cause," a ministry official said. The ministry said Mburu was in the country after he accompanied President Salvar Kiir for the State funeral of the late former president Daniel Moi.
