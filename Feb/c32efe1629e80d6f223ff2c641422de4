The western region Football Kenya Federation candidates have retreated back to their respective counties ahead of the March 14  elections. Countries have since been transformed to branches. The counties, most of whom former officials from  Kakamega, Busia and Vihiga counties that served under the western branch, converged at Mbale on Monday to declare their readiness for the repeat elections and eluding optimism that they will win and continue with their programs. Speaking on behalf of the rest of other officials, Kelvin Mwangu who is also outgoing western branch secretary, said they are all ready for the elections after successfully implementing the order from Sports Tribunal, which included public participation among others. “We are law-abiding Kenyans and we want to state that we are ready for the elections because we know the delegates have confidence in us to carry on with the work in our respective branches," he said. He added: "We just want to assure our opponents that it’s not about life and death since the objective of football is to bring us all together after the elections. Let us embrace each other and work together in developing the growth of soccer in this region." “Our local football is on the rise and we want to make it more attractive as we embark on the campaign to leave a legacy for the coming generations. "We want to complete the restructuring of our branch leagues. While the leagues have been coined around men's football, we also want to have women leagues, and restore youth programs,” he added. He added that branches are the backbone of local soccer hence needs to be restructured well for competitive football leagues. Some of the officials who flanked Mwangu included Hillary Musundi who is vying for the chairmanship of Busia and his counterpart from Kakamega, Allan Muhando among others.
