Chinese nationals travelling back to their work stations in Kenya must undergo a 14-day self-quarantine, the country's ambassador has said. Ambassador Wu Peng said this is part of the measures being taken to ensure coronavirus is contained, adding that so far, no case has been reported in Kenya or any other African country. The ambassador said as at Thursday, data from the National Health Commission indicated 59,884  cases of coronavirus had been diagnosed in China. The virus has  killed 1,368 people in the country, while 600 people have  been cured. Wu said the embassy is monitoring all Chinese nationals working in Kenya who had travelled back home. "I personally check daily with specific Chinese state corporations and big companies to follow up on this," he told a Kenya Editors Guild luncheon in Nairobi. He said the entrants are also monitored through informal Chinese associations in Kenya. For ordinary Chinese travellers, he said they are working closely with the Kenya's health ministry to ensure they are monitored.
