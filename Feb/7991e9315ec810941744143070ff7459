Kipsigis leaders in Narok county have made good of their threats not to attend the Building Bridges Initiative after they failed to show up in during the 5th BBI consultative rally at William ole Ntimama stadium on Saturday. Narok Deputy Governor Evalyn Aruasa and Emurua Dikirr MP Johana Ngeno, who led a march out of the BBI forum alleging tribal isolation at Maasai Mara University on Friday, told the Kipsigis community not to step at the foot of the stadium after what it transpired yesterday. Ngeno said it was sad that irrespective of President Uhuru Kenyatta and former prime minister Raila Odinga's assurance of inclusiveness they were treated with no dignity and no option but to leave the meeting for fear of safety. “I wondered why some speakers allegedly expressed issues in Maasai language which left non-speaking residents out of the whole issue meant to unite the county as some speakers alleged ‘outsiders’ not to be allowed to own more than five acres of land and that local political positions especially in areas where the locals are being led by leaders who are not from Maasai community,” said Ngeno. He added that as the leaders who call Narok home they will call for a comprehensive meeting to discuss the matter to chart their way forward. But a cross-section of Maa leaders have assured all other communities within and outside Maa majority counties that the Maa proposals to the BBI will not exclude or discriminate any other community. Speaking during the  BBI meeting yesterday, Narok Governor Samuel ole Tunai, his Kajiado counterpart Joseph Ole Lenku, Narok Senator Ladema Ole Kina and Narok North MP Moitalel Ole Kenta declared that the Maa Community is part and parcel of the Kenya nation and only seeks to ensure the community’s unique problems, such as historical injustice and dispossessed lands are included in the BBI report. The leaders called on other communities to emphasize with the special Maa Community historical and socio-economic circumstances and to support practical measures to guarantee economic, social and political inclusion of all communities of Kenya.
