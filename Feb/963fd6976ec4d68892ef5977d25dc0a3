 A campaign to eradicate open defecation in Matuga is paying off, with 70 per cent of the residents reported to have built toilets. Matuga constituency tops the rest of Kwale electoral units in the construction of toilets, hence better hygiene. “On matters of sanitation Matuga is the best, leaving Lunga Lunga, Kinango and Msambweni far much behind,” Matuga community health officer Kache Nduva said on Wednesday. Kache attributed the success to select village committees which make door-to-door rounds encouraging people to build lavatories. “The people on the ground educate the villagers to build latrines that provide privacy, can be efficiently cleaned and waste neatly covered,” she said. However, some individuals still defecate in bushes even when they have toilets due to age-old taboos.  " A lot has to be done to ensure that the entire county attains 100% none open defecation," said, regretting that Kwale lagged behind neighbouring counties.
