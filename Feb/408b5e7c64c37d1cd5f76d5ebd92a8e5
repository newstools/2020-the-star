Leaders on Saturday trooped to Kitui County for the fourth leg of campaigns to popularise the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI). The meeting at the Kitui Stadium hosted by Governor Charity Ngilu seeks to reach common ground on what Kitui residents want to be factored in the unity process. ODM leader Raila Odinga, is expected to lead the forum that has brought together politicians from across the country. Raila Odinga arrived at the Kitui Stadium some minutes after 1 pm atop his vehicle with Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya. Kalonzo Musyoka and Charity Ngilu led the convoy as it snaked into the grounds. Raila was received at the Kitui Airstrip by Kitui deputy governor Dr Wathe Nzau. He arrived in the company of Oparanya among other leaders. Hundreds trooped to the county amid expectations for the region’s residents to give their stance on the BBI question. Governors, MPs, Senators, and MCAs led delegations to the event which comes a week after the one held in Mombasa. Other meetings were in Kakamega and Kisii counties. The meeting comes against the backdrop of a concerted effort of politicians keen on marshalling the Ukambani vote to their basket. The region’s leaders have been sending mixed signals on their stand on the BBI, a matter which featured in their meeting in Athi River last Wednesday. In the said meeting, they resolved to reach a common position on the unity pact which will be captured in the ‘Kitui Declaration’ set to be read at today’s rally.
