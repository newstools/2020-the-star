The fate of a crucial top position in the Judiciary now lies with the Judicial Service Commission, MPS in the Justice and Legal Affairs committee were told. JSC secretary Anne Amadi, who is Chief Registrar of the Judiciary, said the Directorate of Finance position will be filled any day. Amadi said there were delays because the office was affected by recent restructuring. “There were two directors in that department and after restructuring, only one position was left available,” she said. Amadi was responding to a question from Kisumu West MP Olago Aluoch who wanted to know why it had taken so long to fill the position. The Directorate of Finance position has not had a head since November 2013. Susan Oyatsi has twice been appointed in acting position and has acted for close to four years without being appointed to take up the position, raising questions. Oyatsi has been interviewed for the position twice and was with Amadi on Thursday when Judiciary officials appeared before the committee. The committee asked her to step outside when Amadi was asked to explain why the position has never been filled. Interviews for the position were held in November last year together with those for planning and organisational performance as well as audit and risk management. Both were filled within days. Oyatsi was first appointed to act in the position in February 2015 by then Chief Justice Willy Mutunga. She took over from Beatrice Kamau who had been acting since November 2013. She then resigned and Philip Kakai was appointed to act in the position. But in December 2016, she was appointed by Chief Justice David Maraga. Lugari MP Ayub Savula has written to the JSC chairman and Chief Justice seeking answers, citing discrimination against Oyatsi. Edited by R.Wamochie
