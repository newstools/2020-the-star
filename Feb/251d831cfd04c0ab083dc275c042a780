Kenya National Paralympics Committee KNPC vice President Dennis Omondi Muga wants players who have already booked their tickets to hit training camp as soon as possible. Despite being continental giants in the sport, Muga said Kenya face stiff opposition against superpowers in the quadrennial event that is governed by the International Paralympics Committee. He opined that putting the team together in a residential camp will create a conducive environment for the athletes to concentrate. He said late preparations are likely to be counterproductive. He, at the same time,Â  appealed to the government to avail funds in time to allow organisers sort everything in time. With Kenya earning recognition in Paralympics, he said the sport deserves the best. "There's no shortcut to achievement. It's all about hard work and training. Tokyo will not be a walk in the park because we will face quality opposition. We need to put things in order to counter global forces. Training as a team has been the biggest problem since players are scattered. If this can be sorted in time, competitors will deliver." "We are happy with government support but we wish they can double the funding for us to train effectively." Powerlifter Hellen Wawira will be amongst those in the plane for the global extravaganza after she emerged top in the 41kgs weight category. 2016 Paralympics champion in the 5,000m T11 category Samwel Mushai has also made the cut. Mushai also won gold in the 1,500M T11 in 2012 Paralympics. T11 1,500m specialist Nancy Chelagat is certain to represent the country too.
