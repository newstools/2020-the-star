Former President Daniel Moi — known for healthy eating and traditional foods — also loved red meat and for his send-off, mourners will dry their eyes and devour tons of meat to celebrate his life. The government with family and friends have slaughtered hundreds of head of cattle to feed the public who will attend the funeral service at his home in Kabarak in Nakuru. Close to 300 chefs and cooks were busy chopping the carcasses at the Kabarak University main cafeteria which will be catering for the public. Family members, dignitaries, friends and invited guests will have their lunch at Moi's home within the university compound. "We have been told that the attendants should eat to their fill and we endeavour to ensure that the family wish is fulfilled," a chef said. Meanwhile, preparations for the final rite for Moi were in top gear at Kabarak University and Afraha Stadium where the proceedings will be projected. Rift Valley Regional Commissioner George Natembeya said at least 30,000 mourners are expected to attend the service. He warned those interested in attending against putting on clothes bearing political messages. "The only clothing with messages that will be allowed at the venue are those with Kanu prints because Mzee was the party chairman," Natembeya said. Rehearsals for the ceremony were ongoing as different formations put their final touches on the preparations. Edited by R.Wamochie
