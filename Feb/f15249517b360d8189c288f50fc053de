Veteran Thomas Odoyo defied age to lead Pakistan Club to victory over star-studded Coast Jafferys, beating them by six wickets in the Coast Cricket Association Twenty20 league at Coast Gymkhana grounds. Jafferys, who fielded current national team players including Irfan Karim, Rushab patel and Emmanuel Bundi failed to defend 165, thanks to Odoyo’s unbeaten 35. Jafferys have themselves to blame for the loss in the NCBA Bank-sponsored event, thanks to Martin Okoth’s two dropped catches at crucial stage. Rushab had led his side to a total of 165 with 50 off 23 balls. In earlier match played at the same venue, Kamande remained unbeaten on 35 runs as Coat Gymkhana beat Gondaria’s SCLPS by six wickets. Bhudia was impressive with the bat, posting 60 runs as SCLPS raced to 145. Ouma had laid the platform for Kamande with 30 in the chase. At the adjacent Mombasa Sports Club, national team trialist Sagar Karia’s half century proved crucial as his the home team beat Burhani Sports Club by 24 runs. Karia scored 71 as his side that included Shem Obado and former Stray Lions opening batsmen Abraham Vadada scored 176 for 4. In reply, Obanda (37) and Odhiambo (42) had given them a good start but their dismissal halfway through the chase proved costly as they ended up losing wickets at regular intervals before finally folding on 152 despite late cameo of 31 fromYusuf Bakir. The tournament director Upesh Patel was impressed with the contribution Nairobi players are making in the league and hoped that this will impact on the coast players. The tournament continues next weekend with four matches on the card.
