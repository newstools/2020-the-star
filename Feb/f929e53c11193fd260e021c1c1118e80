It is inexcusable for the Ezekiel Mutua-led Kenya Film Classification Board to have taken so long in cracking down on Public Service Vehicle operators who play loud music and raunchy videos in matatus. Matatus plying among other routes Waiyaki Way, Lang'ata, Mombasa, Thika, Limuru and Jogoo roads are especially notorious for the screening of x-rated content that exposes children to obscenity. Much of the music and videos played in some of the PSVs are lurid and highly sexualised. The twerking of skimpily dressed females and other acts only lower women's dignity. The already dire situation is further amplified by the social media that glorify sex and anything to do with women's genitalia. Last week's decision by the board to crack the whip starting this week has been long coming. Yes, it's time to bring sanity in PSVs. Passengers have for far too long been badly treated and held captive by rogue conductors and drivers. And it is not like the passengers have not been complaining. Members of the board, policymakers and religious leaders are not immune to the inappropriate content flaunted by the operators. They have been too silent. PSVs must not be allowed to corrupt our morals by glorifying and glamourising irresponsible sexual behaviour.
