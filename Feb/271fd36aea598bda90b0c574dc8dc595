Hundreds of Nairobi residents thronged Parliament building to pay their last respects to former President Daniel arap Moi. Huge crowds started trooping in at 11 am after President Uhuru Kenyatta left after viewing the body of the former president. The young and old, youths, women with young children all waited patiently in long queues for an opportunity to view the body. Officers from the military, the police and National Youth Service had a hectic time controlling the eager crowd who wanted to catch a glimpse of Moi's body. Members of the public entered parliament through the gate opposite KICC and left the precinct through the gate opposite County Hall. All those who entered parliament were frisked before being allowed in. It was a booming business for some hawkers who grabbed the opportunity to sell badges and stickers of the former president. "I have managed to sell 200 badges in just 30 minutes. I have been selling a badge at Sh100 each. I just wish every day was like this," said Peter Mutua, a hawker. A police officer lamented that it is going to be three days of extreme exhaustion should members of the public turn up in large numbers as witnessed when viewing begun. "This will totally wear us out since we will be controlling huge crowds from 8am to 5pm for three days. I'm not complaining though because what we are doing is in honour of the former president, " she said. Other Kenyans watched the session from screens around Nairobi's Central Business District.
