Police have begun investigations into the circumstances under which a Congolese businessman with Kenyan citizenship disappeared last week. Samir Munyinyi, 36, went missing on February 18 after he left his home in Edenville, Kiambu Road for work. “He didn’t report to the office when I checked and never picked my calls when I tried to reach him,” his wife Esther Njenga told the Star on phone on Tuesday. Esther said she reported the matter at Kiambu police station at 11pm on the day he failed to return home. Munyinyi had investments in properties and transport businesses. He was in court for allegedly defrauding Mertroglu Muhammet of Sh25 million and Mertroglu Muhammet Sh 5. 7 million by pretending to sell them gold in 2018. “We had stayed together for more than 10 years,” Esther told the Star. Kiambu OCPD Kimani Mutugo said Esther reported her husband's disappearance at 10pm on February 18, 2020. “We are investigating but I will not give you more details,” Mutugo said. Friends told the Star that CCTV footage obtained at a Petrol Station on Kiambu Road showed that Munyinyi was at there at 11.22am. His black Mercedes car was found parked next to Muthaiga police station at noon without an occupant. “We saw the car, which was left here but it had no occupant. We became suspicious and towed it to the police station” a source at Muthaiga said. Investigators said that they have retrieved Munyinyi's call data from his mobile phone and widened the scope of investigations.
