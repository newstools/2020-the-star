Tributes continued to pour in following the passing on of former President Daniel Toroitich Arap Moi  with the immediate  former Sports Commissioner, Gordon Oluoch touting the  creation of  sports  department in the Ministry of Sports back in 1987 as testament of his love of sports. "In his wisdom, the former President Moi created the department of Sports within the Sports Ministry to manage the technical aspect of sports in the country. Moi recognised that sports should be managed by technical experts if it was to develop to professional standards," Oluoch said in his statement. Oluoch also noted that Moi had a vision for sports that were seen in his actions like helping in the building of notable sports infrastructure like Nyayo Stadium and Kasarani. "Kenyans  recall that Nyayo Stadium, built between 1980-1983, was his brainchild as was Moi Stadium, Kasarani, which sits on 1000-acre piece of land," he said. "He was an avid lover of sports and attended national athletics championships as well as matches involving Harambee Stars. His passion for Sports was there for all to see," added Oluoch. The former sports commissioner concluded by saying that Moi was a  great inspiration to sportsmen and women and his legacy will live on long after his passing.
