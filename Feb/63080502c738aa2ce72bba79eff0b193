The county government of Kitui will exterminate immature locusts (nymphs) by spraying them now that it has mapped out the breeding areas, Deputy Governor Wathe Nzau has said. Nzau, who is coordinating the war against locusts, said the ravenous insects started mating two weeks ago at Maseki, Kyethetu-Kiseuni, Kakuyu, Kyoea, Katse, Mbarani and Kaivirya and the eggs have started hatching. "All is set to deal the locusts a fatal blow now that the county has acquired handheld motorised sprayers to spray the nymphs. We are aware that locusts are ravenous and destructive after their wings are strong enough to fly. It takes time before the wings become strong. It is at this stage that we will strike and wipe them out,” the DG said. He spoke on Thursday as photos of the nymphs (identified as baby locusts) in Maseki started doing rounds on the social media. The news caught the deputy governor offguard. He said he was yet to confirm the hatching in Maseki area of Kyuso. He said the county government was collaborating with the national government in the war on the voracious insects.  National Youth Service personnel will assist in the ground spraying of the nymphs. The county has a stock of  1,400 litres of pesticide from the national government. Nzau said that the NYS personnel will accompany agricultural officers in respective locations.
