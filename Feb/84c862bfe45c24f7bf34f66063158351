The government has set up a technical team to probe shoddy work at the Isiolo International Airport. The facility cost Sh3.1 million but has not been fully operational for three years due to a small and potholed runway. Eastern regional coordinator Isaiah Nakoru told the press at the airport after a fact-finding mission that the team will investigate whether the contractor used substandard materials. The team will conduct a thorough probe including soil analysis, he said. He said the 1.4-kilometre runway will be extended to three to enable bigger aircraft to land at the facility. Nakoru said the team is expected to report back in a week so that repair works can begin. He reiterated the governmentâ€™s commitment to ensuring the facility is up and running. The Kenya Airports Authority will construct cargo sheds at the facility to enable miraa farmers and traders to use the airport for transport, he said. Meanwhile, the East African Safari Express has resumed flights from Nairobi to Isiolo twice weekly. According to Nakoru, the flights will be scheduled on Sunday and Tuesday. He called upon members of public from Isiolo and the region to embrace and support the mega government project by using it regularly. The charges to and from Nairobi are pocket-friendly, he said.
