Politicians from North Eastern led by National Assembly Majority Leader Aden Duale on Monday held a bipartisanship consultative meeting on key issues affecting the region. The more than 40 elected leaders now intend to seek an audience with President Uhuru Kenyatta to present their development issues they want the Jubilee administration. The leaders who included governors Ali Roba(Mandera), Mohamed Mahamud (Wajir) and Garissa's Ali Korane mapped out priority areas for the region. Appearing to be drifting from the Building Bridges Initiative as they seek immediate solutions to the problems the leaders crafted a memorandum they will hand to president Uhuru this week. The meeting comings hot on the heels of a BBI rally that was held in Garissa on Sunday but snubbed by Duale. Duale has argued that the platform to present the region's problems including insecurity, census issues and education cannot be in rallies that have been hijacked by the political class. While a section of leaders from both Eastern presented a memorandum to the Yusu Haji led committee in Garissa, Duale is leading efforts to have key proposals tabled before the taskforce's formal sittings in Nairobi. "We have held a meeting with elected leaders from North Eastern to fine-tune the memorandum to be presented to H.E. Uhuru Kenyatta prior to convening another meeting," Duale said. He said the leaders agreed to present as part of their memorandum education crisis, insecurity within NEP, and infrastructural development. The meeting was also attended by Haji who is also the Garissa senator.
