A fishing expedition for a Budalangi man turned tragic when he drowned in Busirwa dam in Bwakama village of Bunyala North ward. Antony Amondi, 23, was with three other fishermen when he drowned on Saturday morning. Amondi's parents John Wangira and Mildred Anyango told the Star at their home that the youth was an experienced fisherman who had plied his trade even outside the country. They said two of Amondi's fishing colleagues were surprised when they could not see him in the dam yet he had been a short distance from them. They immediately sent one of them to rush to the village and alert the family about what had happened. “We were informed by one of his colleagues that our son had drowned while fishing, prompting us to rush to the scene where we confirmed that the accident had occurred,” Wangira said. Village elder Mathias Magio called upon the Busia county government to speedily fence off the two-acre dam to avoid more deaths. “Area residents, more so the children who might be tempted to swim in the dam could be saved by the fencing of the dam,” Magio said.
