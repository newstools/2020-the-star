Pep Guardiola thinks he will be regarded as a failure at Manchester City if he does not win the Champions League. The former Barcelona boss has won five major trophies since arriving at City in 2016, including Premier League titles in 2017-18 and 2018-19. However, European success has so far eluded Guardiola. “Last year was an extraordinary one for us but people say, ‘But you didn’t win the Champions League’,” he said. “That is why I will be judged, if we don’t win it in my final period here, that I will be a failure here. I know that.” City have not made it beyond the quarter-finals of the Champions League under Guardiola and have been knocked out by Monaco, Liverpool and Tottenham in the last three seasons.
