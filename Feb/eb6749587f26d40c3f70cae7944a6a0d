Rising police shootings have raised an alarm on how our officers operate and without action, it can land our nation into a dilemma. Every day, thousands of police officers respond to a variety of requests for service, many of which are inherently dangerous. More often than not, the police resolve encounters in a peaceful manner. For this, they deserve support and respect from the public. Although the general public supports a majority of police officers in ensuring the security of our nation, there are things we cannot support based on general morals and humanity. Killings by the police lower the public trust in the service making them report fewer cases to the police every day. For the past few years, a number of brutality by the police have raised concern and sparked outrage and consternation as these are the same people we trust to protect us. The case of the officer shooting a boda boda rider over a scuffle with security officers of a city hospital shows that the cops are not prepared to control their emotions when on the job. They carry weapons and should be able to control their anger to avoid such cases. The policing authority should take stern action on officers convicted of brutality or wrong use of their weapons.
