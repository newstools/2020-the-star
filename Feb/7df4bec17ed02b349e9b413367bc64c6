Residents of Gituamba in Kasarani on Sunday held demonstrations after two children aged six and eight years drowned in a dam. Godfrey Maina, a Kasarani resident said the two deaths brought the number to four in the recent past. The open quarries were dug by Safari Rally personnel to get murram for route construction. “We want the government to move with speed and ensure the holes are covered because our children can’t pass via this field or come to play here,” Maina said. Maina said despite having made a report to the relevant authorities when the first child died, no action had been taken to date. Addressing the residents during the demos, area MCA Anthony Mburu askd them to remain calm as he tried to engage the relevant authorities. “If tomorrow they are not here by midday we will come and cover up the holes ourselves and if we do so things will not be good,” Mburu said. “When I wake up tomorrow, the first thing will be to go to their offices to ensure they do what is supposed to be done.” He said the holes were putting the lives of residents and those from neighbouring areas at risk. “Even you where you live there is no way you will dig a pit latrine and fail to cover it.” The residents said the deaths might be higher as they could not tell how many people from neighbouring areas had drowned in the dams. Children come from areas such as Dandora to swim in the dams. Kasarani DCIO Charles Mwangi told the Star yesterday that he could not comment on the matter as it fell under the playground’s administrative department.
