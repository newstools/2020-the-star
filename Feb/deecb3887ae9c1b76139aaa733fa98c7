Former MP Silas Muriuki says his name might be on the North Imenti ballot paper in 2022. “A lot of people are telling me that the development projects I initiated when I was MP have been neglected,” he claimed. Muriuki lost to Abdul Rahim Dawood in the 2017 general elections. The former MP, who has called on Deputy President William Ruto to resign over the now controversial fake Sh39 billion military deal, said roads outside Meru town roads were in a pathetic situation. He accused Dawood of neglecting rural North Imenti for not voting for him. “The areas where I got a lot of votes are not given bursaries and infrastructure. When they ask, they are told to ask me as they voted for me,” he claimed, citing those areas as Nyaki East, Nyaki West, Ntima East and parts of the municipality. Muriuki said roads in Meru town's central business district are potholed. “Gakoromone market is pathetic while Njuri Nceke, Kirukuri, Mosque and Harambee roads are full of potholes. Meru town is neglected by MCAs and the MP,” he said. Muriuki said it was unfortunate for high-security offices like the DP's to be associated with fraud. “I heard the DP said the staff should be reshuffled. I think they should be sacked and arraigned. If I were the DP, I would resign as he has admitted that the fraud happened in his office without his knowledge,” he said. Muriuki said there have been many corruption cases in the country but none had to do with illegal arms.
