The Mediheal Group of Hospitals will soon be conducting liver transplants after it hired experienced specialists. Hospital chairman Swarup Mishra said they have successfully performed kidney transplants among other complicated operations. “The hospital has been of great help, not only people from Eldoret but in the entire republic. We have had successful kidney and other surgeries,” Mishra said. The MP for Kesses spoke in Eldoret over the weekend. He dismissed rumours that he is involved in the smuggling of kidney and other human body parts. “If I bring specialists from India to conduct successful surgery to Kenyans and reducing the expenditure of travelling to other countries, my opponents accuse me of kidney smuggling. That is nonsense,” Mishra said. Uasin Gishu Deputy Governor Daniel Chemno said the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) should be expanded to cover the recovery process, not operations only. “We need a full cover on the kidney. We want the cover for the testing, operation, and post operations treatment,” Chemno said. There is a rise of people suffering from kidney diseases as witnessed in our hospital. We want to stop this movement to India, he said. Parliamentary Health Committee chairperson Sabina Chege said they are working on reforms at NHIF. “Within a month, it will be able to cover most of what the deputy governor has requested especially on kidney and cancer,” she said. Chege said it laudable when then the private sector comes in it complement what the government is doing. “We visited Eldoret sometimes back last year as the Health Committee and we saw everything you are doing. We appreciate the efforts,” Chege said.
