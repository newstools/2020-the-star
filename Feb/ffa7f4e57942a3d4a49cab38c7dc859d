Construction of the Sh1.8 billion Kirandich Water Dam Phase II project in Kabarnet, Baringo county has stalled over alleged Sh270 million owed to the contractor. On Tuesday, Baringo Central MP Joshua Kandie appealed to the government to liaise with their Italian counterpart to fast track the completion of the dam. The 1.4 million cubic meters Italian-funded dam was established in 1994 and its treatment and piping plant was planned to commence immediately. There were also plans to construct a modern Kabarnet town sewerage system to at Sh700 million, which has also stalled. Works resumed in April last year but were put on hold indefinitely in November. Kandie regretted that the delay had kept thousands of thirsty residents in Kabarnet town, Kituro, Kapropita, Kaptorokwo, Kabasis, Kapkut, Kiboino, Tenges and Kabartonjo waiting. The lawmaker said that owing to the delay in completion of the dam his office has had to fund sinking of boreholes, do piping and connect water meter boxes so people have access to clean water. On Saturday, he issued over 50 water meter boxes worth Sh150,000 to Kongmet community borehole at Kituro to benefit over 100 homesteads. “Residents can now pay their water bills and run their normal daily activities comfortably without encountering the stress of frequent of water rationing,” Kandie said. He said the money used to purchase the meters is part of the proceeds realised during the annual 10-kilometre Kirandich Dam Road Race held along Kapsogo-Kabarnet town in August last year. “I cannot watch as my people thirst around the stalled giant Kirandich dam,” Kandie said. He has also sunk boreholes in Tenges, Tandui and Kapsogo only awaiting connection of pipes and solar power. The MP further pledged to distribute plastic tanks to his constituents ahead of the rains to help in water harvesting.
