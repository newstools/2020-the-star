Kakamega Homeboyz team manager Boniface Imbenzi has faulted Fifa's decision to ban players allegedly involved in manipulation of matches for three years, saying they are just sacrificial lambs but the real culprits are still free. Imbenzi  termed Fifa's punishment to the affected players harsh. On Wednesday defender Festus Okiring currently of Ulinzi, Festus Omukoto of Western Stima and Moses Chikati of Homeboyz were banned for three years each while Ugandan George Mandela was handed life ban from taking part in any kind of football-related activity at national and international level following their  involvement in match-manipulation. Imbenzi revealed that the affected players were used as witnesses to form the case against the runaway Ugandan coach Paul Nkata who allegedly was the main suspect. He faulted the federation for ignoring some of the allegations and complaints from the affected teams—a development that threatens to ruin  the credibility of local football. “As we hope to clean the match fixing mess,  I would like to appeal to the relevant authorities to get to the bottom of the matter and ensure real culprits are brought to book. "I want to sympathise with the affected players going by their young age and also bearing in mind how they were settling in this trade. It would have been better if the period of the ban was less," said Imbenzi. Reached for comment, Homeboyz dependable defensive midfielder Moses Chikati revealed that he was shocked to read in the news as he was preparing with the rest of players for the away match against Bandari in Mombasa. He also added that he is yet to receive the official letter before deciding on the next step as he fights to salvage his career which is currently at the peak with Kakamega Homeboyz.
