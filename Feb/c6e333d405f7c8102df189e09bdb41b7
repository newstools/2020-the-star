Kenya Revenue Authority officials in Garissa on Friday morning  destroyed assorted contraband worth Sh1.8 million seized from smugglers. Garissa county commissioner Meru Mwangi who oversaw the exercise at the Garissa dumpsite said the goods were intercepted by security officers at various entry points in June and July last year. Security was tight at the site to keep off looters. “The goods were seized during the ongoing multi-agency crackdown on illicit goods. Most of them were concealed to evade payment of tax (import duty), while some were found to be counterfeit or substandard products,” Mwangi said. “The goods had been smuggled into the country from neighbouring Somalia.” Some of the goods destroyed included 82 bags of sugar weighing 25kg each, 234 bags of rice weighing 25kg each, 59 cartons of assorted powder, 75 rolls of textiles of 25 metres, 50 pieces of multivitamin syrups of 200ml, norfloxagin and metranidazole 96 pieces all valued at Sh1,870,250. Mwangi said stern action would be taken against anyone found smuggling contraband goods into the country to create unnecessary competition in the market. “These kind of products are not even fit for human consumption. That is why we are destroying them to send a clear message to all those dealing with illegal goods that their days are numbered,” he said. Mwangi said all state agencies will work closely to ensure substandard products that are potentially harmful to Kenyans don’t find their way into the country. “We want to protect legitimate businesses who pay taxes to the government from unfair market competition,” he noted.
