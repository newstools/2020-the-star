Turkana pastoralists have asked the government to help fight a desert locust invasion that is threatening their livestock pasture and livelihoods.. Agriculture CEC Christopher Aletia said that Turkana has been infested by both tree and desert locusts. Aletia said the county spent Sh30 million last year to spray tree locusts but the government didn't give any support. “The desert locusts were spotted in Elelea and other parts of Turkana East. When our team reached on the ground, they had left the region to neighbouring counties," he said. He said they later learnt that the swarm of desert locusts split in two directions to Katilia in Turkana East and Kerio in Turkana Central subcounty. Aletia said the maturing yellow desert locusts have been spotted in all parts of Turkana. “We were told not to fear the yellow locusts because they fly with winds but they have been laying the eggs and hatch. The nymphs are now on the ground and they are dangerous,” he said. Aletia has appealed to the national government for help since they don't have chemicals to spray the insects. Peter Ewaat, a herder from Lorenglup in Kerio said they were afraid for their livestock because the locusts are feeding on vegetation. "Recently we experienced rains that brought vegetation but the infestation of the desert locust is a threat to our cattle," he said. Margaret Ewoi, a resident of Kerio said swarms of locusts are moving from region to region. She said they are living in fear of drought and hunger because of locusts infestation in the region.
