Gospel singer Size 8 says being close to God helped her overcome the trauma of having a miscarriage. Size, 8, who’s married to DJ Mo, told Word Is it was easy for her because she understands God is the giver of life. Everything on this earth is temporary, she said. The singer said she suffered postnatal-depression, saying it is always good to speak out what you are feeling. In December 2018, she shared a heartbreaking story and to women who have gone through a similar ordeal. “Rumours were in many blogs that I was pregnant but I never did confirm it because it was a battle all the way, so I just wanted to go with the fight privately," she said. “But God decided the best lane for me and I lost the pregnancy. To be honest, I’ve cried and asked God so many questions. I have given my husband stress. He is trying to make me okay. “I was so angry. My faith in God has been greatly tested...But what the holy spirit reminds me is this: ‘Linet, trust in the faithfulness of God. Trust in His perfect love for you. He knows what's best for you, Linet. “So to all the women who have gone through the same, I will tell you this: God loves us and He knows what’s best for us. And let us trust in His faithfulness.” Size 8 got pregnant and welcomed her son in November last year, although it was a tough journey again. She narrated how the pregnancy took a toll on her, a few months after she suffered a miscarriage. "I panicked and asked my husband (DJ Mo): The other pregnancy miscarried, what if this also terminates? So we rushed to the hospital and I was given some medication," she said. Size 8 and husband DJ Mo will hold a Valentine’s dinner event titled,‘Dine with the Murayas’. It is open to those in relationships and single folk, too. The red-carpet affair will go down at The Emory hotel, and charges are Sh7,000 per couple and VIP Sh10,000 per couple.
