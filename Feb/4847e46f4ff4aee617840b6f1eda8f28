The University of Eldoret will host this weekend’s Athletics Kenya track and field meeting following the unavailability of scheduled venue, Kipchoge Keino Stadium. AK Central Rift chairman Abraham Mutai said they have been forced to settled for the university track since the stadium is still under renovations. The event will be held on Saturday and Sunday as opposed to the earlier communication for Friday and Saturday, according to AK vice president in charge of competitions Paul Mutwii. And with the national trials to the 2020 Olympic Games set for the same venue in June, Mutai expressed his disappointment with the pace of renovations. “We are forced to use a substandard track because the Kipchoge Keino Stadium is still closed for renovations. This is not good for both athletes and technical teams, who are always working hard to ensure that they get correct results,” said Mutai as they put final touches in their preparations to host the first-weekend meeting. The officials appealed to the government to complete the renovations with an eye at the Olympic trials. On Tuesday, stakeholders from the region visited the iconic stadium to establish its status but were shocked by what they saw. “We pleaded with the county government of Uasin Gishu to give us access into the facility but upon entry, we were shocked to find it bushy and thus not fit to host such a championship,” said Mutai.
