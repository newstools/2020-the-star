Khaligraph Jones has defended himself after he alleged in his new song ‘Yes, Bana’ that Nyashinski denied him a chance to do a collabo with him. The song, in which he features Bien of Sauti Sol, was released on Thursday last week. Partly the lyrics say, "Shinki collabo tufanye? Yes, bana. Tushike from Dago to Kani. Yes, Bana. Into bradhangu, wasema ni? Yes, Bana. Usitry kunishow haiwezekani. Yes, bana." Explaining that during an exclusive interview with Word Is, Khaligraph said, "He has not refused, I am just echoing the voice of the fans. Sometimes they ask me when am I releasing a song with Nyashinski. Kama inafanyika, ifanyike." On why he chose to collaborate with Bien in his new jam, Khaligraph said, "Bien is a very good friend of mine, and he is used to doing a different genre of songs. So I wanted to introduce him to hip hop."
