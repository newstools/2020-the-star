Munch away, desert locusts sprayed with pesticides are not harmful, the government has told locust-eating communities. Government spokesman Cyrus Oguna said on Friday the pesticides used to kill the insects have been tested rigorously and declared not harmful to human health. Speaking in Embu, he said there is no chance of anyone developing side effects after eating sprayed desert locusts. “I know there are parts of this country where the insects are delicacies like in Western because they are very rich in protein. Duration of oxidation is very low so once they have been sprayed within two hours the drug is oxidised and is not harmful at all,” Oguna said. He said the locusts have invaded 21 counties so far. Oguna was speaking at Embu Talent Academy, where he presided over a public participation forum on a proposed law to manage the National Integrated Identification Management System, popularly known as Huduma Namba. Meanwhile, in Kithimu, Embu West subcounty, farmers were frantically trying to scare away locusts that were destroying their Muguka plantations. Oguna said the insects have started to break into small groups as they look for areas to lay their eggs under the ground. The government has, therefore, increased the number of teams carrying out ground spraying. It will also educate citizens on how to identify young locusts so they can be sprayed while still on the ground. Oguna said citizens' Huduma Namba data will be safe. Only criminals' details will be shared to enable security personnel arrest them. Edited by Josephine M. Mayuya
