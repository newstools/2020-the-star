Six more people were on Monday morning treated and discharged following a suspected anthrax outbreak in Emityot village in Sotik, Bomet. Health executive member Joseph Sitonik said all the individuals exhibited cutaneous signs where watery wounds appeared on parts of their bodies. Sitonik said they were out of danger. Those referred on Sunday, he added, were also attended to and discharged. No patient is admitted to any health facility as a result of anthrax, Sitonik said. "We treated and released them after they tested positive for the disease, but we would also like to state that there are no patients admitted to hospitals since their conditions are not severe," Sitonik told journalists in his office. The number of those who came in contact with the carcasses of the animals was 29 â€“ those under five years were four, 17 male adults and eight women. Sitonik said the number of animals that died were seven. While calling on residents from the area to visit the nearest health facilities for check up, the CEC said the disease had adverse effects on humans, saying it can cause severe pneumonia.
