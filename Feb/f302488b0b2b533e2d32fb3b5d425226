Kenya is making good progress in improving maternal healthcare, spelling good fortune for expectant mothers in the country. Introduction of free hospital delivery initiatives such as Linda Mama have spearheaded this progress. In addition to this, health records of 2007-17 indicate that there has been a decline in infant mortality rates, which is a sure guide to success.
