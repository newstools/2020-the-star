Police in Kisumu are investigating the cause of a fire that broke out at the IFMIS section of the county finance offices on Sunday evening. The fire on the second floor of Prosperity House destroyed documents in the finance and planning office that also hosts the directors of budgeting, accounting services, revenue and supply chain management. Firefighters arrived on the scene and put off the fire after it had damaged computers and files. They stopped it from spreading to the adjacent offices. Kisumu county police boss Ranson Lolmodon told the Star on the phone that the cause of the fire is yet to be known. “We are currently carrying out investigations to establish the cause of the fire,” he said. The governor's press officer Aloice Ager in a statement said the fire was managed by the quick response of the county fire brigade. “A comprehensive brief will be provided as soon as we receive information from the investigating officers,” Ager said. However, he said that they don't know what might have been lost in the fire because the police have just commenced investigations. A section of residents who spoke to the Star suspected arson to cover-up alleged misappropriation of funds. Kisumu Residents Association Chairman Audi Ogada said the timing of the fire was questionable. “We want the issue to be investigated properly and the public be told the truth if this is a cover-up on something,” he told the Star. He said the civil society organisations are concerned by how the county government is being run. “Issues of pending bills have brought untold suffering and pain amongst contractors and suppliers,” Audi said.
