Wazito defender Johnstone Omurwa believes last weekend’s one-all draw against Kakamega Homeboyz  at Bukhungu will instil confidence in the team ahead of the club's forthcoming assignments starting with Western Stima tomorrow. Derrick Otanga’s stoppage-time strike from the spot halted the Moneybags’ seven-match losing streak in the Kenyan Premier League and Omurwa, who skippered the team in the match in the absence of Lloyd Wahome and Bernard Ochieng, said  the point earned in Kakamega will boost the squad’s belief. “It’s definitely a huge confidence boost for everyone after such a long poor run. Getting a point against a Homeboyz side that had won their last four games and are among the title contenders is commendable,” the defender opined. Omurwa also praised the team’s fighting spirit throughout the game. He said  even going down early in the second half did not deter the team’s resolve not to lose the match. “The fighting spirit was very good. Even when trailing, the boys kept fighting and no one in the team wanted to lose. We still believed that we could get something out of the match and luckily,  it came in the last minute of the game. It’s the least we deserved,” he added. The defender recruited from Mathare United at the start of the season was equally confident that he can skipper Stuart Hall’s charges if the responsibility is bestowed on him permanently “I think I was born a leader and a chance to skipper the team is one that I cherish. Hopefully, I can lead the team to a couple of wins in our next few assignments,” he concluded on Wazito’s portal. Wazito have endured an underwhelming season, managing 12 points from 19 matches and are just six points adrift of cash strapped bottom placed Chemelil Sugar and four above the last automatic relegation slot occupied by Kisumu All Stars. Wazito are yet to win any match at home and will be hoping to end that jinx when they take on Stima in Narok.
