Jubilee secretary general Raphael Tuju will return home on Wednesday, former Jubilee vice chairman David Murathe said. Tuju was involved in a road accident on February 12 on the Nairobi-Nakuru Highway while en route to Kabarak for the burial of retired President Daniel Moi. He was flown to London for specialised treatment on February 19. "Tuju is coming back on Wednesday, he is now healed," Murathe said. He had been invited by former Prime Minister Raila Odinga to address the Building Bridges Initiative rally at Kinoru stadium in Meru on Saturday. He did not, however, elaborate further. Tuju had reportedly broken two ribs and had some injuries in the intestines during the accident. He also complained of difficulty in breathing. There were also fears that some of his internal organs could also have been injured during the head-on collision with a matatu. He underwent emergency surgery at Kijabe Hospital before being airlifted to Nairobi. At the Karen Hospital, Tuju was sedated for days and only his family, close friends and top government officials were allowed to visit. However, on Tuesday, the Jubilee Party announced that he had been weaned off sedation and assured the public he was responding well to treatment. “He is conscious and fully in control of his limbs just as he was when he walked into the accident and emergency section of Kijabe Hospital,” Jubilee Communication Director Albert Memusi announced. The matatu driver involved in the Wednesday morning accident along Naivasha-Nairobi Highway has been put on life support. The driver was unconscious after the accident and was rushed to the Kijabe Mission Hospital. Three vehicles were involved in the accident. The other 12 passengers who sustained minor injuries were also rushed to Kijabe Mission Hospital. One of the passengers sustained an injury on the chest while another sustained a head injury. The two, however, are in stable condition. Edited by R.Wamochie
