The Busia county assembly resumed on Tuesday after 74 days recess, with a call to members to uphold justice and improve residents' lives. Minority leader Felix Omanyi told the house to come up with statements or motions on the challenges they encountered during the recess so they can respond to issues raised by residents. "We also want the executive to expedite the advertisement of tenders for various pending ward projects and get contractors on the ground to execute tasks for the 2018-19 financial year," he said. Education Committee chairperson Novena Ndaliro said the Education department had done invoicing for bursaries, which she said will be issued on Friday. She said the committee will fast-track the education and vocational training centre bills to enable the department to execute its mandate within the legal framework put in place. "Other burning issues in the department will be to issue letters to about 460 first cohorts of teachers whose terms are being converted from contract to permanent and pensionable basis," Ndaliro said. Malaba South MCA David Kokonya urged the executive to expedite the implementation of projects so they are completed before the next financial year. He said he will come up with a motion to have the Facility Improvement Fund, which is applicable in hospitals, replicated in markets to enable a portion of funds collected retained for maintenance of the facility. "I will also come up with another motion mandating 50-tonne lorries to buy sand from locals at current market prices, instead of throwaway prices," Kokonya said. Deputy speaker Lawrence Okaale, who chaired the session, said members would deliberate on the calendar of events on Wednesday. The session will tentatively on December 3, 2020, with two breaks between April 24 and May 18, and August 18 and April 7.
