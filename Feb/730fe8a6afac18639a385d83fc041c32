Former Sports CS Rashid Echesa has been charged with conspiracy to commit a felony by conspiring to make a document with intent to defraud. Echesa has also been charged alongside three others with six counts of making a false document in the Sh39.5 billion fake arms deal. They are also alleged to have obtained Sh11.5 Million from Kozlowski Stanley Bruno by purporting that they will award him with a tender to supply military equipment. However, they all denied the charges. Echesa has also denied impersonating to be Deputy President William Ruto's PA. The suspects have also been charged with attempting to defraud Sh39 billion from the complainants. The prosecution has opposed bail with the DPP saying if released they might interfere with witnesses and exhibits. State Counsel Jacinta Nyamodi argued that they be denied bail for now and the court can review bail at a later date. Echesa was presented before the court on Monday morning but his lawyers opposed the plea taking arguing that there is an order at JKIA court. Evans Ondieki argued that they had been ambushed this morning in a bid to frustrate them. Last week the court had directed that Echesa be released on an Sh1 million police bond after a search had been conducted at his Karen home. The police conducted the search on Saturday but did not release Echesa and opted to charge him on Monday. They had been given until 6 pm to release him, but Echesa and the co-accused were to appear before the JKIA court for mentioning of the matter. His lawyers led by Ondieki while arguing before the judge said the case is about the Deputy President William Ruto adding that there are letters written by politicians including Kitui governor Charity Ngilu on the matter before the court.
