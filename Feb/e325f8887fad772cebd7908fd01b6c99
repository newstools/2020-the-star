Wazalendo forward Sutcliffe Usagi has set his eyes on winning the Kenya Hockey Union Premier League top scorer award this season. The maverick striker registered five goals and four assists last season and now wants to triple that tally and as well double his assists to dethrone last year's winner Greensharks' Chris Wokila, who had 13 strikes. Usagi, a former Dedan Kimath University player, was crowned the HockeyKE player of the year in the inaugural awards early this month. He observed that academic commitments, which meant he missed most of his team's midweek matches last season, are now off his plate and therefore offers him a chance to fully concentrate on the team's course. "Everything is possible this season. Last season was not as productive as much as I wanted it to be but I believe in my abilities. Through hard work, I will manage," said the former Friends School Kamusiga player. "15 goals will not be a bad return at the end of the season. I also hope to play more games and remain consistent throughout the season." Usagi believes the decision by the management to stick with all the players will bear fruits as they launch an assault on winning the title. The team finished second last season and Usagi believes they have no excuse not to do well this year, adding that their structure and style of play will be like a secret weapon against their opponents. The laid back attacker is also targeting a senior national team call up. "Playing for the national team will be a dream come true and I endeavour to battle for a place," he said.
