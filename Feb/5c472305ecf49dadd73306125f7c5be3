The race for the Kenya Cup playoffs intensifies on Saturday at various venues across the country. Three teams are battling for the two remaining slots including Menengai Oilers, Mwamba and Nakuru. Menengai are fifth-placed with 36 points; Mwamba are sixth on 34 points while Nakuru are seventh on 33 points with two games remaining to the end of the group phase. Oilers have a tough fixture against champions KCB at the Lions Den in Ruaraka. In the first leg meeting played in November, the bankers came away with a resounding 43-13 victory in Nakuru. The holders have made four changes to the squad with Samuel Asati getting the nod to start at scrum-half where he will partner with Johnstone Olindi who is set to start at fly-half for the second time in a row after missing out the Kenya 7s squad. Levy Amunga is back to the squad to play as the inside centre while Brian Omondi has shifted to the outside in the absence of Peter Kilonzo. Mwamba have a tricky encounter with Impala at the Railway Club. The Ngong Road outfit won the first leg encounter narrowly ( 26-24) with a last-minute try and will be seeking to bounce back after losing top league leaders Kabras 37-24 last weekend. Nakuru make the short trip to Nairobi to play Quins at the RFUEA ground. In the first leg meeting, the Rift valley-based side came from behind to win 25-18. Head coach Felix Oloo termed today's match a must-win for his charges. "We are in the seventh position and its a critical game for us if we are to qualify for the playoffs. We lost to KCB last weekend but in terms of performance, our boys stood up and gave a good account of themselves,‚Äù added Oloo. In other fixtures Kabras host Nondies at the Kakamega Showground, Homeboyz travel to Kakamega to face Western Bulls as Kisumu host Blak Blad.
