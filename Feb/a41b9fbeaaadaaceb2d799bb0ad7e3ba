An embargo imposed by the Kitui county government on the sale of iron ore from Tumboni mines in Ikutha division is hurting locals, a local clergyman, who is also a dealer, claims. Rev Patrice Matuku said that since June, 2019, when Governor Charity Ngilu stopped the sale of iron ore to brokers, locals have suffered because that was their only reliable source of income. “The governor may have meant well for us because she had promised to get us a buyer who would offer very attractive rates. That has never happened and as a result the lives of many people who depended on the mineral for income have been turned upside down,” said Matuku. He claimed families have broken up and women have resorted to engaging in prostitution to fend for their families as men have abandoned families since they are unable to meet financial and other obligations. “The situation is dire in Timboni area. Married women and young girls who have dropped out of school and colleges for lack of school fees have resorted to prostitution to earn money,” said the AIC clergyman, who heads the Ebeneza Artisanal Miners Association in Timboni area. He was making a presentation on the challenges local communities in mineral producing areas were facing, during a two-day Jukwaa la Madini 2020-Kitui County conference that concluded in Kitui on Friday. Rev Matuku called for the reviewing of the order by the governor to allow the locals, who were now stuck with the ore, to sell it as they waited for the county government to link them with the promised buyer. “Mombasa Cement and DEVIK companies, who were buying the iron ore, have kept away for fear they would be arrested for flouting the governor order. Others fear that their lorries would be torched should they violate the ban,” said the church leader.
