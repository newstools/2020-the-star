Seventy-one people have pleaded guilty in an Eldoret Court to charges of forging Kenya Defence Forces calling letters after they reported to Moi Barracks Recruits Training College in Eldoret with the fake documents. Twenty-eight others, however, denied the charge when they appeared before Principal Magistrate Naomi Wairimu and were released on a Sh30,000 bond. Their case will be mentioned on February 24. Each of the suspects had been charged with two counts of forgery and uttering a false document. Those who pleaded guilty were fined Sh10,000 each for each of every count. They allegedly committed the offense on unknown dates with other people who were not in court. The youth were arrested on January 26 when they arrived for admission to startÂ training. They were nabbed during screening by military police and handed over to the Kenya police service to be charged in court. Colonel Paul Njuguna from Public Affairs Department at the KDF headquarters said only those who were recruited at the advertised centres in all subcounties were taken in for training.
