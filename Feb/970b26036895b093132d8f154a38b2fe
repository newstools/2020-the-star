Seven suspected robbers were shot dead by Special Crimes Unit officers after a dramatic chase from Nairobi to Isinya, Kajiado county. The officers trailed the suspects from Nairobi shortly after midnight on Wednesday up to China camp on the Isinya-Kiserian road at 2am Thursday. Isinya subcounty police boss Kinyua Mugambi said his officers were not involved. “This was purely a special service crime unit officers’ affair, and they managed to gun them down after they failed to stop when flagged down,” Mugambi said. Police recovered one AK 47 rifle with three rounds of ammunition, two police jungle jackets and a radio set from the suspects. “One AP’s beret, seven mobile phones, and assorted crude weapons were recovered from the suspects’ vehicle,” Mugambi said. The police boss said there was no casualty on the part of the police officers. “DCI has started investigations on the matter after the bodies of the seven suspects were moved to City Mortuary,” Mugambi said. The bullet-riddled car belonging to the suspects was towed to Isinya police station. Special Crimes Unit officers responded to a tip that a Toyota Fielder (black) with suspicious characters onboard had been seen in Isinya town. The suspects, they said, drove towards Birika trading centre along Isinya-Kiserian road. “On reaching China Construction site area, the robbers made a U-turn and drove back towards Isinya,” police said. They were ordered to stop by the officers but did not comply. Instead, they started firing at the officers' vehicles. The officers fired back, killing all of them. Two of the suspected thugs had ID cards with them. Police believe the gang has been responsible for a series of robberies in Nairobi, Mlolongo, Kitengela, and Isinya.
