Dogged for years by lack of incentives to support their league women footballers in the country have a reason to be optimistic after  Kenya Footballers welfare Association (KEFWA) revealed they will launch a monthly awarding project dubbed 'players for players award' starting in March. KEFWA, in a statement, said the award will boost morale and level of competition in the Kenya Women Premier League (KWPL). According to the organisation’s secretary general Jerry Santo, the project is aimed at recognising the immense talent among the girls and young women taking part in the WPL. He also adds that a gala at the end of the season will be the highlight of the highly anticipated activity. “When I attend WPL matches, I do not see anything less of what is offered in the men's leagues. I enjoy the matches and get to see amazingly talented players who are capable of winning anything locally, regionally and even globally," said Santo. "It is therefore time we start appreciating the women and this is why we are coming up with this initiative, which is a first in the history of women football in the country. At the end of the season, a gala will be held in order to award players who have performed well throughout the season in different categories.” Last year, the KEFWA Player of the year award went to Vihiga Queens striker Terry Engesha, who was the top goal scorer in the WPL with a total of 36 goals.
