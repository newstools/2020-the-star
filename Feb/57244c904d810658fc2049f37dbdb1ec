Wajir Governor Mohamed Abdi has warned county and national officials against stealing relief food meant for hungry people. He said on Thursday some officials responsible of safeguarding and distributing e food to vulnerable groups up divert and sell it for their personal benefit. He spoke at the Wajir cereals board offices after flagging off relief rice, cooking oil and sifted maize meal. "Any reports on loss or sale of the relief food by anybody — whether staff or a community member —will be met with the full force of the law,” the governor said. He directed subcounty and ward administrators to be at their duty stations to ensure fair distribution of food. "It is not only sinful but also morally wrong for one to divert relief food meant for the poor. Such individuals should not be tolerated," the governor said. He added, “No deserving case should be left out. Special groups such as the orphans, people with disabilities, elderly, single-headed families and extremely poor families must be the target.” Cases of food theft in Northeastern have become common with administrators being implicated. Abdi further directed the Department of Town Administration and Decentralised Units to work closely with the Special Programmes department in supervising distribution. The governor also urged residents to find other ways of making a living, saying providing relief food is not sustainable. Edited by R.Wamochie
