Embu boda boda operators behave badly – they defile schoolgirls after enticing them with free rides and money. This behaviour has been condemned by Woman Representative Jane Wanjuki, who on Wednesday, also urged parents to devote time to their daughters and counsel them to avoid sex until they are mature. “When your daughter comes home with an item that you have not bought,  find out where she got it as this might be an indication of a relationship with an irresponsible man,” the lawmaker said. They should provide their daughters with basic necessities and educate them on the dangers of free rides as boda boda operators demand to be paid with sex. Wanjuki, who spoke in her Embu Town office during the presentation of Sh2.3 million bursary cheques to university, college and secondary school students, said educated and empowered girls shunned irresponsible behaviour and were not vulnerable to exploitation by men. She said immoral men take advantage of schoolgirls' ignorance on matters sex and law. Wanjuki called on the police to always be suspicious if they see underage girls in the company of boda boda riders and matatu touts. She asked them to act decisively so that as many girls as possible remain in school and complete their education. The Woman rep regretted that the county government had condoned the opening of many bars where wayward students pass through on their way home in the evening. She further called on parents not to criticise teachers in the presence of their children as that encouraged the learners to become arrogant and disobedient. Wanjuki said she wants both men and women empowered, hence the introduction of programmes in which youths are trained in procurement and other professions at the Kenya School of Government, Embu campus. The training of 300 youths in plumbing will start soon, she added.
