Seven Kenyan fishermen have been arrested and detained by Uganda security officers over alleged border trespass and use of prohibited fishing gear. The fishermen identified as Vincent Owino, Maurice Otieno, Kennedy Owino, Moses Ayieta, Calvins Okinyi, Fredrick Omollo and Walter Otieno from a beach in Suba South were arrested on Wednesday night. Homa Bay County Beach Management Unit chairperson Edward Oremo said the fishermen were taken to Kalangala police station in Uganda where they were held, awaiting to be arraigned. The Ugandan security officers also confiscated their two boats and fishing gear. Oremo said Ugandan officers accused the Kenyans of trespass andusing fishing gear that is prohibited on the Ugandan side. "The security personnel arrested the fishermen because they were using gear that is not allowed on the Uganda side," Oremo said. Homa Bay county commissioner David Kipkemei said they were already negotiating with the Ugandan authorities to have the fishermen released before being taken to court. He however appealed to the Kenyan fishermen in Lake Victoria to avoid using illegal gear and crossing over to the Ugandan side to avoid such arrests in the future.
