 The government has started preparations to roll out the 2-6-6-3 curriculum to Grade 5 after publishers were asked to submit learning materials for evaluation. The Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development will evaluate and approve materials to be used for teaching and learning in schools. The CBC moves to Grade 5 next year. The new system ends primary school learning at Grade 6 meaning pioneer cohorts will exit primary school education under the new system in 2022. KICD in an advert on Tuesday asked publishers to submit course materials for the Grade 5 rollout for vetting which starts on April 6. "The Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development wishes to invite publishers registered or legally represented in Kenya to download the submission, evaluation and approval procedures for competency-based curriculum course materials 2020," the advert reads. The institute has contracted Kenya Literature Bureau, Oxford University Press, Jomo Kenyatta Foundation, Moran Publishers, Spotlight, Longhorn Publishers and East Africa Education Publishers who printed textbooks for Grade 4 last year. CBC has 14 subjects in primary school and the evaluation will entail a review of textbooks to be used. "Publishers submission for any of the listed learning areas for evaluation and approval must be made not later than April 6." Last week, Education Cabinet Secretary George Magoha said plans were underway to train teachers on the new curriculum in the course of the year. The training is expected to take place during the school holidays of April, August and December. However, the Teachers Service Commission that handles the training raised concerns, saying it was too underfunded for the exercise. TSC chief executive Nancy Macharia said the commission only received Sh300 million out of the required Sh1.3 billion for the training. Macharia spoke when she appearing before the National Assembly's Committee on Education on Wednesday last week.  edited by peter obuya
