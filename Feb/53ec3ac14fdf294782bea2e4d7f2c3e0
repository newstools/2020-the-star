Little-known Kamwosor Junior Athletics Training Camp is the latest entry as a breeding place for junior runners in the country following their dominance at the recently concluded national x-country championships/trials. Located in Keiyo South, Elgeyo Marakwet county, the camp under the management of Ruth Jepchumba Bundotich, produced four athletes who will run for Kenya in African cross in Lome, Togo on April 8, all in junior ranks. Two-time East Africa junior champion Agnes Jebet will lead the U-20 title chase in the girls' category, Marion Cheruiyot will compete in girls’ U-18 alongside Naomi Jeptoo while Shadrack Kipchirchir will run in boys’ U-20. The four will be joined by other athletes who train together in Baringo County especially from Torongo camp. They include Ismael Kirui in the boys U-18, Gideon Rono (boys’ U-20), Emmanuel Kiplagat (boys’ U-20) and Lydia Jeruto mixed relay. The celebrated Jebet who won the 3,000m and 1,500m at the East Africa junior championships is a Form 3 student at Kimwogo secondary, just like both Jeptoo (Form 1) and Cheruiyot(Form 2) while Kipchirchir is in Form 3 at Chewoyet. Jepchumba said the club was created mainly to train and nurture various talents in the region. “Our main aim is to tap, nurture and promote talent for the young runners who lack access to proper training,” said Jepchumba. She added : “As a teacher and their mentor, I am happy for the young talent and I hope they will impress at the continental show.”
