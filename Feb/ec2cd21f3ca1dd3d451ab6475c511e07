 This financial year's development projects in Marsabit will be suspended to clear pending bills, Governor Mohamud Ali has said. Ali appeared to the county assembly for support to clear the Sh374 million owed to contractors and suppliers. He asked the ward reps to approve a supplementary budget his government will be presenting to the assembly to hasten the payment. His government inherited pending bills worth Sh1.2 billion. The governor, who was addressing the MCAs on Tuesday, said the indebtedness has forced a cut on recurrent expenditure and is considering freezing non-essential travelling, training and conferences. He at the same time urged the MCAs to effectively play their oversight roles to ensure that contractors complete work within the set timelines. He said that his government will continue all the transformation programmes like free ambulance services and medical insurance. "The county will maintain the operations and delivery of all the essential services in spite of the fiscal challenges," Ali said. He said Marsabit leaders support the Building Bridges Initiative report released to the public late last year. He called on all leaders, irrespective of their political affiliation, to jointly find solutions to the challenges of the county. "We must put our antagonism behind us, ease tension in our midst to build our county," he said. Ali said he will work for the enhancement of social harmony and peaceful coexistence among all communities in the county, transparency and accountability. "I will continue to work tirelessly to make Marsabit a county for all. The government will be accessible, responsible and accountable to its people," he said
