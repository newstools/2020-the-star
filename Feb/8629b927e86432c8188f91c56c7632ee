Trading at the Nairobi Securities Exchange remained unchanged two hours after opening on Wednesday as the focus shifted to Kabarak, where Kenya's second president Daniel Moi is to be buried. A real-time spot check on the Nairobi bourse via Nutcracker Africa at 11 am indicated no change on three indices, with the value of the Nairobi All Share Index (NASI) at 166.34, NSE25 at 4110.98 and NSE20 maintaining Monday's value of 2666.96. Similarly, there was no change on any of the 68 counters, with none of the tickers moving up or down. The shilling, currently ranked the fourth-strongest currency in the world by Reuters, however, weakened slightly against all major currencies, losing 10 basis points against the US dollar to trade at 100.60. It had also lost 20 basis points against the Euro to trade at 109.71 and 0.12 percentage points against the UK pound to trade at 130.32. The late president who ruled Kenya for 24 years died last week aged 95 years.
