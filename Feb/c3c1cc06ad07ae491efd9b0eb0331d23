SportPesa have confirmed their intention to exit as English Premier League side Everton’s shirt sponsors after the end of the current campaign. In a statement released yesterday, the sports betting firm confirmed they have opted to change some of its global sponsorships in line with its new business strategy. “To this end, SportPesa will no longer be on the front of the shirt of Everton as a principal partner after the 2019/2020 season. We would like to thank our partners for their support and the amazing projects that we did together such as Everton in Tanzania, which saw the first-ever EPL side play in East Africa. This was followed by a return visit by the Kenyan champions Gor Mahia to Goodison Park and yet again a return on African soil by Everton in Kenya in July 2019,” the statement by the Kenyan betting firm said. Everton were beaten on post-match penalties by Kariobangi Sharks last year at Kasarani. “We would like to thank the fans for their support and for their participation in amazing acts of charity work that saw #Kits4Africa deliver soccer kit to the needy and Everton for their great football and health-related programs with the local communities in East Africa,” added the statement. Everton didn’t wear shirts with the SportPesa logo in their last league match at home to Crystal Palace, fueling speculation about their future relationship. The Merseyside club also confirmed they would go separate ways with their sponsors SportPesa despite a lucrative five-year deal with SportPesa agreed in 2017. The deal was one of the most high-profile and increasingly controversial Premier League club sponsorships by gambling companies, prompting campaigners to warn of the social costs and “dire consequences” being caused by the increasing 'gamblification' of football.
