Relegated Kisumu and Western Bulls have vowed to bounce back to Kenya Cup. The two were sent back to KRU Championship after a season in the top-flight league following defeats over the weekend. Bulls and Kisumu were promoted to the top tier league during the 2019/2020 season. Bulls went down 56-6 against Homeboyz at the Bull Ring in Kakamega while Kisumu lost 38-5 to Kenyatta University’s Blak Blad. Bulls are 11th on the log with 13 points while Kisumu are bottom with six. Kisumu coach Brian Makalama said planning and organisation was their major hiccup in their disastrous Kenya Cup campaign. He, however, said: “It was a good experience for the team. We shall bounce back.” His Bulls counterpart, Solomon Obiero, said: “There are a few things we didn’t do right this season but I’m sure we have learnt from our mistakes. I’m looking forward to our last game and I’m hoping we will bounce back stronger.” He admitted the season was challenging. “We managed three wins in the first half of the season but couldn’t carry on in the second leg. It has been a good experience with a lot of lessons but sadly, we are back to the championship,” said. Western Bulls will conclude their Kenya Cup campaign on Saturday against Nakuru RFC while Kisumu will be away against Resolution Impala Saracens in Nairobi. Kisumu have a game in hand against Nondescripts. The game was postponed after Kisumu players were involved in a road accident at Kinungi on the Naivasha-Nairobi Highway three weeks ago.
