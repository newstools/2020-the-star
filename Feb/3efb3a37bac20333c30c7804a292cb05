The board of directors of the Kenya Copyright Board has outlined measures to protect artistes' interests. In its meeting of January 28, 2020, the board resolved to establish a system of fair, fraud-proof royalty collection and to ensure individuals who may have previously been involved in the mismanagement of funds are punished per the law. To protect artists whose livelihood depends on royalties, the board approved the issuance of provisional, six-month licences to three music societies: Kenya Association of Music Producers (Kamp), Performers Rights Society of Kenya (Prisk) and Music Copyright Society of Kenya (MCSK). "Any CMO official involved in the misuse of royalties will be prosecuted and steps taken to recover lost funds," Kecobo said in a statement.
