A woman has succumbed to injuries after the engine flywheel of a boat detached from its shaft and flew around cutting them randomly in Lamu town on Saturday. The accident happened at Tusitiri area along the Wiyoni beach in Lamu town. The deceased who sustained serious cuts to the rib and chest died at the King Fahad hospital in Lamu town where she had been rushed by good Samaritans after the accident. She had boarded the boat with five others. Two including the coxswain are also nursing serious cut wounds and have since been referred to Kilifi for further treatment. Doctors have predicted the coxswain's hand may have to be amputated. A flywheel is a heavy disk or wheel rotating on a shaft and builds up momentum as the boat engine accelerates, helping it to maintain smooth and steady engine speed. The accident was confirmed by Lamu county commissioner Irungu Macharia. He said the boat had six passengers and was heading to Lamu town from Momowe Jetty. He called for caution among boat operators and encouraged them to conduct frequent servicing of their vessels to prevent such accidents. “We lost one of the passengers unfortunately but the other two are still recuperating,” Macharia said. Lamu Boat Operators chairperson Hassan Awadh urged boat operators and owners to service the engines regularly and as required to avert such incidents. “This is not just any other business but one that directly deals with human life. Let’s service our vessels regularly so that we don’t have such accidents again. It’s irresponsible and selfish,” Awadh said. Much of Lamu’s transport is by water with the region having a boat population of over 5,000 vessels. Edited by R.Wamochie
