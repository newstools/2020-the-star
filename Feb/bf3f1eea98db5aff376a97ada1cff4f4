Kenyans will be able to view the body of retired president Daniel Moi for three days. A government source told the Star that Kenyans will view the body on Saturday, Sunday and Monday on a venue yet to be disclosed. On Tuesday, there will be a funeral service at Kasarani and he will be buried on Wednesday in Kabarak. Earlier, the family led by Raymond Moi said his death had become a Military affair and thus going on, any communication will be relayed by the government’s spokesman or senior state officer. "It has been almost three months since Mzee was hospitalised at the Nairobi hospital. We had dedicated healthcare team that was taking care of both local and international cadre but our creator had decided otherwise beyond our expectations,” he said. “We want to thank the military and state operatives for swiftly moving in and it is our prayer that God will give us strength at this moment”. Moi died peacefully on Tuesday at 5.20 am at the Nairobi Hospital where he had been receiving treatment. President Uhuru Kenyatta issued a presidential proclamation on Tuesday announcing the passing on of the retired President.
