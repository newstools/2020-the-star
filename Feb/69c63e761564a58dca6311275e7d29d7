Kiminini MP Chris Wamalwa has denied brandishing a pistol at an advisor ofÂ  Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa. On Monday morning, Ronald Masindano called the Kitale press complaining that the legislator threatened to shoot him at the Kitale airstrip before boarding for Nairobi. However, when contacted, the MP denied the claims. "I have been holding a firearm even before I became an MP but I have not misused it. I think Masindano is confused," Wamalwa told the Star on phone. Wamalwa also distanced himself from Masindano's statement that he is the MP's elder brother. On Saturday during a burial function at Sibanga in Cherangany, Masindano announced that Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa will be vying for the Trans Nzoia gubernatorial seat in 2022. The Kiminini MP has been campaigning for the seat for the last two years. "Masindano is not my brother, we are not related in any manner. He should desist from masquerading that he is my brother, everybody in Trans Nzoia knows who my brothers are," Wamalwa added. The MP alleged that Eugene did not send Masindano to represent him at the burial function on Saturday as he claimed. "How can a person who is interested in the position of a governor send a representative to declare his stand? He should have come himself to do so," Wamalwa said. He said Masindano has fuelled youth to attack him on social media. "He should know that votes are not received through social media. I am firm on the ground and optimistic that I will be the next governor of Trans Nzoia," Wamalwa said. On Saturday, the Sibanga burial function came to a standstill after a man alleged to be Cherangany MP Joshua Kuttuny's blogger shouted at Wamalwa. He was later detained at the Sibanga Police Post. "Remember that at every market, there must be a mad man, I think that boy was insane,"said Wamalwa. An OB doing rounds on social media whose authenticity is yet to be confirmed showed Masindano reported the matter at the Central Police Station in Nairobi.
