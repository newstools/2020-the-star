Nairobi Secondary Schools basketball champions Dagoretti High coach Peter Orero is eyeing the top prize this year. Orero said he is having the same calibre of players in the team that can go all the way to win the national as well as the regional title. “I lost three players from the last team including star Churchill Odhiambo but I believe the squad I have now is equal to the task. Their level of game maturity and experience will count towards the Nairobi and national title bid.” He said after placing second both at the national and regional championships, it’s time to go a step higher. Dagoretti lost to Laiser Hill in the national finals in Mombasa last year but still proceeded to the regional show in Arusha, Tanzania where they went down to Uganda’s Budo in the final. He cited Upper Hill, Langata High and Jamhuri High as their biggest threat in the fight for the city crown. “The three remain our biggest rivals in Nairobi. We are working hard and hopefully, we will reach the nationals once again,” he noted. Dagoretti lost to Laiser Hill Academy in the finals played in Mombasa last year. Their second position took them to the regional finals in Arusha, Tanzania. Orero, who is also school principal said, Laiser Hill, Agoro Sare and Sigalame remain their challengers at the national level.
