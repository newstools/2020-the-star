An AP officer who allegedly shot dead a boda boda rider at Mama Lucy Hospital on February 18 will remain in custody for five more working days. Detective constable Laban Kalama sought and was granted extension of custodial orders against Constable Zaddock Ochuka Oyieka. Makadara chief magistrate Heston Nyaga on Friday directed Oyieka to be presented before the court on Friday or earlier, if he will not have been charged with murder before the High Court. Kalama said only one key witness in Korongocho slums has not recorded a statement with police. The detective said he visited the hospital, took the suspect for treatment and later a mental assessment and attended the postmortem of boda boda rider Daniel Wangari on Friday. Kalama said he needs to take the file to the DPP for review and advisory; the office could recommend more areas to be investigated. The defence objected to continued detention and sai it should be for only three days, not five — if granted at all. “When you came here, you asked for 14 days. I suspected you would go and slumber but I now commend your work, you have made quite some progress,” Nyaga said Mburu, a boda boda rider who had rushed a drowning child to hospital, was allegedly shot dead by the officer during a confrontation between police and boda boda riders at the hospital parking lot. The issue apparently was whether he had the right to park. (Edited by V. Graham)
