An Italian investor has been charged with tax evasion amounting to Sh79.3 million. Tony Rosafio was charged with five counts on Friday before Mombasa chief magistrate Edna Nyaloti. He was charged alongside his construction company Smoky Hill Ltd in which he is a director. They were charged with making an incorrect statement to defraud the government of revenue. Rosafio, alongside his company, is accused of making incorrect statements to the taxman in the VAT returns for years between 2015 and last year. This act allegedly reduced the VAT payable for the period by Sh20.2 million. They allegedly committed the crimes between July 2015 and December last year in Kilifi county. The accused pleaded not guilty and was released on Sh4 million bond with a Kenyan surety since he is a foreigner. He was also given an alternative bail of Sh1 million. The magistrate set the matter to be mentioned on February 18 for a pretrial. According to KRA Commissioner for Investigation and enforcement David Yego, Smoky Hill Ltd deliberately failed to declare income earned and unjustifiably used fictitious invoices to defraud the government of tax. Further, the company allegedly neither filed Income Tax Company Returns between 2015-18 nor paid any corporation tax on the same. Additionally, the company claimed fictitious invoices with the intention of reducing tax liability with the fictitious claims, the court heard. The court further heard that KRA made several unsuccessful attempts to engage the company through its directors. This was after in-depth investigations carried out by KRAâ€™s Investigation and Enforcement Department. Edited by R.Wamochie
