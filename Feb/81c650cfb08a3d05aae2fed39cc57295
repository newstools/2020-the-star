Cotu wants the Salaries and Remuneration Commission to be disbanded for failing to ensure transparency and fairness in public entities. Speaking on Saturday during the BBI meeting in Meru, Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli said the commission had failed to harmonise the remuneration and benefits of state officers, which is its core mandate. Atwoli also termed the commission "a stumbling block" to fair labour practices, such as independent negotiations between employees and trade unions. "Despite being an independent constitutional body, the commission has become a government lapdog hence interfering with its constitutional mandate,‚Äù Atwoli said. The University and Academic Staff Union has also backed the dissolution of the commission. Uasu said employers and employees want to hold independent salary negotiations without involving a third party. "Uasu considers that SRC has strayed from its original mandate of setting the salaries and benefits of state officers and should altogether be disbanded and converted to a statutory body, not a constitutional one," secretary general Constantine Wasonga told the Star on Saturday. Knut has also backed the proposal.
