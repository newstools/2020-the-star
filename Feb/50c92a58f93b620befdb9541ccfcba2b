Nairobi MCAs on Thursday tabled a notice of motion to impeach Governor Mike Sonko. A total of 62 MCAs appended their signature to the motion. These are the grounds of impeachment: On Wednesday, speculation was rife at the County Assembly of Nairobi over the possibility a notice of motion to impeach Sonko. This is even as a section of Jubilee MCAs had a meeting with Sonko at his Upper Hill office when they were supposed to be in attending plenary. The majority of Jubilee MCAs were absent from the chambers with only around 10 MCAs spotted. Sonko's troubles started with a dramatic arrest on December 6. He was locked out from office over the loss of Sh357 million.
