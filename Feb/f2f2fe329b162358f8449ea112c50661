The Mombasa assembly on Tuesday nominated a new chief whip. Chaani MCA Junior Wambua replaces Freretown MCA Charles Kitula, who is viewed as ‘an enemy of the county’. This is because he has been questioning decisions made by the county’s executive. Speaking during the session, speaker Aharub Khatri said the changes were made after Kitula walked out of the house during a special sitting in January this year. Wambua accepted the new role and promised to serve with dedication. Kitula congratulated his successor, urging him to serve the people with truth and fairness. "The reason I stepped out was because of CECs who don't want to be told the truth. I swore to work with truth and fairness and not to be told what to say or not,"  Kitula said. Deputy chief whip Magogoni MCA Ali Shomari said he was disappointed to have been bypassed as he expected to take over from Kitula. He, however, urged Kitula to serve with dedication and verve. Jomvu Kuu MCA Athumani Shebe told Wambua, "This is a big shoe that you are expected to wear. I will follow you closely because you have a lot to achieve." Likoni MCA Athman Mwamiri said the position should have been given to a female member. "The motion was not brought to the house, which is unfair," Mwamiri said. Shanzu MCA Maimuna Salim supported Athman, saying women have been left out in the leadership of the house. "I’m not happy with this nomination because we have 12 female leaders in the house, but they have been denied the right of leadership,” Salim said. Ganjoni MCA Priscilla Mumba urged the speaker to ensure women are given a separate office for their privacy where they can discuss their issues.
