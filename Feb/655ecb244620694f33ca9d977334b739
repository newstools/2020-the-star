Governors from the North Rift have agreed to partner with churches and revive development projects to safeguard peace in the bandit-prone Kerio Valley. The county chiefs say taking new projects to the people and re-establishing old ones will dissuade local communities from falling back into banditry. Turkana Governor Josphat Nanok said the church and leaders have made great strides, but there were still volatile areas in some of the counties. Nanok said they will work to strengthen cohesion between communities in the North Rift. “Like the BBI nationally, we also want to build bridges between the Pokots, Marakwets, Turkanas and other communities so that they live in harmony and forget about banditry,” Nanok said. Nanok spoke in Eldoret where he was with governors Jackson Mandago of Uasin Gishu and Stephen Sang of Nandi. They met with the new bishop of the Eldoret Catholic diocese Dominic Kimengich and agreed to enhance peace and security in Kerio Valley. The county bosses said that peace and security had largely returned to the Kerio Valley region but Suguta and Baringo areas were still volatile. “We want to work with the government security agencies and communities to help kick out the criminals still using Suguta and Baringo valleys as their hideouts,” Nanok said. Mandago who doubles as chairman of the North Rift Economic Bloc (NOREB) said more than 200 projects had stalled in the region but would be revived. NOREB has earmarked joint projects worth more than Sh200 billion in Uasin Gishu, Nandi, Trans Nzoia, Baringo, West Pokot, Turkana, Samburu and Elgeyo Marakwet. Within the last year, only two banditry incidents have been reported in Kerio Valley area, but there were several attacks in Baringo and Samburu. Nanok said they were grateful to police officers who had put their lives on the line to battle with bandits.
