Nairobi county assembly minority whip Peter Imwatok said Thursday that he has received death threats. Imwatok said that there was a plan to have him killed this weekend and he is being followed and his car is tracked. The minority whip, who doubles as Makongeni MCA, said that unknown armed people had accosted and told him to keep off his fight against the county administration. “The men brandished guns saying wewe tumezoeana sana na utakula copper ukiendelea kupiga governor (You have become too much and we will shoot you if you continue criticising the governor),” he said. He told officers at the Central Police Station that the threats are because of his strong oversight role and checks on the county government. He recorded the statement with the police under OB number 83/06/02/2020. “I want to state that there are people after my life and a leader high up in the county leadership structure is on record saying that he was stopping guys who have just left prison from killing me,” Imwatok said. Governor Mike Sonko’s communications boss Elkana Jacob said Imwatok's were mere allegations. The minority whip said his problems started when he announced that he had collected more than 88 signatures for an impeachment motion on Sonko. “If I am being targeted because of my stand on impeaching the governor, then I am sorry to the perpetrators because I am doing my constitutional duty of ensuring Nairobi has the right leader,” he said.
