Good morning, The late President Daniel Arap Moi shaped the careers of Kenya's star politicians including President Uhuru Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto. During his 24-year stranglehold on power, Moi identified promising greenhorns, training them to be successful politicians striding the shifting terrain. Here are the stories making headlines in the Star today. Was it a ghostly figure with a teacher's body and a cow-like head that sent children into a panic and caused a stampede? Was it deadly devil worship linked with a businessman or church-cults? The government will this year carry out an audit to establish capacity and ability of secondary schools to accommodate junior secondary under the new education system. In a bid to avert any crisis, the government is planning a mapping out of the current situation in schools, information that will guide the infrastructure development for the institutions in preparation for 2022. Off a main road that leads to Ngong Road lies Kabarnet Gardens, the late President Daniel Moi’s residence in Nairobi. The home is miles away from the road, and but for the military guards paraded outside, it would be impossible to know that there exists a statesman’s home.  Events following the death of retired President Daniel Moi have exposed Deputy President William Ruto as an outsider in his own government. With President Uhuru Kenyatta in the US — alongside ODM leader Raila Odinga — his second command was expected to be the man in charge. But this was not to be.  With the many layoffs seen in 2019, the government has been encouraging the unemployed, especially the youth, to join the agricultural industry due to diverse job opportunities. But agricultural expert Caleb Karuga warns that agribusiness is not a walk in the park. It takes a lot of determination and patience to succeed, he says.
