The Building Bridges Initiative will end education challenges facing pastoral communities and offer quality learning to students, Knut boss Wilson Sossion has said. Speaking during the BBI rally at Narok Stadium on Saturday, Sossion said the Building Bridges Initiative process should be concluded as soon as possible so a referendum is held. "As teachers and workers of this country, we support the handshake between President Uhuru Kenyatta and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga and the BBI process in full,” Sossion said. The nominated MP said BBI will provide equal education opportunities to all children from pastoral communities. “BBI will promote education in pastoral communities such as Garissa, Wajir and Mandera for children from the regions to access education just like those from other regions,” Sossion said. The Kenya National Union of Teachers secretary-general said President Uhuru Kenyatta should intervene so that all children access education wherever they are across the country. Learning has been disrupted in Northeastern after the Teachers Service Commission withdrew teachers from the region due to insecurity. Terror attacks orchestrated by al Shabaab militants have targeted teachers in recent weeks with scores killed in attacks in Garissa. “Schools in Garissa, Wajir and Mandera counties have never had teachers for the last six years,” Sossion said. Sossion said that the BBI will end conflicts of interest in various commissions. “There were a lot of conflicts in the last general election.  We should complete the BBI process and go for a referendum,” Sossion said. edited by peter obuya
