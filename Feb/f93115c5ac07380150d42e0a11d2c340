More than 40 training institutions will gather in Nyeri on Friday and Saturday for the Mt Kenya Regional Drama and Film Festival. The festival will take place at Dedan Kimathi University of Technology in Nyeri town. It will bring together national polytechnics, vocational training centres, private colleges and technical training institutions. Kenya Association of Technical Training Institutions regional chairman Patrick Muchemi on Friday morning said a team will be picked to compete with five other regions at the national level on April 14-24 in Mombasa. "The institutions are to participate in various genres which are to be judged and the best items chosen to represent Mt Kenya region in the 2020 National Drama and Film Festival at Mombasa," he said. The other regions are Nairobi, Rift Valley, Western, Coast and national polytechnics, which are considered an independent region. This is the first time KATTI has organised the activity in Mt Kenya region. Education CAS Zack Kinuthia is expected to be the chief guest during the official opening. The Jubilee government's Big Four agenda—affordable housing, food security, manufacturing and universal health coverage—is among this year's themes. "The nine categories [in which teams] will be competing include cultural creative dances, choral verses, dramatised coral verses, narratives, modern creative dances,  drama and stand-up comedy, among others," Muchemi said. He is also the principal of Mukurweini TTI. The winning teams at the national competition will perform to the President at State House, Mombasa. Edited by Josephine M. Mayuya
