Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen has said that he will support the Building Bridges Initiative only it will capture Kenyans aspirations. The Senate Majority Leader stated on Saturday that the ongoing debate on the BBI should not be diverted to benefit politicians. He said a referendum being proposed to amend the BBI report should not be used to limit the sovereign power of the people of Kenya. The senator added that he will be leading a team opposing the referendum if politicians will use it as a means of creating tribal positions and undermining the devolution. "If the final BBI report doesnâ€™t capture the aspirations of the people of Kenya and a referendum to amend the constitution is organized with a draft that limits the sovereign power of the people or create tribal positions or undermine devolution, I will oppose and Will lead the NO Team," Murkomen said. His remarks come barely a month since he surprised many in Mombasa BBI rally by announcing that he will push for a referendum. Addressing Mombasa residents at the Mama Ngina Waterfront Park on January 25, Murkomen said that politicians were in support of BBI and that political rivalry over issues should end. "It's the first time in history for politicians to sit on one dias and have a common stand," Murkomen said. He added, "It is no longer about us versus them, we are united. We've all agreed that a referendum is a must." Murkomen's words come as BBI rallies are set to resume after being halted in respect for the late former President Daniel Arap Moi. Meru will be hosting the BBI rally on February 29.
