Ukambani gospel singer Caxton Mutambuki, 37, has been pricked by the pain caused to farmers and the threat to food security following the desert locust invasion. Mutambuki, who made his debut in gospel music in 2005, has released a song seeking repentance among Kenyans. In 'Malocust', the Kitui-based artiste wonders what sins people have committed to merit the curse of the invasion of locusts that are devouring tons upon tons crops in farms. The singer is seen in the video busy scaring off locusts from his farm in Waita ward, Mwingi Central subcounty. “Have mercy on us; have mercy on us. We have repented our sins our sins oh hallowed Jesus,” sings Mutambuki in his Kamba song, which is already trending on YouTube. He humbly implores Jesus to cast the desert locusts out of Kenya.
