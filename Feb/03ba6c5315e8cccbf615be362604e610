Rongai MP Raymond Moi on Wednesday gave the family leadership rungu to Baringo Senator Gideon Moi. The rungu, which resembles the one the late and former President Daniel Moi used to carry during his rule, came from Kalenjin elders. It was handed to Gideon during Mzee Moi's funeral service at Kabarak. The move is touted as one that will continue the family’s leadership following the death of Mzee Moi, who ruled Kenya for 24 years. But what exactly does it mean? Moi ascended to power in 1978 following the death of Kenya’s founding father Mzee Jomo Kenyatta. The rungu, almost remained glued to Moi's right hand for the 24 years he was in power. Moi never spoke publicly of the significance of the rungu, but the origin is of young men of the Tugen community in Baringo, who were implored by their elders to carry an assortment of small weapons to protect themselves against wild animals. Gideon is the leader of Kanu, the oldest party in the land that ruled for nearly 40 years after Kenya’s independence from British colonial rule in 1963 until its electoral loss in 2002. Moi’s famous rungu represented power and leadership. Passing on of the symbol of power means that Gideon has blessings to run for presidency in the 2022 election. Gideon’s presidential ambitions were supported by ODM leader Raila Odinga, who dismissed dynasty claims. “No one should tell us Moi is a dynasty yet he came from a poor background. He inherited nothing. He came from poverty. You can’t say he is a dynasty. Gideon Moi has a right to vie for any seat. He is not a dynasty, ” Raila said. Raila said he had a long history with Mzee Moi characterised by both hate and love, but they chose to forgive one another. Moi, who passed away last week on Tuesday, will be laid to rest at his Kabarak home.
