Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya has faulted the Kenya National Highways Authority for conducting road marking reserves without involving the public. His concerns came barely a week after Msambweni residents protested against road beacon extensions along the Ukunda-Lunga Lunga road. Mvurya said matters of land are sensitive and the public must know why Kenha extended some measurements. “There is a problem because the engineers had stretched the road reserve to 80 metres from 60 metres without the residents’ knowledge,” he said. He spoke on Wednesday at Kombani during the launch of two municipal road constructions in Matuga. The governor said land disputes at the Coast needed to be properly approached. He called on Kenha to hold barazas to enlighten residents on their agenda. He said compensation terms must be tabled for those whose land had been encroached on. Mvurya urged the affected residents to present their grievances to ward administrators for the county to closely monitor and protect their rights. He, however, said he has communicated with the authority's regional managing engineer Jared Makori and interventions are underway. Msambweni MP Suleiman Dori said residents welcomed development but every citizen’s rights must be upheld. He said Makori told him Kenha was extending by 10 metres each side of the road reserves. Initially, 30 metres from both sides of the highway were to be spared for roads expansion, Dori said, adding that residents should be compensated if more land is to be taken. Last week, Kenha Mombasa office denied some of the allegations on road expansion. Edited by R.Wamochie
