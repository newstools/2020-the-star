Wiper party leader Kalonzo Musyoka has said former President Daniel Moi played a critical role in the country in 1982 when he stopped the attempted military coup. Kalonzo said the country could have gone through what the majority of West African countries have gone through. "This country has never seen a military government. The whole of the West African region has encountered problems because of military coups," Kalonzo said. He added that "we were spared from that problem here because Mzee Moi held strong". Kalonzo spoke on Monday outside the Parliament Buildings after viewing the body of the former president Moi which is lying at Parliament for the third day. He was accompanied by his son, East African Legislative Assembly MP Kennedy Musyoka. Kalonzo said Mzee Moi was a firm leader during his leadership and created an inclusive government. "He stood for one united country," he said. Members of the public have until Monday 5 pm to view Mzee Moi's body on the last day his body lies-in-state. Kalonzo, who is also the Special Envoy in monitoring peace in South Sudan said they agreed that a new government will be in place for South Sudan in the next 12 days. The state will have a funeral service for Mzee Moi on Tuesday at the Nyayo Stadium. The government has announced that all preparations have been completed at the stadium, where at least 10 heads of states will attend. Mzee Moi will be interred on Wednesday 12 at his home in Kabarak, Nakuru County.
