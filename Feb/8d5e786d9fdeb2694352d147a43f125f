 Over 200 learners from the Boni community are back to school following the intervention of Lamu county commissioner Irungu Macharia. The upper primary learners were early this week airlifted to Mokowe Arid Zone Primary School in Lamu West, hundreds of kilometres from their homes, in police and military helicopters. The school has boarding facilities. The Standards 5-8 pupils spent the first part of this term at home due to terrorism threats. Their homes are within the Linda Boni security operation. Basuba, Milimani, Mangai, Mararani and Kiangwe primary schools, all in Boni Forest, were shut in 2014 when non-local teachers fled after they were threatened with death by al Shabaab militants. They were re-opened this month for Classes 1 to 4. Some of the schools were torched and vandalised. The upper primary pupils were offered places away from the danger zone. However, their parents could not afford the fare and boarding fees. Mokowe Arid Zone School was established in 1992 to accommodate pupils from disadvantaged communities like the Boni, Sanye and Orma. Macharia urged the Boni community to embrace education. He warned that parents who did not take children to school will be arrested and prosecuted. “Education is a fundamental right and not a favour. That’s why we have ensured that these Boni kids get to and stay in school. We are determined to have 100 per cent transition succeed,” Macharia said. Lamu's transition from primary to secondary schools stands at 93 per cent. County director of Education Joshua Kaaga said they were confident the county will achieve the 100 per cent transition.
