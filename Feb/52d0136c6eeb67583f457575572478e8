More than 300,000 Vihiga residents will be connected to piped water by end of next year, acting Water chief officer Dominick Luvavo has said. Luvavo said the Sh1.7 billion project funded by the Belgian government will ensure the residents have clean water across the county. “Once the project is finished, water shortages will be a forgotten story. The work is almost in its final stages in most of the stations,” Luvavo said. Luvavo briefed the press in his office on Thursday about the progress of the project. He said Maseno water supply in Luanda is at 95 per cent, Kaimosi water supply in Hamisi subcounty is at 98 per cent and Lunyerere in Vihiga is at 85 per cent. “Once completed, we will supply clean water in Luanda town, parts of Maseno and its environs, Hamisi and Vihiga,” he said. The chief officer said the Maseno water supply will serve Emuhaya; Lunyerere serve Sabatia and Vihiga, as Kaimosi serves Hamisi and Sabatia. All the cluster projects are in the final stages of implementation. Among the works undertaken on the project include the rehabilitation and upgrading of the existing tanks and fixing of new ones. Solar panels will be fixed to generate power for the pumping of water. Among the areas where tanks have been put up are Kima Mission Hospital, Emunua Primary, Ebusakami Primary, Shamakhokho and Munoinywa. “The only challenge we are going to face is piping this water to locals and the institutions because that was not part of the deal with the Belgian government,” he said.
