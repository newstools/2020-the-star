The Kisumu Speaker Elisha Oraro has declared the North Kisumu Ward seat officially vacant. Aspirants for the seat are already campaigning by taking advantage of any opportunity in church, fundraisers and any public gathering to campaign. With the official declaration of the seat as vacant, the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission can now plan to conduct by-election in the ward. The seat went vacant following the resignation of Oraro, who was unanimously elected as the Kisumu County Assembly speaker by all the MCAs on January 24. Last week, when the MCAs resumed from a long recess, the speaker tabled a notice of resignation as the North Kisumu Ward Representative, which he said his office received on January 19. Oraro said the resignation was in accordance with the Article 194 (1) (d) of the Constitution. He noted he will communicate to IEBC to allow them conduct a by-election. The hopefuls for the seat include Ken Ogada of Ford Kenya, businessman John Ouko, Ramadhan Bilali, former MCA Caroline Owen and former councillor Bernard Muga Obewa. But even as the by-elections beckon, the Court of Appeal is still yet to hear an appeal by Ousted Speaker Onyango Oloo filed challenging his impeachment. He wants to retain his seat and has asked the judges to quash the decision by the High Court to uphold his impeachment.
