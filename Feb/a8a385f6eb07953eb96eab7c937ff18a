Mr Seed has released a new track, 'Kwa Hao' featuring comedian Kartelo, Breeder LW, Masterpiece, Vuva and Madoxx. The song is in Kapuka style. He says is Kapuka more of a Kenyan style. This comes two weeks after Bahati also released a song, 'Taniua', with Gengetone artiste Bondoocks Gang. Fans are now asking who copied the other. Speaking to Word Is yesterday, Mr Seed said he did the song long time ago. "Maybe Bahati heard that I was working on the song and went ahead and did his and released before I did," he said. He added, "I don't copy people in the industry. I am a strict gospel artiste and in the song." Asked why he chose to work with artistes who are not in the gospel industry, Seed said he believes everyone has a message for people. "I have worked with different artistes and I don't like judging people by the kind of music they are doing. They all could be having a message," he said.
