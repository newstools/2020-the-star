Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) will achieve what the 2010 Constitution failed to, the Amani National Congress Political Party (ANC) leader Musalia Mudavadi has said. Mudavadi urged Kenyans to participate in the BBI process by giving out their ideas to be discussed and captured by the initiative’s steering committee as good proposals. “I gave my proposals and those of the ANC party through a memorandum to the BBI steering committee a few days ago,” Mudavadi said. He spoke during the BBI Forum in Narok County on Saturday. Mudavadi said he supports the Maa community and Kenyans at large in their commitment to ensuring environmental conservation. He said that a special national fund should be allocated by the national government for facilitating and supporting environmental conservation across the country. “I am supporting the Maa community and Kenyans at large in their commitment to environmental conversation. There should be a national fund to facilitate and protect those supporting environmental conversation,” Mudavadi said. Mudavadi said that land issues must be solved once and for all, the BBI should provide the solution to land disputes. He said that it was high time both the Truth Justice and Reconciliation (TJRC) and Ndung’u reports were implemented. On governance, the ANC boss said they did not have a problem in a broader structure. “What we didn’t achieve with the 2010 Constitution, we must achieve with the BBI,” he added. Mudavadi said there were people who did not know the difference between the president, his deputy and a core president adding that was the reason why ODM leader Raila Odinga had a problem when he served as a Prime Minister in the grand coalition during retired President Mwai Kibaki’s regime. “There is a difference between a president, his deputy and core president. We must come with clarity on who is the boss,” Mudavadi said. He said corruption and theft of public resources must be fought in both county and national governments.
