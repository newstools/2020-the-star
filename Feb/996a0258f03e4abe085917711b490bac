Kenya Lionesses will grace the HSBC Sevens Challenger Series event scheduled for next month in Stellenbosch, South Africa. Felix Oloo's charges are among 12 teams invited for the two-day tournament. The teams including—Argentina, Belgium, China, Colombia, Japan, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Papua New Guinea, Poland, Scotland and host South Africa—will be competing for the sole berth. The  12 teams will be drawn into three pools of four teams that will compete towards a grand final, where the winner will gain core team status on the HSBC World Rugby Sevens Series 2021. They will replace the bottom-placed core team at the end of this season and provide a clear and consistent pathway for teams to progress and play against the world’s best. Lionesses will also play in the Langford Sevens in Canada in May. Oloo said the two tournaments will be good preparation for the Tokyo Olympics in July as well as give the team a chance to qualify for the World Sevens Series next season. “It's encouraging we are getting opportunities to test ourselves against some of the top teams in the world and we will relish the challenge to play against them,” added Lionesses bowed out in the semi-final last year in the qualifiers to Brazil and Oloo has said lessons learnt from last year's event will aid in their push this season. "We have a strong side which is growing in confidence and we have corrected the mistakes from last year and we hope to go all the way,” added Oloo The team has been training for the past two months and Oloo said they have worked on several aspects of play in their training. "We are working on our continuity in attack transition to defence and looking at our setpiece." Oloo said competition for places is intense. “It's healthy that we have a good squad to choose from and the players are working hard to get selected for the upcoming tournaments."
