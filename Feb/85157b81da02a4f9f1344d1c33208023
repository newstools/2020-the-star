The Msambweni Referral Hospital has resumed operations after replacing crucial facilities destroyed in a fire incident last month. Health chief officer Juma Mbete said x-ray services are back after the machines were revived and advanced power generator worth Sh12 million installed. Speaking on Thursday evening in Kwale, the official said various activities were disrupted due to technical hitches. In January, a back-up power generator blew up, destroying equipment and forcing several patients to be transferred to nearby subcounty hospitals. “Most services were affected, especially the x-ray sector. The governor has managed to restore undertakings in all other departments,” Mbete said. He said the generator will supply electricity to the Intensive Care Unit, ultrasound and radiology departments exclusively. Mbete said Sh5.9 million has already been disbursed for mortuary renovation. He said within three weeks, the facility will be able to deliver services to residents. "The contractor has commenced work and very soon the mortuary will be ready to serve better than before,” Mbete said. At the same time, Mbete urged the community to make use of other health centres to reduce congestion in the referral hospitals. The chief officer said Msambweni receives about 200 patients per day. "Only some illnesses require referral hospitals like Msambweni but you can't be travelling all the way from Kinango to this place simply because of flu,” he said.
