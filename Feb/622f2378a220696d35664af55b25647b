Kenya Hockey Union (KHU) women's Premier League champions Blazers will have to pay 1000 euros fine imposed on them for the late withdrawal from the African Cup of Club Championship. The 10-time African champions withdrew three days prior to the start of the tournament in Ismailia, Egypt in December last year and have until February 29 to pay the money. Failure to meet the deadline may result in further sanctions from the African Hockey Federation. No Kenyan team attended the annual tournament with Butali, Kenya Police and USIU-A Spartans having made their decision to pull out earlier. Blazers' boss Jos Openda was, however, confident that despite their financial situation, they will solve the issue before the deadline. "We expected it. We will pay the fine and will be back on our feet again. The amount was higher and it was discussed with Kenya Team in South Africa. Jacqueline Mwangi , who is the chair of the Athletes' Committee in the continental governing body, renegotiated the amount and this was a huge relief for us," hinted the title-winning coach. The long-serving tactician said his charges should be prepared for a tiring season after winning the Parklands tournament over the weekend. Openda also affirmed that Mwangi will continue playing regardless of her new-found status as she serves the board for two years. The Iconic striker has conquered the league with goals and trophies and is tipped to drive the sport to another level. "We are preparing ourselves for a gruelling season. Jacqueline will continue to play because she's passionate about the game. She was voted to serve in the African body and we expect her to talk about hockey on another level. Blazers are without a sponsor after their 30-year-oldÂ  financiers, Telkom cut short their deal in June last year.
