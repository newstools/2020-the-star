Relatives yet to recover from shock and grief were not willing to talk to the media. “Mr Kennedy Ambani aged 40, his wife and two kids were attacked by armed robbers overnight.It’s believed the robbers had plans to steal chickens from the family,” Oyugi said. The killers are still on the run, with the security team in the county pursuing them. According to area MCA Victor Ijaika, Ambani was a businessman at Magada shopping centre. “I am just appealing to the security team to pull up their socks to curb this menace," he said. Ijaika said Interior CS Fred Matiang’i promised Vihiga people security. The county commissioner said the masterminds of the killings were members of the community. “I am appealing to Vihiga people, please, cooperate with my security team so that we are able to track these culprits and bring them to face the law,” county police commander Hassan Barua said. Barua accompanied Vihiga commissioner to the scene where the incident occurred. A week ago, a man and his wife were killed by unknown people in Itenji village. The assailants are still at large. Security agencies said they will propose setting up of a police post in the area to help curb increasing insecurity. Members of the community have vowed to take the law into their hands if police do not act.
