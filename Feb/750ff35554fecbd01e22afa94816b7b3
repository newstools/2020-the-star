Students and staff from St Andrew's Turi converged at the Pawa 254 on State House, Nairobi, last weekend for the launch of the book, 'Whispers from the River'. The book, an anthology by Turi's students, explores different cultures and traditions through short stories. The stories highlight the power of the written word through whispering subtle tales. Among the authors of the book present at the launch were Amy Migunda, Shawn Mwenje and Ariana Manduku. The school's head of English faculty Elizabeth Nyariki, Esther Wamugunda and Baraza Media Lab curator Christine Mungai were the book's editors. Renowned linguist, author and novelist Ken Walibora was the chief guest.
