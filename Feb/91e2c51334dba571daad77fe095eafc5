 A fisherman is feared to have drowned after a hippo rammed his boat on Masinga Dam on Sunday night. The boat capsized on impact near the Spillway and Michael Mutinda, 46,  and his friend Jacob Kamwaria, 32, had to swim to safety. Kamwaria swam to safety. Mutinda has not been seen since the tragedy.  Spillway police station officers and local divers had by Monday not found his body. Katulye assistant chief Martin Shikuku said one of the fishermen managed to reach the edge of the dam in Katulye sub-location. Mutinda did not make it. Masinga deputy county commissioner John Ayienda told the Star that divers and the police are looking for the missing man, 13 hours since the incident happened. "If the man drowned, then we expect the body to resurface after two to four days. Even tomorrow there will be people on the look-out for the body along the sides of the dam," Ayienda said.
