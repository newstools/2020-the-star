Hundreds of families from Khajula location in Budalangi constituency displaced by floods have appealed to the county and national governments for assistance. The families wereÂ  forced out of their homes by water from Lake Victoria. Speaking to the Star at Mainau trading centre on Sunday, Rugunga sub-location disaster management committee chairman Godfrey Wanjala said the families were displaced two weeks ago. He said they had not received any assistance from the Busia county government or any non-governmental organisation. Most of the flood victims had gone to stay with their friends and relatives, with some opting to live in residential houses in Port Victoria town. Wanjala said some of the flood victims from outside Bunyala South ward like those from Alego-Usonga subcounty in Siaya had opted to go back to their homes. A Kenya Red Cross team visited the area to asses the situation, raising hope that the flood victims might receive assistance.
