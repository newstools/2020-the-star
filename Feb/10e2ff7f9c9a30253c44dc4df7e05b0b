Retired President Mwai Kibaki on Sunday entered Parliament buildings secretly to view the body of predecessor Daniel Moi. The retired President made his way through Parliament main gate avoiding the gate facing KICC which dignitaries have been using since Saturday morning. Kibaki arrived around 11.10 am. Minutes before his arrival, security ordered everyone from the area to leave. Only top military officers and his handlers were left to usher him in. Not even media including Moi owned Standard media group were allowed to take photos of the former President. Members of the public who had lined up to pay last respect were also stopped briefly for Kibaki to pay his last respects. He left Parliament building at exactly 11.45 am. It is not clear why the arrival of the retired President was treated with such level of secrecy. The public viewing of the body, which began on Saturday, will end on Monday. On Tuesday, an interdenominational service will be held at the Nyayo National Stadium in Nairobi. Moi will be interred on Wednesday in Kabarak. The casket was wheeled by a carriage as happened with founding President Mzee Jomo Kenyatta in 1978.
