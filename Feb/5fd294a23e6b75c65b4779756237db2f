Kabras Sugar coach Henley Du Plessis has lauded the role played  by fly-half Ntabeni Dukisa in their 48-19 victory over Menengai Oilers to book a place Enterprise  Cup quarters. Dukisa was instrumental for the sugar millers after grabbing two tries and five conversions to bundle out Oilers at the Bull's Ring in Kakamega on Saturday. “We had very good preparations and we gave our fringe players an opportunity thus they did not disappoint. They gave a good account of themselves and ensured a ticket to the quarters," said Du Plessis. “It was good for the other regular players who got the chance to rest and freshen up ahead of our Kenya Cup match next weekend," he added. "I’m happy for the win and the fact that we managed to score some good tries. "We are still on course for the new goals we have set for the season. "Our players played as per the instructions and credit to them for the good work. "I want to, especially, appreciate Dukisa, who has really settled well in the team. He has hit  great form at the right time when both Enterprise and Kenya Cup are at a crucial stage with things getting tough and tight." “We are focused on our next matches and I urge my charges to maintain the fighting spirit as we take each match at a time," said Du Plessis. The coach revealed that the team has young players with the potential to shine at international level as long as they keep their focus.
