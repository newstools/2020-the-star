Narok county Senator Ledama Olekina has accused Deputy President William Ruto of being behind his arrest early Tuesday. Addressing the media shortly after he was released outside the Kilimani Police Station, Olekina said Ruto has no authority whatsoever to order for his arrest. "This today was kicks of dying horse. This is a witchunt. The DP is behind it. Enough is enough!" he said. "..he needs to fix his back yard. The DP has a lot to prove on national cohesion. Ruto why the hell are you so angry? Whether it is the Mau issue, you are angry, whether it is Arror and Kimwarer dam, you are angry, BBI you are angry." But these claims were dismissed by Ruto's aide David Mugonyi. "That is stupidity. Since when did Ruto become an officer?" Mugonyi told the Star on phone on Tuesday. Olekina said he will not be intimidated adding that he will not shy away from discussing the BBI. "Political dominance by one ethnic group will not be tolerated. Do not force yourself in political leadership. Kalenjin leaders should promote harmony free of incitement," he said. "Whether it is 2022 issue, you are angry.. . learn to live with other communities. It is your tolerance that is in question." Olekina said the DP is capable of negative discourse adding that he is stepping on others opinion. "His pursuit of personal interests has become a danger to us. He has created a following of ethic minded individuals," he said. Olekina was arrested in Nairobi on Tuesday morning over incitement allegations. The senator was arrested over his utterances made on February 19, during the JKL Interview on Citizen TV.
