Kenya Commercial Bank KCB is the team to watch today as the first leg of the Kenya Volleyball Federation women's league serves off at the Ruringu Stadium in Nyeri. The bankers have reinvigorated their squad with top-crop signings. Among them is Malkia Strikers captain Mercy Moim from Kenya Prisons and former Pipeline left attacker Sharon Chepchumba, who was voted the best attacker at the African Club Championship in Cairo last year. Middle blocker Edith Wisa, as well as the duo of setters Immaculate Nekesa and Sharon Sandui, will inject steel as the moneybags are one of the favourite teams for the title this season. Ugandan import Sharon Umito completes an almost new-look team. KCB, who will be looking to dethrone Kenya Prisons, have an upper hand against Bungoma County in their first match before raffling feathers with Pipeline in what is touted as the 'match of the day'. National team coach Paul Bitok, who is KCB's technical advisor alongside coach Japhet Munala, will hope for a perfect start. Pipeline will miss the services of middle blocker Triza Atuka through injury but the presence of new coach, Paul Gitau, on the touchline will be an extra motivation to the girls. Prisons face unfancied Ashton and the Directorate of Criminal Investigation (DCI). DCI finished fourth last season and has injected the squad with young players and are also set to face Kenya Defence Forces and Bungoma County. KVF received a big boost on Wednesday following a Sh300,000 sponsorship deal from Deep Heat.
