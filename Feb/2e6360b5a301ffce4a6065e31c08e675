Former North Imenti MP has urged Deputy President William Ruto to resign over the fake Sh39 billion military deal. The DP is under fire over claims his office space was used in the alleged scam. “I heard the DP said the staff should be reshuffled I think they should be sacked and arraigned. If I was the DP,  I would resign as he has even admitted that the fraud took place at his office without his knowledge,” Silas Muriuki said at his residence. He said it is unfortunate for such high office that is heavily secured could be used in a con game. He said if the arms deal was real, it would have been a big threat to the country. “Supposing it was real, what were the arms coming to do? Or if they were shipped to another country, what would have happened there?  Those are things that are things that are unimaginable,” he said. Muriuki said the country has had many corruption cases but not to the extreme involving illegal arms. Former Sports CS Rashid Echesa was charged with conspiracy to commit a felony by conspiring to make a document with intent to defraud. A section of political leaders began agitating for Ruto to step aside, claiming that his office had become a citadel of graft, in what is likely to trigger more political fireworks. Police also are investigating claims that agents of the military equipment supplier Eco Advanced Technologies had previously been hosted by Echesa at the DP's office. Ruto has written to IG Hillary Mutyambai to speed up investigations into the case.
