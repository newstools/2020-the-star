Siaya Senator James Orengo has asked Mt Kenya leaders and residents to allow him to take another wife from the region. Speaking in Meru on Saturday, Orengo said he is looking for another Meru wife to take home. "..she (wife) comes Tharaka Nithi, and my sister married in Maua...," he said. "Natafuta Mmeru mwingine, niende na yeye nyumbani. Mkikubali nitachukua mwingine kutoka hapa imenti (I am looking for another Meru to take home. If you allow me, I will take one from Imenti)," he said. Orengo said the BBI was addressing issues of changing the Constitution to allow others to enjoy the political power. To say parliamentary system does not mean that we want leaders who have not been elected. We need to do this referendum before July," he said. The Mt Kenya region has presented a 10-point demand to the Building Bridges Initiative task force. Nyandarua Governor Francis Kimemia read the resolutions during a BBI rally at Kinoru Stadium in Meru on Saturday. Kimemia is the chairman of the Mt Kenya governors' caucus. Edited by R.Wamochie
