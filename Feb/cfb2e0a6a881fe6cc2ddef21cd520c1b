The court will this afternoon expected to rule on whether former Sports CS Rashid Echesa will take a plea in the Sh39.5 billion fake military arms scandal. Echesa was presented before the court on Monday morning but his lawyers opposed the plea taking arguing that there is an order at JKIA court. Evans Ondieki argued that they had been ambushed this morning in a bid to frustrate them. Senior Principal Magistrate Kennedy Cheruiyot said the matters are weighty and needs to make a ruling on the matter at noon. Last week the court had directed that Echesa be released on an Sh1 million police bond after a search had been conducted at his Karen home. The police conducted the search on Saturday but did not release Echesa and opted to charge him on Monday. They had been given until 6 pm to release him, but Echesa and the co-accused were to appear before the JKIA court for mentioning of the matter. His lawyers led by Ondieki while arguing before the judge said the case is about the Deputy President William Ruto adding that there are letters written by politicians including Kitui governor Charity Ngilu on the matter before the court. Though the prosecution insisted that Echesa takes plea since they had followed the right procedure, his lawyers said the plea does not stand since the same prosecution had not withdrawn the miscellaneous application against Echesa currently at the JKIA court.
