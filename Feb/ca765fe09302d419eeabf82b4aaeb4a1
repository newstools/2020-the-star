Members of Parliament today in the evening staged an emotional bye to late former President Daniel Moi on the last day of the body lying-in-state. The MPs from both bicameral Parliament led by speakers Justin Muturi (National Assembly) and Kenneth Lusaka (Senate) sang songs in praise of the man who served not only as the President but also as a member of Parliament. The lawmakers in their numbers positioned themselves at the senate gate where they paid their last respect to Moi before he was carried in gun carriage to Lee funeral. The MPs sang 'tawala Kenya, fimbo ya Nyayo' lyrics which were popular songs during Moi's rule. The lawmakers escorted Moi's body up to Parliament road where they emotionally waved as the body slowly moves to Lee Funeral. The song and dance came as the public viewing of the body of Mzee Moi officially ended. The viewing ended on Monday 6 pm marking three days Moi's body lay-in-state. National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi said cumulatively some 213,000 Kenyans viewed the body over the three-day period. Muturi said it was unfortunate that the viewing was closed while more people flocked Parliament to pay their last respects. On Sunday over 55,000 Kenyans viewed the body compared to 24,000 who viewed the body on Saturday. “As at 5.35 pm today, it has been recorded that 213,000 Kenyans had the opportunity to pay their last respects to the retired former president Daniel Arap Moi. Out of these, 72,500 viewed the body today,” Muturi said. The body of Moi has been laying at parliament since Friday last week.
