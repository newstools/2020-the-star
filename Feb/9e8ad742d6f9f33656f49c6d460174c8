The legislation on the slaughter of donkeys should be reviewed urgently to save the beast of burden from extinction, Agriculture CS Peter Munya has said. The CS who spoke at Kalatine in Mumoni sub-county, Kitui, said that donkeys are of great value especially to women. “What will women use for transportation if the high demand for donkey skin and meat continues?” Munya asked. Four donkey abattoirs have been constructed in Kenya since the law on the slaughter was enacted in 2012. The slaughterhouses are Goldox Kenya in Baringo, Star Brilliant Abattoir in Naivasha, Silzha Ltd in Turkana and Fuhai in Machakos. The meat and skins are sold to the Chinese. “Going by the rate at which donkeys are being slaughtered, chances of the animal becoming extinct are high. This will adversely affect women who use the animal to ferry water, charcoal, firewood and for home and commercial uses,” the minister said. Donkey meat is a delicacy among the Chinese who process the skins for traditional cures of anaemia and dizziness. Slaughterhouses pay between Sh15,000 and Sh25,000 per donkey, with males fetching higher prices. The high prices have attracted livestock thieves and farmers want donkey slaughterhouses closed.
