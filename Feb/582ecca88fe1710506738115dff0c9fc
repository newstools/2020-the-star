Harambee Stars captain Victor Wanyama may have played his last Tottenham match after being excluded from their Champions League squad, Football Insider has learned. The midfielder, 28, has slipped further down the pecking order at the club after failing to secure a January transfer. A Tottenham source has told Football Insider there is a growing expectancy among the hierarchy and coaching staff that Wanyama won’t play again for the first team. He continues to train with the senior squad and is said to have remained professional and committed throughout his freeze-out from the team. But the January signing of Giovani Lo Celso on a permanent deal and the loan-to-buy arrival of Gedson Fernandes has further pushed the Kenya international down the pecking order despite the long-term injury to Moussa Sissoko. Harry Winks, Eric Dier and Oliver Skipp are also ahead of Wanyama in the central midfield reckoning. Tottenham were keen to offload Wanyama in the January window but they could not find a buyer willing to meet their valuation or pay his £65,000-a-week wages. There was interest from Bundesliga outfit Hertha Berlin, French outfit Amiens and La Liga club Leganes, as well as Celtic. Tellingly, Wanyama was excluded from the 30-man Champions League squad named by Jose Mourinho last week for the knockout stages after featuring in the group stage dead rubber against Bayern Munich in December. That was one of just four appearances Wanyama has made for Tottenham this season and he has not made a single Premier League matchday squad since Mourinho took over in November.
