In celebration of the birthday of His Majesty the Emperor Naruhito of Japan, Japanese Ambassador Horie Ryoichi and his spouse Madame Yuko hosted a lunchtime reception at their Riverside Drive ambassadorial residence in Nairobi on Friday. Known as 'Tennou Tanjyobi', this holiday is celebrated on the birthday of the current emperor. Thus, if the emperor changes, the national holiday will change to the birthday of the new emperor. Emperor Naruhito was born on February 23. The reception was attended by invited guests from members of the diplomatic corps, businessmen and government institutions.
