Good evening, Kiambu Governor James Nyoro has gotten the green light to appoint a deputy governor, while the KDF-acquired Spartan aircraft is set to undergo local acceptance trials. Meanwhile, there are concerns the pesticides sprayed on desert locusts are killing other useful insects, while China has accused US of whipping up fear over coronavirus. Kenyaâ€™s military newly acquired the C-27J Spartan aircraft will undergo acceptance trials by a special military unit before being registered KAF 222. The KDF's Air Force squadron unit is made up of engineers, pilots and other skilled teams that do testing on newly acquired aircraft before they are accepted and registered locally. High court Judge James Makau has declined to issue orders stopping Kiambu Governor James Nyoro from appointing a DG. The Judge on Monday said the appointment of a deputy governor is not a single act but a process.  On January 10, thick clouds of locusts blackened the skies of East Africa from Ethiopia and Somalia into Kenya. Interestingly, the government attempted to rebel the ravaging insects using teargas and live bullets.   Two politicians from Eastern have disowned Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu, following her move to order the eviction of Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria from a BBI rally on Saturday. Senator Enoch Wambua decried the intolerance towards Kuria during the rally.  China accused the United States on Monday of whipping up panic over a fast-spreading coronavirus with travel restrictions and evacuations as Chinese stocks plunged on the first day back from the extended Lunar New Year holiday. The death toll in China from the newly identified virus, which emerged in Wuhan, capital of the central province of Hubei, rose to 361 as of Sunday, up 57 from the previous day, the National Health Commission said.
