 The national government's takeover of functions of the Nairobi county government has set a bad precedent that might kill devolution, the county assemblies forum has said. The forum's secretary-general Kipkirui Chepkwony said the council of governors and senators should convene a crisis meeting to defend devolution. He said the Nairobi case was unprecedented and that there was more than meets the eye. Chepkwony said Nairobi MCA’s were confused on whether they will be provide oversight to the national government or not. “The roles of ward representatives must be protected at all cost and be upheld as stipulated in the Constitution,” Chepkwony said. He was speaking in Kapsabet after holding a meeting with Nandi MCA’s on the happenings at in Nairobi. He said there should have been public participation to discuss “a planned” takeover before the deal with the state was signed. He said counties were having a lot of problems in accessing resources from the national government and claims it could be part of the wider scheme to frustrate devolution. “Many counties are currently facing serious financial challenges to pay salaries and allowances to both MCA’s and employees, why should it be so.? The MCA said more functions ought to be devolved but the reverse was happening. “We are foreseeing a situation in the future especially in the advent of BBI where the creation of metropolis might end public representations,” Chepkwony said.  edited by peter obuya
