Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka still holds dear some of the special notes former President Moi wrote him. He spoke during Moi's burial service at Kabarak University on Wednesday. Kalonzo said Moi mentored him and made him the leader he is today. "I remember while in New Zealand he told me, Stephen, when trouble comes, they don't come singly. It was a response to a crisis we were handling at the time," he reminisced. Kalonzo said the former President stood for the dignity and honour of Kenya. "He would never sell his birthright of Kenya to any leader anywhere in the world," he said. Deputy President William Ruto said he too owes his leadership skills to Moi. "We are proud graduates of the politics of former President Daniel Moi. He taught us that hate is a burden," he said. Ruto said Mzee Moi built strong political institutions during his 24 years as president, including the national army. "Moi built the most disciplined and professional army not only in Kenya but in East Africa and Africa at large," he said.
