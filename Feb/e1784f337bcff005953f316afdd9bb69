A fire has once again razed stalls and buildings at the populous Gikomba Market early Saturday morning. According to the Kenya Red Cross, response teams are currently at the scene. Merchandise of unknown value was destroyed in the fire that started at around 4 am. County officials have launched investigations to establish the cause of the fire. Nairobi County Emergency CEC Ann Mwenda said firefighters from the county managed to contain the fire. She cited inaccessibility to the area as a major hindrance to contain the inferno. "At least there were no injuries and casualties. It was a good response and I really commend the disaster response team together with the area DCC, Kenya police and the area MCA for their swift action," she said. This is the latest incident in which part of the market has gone up in flames in what has come to be an annual worrying trend. The market last year saw three such incidents. The last one was in August last year, property worth more than Sh100 million was reduced to ashes at the market. The Nairobi county government has on several sought to assure residents that the perennial fire problem comes to a stop. It is currently building a market in the area to fix the problem.
