Narok Senator Ledama ole Kina was arrested on Tuesday over hate speech and ethnic contempt. Officials from the National Cohesion and Integration Commission and the Directorate of Criminal Investigations took him to Kilimani police station. The senator was later released. NCIC chairperson Samuel Kobia said in a statement that Kina was arrested in connection with his utterances on JKL Interview on February 19. The interview was aired on Citizen TV. The senator had told the interviewer that the Building Bridges Initiative rally in Narok (last Saturday) would be about the Maa community. He said two groups had met separately to articulate on issues to be addressed. "In the morning, non-Maasais met in [Ongata] Rongai. We held our meeting at the Maasai Lodge. We were there to articulate our issues," Olekina said. "Maasai issues will be better articulated by Maasais and I am not going to apologise for that." Kobia said the comments had threatened the cohesion fabric in Narok county and its environs. "These invective and diatribe utterances have caused animosity and triggered tension among the different communities living in the county." The NCIC boss said peace had been destabilised due to "the senator's reckless utterances". He reiterated that BBI is not a tool for seeking or demonstrating political supremacy. According to the former World Council of Churches boss, the issues raised ought to be addressed candidly and resolved amicably without dividing and inciting Kenyans. He warned that any leader, regardless of their political affiliation or status, will be held accountable for their actions and utterances. Kobia said while the Constitution guarantees freedom of expression, it does not extend to incitement to violence, hate speech or advocacy of hatred. "The commission continues to work with law enforcement agencies to ensure calmness and peaceful, cohesive society," he said. Edited by R.Wamochie
