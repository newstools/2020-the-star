President Uhuru Kenyatta's Trade PS nominee Johnson Weru has no EACC clearance. The revelation emerged on Tuesday morning when he appeared before a Parliamentary vetting committee. According to EACC's communication to Parliament, they have no records for Weru's self-declaration form which is a mandatory requirement before one is cleared to assume a public office. Appearing before National Assembly's Trade committee chaired by Kieni MP Kanini Kega, Weru submitted a copy of self-declaration forms he claimed to have filed on February 14 at Huduma center. According to the nominee, the anti-corruption body advised him to fill self-declaration form, have it stamped by a lawyer and file the same with Huduma Center. In a letter dated February 19, EACC indicated that it has not received the crucial form. Kanini directed Weru to settle the matter with the antigraft body and submit the letter to the committee before they compile their report. The President made the appointments last month. Principal Secretary nominees will be vetted by House committees of the respective dockets. Those vetted will fill vacancies at the Trade, TVET, Public Service, Transport and Physical Planning dockets.
