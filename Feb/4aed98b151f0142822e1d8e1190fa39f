Bongo star Ben Pol has asked fans to expect a lot from his encounter with American rapper Gucci Mane late last year during an event in Miami. He told Wasafi Media, "I was interacting with people and I was at the VIP with Gucci Mane and his team, but we really didn't talk too much because he was like the centre of attention and everyone wanted to talk to him." Adding, "Most of the time I spoke to the manager and the organiser and it was a privilege being there because there are so many things that were spoken about, which will come to light soon. It was a good connection."
