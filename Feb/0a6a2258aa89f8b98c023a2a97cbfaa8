Reigning Frankfurt Marathon champion Valary Aiyabei Jemeli will be hoping to run well at her second marathon in the World Marathon Majors (WMM) when she lines up at Sunday’s Tokyo marathon. The former Barcelona Marathon winner, who has recovered from a waist injury, said her preparations are in top gear and she is ready for Tokyo. This will be her second race in World Marathon Majors after finishing third in the 2017 Berlin Marathon behind Gladys Cherono and Ethiopia’s Ruti Aga. In October, Aiyabei made headlines when she won the Frankfurt Marathon in a course record time of 2:19.10. “I am mentally and physically fit for the title chase in Japan. I know I have just recovered from waist injury that kept me out of training but I am ready for the challenge. I want a title in majors,” said Aiyabei who is also the 2019 Eldoret City Marathon winner. Apart from Tokyo Marathon, the 2015 Kass Marathon winner is part of Kenya team to this year’s Olympic Games to be held in Tokyo, Japan. As a reserved runner in the Kenya Olympics team, Aiyabei is optimistic of scaling the heights in Tokyo on Sunday in a bid to catch the eye of the national coaches as she prepares for the 2020 Olympic Games. “The journey to glory is not easy and I want to try my best to feature in the Kenya marathon team. Every runner would love to compete for his or her country in all championships and this, I guess is my time,” she noted. Apart from running at the international level, Aiyabei has also dominated the local races. “My target is to run well in all races especially while representing my nation. If I will run in Tokyo, it will be good for me because it will be the first time I will be running for Kenya and I can’t wait,” added Aiyabei.
