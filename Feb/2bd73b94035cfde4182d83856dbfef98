Kenyan Premier League side Bandari will not be shaken by the exit of their long-serving centre half and skipper Felly Mulumba. The burly Congolese defender joined Zimbabwean champions FC Platinum yesterday, marking an end of his five-year stay at Bandari, where he won three titles. Mulumba’s quest for greener pastures began in May, 2018 when he attended trials in eSwatini but despite being successful, he extended his allegiance with the Dockers. The former Sofapaka man was part of the Bandari squad that won the 2016 KPL Super Cup and had clinched the then Gotv Shield Cup the previous year. He successfully skippered the club to claim the Super Cup in June last year as well as silver in the former SportPesa Super Cup in January. Bandari team manager Wilson Oburu confirmed Mulumba's exit but insisted that his departure will not distabilise their defence. Oburu who passed the armband to Mulumba after hanging his boots expressed optimism that the quartet of Sothenes Idah, Brian Otieno, Bernard Odhiambo and the versatile Dan Otewa will provide cover in Mulumba's absence. “Mulumba approached us and requested that we hand him his release letter for he had a better deal. We could not stand in his way as he had served us well and the deal will see him progress in his career,” said the former Kenyan international. "It is a motivation to the rest of the players that their efforts are monitored and should they step up, they may get the rare opportunity of playing abroad. With his exit, there should be no cause for alarm as we have able centre-halves." Oburu, in the meantime, said that the armband will rotate between the four players who were Mulumba’s assistants including another long-serving player Shaban Kenga Otewa, Odhiambo and former Harambee Stars playmaker David King’atua.
