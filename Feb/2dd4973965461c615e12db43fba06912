Two teen girls have been rescued from forced marriage in Ngaremara, Isiolo, and enrolled in school. The girls aged 13 and 15 were rescued by provincial administration officials on Monday and taken to the Child Welfare Society of Kenya-Isiolo branch. They were enrolled in Isiolo Girls' High School on Tuesday. The two will be returning to the centre during school holidays until they complete their studies. New Education Chief Administrative Secretary Mumina Bonaya, who is monitoring the government’s 100 per cent transition programme in Isiolo and Marsabit counties, condemned the incident. She said police are pursuing the matter. “Those found responsible will be arrested and ultimately jailed," Bonaya said. The government is working to ensure all the candidates who sat the KCPE exam enrol in secondary school. “The transition rate in Isiolo is at 91 per cent. The children who have not yet gone to school are way too many," Bonaya said. "Majority of those who are yet to report to secondary schools are girls.” The CAS spoke at Isiolo girls, where she oversaw the admission of the two girls and 13 others from poor backgrounds. She warned parents against marrying off underage girls. "In Northern Kenya, retrogressive cultural practices are still keeping girls out of school. Society needs to shun outlawed practices to give girls a chance for education and avoid getting on the wrong side of the law,” Bonaya said She said the government aims to have all children who sat the KCPE exam enrolled in school in two weeks and to ensure all are accounted for.
