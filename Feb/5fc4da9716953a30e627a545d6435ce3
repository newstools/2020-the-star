The East Africa Community celebrated its 20th Anniversary at Daystar University Valley Road Nairobi. To mark the occasion, students from different universities were given a platform to come up with short films on togetherness in the East African Community. Speaking during the occasion, EAC secretary general Liberat Mfumukeko called for the realisation of EAC's mandate. This includes political federation and a common currency, hence maximising on a common market. In attendance were Kenya Film Commission marketing director Alex Mulwa and Dr Ali Matano. Artiste Kidum curtain-raised the event.
