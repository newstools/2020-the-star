Kenyans woke up on Sunday Morning to continue with public viewing of Mzee Moi's body in Parliament. Kenyans started arriving at Parliament Buildings as early as 5am to pay their last respects to the former president of Kenya who died on February 4, 2020. The body of the former president will lie in state for two more days. Several leaders, including former president Mwai Kibaki is expected at Parliament Buildings to view the remains of Moi. The public viewing of the body, which began on Saturday, will end on Monday. On Tuesday, an interdenominational service will be held at the Nyayo National Stadium in Nairobi. Moi will be interred on Wednesday in Kabarak. On Saturday, military officers pushed the coffin of former Kenya's President  from the Lee Funeral home to parliament. The casket carrying the body was draped with the Kenyan flag and left the parlour  at 7:15 am. This practice is used by the military to affirm that the deceased is mourned by the nation and appreciated by the state. The casket was wheeled by a carriage as happened with founding President Mzee Jomo Kenyatta in 1978.
