Kenyans have registered their disappointment with Olympic kits released for the Kenyan athletes team. The short sleeved shirt has a red and green pattern all over it with the flag of Kenya positioned at the shoulders. Designed by Nike, the kit features a conspicuous honeycomb pattern, a break from iconic past kits which laid out the red, black and green colors of the flag. The official kit includes Team Kenya running tops, armbands, shorts, track pants and hoodies. Most Kenyans said the shirt was not good for their athletes to wear during the world championship which will begin in Tokyo Japan on July 24 and run until Aug. 9, 2020. Most of the big swimming events will take place over the first week, while the track and field competitions ramp up in the second half. "You mean The G.O.A.T @EliudKipchoge will wear these .......??? Iko shinda," @kimfrank said. @AtBore said "I don't like them... I see soccer nets and we are in Olympics.." The Team Kenya kits was one of the major contentious issues during the last Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro in 2016 with issues ranging from oversized uniforms for the athletes to ‘lost’ kits and late arrival. National Olympic Committee of Kenya president Paul Tergat disclosed that the team will be draped in new remodeled kits by sponsors Nike after the two entities met. Last year, in a bid to avoid previous problems with national teams’ kit, the National Olympic Committee of Kenya begun early engagement with clothing giant Nike ahead of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. Nock held a consultative meeting with Nike’s Robert Lotwis to initiate early discussion on the Kenyan kit for Tokyo 2020. In run down to the 2018 Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast, Australia, there was a stand-off between athletes and officials as far as team’s kit is concerned. Nock Committee, led by the President Paul Tergat, informed Nike that the aspect of kit is a critical element to the preparations and participation of Team Kenya in the future events.
