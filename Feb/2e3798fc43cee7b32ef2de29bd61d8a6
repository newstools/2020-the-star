More than 200 farmers groups in Embu have received a Sh32 million grant to support dairy, indigenous poultry, green grams and mango farming. The groups received the funds awarded through the National Agricultural Rural Inclusive Growth Project (NARIGP) at Umau grounds in Mbeere South subcounty. County project coordinator Jane Murithi said the funds will be managed by the Community-Driven Development Committee, with the Social Accountability and Integrity Committee playing an oversight role. "The CDDC will ensure that the groups do not divert the funds from the intended purpose as outlined in the proposals," she said. Margery Murugi, a green grams farmer from Mbeere South said that the project will change the lives of farmers in a big way. "For years we have been struggling with poor yields due to lack of funds and technical know-how. Now, with the generous support our group is receiving from NARIGP, the future looks much brighter. We look forward to bumper harvests", she said. The grant is part of Sh82 million fund to be granted to groups across the county. NARIGP is a World Bank-funded project rolled out in 20 other counties across the country. Murithi said that this is the first tranche of the disbursements. "This is approximately 40 per cent of the amount of funding allocated to the county by the World Bank," she said.
