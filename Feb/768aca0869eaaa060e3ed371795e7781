The statue of a lion that had been placed at the VIP entrance at City Hall was mysteriously burnt on Tuesday night. It is not known who set fire to the statue but the incident happened hours after governor Mike Sonko handed over county functions to the National Government. Firefighters were grappling with putting out the fire as they removed the remains of the Lion. The lion is known to be the King of the jungle, which had indicated that the statue was in the premisesÂ  of the king's (Sonko) place. In March last year , two similar-looking lion statues had been placed on either side of the VIP entrance to City Hall. At the same time , another lion statue was placed at the University way roundabout which attracted criticism and mockery from Kenyans. Many Kenyans questioned the tendering process of the statues and how much the project might have cost. Sonko bowed to pressure and the statue at the roundabout was removed
