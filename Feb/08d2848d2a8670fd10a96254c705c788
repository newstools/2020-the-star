Student accommodation is in a crisis and they are not living in good conditions, PS Charles Hinga has said. Speaking during the launch of new hostels for Strathmore University students on Friday, the Housing and Urban Development PS also said there is a housing challenge in Kenya. He was accompanied by Arcon Holdings CEO of Edward Kirathe, as he inspected the hostels dubbed Qwetu Homes. “Would like to thank Arcon for identifying this niche and putting up accommodation for our students,” Kirathe said. He said this is their fourth Qwetu property bringing them to a total of 2,300 beds across the four properties. They serve 65 universities and colleges and 53 nationalities. “We have a pipeline of 10,000 additional beds and will continue to support the affordable housing programme providing affordable housing for students and young professionals," he said. "That is our focus. This is the largest facility we have so far compared to other Qwetu hostels." The Qwetu Homes are equipped with a fridge, cooker, bed, microwave and wardrobe at a cost of about Sh22,000 per student per month. Arcon Limited has a housing plan to put up 50,000 rental stock not only for students but for young professionals. “Kenya has a huge young population and we want to make sure as we talk about ownership, the young generation is not left out since they are more about flexibility and the ability to move,” he said. Kirathe added that the development is about to be completed and students are already registering. The PS said that the Ministry will partner with Arcon to put up 20,000 units as part of the Railway City project. “We already have several anchors. We have anchors for an office park, railway station, affordable housing and spaces for international offices,” he said. Edited by R.Wamochie
