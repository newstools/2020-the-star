Parents and guardians should not enrol their children in unregistered schools, Kisii Education Board chairman Henry Onderi has said. The official said they will not watch as parents waste money and their children's time in unregistered schools. Onderi and county director of education Pius Ngoma on Tuesday told parents to check the status of schools before enrolling their children. “The board has given parents up to this Friday to withdraw their children from the unregistered schools," Onderi said. “Children in unregistered private institutions should be withdrawn immediately and (the board will) transfer them to neighbouring schools.” The chairman warned tutors registered with the Teachers' Service Commission not to work in unregistered schools or else they be blacklisted. “The board should audit teachers to ensure they have TSC numbers. The County Education Board will take action against school board members who employ unregistered teachers,” Onderi said. Ngoma said the county had closed Ramasha Milimani Academy and delisted it as a national examination centre for non-compliance with the Education ministry's rules and regulations. “The institution was closed but I understand it is still operating under a different name. The proprietor risks arrest and prosecution,” he said, adding that they will closely monitor private schools to ensure compliance. Edited by Josephine M. Mayuya
