The National Land Commission wants land matters sorted out through dispute resolution mechanisms. Residents always have sufficient and reliable information to solve land cases before heading to court, commissioner Gertrude Nduku said during the presentation of title deeds in Makueni. “Let us use the information we have and in a harmonised way – especially from the elderly – to solve our land disputes before we go to court,” Nduku said at Wayani in Nzaui sub-county on Wednesday. She said the NLC was consulting the Judiciary so that the wananchi are well guided on land dispute resolution. She issued titles to 1,012 residents who have been squatting at Nguu settlement scheme for 25 years. The function was witnessed by Governor Kivutha Kibwana and both county and national government officials. The issuance of the land ownership documents brought to an end a 25-year dispute between the squatters and members of Nguu Ranch Cooperative Society who had been claiming the 7,341-acre property. A task force formed to come up with a resolution on who was the lawful owner settled on the squatters. Kibwana blamed corruption for poor land administration and management across the country. He also blamed the rich for the oppression of the poor in land disputes. “Just because someone has money and is able to access the court or other land offices without pain, he will take the small piece of land from a poor person,” the governor said. He promised not to spare corrupt officers in his government and at the same time called on the national government to clean the lands department.
