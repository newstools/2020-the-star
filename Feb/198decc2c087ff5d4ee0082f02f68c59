The Mombasa county assembly resumes business on February 18 after a week of mourning occasioned by the death of retired President Daniel arap Moi. The ward reps have been on recess since December 4 and were due back yesterday (Wednesday) but this was put off to join the rest of the country in mourning the country's second president. Their first business will be debating and passing the county's budget. Governor Hassan Joho will also give his state of the county address. The banning of miraa and the Standard Gauge Railway and its impact on the Coast economy are other issues to be addressed. An advertisement placed in the dailies by speaker Aharub Ebrahim Khatri explained the postponement. "Kenya has lost a true patriot and a great leader who strived to instil a sense of dignity and mutual respect amongst us," Khatri said, noting that Moi extended a personal touch and friendliness to the coastal region during his 24-year governance.
