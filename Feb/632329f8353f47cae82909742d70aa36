 A magistrate at a Nairobi court called her prosecutor a joker who takes things casually and is an idler. "Prosecutor, you are not serious with your work. You take things for granted. Where do you want me to write down the exhibit you are telling me and I have finished noting down my notes? The magistrate, who seemed irritated after taking down some notes, said. In a rejoinder, the state counsel smiled and proceeded with his work and later left the court leaving his colleague to hold brief for him "over personal commitments". A man appeared in Nairobi court drunk, stubborn and confused. His clothes were torn and his trouser was muddy. The magistrate asked the police where they got him from without an appropriate answer. The prosecutor, however, told the court that the man had been arrested during an alcoblow crackdown along Waiyaki Way. The magistrate fined him Sh20,000 after he pleaded guilty. A man charged with assault rolled his tongue, smiled before a female magistrate but was "properly ignored". The suspect is accused of assaulting a woman in one of the Nairobi slums seemed to be seeking lenient bond terms. The magistrate told him to stand upright and listen carefully to the clerk. "We are on a serious business here. Please listen to the charges and tell us if it is true or false," she said. She released him on Sh 30,000 bond.
