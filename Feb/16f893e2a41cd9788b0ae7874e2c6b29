President Uhuru Kenyatta has narrated how he hid from Mzee Daniel Moi after he made a mistake. Speaking during Moi's funeral service in Kabarak on Wednesday, Uhuru said a phone call came in at 5 am making him weary. "Siku moja alipiga simu na zile simu zake zilikuwa za 5 am," Uhuru said. (One day he called and remember his phone calls could come in as early as 5 am) "...kulikuwa na kitu nilifanya nikajua hii simu iko na taabu...nikaambia mama wewe chukuwa hiyo.." (I did something wrong the previous day. I knew this phone call was not a friendly call. I then told my wife to receive it) But he notes that the wife who was obeying picked up the phone. "Moi akamuuliza niko wapi. Mama akasema hayuko karibu. After five minutes, Moi akapiga tena. Lakini mama akasema hashiki simu," he said. (Moi asked her where I was. Then she lied that I was not around. After five minutes, Moi called again. But my wife refused to receive the call) Uhuru then said he was forced to receive the phone call that was coming from President Moi. "Nikasema nilikuwa naoga najitayarisha kutoka.. wacha moto uwake..simu ikapigwa chini mara ya tatu..after 10mins.." he said. Uhuru tried to apologise for his unidentified mistake, but Moi could not let it go. "Nikapiga sorry..akasema nataka niwe in Nakuru by 7am.....ni mjinga pekee yake anajipeleka kwa moto.." "Karibu wiki moja nikapotea ..nikasema siendi mpaka joto iishe.. vile alivyo mkali ndivyo vile angekusamehe virahisi." But Moi later forgave him. The President eulogised Moi as his mentor, teacher, adding that they shall miss him. The late former President Daniel Arap Moi will be buried on Wednesday at Kabarak. Thousands of people across the country turned up as government kept its earlier promise to provide sodas and bread for the first 30,000 people. A funeral service was held at the Nyayo International Stadium on Tuesday which was attended by seven heads of state including several dignitaries.
