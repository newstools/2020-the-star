Former movie producer Harvey Weinstein has been found guilty of two counts in his sexual assault trial. He has been convicted on lesser charges of third-degree rape and a criminal sexual act in the first degree. But Weinstein, 67, has been acquitted of the most serious charge against him - of predatory sexual assault and first-degree rape. He still faces charges in Los Angeles of rape and sexual assault of two women in 2013. Weinstein had pleaded not guilty to sexually assaulting former production assistant Mimi Haleyi and raping Jessica Mann, a former aspiring actress. The jury of seven men and five women reached their verdict on Monday morning, the fifth day of deliberations. The case was at the centre of the #MeToo movement that inspired women to go public with misconduct allegations against powerful men. Weinstein entered court before the verdict wearing a navy blue suit and leaning on a walking frame.
