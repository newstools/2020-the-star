Gospel singer Nicah the Queen says she still loves her baby daddy Dr Ofweneke, despite their break-up. In a Q&A with her fans on Instagram Nicah got lots of enquiries about her relationship with Dr Ofweneke. She said she still loves the comedian but is no longer in a relationship with him. She, however, added that just because she is single does not mean she is searching. This is because many people are sliding into her DM. Dr Ofweneke has moved on with another woman, whom he got a baby with. The media personality took to Instagram, where he shared a photo of his girlfriend with the caption â€œTHE EAGLES." Nicah and Ofweneke are still co-parenting.
