President Uhuru Kenyatta is in the US for bilateral talks. Kenya is among the United States’ most important allies in Africa. Over the last decade, an expanding number of US companies have entered the Kenyan market, attracted by the political, structural, and economic reforms that have made it significantly easier to conduct business in-country. In recognition of Kenya’s strong contributions to the African Union Peace-keeping Mission in Somalia and the country’s role as a key regional actor, the United States has elevated its bilateral relationship with Kenya to a more ambitious Strategic Partnership, aimed at advancing counter-terrorism collaboration, defense and security cooperation, and economic relations between the two countries.
