All actors should support president Uhuru Kenyatta and Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko's deal, DP Willam Ruto has said. On Monday evening, Sonko surrendered key functions of the Nairobi county to the national government. The four critical functions to be under the national government include health, transport, public works and planning service. But this move has drawn criticisms from all quarters with activist Okiya Omtata and a voter moving to court seeking orders to block the process from taking place. Ruto said on Wednesday in a tweet that due process was followed before the deal was sealed. "Support this effort to ensure our city functions. The management of Nairobi city has been a major source of concern for the government and Nairobians," Ruto said. The DP disclosed that Uhuru, the Council of Governors and IEBC had consulted earlier before the move was undertaken. "...with a consultation with other actors to facilitate the agreements signed," Ruto added. Senators, who are the custodians of the counties have also criticised the move. The Majority Leader in the Senate Kipchumba Murkomen dismissed the deal, saying it was illegal. Murkomen said the deal will leave Nairobi a shell of a county and that the public was not involved before the deal. The State House defended the deal, saying that the move was legal as pursuant to Article 187 of the Constitution. According to the Constitution, 1) A function or power of government at one level may be transferred to a government at the other level by agreement between the governments if: (a) the function or power would be more effectively performed or exercised by the receiving government, and (b) the transfer of the function or power is not prohibited by the legislation under which it is to be performed or exercised.
