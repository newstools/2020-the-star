North Korea has quarantined 380 foreigners in a bid to stop the coronavirus from breaking out. The foreigners are mostly diplomats stationed in the capital Pyongyang, said news agency Yonhap, quoting the Korean Central Broadcasting Station. Around 200 foreigners had already been confined to their compounds for the past 30 days - but as that came to an end, the quarantine has been extended. There have not been any reported cases of Covid-19 in North Korea. It's not known how long the new quarantine for foreigners will last. In South Korea, seven people have died with 763 people infected. Around 7,700 troops have been quarantined after 11 military members were infected. The virus, which emerged in China, has spread to at least 29 countries. Italy has the highest number of coronavirus cases in Europe, with 152. Around 50,000 people in two northern "hotspot" regions - Veneto and Lombardy - have been put under quarantine for two weeks. Iran has also confirmed 43 cases of the virus and eight deaths. In the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the virus emerged, healthy non-residents who are not under quarantine - and have not showed any symptoms - will be allowed to leave. People with special reasons to leave, including those who need to seek treatment, may also be permitted to do so. Both groups will be required to apply for approval before leaving and will have to monitor their health for the next 14 days. The city has been in lockdown since January 23, with authorities cutting off transport links in and out of the city. More than 2,500 people have died from the virus in mainland China, with some 77,150 cases confirmed cases reported.
