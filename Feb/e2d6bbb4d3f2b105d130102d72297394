The expansion of the Kenya Hockey Union League is the reason why the 2019/2020 transfer window has been the most successful in recent times. The men's league has been divided into three thus Premier, Super and National League. The ladies division composes of Premier League and Super League only. Previously, the women's category only boosted the top tier. The December-January transfer window had 81 applications and 70 have already been approved. According to KHU, the remaining 11  are being vetted by the arbitration committee starting this weekend. Comparatively, there were only 61 applications in 2018/2019 window. The men's Premier League teams dominated the market with Mombasa Sports Club pulling a massive five deals. Returnees Parkroad Badgers and Greensharks signed four players each while defending champions Butali brought in three and one more is expected should Kennedy Munialo's dream move be cleared. Debutants Wolverines and Sailors had the biggest say in the women's category while record champions and cash-strapped Blazers did not sign any according to the transfer list released by the union. Parkroad Tigers reigned supreme in the men's Super League. Deputy match and fixture secretary Moses Majiwa observed that the restructure and increase in the number of teams is responsible for the high numbers witnessed. Kitale Hockey Club, Nairobi Chapel and University of Eldoret Panthers are the latest clubs to join the league in different cadres. "More teams have joined while some have also shown their intention to come in next season. This has enhanced the growth of the game in line with the vision of the union. Many players have moved to clubs of their choice across all divisions," said Majiwa who anticipates a better 2020 season.
