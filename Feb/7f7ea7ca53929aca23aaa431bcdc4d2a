The United State on Friday banned Tanzania's capital city mayor and his family from entering the country because of his anti-gay crackdown. Dar-es-Salaam's Regional commissioner, or mayor, Paul Makonda, was also banned because of his crackdown on freedom of expression and oppression of the political opposition. The US State Department links Makonda to violating human rights by using his capacity as the Regional Commissioner of Tanzanian capital to oppress the marginalized. The regional commissioner is the highest representative of the central government in Tanzania. The statement by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, dated January 31, said Makonda "has also been implicated in the oppression of the political opposition, crackdowns on freedom of expression and association and the targeting of marginalized individuals" In 2018, Makonda — then newly appointed by President John Magufuli as the new city boss— announced a crackdown on gay people and sex workers. Makonda's plan was to use social media platforms like Instagram and Facebook to identify and arrest people suspected of being gay. The move led to an outburst from local and international civil society groups and fear among the LGBTQ community in Tanzania and elsewhere. Makonda is also famous for alleging Tanzanian businessmen and the political opposition figures are linked to drug trafficking. The move bars Makonda and his wife, Mary Felix Massenge, from visiting the United States. The State Department also raises concern about the deteriorating respect for human rights and the rule of law in Tanzania. "These actions against Paul Christian Makonda underscore our concern with human rights violations and abuses in Tanzania," the statement reads. "We call on the Tanzanian government to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the freedom of expression, association, and the right of peaceful assembly." (Edited by V. Graham)
