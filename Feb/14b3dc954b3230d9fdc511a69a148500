There was chaos on Saturday at the BBI consultative forum in Kitui County after Senate Majority Kipchumba Murkomen and Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria missed their seats at the main dais. The meeting at the Kitui Stadium had just started and was largely peaceful after ODM leader Raila Odinga accompanied by the host Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu, Wiper Leader Kalonzo Musyoka arrived at around 1.18 pm. However, the drama started when Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana started reading the resolutions by the South Eastern region. Minutes into his speech, Murkomen accompanied by Kuria forced their way into the dais however, the two were pushed at the back. The two leaders appeared to engage in a scuffle with the organisers that led to several interruptions of Kibwana's speech. It took the effort of Ngilu to try and appeal for calm but the chaos persisted at the back of the dais. As the scuffle continued, Raila appeared unperturbed and was seen consulting Kalonzo who sat next to him. Minutes letter, Kuria was seen being forcefully ejected from the main dais amid jeers from the crowd. A visibly agitated Ngilu shouted that the Gatundu South MP be removed from the area. "Nobody will abuse our President Uhuru Kenyatta and sit in this meeting! Atolewe!" Ngilu shouted. After a scuffle that lasted several minutes, Kuria forced his way back into the dais and was given seats together with Murkomen after which Kibwana continued with his speech.
