The 7th Devolution Conference set for Wote town in April is a major opportunity for Makueni traders to make millions of shillings, Governor Kivutha Kibwana has said. At least 8,000 delegates are expected to attend the conference – a huge business opportunity for local traders and their colleagues in neighbouring counties. “My government is working with Kerra [Kenya Rural Roads Authority] and other stakeholders to make sure the conference is successful. It is upon you to make sure you tap into the opportunities that will be offered by the event,” Kibwana said on Thursday. He was addressing hawkers, grocers, transporters, garment traders and hoteliers in Wote town. The annual event draws delegates from Kenya's 47 counties, the national government, legislators and the private sector. Makueni Chamber of Commerce chairman Festus Maii said the hotel industry is forming a consortium that will boost their services during the event. They will have a joint catering service under the consortium involving all Makueni hotel owners. “We want to put our efforts together to ensure our services are good as well as the standard that befits the event given that it will be attended by high-profile delegates,” he told the Star in Wote town. He said the county and neighbour Machakos have adequate accommodation. Edited by R.Wamochie
