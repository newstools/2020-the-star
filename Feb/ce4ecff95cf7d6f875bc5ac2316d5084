Former President Daniel Moi was thrust into power with the sudden death of his Mzee Jomo Kenyatta in 1978. That changeover was a first in Africa — no African President had taken power peacefully. He revived and energized Kanu, his beloved political party, and set about reforming the education system. By the end of 1978, he set all the political detainees free and proclaimed a new era of reconciliation and tolerance. His diplomatic efforts opened up Kenya for strong relationships with the international community that improved foreign investment. But as he built the nation and imposed uncompromising authority, pockets of politicians and the academics fought for democratic space in a multi-party society. This would culminate ina series of new detentions of those who believed in a free society. He steered political discourse and soon Kenya was able to hold the 1992 multi-party election. He made his mistakes, for which history will judge him, but his patriotism can never have been questioned. Moi will be remembered for his generosity, love of children and spirited efforts to preach peace both in Kenya and East Africa. His simplicity should inspire politicians entrusted with power for years to come.  Quote of the Day: “In deep sadness there is no place for sentimentality.” William S.
