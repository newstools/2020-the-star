Kisii Governor James Ongwae has directed revenue officers to guide customers on how to use the recently launched digital revenue collection system. Ongwae said customers should be properly trained in selecting the type of service they want, to save time and avoid unnecessary complaints. “The county has been losing millions of shillings every year to unscrupulous tax collectors,” he said The county boss said that his administration has partnered with KCB and Riverbank to double revenue collected. Ongwae said Safaricom will provide M-PESA, KCB offer banking services and Riverbank will run the system. The online system's target is to raise more than Sh700 million annually as compared to Sh350 million collected last year. The governor said the system will be used for collecting parking, markets, pay invoice and cess fees. “The idea of digitisation of revenue collection started in 2016 so the launch is a milestone,” Ongwae said. He said that the approach will be applied across the county to help realise 100 per cent revenue collection. (edited by O. Owino)
