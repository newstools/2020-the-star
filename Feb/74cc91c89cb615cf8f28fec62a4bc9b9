 An elderly man who defiled an eight-year-old child after luring her with Sh50 will spend the next 10 years in prison. Walladi Musa Walladi, 50, committed the offence in his Lamu town carpentry shop on October 14, 2018. The court had been told that Walladi had on that day lured the child on her way home from church. He gave her Sh50 to buy chips and chocolate and led her to carpentry shop where he sexually assaulted her. He gave her another Sh50 to buy her silence. He also asked her to bathe when she got home. The accused had denied the offence and blamed his arrest and prosecution on people he did not identify. “I don’t even know the girl. My workshop is a public place and I could have easily been caught if ever I did that,” Walladi said. But Lamu principal magistrate Allan Temba convicted him after the testimonies of several people among them the police and doctors. Temba said the court was convinced that Walladi was a dangerous sexual offender. “The evidence before the court proved beyond doubt that the accused is a dangerous sexual offender," he said before passing sentence.
