The High Court has stopped the Nairobi County Assembly from carrying on with the vetting of Nairobi Deputy Governor nominee Anne Mwenda. Justice Mumbi Ngugi issued the ruling after petitioner Peter Agoro argued that Mwenda's nomination amounts to a direct insult to earlier orders issued against Governor Mike Sonko in December last year. Anti-Corruption Court magistrate Douglas Ogoti barred Sonko from accessing county offices unless accompanied by an investigating officer or any other authorised person. The court also barred Sonko from approaching any witnesses. This was after Sonko denied charges of money laundering and unlawful acquisition of public property at City Hall amounting to Sh357 million. Agoro said the nomination poses a real likelihood of interfering with prosecution witnesses as she is under the direct control of Sonko. “Sonko after being charged, was ordered not to go to office or interfere with witnesses which order was given to ensure that the integrity of the prosecution process is insulated from any interference,” Agoro said. Agoro claimed that the timing of the nomination is an act of self-preservation by Sonko and goes against the public interest in the fight against corruption as it’s aimed at defeating the cause of justice in the corruption case he is facing. Justice Ngugi directed Sonko and Mwendwa to file their responses ahead of the mention date on March 10. Sonko in a letter dated January 6 nominated Mwenda for the position of the DG.  The said letter has already been forwarded to the Office of the Speaker for transmission to the assembly for purposes of vetting Mwenda.
