Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen has denied claims that he intentionally walked out of the BBI meeting at Kinoru Stadium, Meru County on Saturday. He said that the reason he had to leave in a hurry was so that he could catch a lift offered by Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria. "Moses Kuria who gave me lift was leaving for another engagement. I had no choice but to follow," he said in a tweet. Murkomen further noted that he had parental duties to attend to. The Senate majority leader stormed out of the meeting accompanied by Kuria and Chuka-Igambang'ombe MP Patrick Munene, leaving  EALA MP Mpuru Aburi speaking. It was not clear why they left, but they had earlier missed seats. Only Murkomen and Linturi were allowed to address the gathering after requests from the public. Aburi said it is disrespectful to leave a meeting halfway even if you are offended. On Saturday they arrived at Kinoru Stadium in Meru for the BBI meeting, but there were no seats left for them the main dias. The two were seen standing behind the podium. Meru Senator Mithika Linturi was also standing.
