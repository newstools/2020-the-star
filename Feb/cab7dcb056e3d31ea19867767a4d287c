The dualling of the 10-kilometre Ngong’ Road Phase 3 is set to be completed in July, the Kenya Urban Roads Authority has said. From Dagoretti corner to Karen Shopping Centre, the road is expected to have five footbridges and five lanes, with walkways and cycle tracks on both sides. The stretch is being constructed by the China Qinjian at a cost of Sh2 billion. The expansion is in line with the Bus Rapid Transport project that is to be implemented in efforts to reduce traffic congestion to and from Nairobi. President Uhuru Kenyatta commissioned the first phase in 2016. The Sh1.3 billion Phase 1 which starts at the Kenya National Library to Prestige Plaza was completed on December 17, 2017  by Japanese firm World Kaihatsu Kogyo Company. It covers three kilometres. Phase 2 covers four kilometres and starts from Prestige Plaza to Dagoretti Corner. It was concluded on April 30 this year by the same Japanese contractors at a cost of Sh2 billion. Kura corporate affairs boss Stephen Njogu said contractors have been facing challenges such as relocation of services. “We are also having encroachment by traders who display their furniture along the road corridor and traffic management,” he said. Motorists have had to use alternative routes such as the Southern bypass, Karen Road that leads to Lang’ata Road and James Gichuru, especially in the morning and evening hour traffic. They have applauded the government for their work, urging them to speed up in the construction. “For many years, we have been hoping that the road would one day be expanded and our prayers have been answered. The expansion will save a lot of time for us and we will not have to wake up so early to beat the traffic,” Jackson Maina said. Maina urged the traffic police to manage the traffic, especially from Dagoretti Corner to the Junction Mall. The area has a lot of potential for investors, public, and private developers.
