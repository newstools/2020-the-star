Middleweight boxer Rayton Okwiri has promised to adopt a new game plan for his next bout after he won a close fight against tough Libyan Elmagasbi Emhemed. Okwiri got Kenya's campaign for slots to the 2020 Tokyo Olympics off to a winning start but the 33-year-old was far from pleased with his performance. "It was important that I got the first win for Team Kenya in our opening match," he said in his post-match interview in Dakar, Senegal. "I had several challenges in the ring mostly to do with the difficulty in breathing due to the humidity in Dakar. I was able to dominate all the three rounds and win on a unanimous decision but that’s nothing close to my best," remarked Okwiri. The experienced slugger said his body is okay and he can not wait for the next match. "I have to adjust for the next fight and adapt a new game plan. I felt a bit heavy, sort of a burning sensation on my chest.  This could be a change of climate. But we are going to work on that with my coaches for the next one," he concluded. On Saturday evening, team captain and Okwiri's fellow Olympian, Nick Okoth will take to the ring against Wilson Carlos Semedo from Cape Verde in the men's featherweight division (52-57kgs).
