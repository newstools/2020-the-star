 The body of a fisherman who drowned in Lake Oloidien in Naivasha was on Wednesday retrieved after a three-day search. The man drowned after their boat capsized following an attack by a hippopotamus. The body was found by fishermen kilometres away from the scene of the attack. He was among four fishermen on an expedition when the attack happened. His colleagues swam to safety. "We have managed to recover the body after three days of searching and we are worried by the increasing cases of drowning and hippo attacks in this lake,” Naivasha Boat Owners Association chairman David Kilo said. He said the hippos in the lake have become violent. “We have seen an increase in the number of foot-fishermen around the lake and in the process many have lost their lives due to hippo attacks,” he said. Elsewhere in Ndunyu Njeru in Kinangop, police are holding a cleric from accused of impregnating a Form 1 student. The pastor was arrested after the 15-year-old girl who joined secondary school last month confessed that she was pregnant and could not continue with her classes. There was drama outside the police station as parents of the minor bayed for the blood of the cleric. The suspect confessed to have had an affair with the girl for the last one year. Area chief Peter Kanyara said the pregnancy was detected by the management of the school where the girl was admitted to Form 1. He said they revealed the information to the parents before the pastor was tricked to come to the school. “The pastor came to the school and when confronted, he confessed to having an affair with the minor and was taken to the police station,” Kanyara said.  edited by peter obuya
