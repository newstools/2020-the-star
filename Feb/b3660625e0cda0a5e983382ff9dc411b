Kakamega Homeboyz coach Nicholas Muyoti won the Fidelity Insurance/Sports Journalist Association of Kenya (SJAK) Award for January after guiding his charges to four wins. Homeboyz beat Kariobangi Sharks, defending champions Gor Mahia, Kisumu All-Stars and Kericho Zoo in January. Muyoti, who received a cheque of Sh75,000 and a trophy from Fidelity Insurance at Bukhungu Stadium, thanked the sponsors for the award. “I am grateful to the team, our fans and also the management for the good work and support they have given us. This award is not about me but the who team in general," he noted. “The team has managed to pick crucial points, especially during our home matches and I want to congratulate my charges for the hard work and positive attitude, which I hope will be maintained," he said. “This is a big motivation for the team and it will make us work harder in all our remaining matches as we remain focused on the league title. We will take each match at a time and avoid unnecessary pressure on the players." “ I believe all the top four teams have an equal chance of winning the title. However,  I can rate Gor Mahia chances highly going by their experience and vast quality within their ranks. “I am, however, impressed by the competition for the title chase. It's good for our local soccer and more entertaining and exciting for the fans,” Muyoti said. He singled out Homeboyz's chairman Cleophas Shimanyula and Kakamega County for praise for the support that has seen them produce good results. Two weeks ago fortnight ago, Western Stima coach was awarded a similar award.
