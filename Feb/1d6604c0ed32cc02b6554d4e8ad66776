The Kenya National Union of Teachers has called for a cohesive working relationship with the Teachers Service Commission. Baringo branch executive secretary Joshua Cheptarus on Saturday said the union has been under attack by the commission since June last year and call for an end to ill relations. "For almost seven months now, the TSC has been favouring, promoting and increasing salaries for teachers affiliated to the Kenya Union of Post Primary Education, locking out those in Knut,” he said. Cheptarus, who doubles as the Rift Valley representative to Knut's National Executive Council, spoke during an educational meeting for Boresha Sacco at the Kenya School of Government in Kabarnet town, Baringo Central. About 800 teachers attended. "We are optimistic that this year, 2020, sanity shall be restored and there will be a good working relationship between us, Knut and the TSC," Cheptarus said. He called upon the commission to treat teachers equally and fairly regardless of their union affiliations. "Knut was disadvantaged last year in terms of promotion and salary increment, yet our members teach in the same classes and sit in the same staffrooms with their colleagues attached to other unions," he said. He added that no amount of intimidation shall make the union shy away from championing the rights of teachers. Last year, the TSC severed its 51-year-old ties with Knut, citing shrinking membership. Cheptarus, however, urged the employer to restore their ties and "and allow teachers to choose a union of their choice without being coerced to leave or join one". He said international laws call for equal treatment for teachers "and that is what we are hoping for this year". Some should not earn better salaries than others merely because they belong to a certain favoured union, he said.
