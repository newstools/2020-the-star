Sixteen organisations operating around Lake Naivasha have been directed to comply with environmental regulations or be punished. The National Environmental Management Authority board chairman John Konchellah said entities on riparian land have also been given seven days to move out. The authority has blamed institutions around the lake including the Naivasha sewerage plant for pollution. Konchellah spoke to journalists after a tour of the lake. He said Nema will lead a clean-up on Lake Naivasha to rid it of water hyacinth. Stakeholders including flower farm owners will manually remove the weed from the lake waters starting next month. Konchellah said the lake is very critical to the economy of the country and needs to be conserved. He said that the authority would mobilise funds and personnel to start the clean-up. The clean-up will be done monthly until we get rid of this weed. “We have issued orders for all permanent structures to be demolished and for all eucalyptus trees around the lake to be uprooted,” he said. Konchellah said they are keen on working with Nakuru government to address the challenges facing the lake. The chairman said that they had launched a countrywide survey of all water bodies to make sure that there was no pollution and that they were fully protected. “In Mombasa, we have closed down the dumping site in VOK land and we are keenly monitoring operations around other water bodies in the country,” he said. Nakuru Nema director of environment Solomon Kihiu said that the Karagita landing beach will be demolished. “Apart from bringing down informal structures around the lake, we shall address the issue of pollution by hoteliers and flower farms,” he said. Nema officer in charge of wetlands Stephen Katua identified informal settlements around the lake as the major source of pollution. “We are challenging Nakuru county government to make sure water from their sewerage plants is fully treated before it’s discharged,” he said.
