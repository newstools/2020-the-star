Manchester City’s home Premier League match against West Ham has been rescheduled for February 19. The match was originally scheduled for February 9 but adverse weather conditions, caused by Storm Ciara, forced its postponement. The game will be on the same night as some Champions League last-16 fixtures. It will be City’s first match since the 2-0 defeat at Tottenham on February 2. The Hammers, who will play their first match since their 3-3 draw against Brighton on 1 February, will offer free coach travel to their fans. The rearranged fixture has interrupted both teams’ original scheduled winter break which had been scheduled between February 9 and February 22 — the start of the next full round of Premier League fixtures. Under normal circumstances, playing a Premier League game on the same night as Champions League matches would have been frowned upon by Uefa. It would still prefer it not to happen but the governing body understands that Manchester City are in a tricky position thanks to a problem they had no control over. Once the March international break has passed, there are only two spare midweek slots — and City already need one for their game against Arsenal, postponed after they reached the EFL Cup final. If they progress past Sheffield Wednesday in the FA Cup, Pep Guardiola’s side could have another two games called off, so they can do without using the West Ham game to fill a slot. While City and West Ham are still technically on their winter breaks on February 19, it was felt within reason to ask them to play on that date as both teams return to training this weekend.
