The University of Nairobi Vice Chancellor Stephen Kiama has apologised following a memo that blamed female students for being careless, hence easily raped. Earlier, the acting Director of  Security and Safety Services accused female students of becoming victims of rape and robbery due to their recklessness. The memo dated February 24 noted that from the three rape cases reported female students were to blame. It further advised students to ensure that they are at the social places in the company of trusted friends and to avoid attending social functions without a clear agenda. According to him, students should avoid receiving sweets and opened drinks from strangers. But in a quick rejoinder, Kiama said the memo was insensitive and does not represent the values of the institution. "This is therefore to assure all students of our commitment to protect and take care of them at all times," VC Kiama said. The VC urged students to always contact the Security and Safety Services office whenever they are facing security challenges.
