Former 'Auntie Boss' actress Nyce Wanjeri is dating again after breaking up with her baby daddy a year ago. Nyce broke up with her baby daddy Tito Wagithomo, who alleged that Nyce was an absentee mother and wife to the family. "I started working during the day so I could take care of our daughter because I noticed that most of the time, we were both away," he said in an earlier interview. On the other hand, Nyce alleged that Tito disrespected her, and they couldn’t seek her family’s intervention because he has never visited them. Now, Nyce is dating Leting, a musician from Halisi The Band. The two have been flaunting photos of each other on social media. During Valentine's Day, they posted each other's photo and captioned it, "Happy Valentine's." Speaking to Word Is on Tuesday, Nice confirmed she has moved on. "Yes, I posted and not for likes. I can't post something for controversy. I am not looking for people to like my character, it is something that I posted and it is legit and the whole of Kenya should know that Nyce is dating Calvin Kipkemboi Letin, a Luhya/Kalenjin," she said. She did not share much about how they met, but described Letin as an all-in-one person. "I like so much about him. I love people for who they are and really supportive," she said. Asked whether she communicates with her baby daddy on matters to do with their daughter, Nyce said they don't talk. "I would not want to communicate with him. Let him have his own life as I enjoy my happy moments and I am good to go," she said. "My baby is fine and she has other father figures like my brothers. I have people who are there to mould her life as a father figure." Nyce and Tito had been together for nine years before they broke up.
