Jamaican reggae dancehall recording artist Buju Banton will be in Kenya over the weekend at the KICC. He took to Instagram to announce the news, writing, "Kenya, I can't wait to see you this Saturday, the 15th of Feb at the KICC grounds. Get your Tickets. Get ready for an Experience like no other, I’m coming with my full band, So be ready! Get your tickets today!" The show was initially supposed to go down on New Year’s Eve in Mombasa but was rescheduled to February 8 at the KICC Grounds in Nairobi. Unfortunately, due to the death of former President Daniel Arap Moi, the venue was unavailable for security reasons as a public viewing of the body started on Saturday at Parliament buildings, which is adjacent to KICC.
