 Investments worth billions of shillings and thousands of jobs are at risk of being lost if a plan to close down donkey abattoirs is effected, a Naivasha trader has warned. John Kariuki who owns the Star Brilliant Slaughterhouse in Naivasha said Agriculture CS Peter Munya's order to close down the abattoirs will hurt the economy. He said they were yet to get a formal letter ordering the closure of the facility. “We don’t want to get into this debate as we have not been formally served with any closure letter from the state,” Kariuki said. He dismissed claims the number of donkeys were on the decline, saying there was no evidence. Cases of donkey theft should be dealt with just like cattle rustling, he said. “We have some NGOs who have been inciting people to fight us instead of seeking ways of backing tens of donkey farmers who have immensely benefitted from this trade,” Kariuki said. The trader called for sobriety, saying the sector had the potential of changing the lives of hundreds of farmers. “Cases of donkey theft in Naivasha are long gone and we should be addressing ways of supporting farmers to breed more.”
