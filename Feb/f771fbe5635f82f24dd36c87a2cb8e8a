Twenty-five players have been named in the provisional Harambee Starlets' squad that will feature in the Turkish Women Cup scheduled to run from March 2 -11. The call-up largely features players who did the country proud during the Cecafa Championships last year in which they emerged as champions. Starlets' head coach, David Ouma, widened his scouting net to the Chapa Dimba Na Safaricom tournament, calling up Falling Water’s player Jane Njeri who showed immense skill in leading her team to retain the Central regional title in the tournament. Vihiga Queens forward, Cynthia Shilwatso, will be seeking the defensive mid-field position in the final squad together with Thika Queens Cynthia Kaveya. This comes as a change from Shilwatso’s normal call up position as the centre mid-fielder. Thika Queens player, Rachael Muema has once again received a call-up to the squad. As expected, teenage sensation, Jentrix Shikangwa who won the most promising girls' gong at the Soya awards in Mombasa in January, has also made the cut. Star forward Mwanahalima Adam who is pursuing a move abroad to Sweden has also been included in the preliminary squad. Other countries who will participate in the Turkish Women tournament include Hungary, Venezuela, Hong Kong, Romania, Uzbekistan, Northern Ireland, Turkmenistan and Chile. Ouma is expected to trim the squad to a final list of 21, few days before the team jets out to Turkey on March 2. The final squad comprising of 21 players will be released a few days before the team jets out to Turkey on Monday, March 2. The team is expected to hit camp on February 23 in Nairobi and a local friendly match has been lined up for February 28.
