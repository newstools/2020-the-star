Gospel singer Kasolo and EMB's Weezdom are beefing after they had a bitter exchange of word on social media. The beef started when Kasolo criticised Bahati on the ongoing drama between him and singer Peter Blessing. Kasolo asked Bahati if he was sure about what he has been saying about their differences with Peter Blessing. Weezdom responded by calling him a hypocrite in the gospel industry. "You are misleading Peter Blessing but you don't know how much it has cost Bahati and I for his music to be heard on air," Weezdom wrote. Speaking to Word Is, Kasolo said he was only advising Bahati to solve issues with Peter Blessing away from social media with no bad intentions. "Weezdom called me a fool, a street child and a village boy, and that he does not depend on anyone. But he doesn't know I am a brand and I can only bless him," he said. "He called me a regional singer and that I should respect Nairobi singers. Let him know that I am a well-known singer and I have done songs with great musicians like Rose Muhando, who is even bigger than Bahati. Calling me a street child is so low for him." His message to Bahati is that him being a dad, he should not let his children get a curse because of getting young artistes arrested because of issues they can solve outside court."Bahati should bless Peter and leave other people to support him," he said. Kasolo's message is that he should respect people who stand by themselves. "Tell him to stand by his own so he can prove himself," he said. Asked why he has decided to expose him on Instagram, Kasolo said after Weezdom insulted him, he went ahead to block him on all his phone numbers and even social media platforms. "I know people will pass my message to him," he said. When Word Is reached out to Weezdon, he said he does not want any interview. "Whatever you want to ask me, write it," he said.
