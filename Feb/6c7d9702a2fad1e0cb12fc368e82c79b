Parliament will next week vet the proposed Principal Secretaries and CAS expected to fill positions in the Education ministry. President Uhuru Kenyatta in mid-January made Cabinet changes that altered the ministry leadership. In the changes, Julius Jwan was nominated to take over as the new PS State department of Technical and Vocational Training. Jwan was the director of the Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development until his appointment. If approved, Jwan will take over from Kevit Desai who was moved to Ministry of Industrilisation in the same capacity. The Education Committee in the national assembly, is expected to conduct the vetting exercise on Thursday. Department of University Education will also be ushering in a new PS, Simon Nabukwesi, if it’s approved. The current PS Collete Suda was moved to the Ministry of Gender in the same capacity and was also the CAS. Uhuru’s pick for the position of Chief Administrative Secretary (CAS) for Education Mumina Bonaya and Zack Kinuthia are expected to be among those to be vetted.
