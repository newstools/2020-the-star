Two mobile numbers that were registered a day before the murder of IJM Lawyer Willie Kimani were used to communicate on the day the victims were killed. During cross-examination, Vincent Mabu told the court that on June 23, 2016, the day Willie and two others disappeared, the two lines were used. He said that on that day at 9.16 am there were two transactions on the said lines which were phone calls that lasted about 45 to 46 seconds. The two lines were 0786526465 which was registered under Moses Kariithi and 0786307473 under Charles Nyaberi. According to Mabu, the outgoing call was in Athi River while the incoming call was at Mlolongo. There were other calls to the numbers at 9:23, 9:43 9:55, 10:01, 11:38,11.53 in the morning all on June 23. The defense asked Mabu if there were errors in the retrieving of the data given to the police but Mabu said that there were no errors as the server recorded the transaction. The court also heard that the number 0786 526465 had different IMEI numbers that were used on June 22 and 23 meaning the line was put in two different handsets. On June 22 it used 354590075559000 IMEI and the line was used interchangeably on several handsets because on 23rd there was a different handset “On 23rd at 9.23 am there was another IMEI 357185051061100, At 12.03 there were 2 entries with 2 different transactions,” the court heard. Mabu also said that after midnight on 23 the number 0786526465 used IMEI no 354590075559000 until 24. During re-examination by State Counsel Nicholas Mutuku, Mabu told the court that the locations of the calls varied from Mlolongo Athi River, Mastermind and Oldonyo Sabuk adding that the Location also varied to Mairu inya Mlolongo to Syokimau “What about when a call is made at the same time double calls where transaction share similar time,” Mutuku asked Mabu said it can happen when a number of transactions have received at the exchange server, converts all contents into text and sends to the recording server. In conclusion, Mabu said there were no errors because the calls were different, there were incoming and outgoing and the duration is clearly indicated. Four Administration Police Officers; Fredrick Leliman, Stephen Cheburet, Sylvia Wanjiku, and Leonard Mwangi are charged alongside a police informer Peter Ngugi with the murder of IJM lawyer Willie Kimani, client Josephat Mwenda and taxi driver Joseph Muiruri.
