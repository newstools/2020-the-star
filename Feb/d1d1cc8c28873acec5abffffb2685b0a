 Two Tigania politicians hijacked a requiem mass at St Maximo Catholic in Mikinduri to dress down one another on matters irrelevant for the solemn occasion. It was all about a clash of egos between Tigania East MP Josphat Gichunge and his East African Legislative Assembly counterpart Mpuru Aburi. The two forgot that the reason for their presence at the occasion was to pray for the soul of MCA Petronilla Kiao, who died on February 14. According to Gichunge, it was about protocol. He was given the microphone to speak before Aburi and he was not happy. "I want to ask who between me and Aburi should speak first. I think Aburi should speak first because I am an elected MP and he is nominated. If I should speak then next person should be senator then governor, cabinet secretary, Deputy President, President in that order," he said. He asked the master of ceremony to reverse the order to the chagrin of some mourners. "If we go to the East African Legislative Assembly, Aburi is the boss there. He should speak last but in Tigania East, I should speak last, " he said. Aburi, who is known for his abrasive style of politics, did not disappoint. "We did not come to politick at the burial of the MCA. The MP should not feel threatened if Mikinduri MCA Gabriel Chokera asks about stalled development from Gichunge," he said. He said the MP should provide answers for stalled tarmacking of Kunati-Mikinduri road, Miathene-Mikinduri road, Thanantu- Mulika, Thiiti bridge, all of which he had lobbied for. "I know my way around many offices. If he is unable to do that I am coming for him," Aburi boasted. Gichunge, the only elected PNU MP, trounced Aburi in 2017.
