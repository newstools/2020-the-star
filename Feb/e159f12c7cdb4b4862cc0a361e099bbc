Burnout from work is pushing HIV/Aids counsellors into depression, alcoholism and sex, an expert has said. Linet Okore, a counselling lecturer at Rhaphen Institute said many counsellors are suffering from the burden of clients and patients. Okore called upon the National AIDS and STI's Control Programme (Nascop) to offer therapy for those working directly with patients. She spoke on Monday at the Rhaphen Institute when she opened a three-month training session for counsellors in Migori town. “Previously, Nascop used to carry out routine checks and counselling sessions to caregivers but it ended. We need it to be back,” Okore said. Okore said Nascop should ensure partners and NGOs working on HIV control and care provide better working conditions for staff. “Nascop has managed to streamline counselling in the country with established courses and set standards. The same should be included by stakeholders before they roll out programmes,” she said. The lecturer said many organisations leave their caregivers on their own at the end of their programme, action which has caused more harm in society. (edited by O. Owino)
