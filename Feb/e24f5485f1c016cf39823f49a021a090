ODM leader Raila Odinga on Saturday donned a shirt that left some Kenyans salivating. The uniquely-designed green, white and orange patterned shirt was paired with navy blue trousers and black shoes. Posing for a picture before going to the Mt Kenya rally at Kimoru Stadium in Meru, Raila was pictured with his son Raila Junior, who wore a pattered shirt and black trousers. Kenyans on Twitter praised Raila's dressing. "Our 2022 President. Pamoja Baba," @Henryma48216367 wrote. @GaiusWillzÂ  posted, "Very smart indeed." All is set for the Mt Kenya region rally after Raila met the region's leaders. The governors drawn from counties in the region met with Raila at his office in Capitol Hill, Nairobi, to brief him on the arrangements ahead of the February 29 rally. Nyandarua Governor Francis Kimemia said the rally will focus on the economic issues as well as political.
