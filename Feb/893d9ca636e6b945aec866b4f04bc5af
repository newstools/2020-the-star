A jilted man who knocked off a vegetable vendor’s teeth after he found him “seducing” a woman he was eyeing is facing charges of causing grievous harm. Jackson Gichu a casual labourer was charged before a Makadara law court with causing serious injuries to Calvin Mukhwana at a bar in Donholm, Nairobi on November 30 last year. Mukhwana had gone to the bar to unwind while taking drinks before going home where he found a woman seated alone and he decided to sit next to her. The woman was watching Liverpool vs Chelsea match and Mukhwana suggested they watch a different one since there were no Chelsea fans in the pub at the time. A conversation continued between the two before Gichu walked in, grabbed Mukhwana and started assaulting him. He was joined by another man who is still on the run. Gichu is said to have punched Mukhwana and removed one of his upper teeth before patrons intervened and rescued the complainant. On Friday, the suspect denied the charges before Makadara law courts senior principal magistrate Angelo Kithinji. He was released on a Sh200, 000 bond with an alternative cash bail of Sh100, 000. The case will be heard from May 25.
