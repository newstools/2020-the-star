Suspected al Shabaab militants on Wednesday night torched houses and shops In Ijara, 300km from Garissa town. The militants went to houses asking to be showed where government agents were living. In January, Interior CS Fred Matiangi recruited Kenya Police Reservists in the area to help them fight the militants. A source close to the Star said the militants went searching for the agents moving from one house to another. "They get into your house and ask you where the agents live. If you don't tell them, they burn your house," the source said. During his meeting, the CS  tasked the National Government Administrative Officers to step up engagement with the local leaders and leverage on cooperation and information-sharing with civilians to effectively counter radicalisation and terrorist propaganda. “The President expects us to be working from the ground, and not issuing orders from Nairobi. We’re going to conduct regular visitors. Don’t be scared to report terrorist operatives, radicalisers and recruiters. The government will protect you,” he said.
