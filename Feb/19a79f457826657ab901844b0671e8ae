Makueni county government has issued a quarantine notice on livestock and their products following an outbreak of foot and mouth and lumpy skin diseases. According to a letter seen by the Star and signed by Fisheries and Livestock director Daniel Kisee, the move restricts the movement of cattle, sheep, goats and transportation of their products. "No cattle, sheep goat or their products shall be moved from or into such area without the written permission from the county," the letter dated February 14 reads. The notice also requires all livestock to be herded as far as possible from public roads. Animals dying from the disease should be buried not less than four feet deep. Speaking to the Star on the Phone on Saturday, Dr Kisee said the move is expected to affect all markets within the devolved zone and its neighbourhood. "We have not received any reports of dead animals from the decease but the move is intended to manage reported cases from some sports such as Kathonzweni, Kalawa, Kikumbulyu and others areas within the county." He said the quarantine will be lifted once the situation is contained. Edited by R.Wamochie
