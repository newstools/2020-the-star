A hotel in Tenerife in Spain's Canary Islands has been locked down after a visiting Italian doctor tested positive for coronavirus. Hundreds of guests at the H10 Costa Adeje Palace Hotel were initially told to stay in their rooms as medical tests were carried out, Spanish media report. The doctor is reportedly from the Lombardy region, where Italian authorities are battling an outbreak. Global cases of the virus have passed 80,000, the vast majority in China. Iran, one of the worst-affected nations outside China, on Tuesday said its deputy health minister, Iraj Harirchi, had tested positive for the virus. The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Monday the world should do more to prepare for a possible pandemicÂ - a situation where an infectious disease spreads easily between people in many countries. The proportion of infected people who die appears to be between 1% and 2%, although the WHO cautions that the precise mortality rate is not known yet. What's the latest from the hotel in Tenerife? Agence France-Presse quoted a health authority spokeswoman, Veronica Martin, as saying that guests at the four-star hotel in the south-west of the island were being monitored for "health reasons and the degree of supervision will be assessed during the day, but so far, we're not talking about quarantine". One guest posted on Facebook an image of a note put under the door of their room on Tuesday saying: "We regret to inform you that for health reasons, the hotel has been closed down. Until the sanitary authorities warn, you must remain in your rooms."
