The Embassy of China has noted that flights into the country will be reduced to once a week until 25th March 2020. The move comes after Kenyans raised alarm after a video went viral of a China Southern Airlines airplane touching down on Wednesday with 239 passengers on board. In a statement released on Wednesday, the Embassy said that the airlines has notified the Ministry of Health in advance and all passengers on board have been screened and cleared. "The Embassy has also sent officials to the airport for assistance and before the arrival of flight the Embassy has reminded all Chinese companies and diaspora groups in Kenya again of the 14-day self-quarantine requirements," the statement read. Chinese nationals entering Kenya have been asked to cooperate with the Ministry of Health and strictly isolate themselves for 14 days. "For those Chinese nationals in quarantine, we have provided their information to the Ministry of Health for monitoring and requested the Chinese companies and diaspora groups to provide necessary volunteer service.' The step taken by the government to allow China Southern flights to land at the JKIA has caused an uproar among Kenyans. So far, 17 suspect cases have been recorded in the country and all have tested negative.
