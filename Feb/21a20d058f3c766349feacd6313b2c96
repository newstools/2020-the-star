The Vihiga government is installing floodlights as part of its efforts to fight crime. The Sh30 million project is sponsored by the World Bank and is already 50 per cent done with areas such as Shamakhokho, Mago, Gambogi, Wangoya, Ekwanda, Emanyinya, Emuhaya, Kilingili markets, Luanda town and Hamisi Stadium covered. While commissioning the project, Governor Wilber Ottichillo said they are keen to ensure residents are safe. The county has suffered a spate of crimes, including murders, defilements, rape and robberies. Early last year, five watchmen were massacred by armed robbers in Kilingili market. Another attack occurred in Chavakali town, leaving one guard dead while another succumbed to his injuries while receiving medication towards the end of last year. "These floodlight masts within our market centres across the county will help us create more time for business community as we enhance our 24-hour economy within Vihiga," he said. "We want to create an environment conducive to business by ensuring everyone is safe at all time. Vihiga is among the top five counties leading in defilements." The governor spoke when Interior CS Fred Matiang'i, regional coordinator Ann Ngetich and the county security team toured Vihiga. Ottichillo warned residents against falling victim to conmen asking for levies over the floodlights. He said his administration will cover the expenses. The county will engage Kenya Power Mbale branch. "We are already in talks with Kenya Power so we set up street lights from Maseno all the way to Ebuyangu as a way of reducing insecurity within Vihiga towns," Ottichillo added. Traders welcomed the project, saying they have suffered heavy losses as a result of insecurity.
