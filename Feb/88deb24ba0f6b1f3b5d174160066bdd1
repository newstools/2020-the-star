World U-18 400m silver medallist and Africa Under-20 champion Mary Moraa is eyeing a double at World U-20 Championships set for July at Moi Stadium, Kasarani in Nairobi. Moraa revealed she intends to run her 400m specialty and 800m. “This is my last time to run in the age-grade category. I have already qualified in 400m and will seek to meet qualifying time in 800m then discuss with the team management if it’s possible to compete in both events,” said Moraa. Moraa is remembered for shaking off men’s challenge in the 4x400m mixed relay during the World U-18 Championships in 2017. “I have been toying with the idea of moving to 800m for the last two years. I think I’m now ready because I have been training for it,” said Moraa. She added that she wants to represent the country in 800m during the Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan. She has been training at the Kenya Police Training camp in Ngong but intends to move her base soon. Yesterday, the 19-year-old speedster was coy on whether she will make her 800m bow in Eldoret during the first Athletics Kenya track and field weekend meet at the University of Eldoret on Saturday and Sunday. “Let’s wait and see. I’m still weighing my options but I will definitely be in Eldoret where I want to start my season on a high,” said the former Mogonga PAG High School student. I’m looking forward to a busy and fruitful year. In 2017, I narrowly missed a gold medal at Kasarani. This time, I want to sign off with the gold,” concluded Moraa. Last week, she represented Keroka Technical Institute during Western region athletics championships at Gusii Stadium where she won three gold medals in 800m, 100m and 4x100m. At the same time, national secondary schools’ 100m champion Beatrice Anyango has intensified her training ahead of the World U- 20 trials. Speaking at her Moi Stadium in Kisumu training base, Anyango said she will be in action in Eldoret during the weekend meeting where she will compete in 100 and 200m.
