A nurses association on Friday urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to ensure self-quarantine is supervised by professionals. The National Nurses Association of Kenya said telling people to quarantine themselves without supervision will not help. He said nurses are deeply worried as they do not have the necessary protective gear to manage the disease should it break out in the country. "Nurses are the people that will be handling patients, so it is important that we are trained and given the necessary protective gear," president Alfred Obengo said. Obengo spoke during a press briefing on coronavirus at the Nurses Complex in KNH Grounds. They told the government to refrain from statements that make the public feel more vulnerable. The nurses said time is ripe for the government and Kenyans to stand united and protect one another against the deadly virus. They also requested the Health ministry to ensure medical workers have enough protective equipment. "Nurses will be working long stressful shifts and their mental wellbeing is extremely important, hence they should be provided with the highest care possible,‚Äù Obengo said. Giving precautions, the union urged Kenyans to strictly continue following the prevention and control measures provided by the ministry. "We commend nurses in Kenya and internationally. As a union, we are ready to partner with the government to educate the public on preventative measures," Obengo added.
