For the first time in years, artistes who receive royalties will have to pay withholding tax on the total amount of royalties they will receive. This came out after the Music Copyright Society of Kenya sent out a message to all its members, asking them to send details to documentation@mcsk.or.ke and other details. The organisation says following the use of the new transparent electronic systems to calculate the royalties payout, the highest beneficiary will receive Sh400,000. Speaking during a press conference yesterday, Milcah Kulati said the organisation is determined to help artistes get their money effectively; to make music a better employer, unlike other years. The MCSK says a new system was used in calculating the amount due to each artist. "We are now using scientific distribution, which means every artiste will get paid according to the airplay they get," Milcah said. She urged musicians to declare their music every time they release a song so they can be monitored. "Other musicians have good music but have not registered with MCSK. If we pay people scientifically, that will make other artistes to even work harder and bring in music that will be more entertaining," she said. Sauti Sol is the top earner. Others are Nyashinski, Christina Shusho, Mercy Masika, Eunice Njeri and Nameless. "Sauti Sol is our highest paid because many people want to listen to their music. We want people to challenge them," Milcah said. "We have 60 per cent of the money that will go to the scientific distribution and 40 per cent will go to general distribution." To the president, Milcah says they are grateful for the support he has shown the musicians and MCSK at large. "I want President Uhuru Kenyatta to know that we will move together with his dreams as he moves together with artistes," she said. Edited by T Jalio
