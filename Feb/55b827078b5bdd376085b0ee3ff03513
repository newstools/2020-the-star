Is there anyone who helps suspects cloth decently before appearing in court? The Star has observed that some suspects appear in court half-naked. On Friday, a suspect appeared at a Nairobi court with his pink innerwear exposed. The suspect also appeared in an old belt but looked jovial as the assault charges were read to him. On the other hand, however, we notice that VIP suspects normally come to court well dressed in suit and ties a day after their arrest. A Nairobi magistrate said some suspects were using witness statements as tissue papers."Wengine tunawapea witness statements but wanatumia kwa choo kama toilet papers au handkerchief," she said. A man charged with defiling a minor appeared in Kibera while seriously bleeding. He then told the magistrate that he was not sick and was ready to take it in. "Mimi si mgonjwa please tuendelee na kesi, (I' am seriously nose bleeding as you can see but am ready to proceed with the case)" he said while holding a bloodied handkerchief. The magistrate, however, said that it was difficult for the case to proceed as he wanted. A magistrate at a Nairobi court was forced to intervene and teach a court clerk on how to read the charge sheet. This happened after the clerk took too long to read the individual charges.
