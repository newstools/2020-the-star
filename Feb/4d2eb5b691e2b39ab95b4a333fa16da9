Treasury CS Ukur Yatani has asked the business community to incorporate the three reports of the 2019 census released on Friday in their business strategies. Yatani said details in the reports will enable investors to make informed decisions when executing business plans. “With the information, one can make targeted marketing as information about who is where and how many they are,” he stated. One report enumerated the population for each administrative unit by sex, number of households, land area and density. The other one presented the distribution of the enumerated population by single year and five-year age groups, sex and administrative units. The other one presented the distribution of the enumerated population by social-economic characteristics. Kenya National Bureau of Statistics director general Zachary Mwangi, while releasing the data at Treasury Building, said the reports will be disseminated at the regional level to reach a wider audience. “One more census basic report, namely the Volume Five on the distribution of the population by geopolitical units will be released soon,” he said. Mwangi added that KNBS has embarked on the production of 20 in-depth analytical reports which will be ready within the next six months. The total enumerated population increased to 47, 564, 296 in 2019 from 37, 724, 850 in 2009. There were 23, 548, 056 males, 24, 014, 716 females and 1,524 intersex in 2019 compared to 18,674,184 males and 19, 050, 666 females in 2009. Intersexes were not counted in 2009. Mwangi said KNBS will remain committed to the production and management of quality official statistics to keep Kenyans informed.
