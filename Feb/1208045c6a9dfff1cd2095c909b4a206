 The death toll of lynch m0b victims in Matuu, Yatta sub-location, rose to three in two weeks on Monday after a suspected thief was stoned to death. The man is said to have been a member of a gang that has been harassing residents. He was cornered along the Kitui-Garissa road as he fled the town, Yatta sub-county police commander Joseph Karanja said. "The locals got worked up when they saw him. He was notorious for stealing. That's why they killed him," Karanja said and at the same time cautioned the public against taking the law in their hands. On Saturday, a man suffered the same fate for allegedly murdering a local businessman.
