A woman and her 11-month-old baby are nursing serious injuries at Coast General Hospital after they were attacked by armed robbers on Sunday night. Police say the two were attacked at 9:30pm a few metres to their home. Kisauni subcounty police commander Julius Kirago said they were attacked by three armed robbers at Hongera near Soko Mjinga in Kisauni and robbed an undisclosed amount of money. "The woman was shot in the stomach and the same ammunition hit her child's leg. They were rushed to Coast General Hospital where they are receiving treatment," Kirago said. The woman was headed home from her M-Pesa shop, where she works. Kirago said the three suspects escaped on a motorcycle, after stealing the victim's handbag which had some cash. No suspect has been arrested yet. Late January armed robbers shot dead a Kenya Ports Authority accountant and stole Sh1.5 million at the Dock Workers Union office gate at Makupa, Makuli Fagia area. Samwel Kinanga was shot in the stomach and died as he was being taken to hospital. His colleague was shot in the leg. They had withdrawn money at Barclay's Bank along Nkrumah Road and they were going to pay employees.
