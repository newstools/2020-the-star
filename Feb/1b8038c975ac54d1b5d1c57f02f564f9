As the Building Bridges Initiative Steering Committee, we are ready to collect feedback from the public about our report which was unveiled by President Uhuru Kenyatta and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga. We are happy that various groups are going on with the process of popularising the report among Kenyans. Our focus is to receive as many views from Kenyans as possible so that they can inform our final report. We shall continue to offer technical support to the groups seeking our help without any bias so that we can give as many Kenyans as possible an opportunity to have their issues captured. We have been available to all groups planning BBI engagement forums across the country by sending our resource persons to guide the engagement process so that it is within the acceptable standards. During the engagement forums we have had in Kisii, Kakamega and Mombasa, we have taken up views of Kenyans. We will be in Kitui on Saturday and we have also received an invitation to Wote. As you know our work involves guiding participants of the delegates meetings to ensure that the process of collecting the views is credible and acceptable to the final product submitted to the committee. I need to emphasise that our technical experts do not participate in actual rallies on behalf of the BBI task force unless invited to pick resolutions in public. In cases where we have been invited to collect the resolutions during the rallies like in Kisii, Mombasa and Kakamega we have done so. We are not part of the public rallies you are witnessing. Our work ends in the delegates meetings which we attend and engage the participants by taking them through our report. We are aware that there are people who would have different viewpoints. We are going to have different forums for those with different viewpoints and who would want to oppose the proposals to also present their views. We shall accommodate all views from Kenyans. Paul Mwangi is the co-chair of the BBI Task Force
