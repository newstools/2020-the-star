Singer Akothee, who came to Lady Maureen’s rescue when she was seriously ill and took her to Jaramogi Oginga Teaching and Referral Hospital, has spoken out after she was rejected by her family. The mother of five has now called upon her followers to contribute towards the ‘Save Lady Maureen’ kitty. "Support a woman and save the village. We are doing this as #teamakothee. Action is better than a pity party," she said. She also pointed out the reason that she didn’t give her land is because they aren’t related and thus no one would be there to take care of her. "She is safe with her relatives," she said. The Ohangla maestro was discharged on February 20 but had nowhere to go to after her family refused to take her in. Nancy Achieng, a good Samaritan who took the 'Wagni Wabiro' hitmaker to her house, told NTV her family doesn’t want anything to do with her. "I talked to the mother and she said I shouldn't take her to her place," she said. Akothee says Maureen’s uncle had offered her a parcel of land after her mother and other family members disowned her. "I had communication with Maureen’s family and she is at her uncle’s place, who has accepted to give her a piece of land to build a home for herself," she posted on Instagram. "My mother will be going to Pap Onditi in Nyakack on our behalf."
