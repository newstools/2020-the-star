Kiambu MPs allied to Deputy President William Ruto ignored the BBI meeting held in Limuru on Wednesday. MPs Kimani Ichung’wa (Kikuyu), Githua Wamacukuru (Kabete), Gabriel Kago (Githunguri), Wanjiku Kibe (Gatundu North), Moses Kuria (Gatundu South), Patrick Muiruri (Thika), Jonah Mburu (Lari), Francis Waititu (Juja) and Ng’ang’a King’ara (Ruiru) did not attend. It was not clear why the MPs did not attend. Stakeholders from the county were meeting at Jumuia Conference and Country Home in Kabuku. They were led by Governor James Nyoro. Nyoro said the resolution made during the meeting would be combined with those from other regions in Central and forwarded to officials at Kinoru Stadium on Saturday during the BBI rally Those present said the BBI was not about who succeeded President Uhuru Kenyatta or about the 2022 General Elections. Limuru MP Peter Mwathi urged residents to accept the BBI if it focuses on changing the laws of representation since some counties have more people than others. “In Limuru, the population is over 100,000, and there are other constituencies with about 20,000 people, but the NG-CDF allocation is the same. When we issue bursary, we give Sh3,000 per student but constituencies with fewer residents give  more than Sh40,000 per student,” he said. “This is why we keep campaigning for “one man, one shilling, one vote”, because we want the representation addressed,” he said. Those present included Nyoro, Kiambu MP Jude Njomo, Kiambu Woman Representative Gathoni Wamuchomba, nominated Senator Isaac Mwaura, Deputy Governor nominee Joyce Ngugi and Kiambu Kanu chairman David Mbiu. Njomo asked leaders for sobriety, urging them to approach the BBI issues with caution and use a language that shows respect to wananchi. Senator Mwaura urged delegates to concentrate on the benefits of the BBI document, saying residents will realise its importance when issues of governance and country management change.
