Willis Raburu says he and his wife are hoping to work on their relationship with God. The couple was left devastated and speaking for the first time after losing their baby, Adana on December 31. During a Q&A with his followers on Instagram, a fan asked Raburu if they were still angry with God and he responded that they are seeking to make amends. Earlier on, Marya questioned why God took their angel. "Everyone is so quick to tell me about God. What they don’t know is that every way I knew Him, He was tested and He didn’t prove Himself," she wrote. "So, as they say, you should know God for yourself. I now can say, I don’t know Him. And I don’t think I want to know him coz He left me when I needed him the most."
