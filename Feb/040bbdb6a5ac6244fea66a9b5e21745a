Yesterday was World Radio Day. Presenters around the country celebrated the day differently. Classic 105 presenter Maina Kageni paid homage to pioneers in the industry. He thanked Kenyans for "making this gig so much fun"."Ahsanteni! There would be no radio without you," he said. "Fundamentally there is is no difference in today's radio. I can't say that today was better than yesterday... I did not think I would be a radio presenter but I found Leonard Mambo very engaging in his show." The theme of World Radio Day 2020 is 'Radio and Diversity'. The theme centres around diversity and plurilingualism (ability to switch between multiple languages depending on the situation, for ease of communication). It is a significant medium to celebrate humanity in the entirety of its diversity and gives a platform for democratic discourse. Gukena FM's Kajim said, "Radio is the easiest way to get information around the world. Even when there is tension in a country, it can neutralise it. Let us continue using radio as an entertaining, educating and informing tool," she said. Radio Jambo's Massawe Japanni said, "Let's continue having fun and being real." Back in the days, radio was ruled by voices such as Jeff Mwangemi, John Karani Elizabeth Omollo, Cess Mutungi and Muthoni Bwika. Those whose contribution is legendary include Cess Mutungi, Elizabeth Omollo, Nzau Kalulu, John Obongo Junior, Larry Wambua and Agao Patrobers, who died in 2019 aged 69. Others are Hadija Ali, Kajuju Kaburia, Caroline Mutoko and Nyambane, Waweru Mburu (died in 2016), Bonnie Msambi, DJ Israel, Mohamed Juma Njuguna (sports) and Ciku Muiruri, who hosted the popular 'Busted' show on Classic 105. Still others are Mambo Mbotela, Edward Kadilo, Tony Msalame, Muthoni Bwika and Jeff Muiya.
