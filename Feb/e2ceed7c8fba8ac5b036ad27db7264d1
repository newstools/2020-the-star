The High Court has directed the cabinet secretaries of Health, Transport and Foreign Affairs to trace all the passengers who boarded the China Southern flight. Justice James Makau gave the orders on Friday following two cases filed in the court concerning the coronavirus. The judge said the passengers will be confined and quarantined in a Kenya Defence Forces facility until they are duly certified to be free from the COVID-19. All the cases will be heard together on March 3. The judge also suspended all the flights from China landing into the country as well as passengers arriving through the sea into the country from coronavirus-hit countries. The Law Society of Kenya had filed the case on Thursday, seeking to suspend the decision by the state in allowing further non-essential flights from China to Kenya due to the coronavirus disease. Also sought is an order compelling Health CS Sicily Kariuki to prepare and present to the court for scrutiny a public health emergency contingency plan to control, prevent and manage any outbreak or spread of the disease in Kenya. The move comes after the revelation thatÂ Kenya has only 11 isolation beds ready to be used in case of a coronavirus outbreak. Health Chief Administrative Secretary Dr Rashid Aman said they have also identified an open ward with 120 beds at Mbagathi County Hospital in Nairobi but will need a month to prepare it.
