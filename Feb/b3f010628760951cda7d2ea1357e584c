President Uhuru Kenyatta has been appointed as chairman of the African Leaders Malaria Alliance (ALMA). Uhuru will lead the alliance for the next two years, taking over from King Mswati of Eswatini. In accepting the new role, Uhuru said he is committed to the objective of ending malaria on the African continent. “I am pleased to take over this role as ALMA Chair. Significant gains have been made in the battle against malaria, but progress has slowed in recent years,' Uhuru said. He added that  "As we enter the decade to end malaria, I am committed to ensuring that we accelerate progress and end this disease once and for all". ALMA is a coalition of African Heads of State and Government advancing advocacy efforts, resource mobilization and accountability in the fight against malaria across Africa. The President did not attend the AU summit that took place in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia following the death of former President Daniel Moi. In his statement, the president said improved health is at the centre of Africa’s development agenda and is part of the African Union's Agenda 2063. Africa accounts for 93 per cent of global malaria cases and 94 per cent of all malaria deaths. Out of this, ten countries on the continent account for 67 per cent of all malaria cases and 62 per cent of all deaths. Amira el-Fadil, Commissioner for Social Affairs for the African Union Commission welcomed President Kenyatta in his new role as chair of the leaders' alliance. “Ending malaria on the African continent is a key priority outlined in the Catalytic Framework to End HIV, TB and Eliminate Malaria and we are committed to achieving this goal. "I welcome His Excellency President Uhuru Kenyatta as the new Chair of ALMA and look forward to working with him to end this terrible disease,” Amira el-Fadil said.
