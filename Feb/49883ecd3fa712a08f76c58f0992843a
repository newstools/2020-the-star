 Msambweni residents in Kwale are bitter with an Australian mineral extractor which they say is exploitative and perpetrates land injustice. They say there are unresolved land matters yet Base Titanium continues to exploit their wealth. The villagers from Magaoni, Zigira, Masindeni, Majikuko, Fioni and Madongoni claim they were poorly compensated and their rights undermined during the first phase of the company's activities in Maumba and Nguluku. Their secretary, Mwalinyenze Hamisi, said the relocation of displaced residents remains unaddressed, adding that Base Titanium lures them with substandard projects that only benefit a few individuals. Another touchy issue is royalties. Amina Bakari said they do not know who the beneficiaries are. They pointed an accusing finger at politicians. Area MP Suleiman Dori the residents to weigh the benefits they have enjoyed since Base Titanium started work in Kwale. Land activist and Masindeni resident Charles Bilali faulted politicians for allegedly allowing investors to play with the locals' lives and asked President Uhuru Kenyatta to intervene. Base Titanium, through its community liaison manager Pius Kassim, denied being involved in the resettlement of residents. "We approach the communities and if they agree we do the work," he said.
