More needs to be done to boost local production and in turn drive up the country’s economy, manufacturers have said. Although significant progress has been made over the past years through the war against counterfeits, tax regulations and reduction of non-tariff barriers, Kenya Association of Manufacturers CEO Phyllis Wakiaga says there are still a number of challenges that need to be dealt with to realize the sector’s full potential. “As we made gains, other challenges including increased cost of doing business and unpredictable policy environment have negatively impacted the sector’s competitiveness,” she said. This has in turn largely scaled down operations with multiple firms in the country closing shop, laying off staff and issuing profit warnings. Manufacturing contribution to the GDP has been on a declining trend from 11.8 per cent to 8.4 per cent last year. A pillar under the Big Four Agenda, the sector aims to grow its contribution to 15 per cent by 2022. This means it should grow at almost 36 per cent compounded annual growth. Manufacturers want the government to put progressive policies put in place to support the pillar under President Uhuru Kenyatta’s Big Four Agenda if. “To transform Kenya into a competitive industrial hub, we must implement effective strategies to drive the growth of local industries whilst encouraging new investments,” KAM chairman Sachen Gudka said.
