Meru Governor Kiraitu Murungi on Tuesday led Meru leaders in mourning retired  President Daniel Moi. He said the former president had once reached out to him, enticing him with a seat in the Judiciary to leave the clamour for democratic space in the country. Kiraitu said the retired president sent the late former Cabinet Minister Nicholas Biwott to try and persuade him from opposition politics. “Biwott knew a lot of people around South Imenti, including my father. They talked with Moi and decided to appoint me a judge of the High Court so that I could stop opposing him in Parliament. I refused,” Kiraitu said. Biwott served as a district officer in South Imenti in 1965 and became well-known to many residents, including Kiraitu's father. Yesterday, the county chief said Moi had many friends in Meru that included the Njuri Ncheke. “Moi steered the country during turbulent times when many neighbouring countries faced civil war and general instability but he ensured the country was peaceful during his tenure as President,” Kiraitu said. The governor said that as Young Turks, they criticised Moi for many things that include one-party dictatorship and mismanagement of the economy. But through his philosophy of peace, love and unity Moi tried to keep the country together, a dream we are still pursuing through Building Bridges Initiative, he said. “To my friend, Senator Gideon Moi, with whom I served in the National Assembly and Senate for 10 years and the entire family, please accept our deepest sympathy,” Kiraitu said. He said he got to know Moi personally after he retired as President While serving as Cabinet Minister for Justice and Constitutional Affairs, Kiraitu said, he came to understand the internal difficulties Moi faced. “I invited Moi in a harambee for us at Nkuene Girls Secondary School. He came and gave Sh1 million. There were jokes in media that I was going to learn some lessons from the professor of politics,” he said.
