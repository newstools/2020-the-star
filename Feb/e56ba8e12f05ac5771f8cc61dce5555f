The Law Society of Kenya has petitioned the High court seeking to suspend the decision by the state in allowing further non-essential flights from China to Kenya due to the coronavirus disease. Also sought is an order compelling Health CS Sicily Kariuki to prepare and present to the court for scrutiny a public health emergency contingency plan to control, prevent and manage any outbreak or spread of the disease in Kenya. The move comes after the revelation that Kenya has only 11 isolation beds ready to be used in case of a coronavirus outbreak. Health Chief Administrative Secretary Dr Rashid Aman said they have also identified an open ward with 120 beds at Mbagathi County Hospital in Nairobi but will need a month to prepare it. "The beds are there but we need to do more work to make it an isolation ward.  Within one month the facility at Mbagathi should be up," he said at a press conference at Afya House on Thursday. The ministry spoke on the day Kenyans including MPs and Senators demanded that the government stop all flights from China. Although no Kenyan has tested positive, globally, more than 80,000 people in about 40 countries have been infected with the new coronavirus, which emerged in December. The vast majority remain in China. Covid-19, the respiratory disease caused by the virus, has killed more than 2,700 people so far. Last week, Treasury Principal Secretary Julius Muia said the Ministry of Health had asked for Sh1.8 billion to renovate the Mbagathi ward. The money has not been approved yet.
