Police in Embu are investigating an incident where a video man was attacked by a group of women for allegedly touching minor girls indecently. Embu North Sub-county Police Commander Geoffrey Muliro said the video shooting businessman Lolland Kivuti was rescued by police officers as the women bayed for his blood. Preliminary reports indicate that the outraged women stormed Kivuti’s premises at Kianjokoma and descended on him with blows and other manner of objects before attempting to lynch him. The police report further indicates Kivuti, who is being held at the Manyatta Police Station for his safety was accused of caressing the private parts of two seven-year-old girls. Some of the women entered the shop and started throwing Kivuti’s property outside before setting them on fire. “We were informed of the incident and we moved to the scene swiftly and rescued the victim,” Muliro said. He added, “The victim is being held at our station for his security as our officers launch investigations into the matter”. Muliro said the women reacted after the two girls complained of pain in their private parts. It is not yet clear on when the incident happened but the women we spoke to said Kivuti had been spotted on Saturday touching the girls. “He is so notorious, several girls have reported him, we have raised the matter with the police but nothing happens. This is why as women we decided to act by ourselves,” one of the women said. While warning the members of the public against taking the law into their hands, Muliro said stern measures will be taken on anybody who will be found culpable.
