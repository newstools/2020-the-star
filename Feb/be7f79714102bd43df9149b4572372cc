The coaching merry go round at Nouveau riche Kenyan Premier  League side Wazito continued when the club revealed that former head coach Fred Ambani who was sacked at the start of the season alongside then technical  director Stanley Okumbi have made a return to the club. Ambani  has been handed the assistant coach role in the dugout, deputising Stuart Hall and Frank Ouna. Also rejoining the club is former goalkeeper trainer Elly Otieno. "We can confirm that coach Fred Ambani and Elias Otieno have returned to the club as a first-team assistant coach and goalkeepers’ trainer respectively. Ambani led the team back to the Kenyan Premier League last season as head coach before exiting in October. He now returns to the team and will deputise head coach Stuart Hall," read a club statement. Otieno was part of the bench that led the team back to KPL last season. He will be tasked with sharpening the goalkeepers once again. “I want to welcome Ambani and Otieno back to the team. I urge them to give their best for the betterment and success of the team,” CEO Dennis Gicheru said. The two take up their new roles with immediate effect. They will be on the bench for Saturday's KPL clash with Western Stima  in Narok.
