Strathmore Leos are unfazed by facing Kenya Cup champions KCB in the Enterprise pre-quarterfinal tomorrow. The varsity outfit is on course to gain promotion back to the Kenya cup as they are unbeaten in the championship and lead the log with 61 points—seven clear of second-placed Masinde Muliro University of Science and Technology. Kisia  has termed the match against the bankers an ideal test. “It will be an indicator of where we have reached so far and they will be good opponents to test our progress,” added Kisia.  The Mwamba player and tactician said he will make changes to his squad  ahead of the bankers duel. “I will mix up the squad with some of the fringe players being given a chance to prove themselves,” added Kisia. He noted that his charges will have to match KCB's physicality and strength in the forwards if they are to be competitive in the contest. “We know KCB's strengths and we must negate and take our chances once we create them,” he added. The winner of the tie will set up a quarterfinal date against either Western Bulls or Blak Blad next month. Champions Kabras face Menengai Oilers at the Kakamega show ground.
