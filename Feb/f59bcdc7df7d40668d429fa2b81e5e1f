The East African Business Council (EABC) has joined Kenyans, the region and Africa in mourning the passing of former President Daniel Moi. In a statement on Tuesday, EABC chairman, board, and management conveyed “deepest sympathy to the President, people of the Republic of Kenya, family and friends”, on the passing away of the former President. “Words cannot express enough this tragic loss of the second President of the Republic of Kenya, a great Pan Africanist and a visionary leader,” EABC said in a statement. The former president who passed away on Tuesday morning is remembered as one of the key founding fathers of the revival of the East African Community(EAC). He spearheaded the Agreement for the Establishment of the Permanent Tripartite Commission for East African Co-operation in 1993, leading to the re-birth of the EAC regional integration process. “His vision, commitment, and dedication to embedding the private sector as the engine for economic growth is evident in Chapter 25, Article 127, 128 and 129 of the Treaty for the Establishment of the East African Community,” EABC notes. This is on partner states' responsibilities towards enabling the private sector to thrive. “His passing is a great loss to the people of East Africa and the business community in the region,” EABC executive director and CEO Peter Mathuki said. “He remains strong in our hearts and it's our duty to keep his vision of a borderless East Africa alive, for the economic growth and prosperity of our beloved East African Community,” Mathuki added. “The East African Business Council stands in solidarity with the family and all East Africans and Kenyans in particular during this difficult moment as we celebrate and remember many achievements associated with Moi.”
