Papa Dennis will be buried today at Matunda in Kakamega county. Celebrities paid tribute to the 'Foundation' hitmaker, with many praising his hard work. Among those who attended the memorial service was Vivianne, known for hits such as 'Chum Chum' and 'Feel Me'. Speaking to Word Is, Vivianne described Papa as a soft-spoken artiste. "Papa Dennis and I used to be in the main studio, Main Switch, and that is where we connected," she said. "He was a soft-spoken person. He was the kind of artiste you would find in the studio and you wouldn’t know he was a celeb. Hakua na kihere here. We just want to pay our last respects." She said she will keep in touch with Papa Dennis' brother to see how they can be of help to him now that he has lost a brother. "I wanted to have a conversation with him but did not manage to, but I have taken his number. We will do a follow-up. People have contributed and he will have some kidogo cash to push him through in the meantime," Vivianne said. Asked whether Kenyan music pays, Vivianne was quick to point out it does, but only when you play smart. "It’s about you understanding the business and putting in the hard work. I know for a fact that it is possible to make money because there are more avenues than there were before. You can live a decent and comfortable life," she said. Papa Dennis died on February 8 after he allegedly jumped from Kirima Building. His twin brother Simon Mwangi sang one of Papa's songs as a tribute to him.
