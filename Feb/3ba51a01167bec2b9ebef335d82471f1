Family, friends and social justice defenders assembled on Saturday at Dandora Social Justice Centre to mark one year since rights activist Caroline Mwatha's mysterious death. The emotional event turned out a celebration of a soul that was selfless, loving and supportive of many helpless citizens whose justice was turned down. Speaking during the ceremony, human rights defender Francis Munyoki said, "We will not stop and if they kill us, our children will continue with the struggle. This is a message to them. They will not stop us. Keep resting, Caro, we will not rest until you get justice." The ceremony was used to fundraise school fees for Caroline's son and daughter. It was also used as a platform to sensitise the public on the need for more numbers to join in the campaign for social justice in society.
