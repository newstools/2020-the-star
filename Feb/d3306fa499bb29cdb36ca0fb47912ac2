Senate Majority leader Kipchumba Murkomen has asked politicians to emulate president Daniel Moi and forge together to unite the country. Moi died aged 95 at The Nairobi Hospital On February 4, 2020. Speaking at Moi's Kabarnet home Nairobi, Murkomen said the political class of today owe the nation a lot in terms of bringing communities and people with divergent view together. "As Parliament we have a lot of history to learn from him. We may come from different political parties, different regions, but it is a very important time for us to think about uniting the country," he said. Murkomen said Moi sacrificed to unite the country at the most difficult moment through his Nyayo philosophy. "Learning from his Nyayo philosophy and his slogan peace love and unity, I think there is nothing wrong with us kufwata nyayo ya Mzee Moi. Especially when it comes to pursuing national unity in diversity," Murkomen said. Earlier, Siaya Senator James Orengo said Moi's death was not closing an era but opening up a new phase in leadership. Orengo who also spoke as an ODM party member on Wednesday afternoon described the late Moi as a leader who used different aspects of leadership while in power. Orengo said Moi was a sensitive leader and made his decisions at the right time. "You need to paint Moi's legacy with a big brush and then you will see the substantial things he did to education but if you paint it with a small brush then you will begin to think about democracy and human right violations," Orengo said. "Moi Served in so many capacities, I do not think that we are ever going to have anybody in this republic to serve for as long as he did in parliament, and to leave monuments in various sectors in education." The former President will receive top military and civilian honours in an elaborate state funeral at his Kabarak home. According to the plan, there will be a public viewing of the body from Saturday to Monday next week.
