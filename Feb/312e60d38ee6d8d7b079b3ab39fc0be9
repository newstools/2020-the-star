Newly appointed Kisumu All Stars coach Andrew Aroka has admitted he faces a herculean task in turning around the team's fortunes. The coach attributed the team's poor performance in the league to inexperience. Aroka was sacked by the club's CEO Nicholas Ochieng a month ago alongside head coach Henry Omino over poor results before finding his way back. Germany-based Arthur Opiyo took over from Omino on an interim basis for one month before Aroka's appointment. “Most of the players are young and inexperienced. I will work on their mindset because they are psychologically not ready for big stage,” said Aroka after a morning training session at Moi Stadium in Kisumu. He said the club will skip Saturday's second round Betway Shield Cup game against Nyabururu Sportiff at Gusii Stadium. “We want to concentrate on the Kenya Premier League where we are fighting for survival.  I'm upbeat that we will avoid relegation because the mood in the camp is vibrant,” added Aroka. According to a statement from the team's media officer Innocent Oleche, Aroka will be assisted by Jeff Odongo formerly of Chemelil Sugar and former Kisumu Hot Stars coach Ambrose Otieno. Fredrick Onyango was named the goal keeper trainer and Evans Oketch the physical trainer. Rashid Ochieng is the kit manager and Alfred Adu remains the team manager. “Aroka has worked with the boys for one and half years. He understands them,” said the statement by Oleche. The club has lost 11 consecutive games in the league. The last league outing saw them thumped 8-1 by Kariobangi Sharks. Kisumu All Stars' next matches will be against Ulinzi, Tusker, Mathare United, Zoo FC, Western Stima and Chemelil Sugar.
