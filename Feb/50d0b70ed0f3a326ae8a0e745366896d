Meru people in Lamu county will not be allowed to erect a monument unless they can prove beyond a reasonable doubt that their ancestors actually lived there. The statement was issued by the Lamu Council of Elders who are considered the custodians of history, culture and heritage. In January, the Meru and Tharaka Nithi county governments announced plans to purchase land on Manda Island in Lamu where they intend to build a monument. They have said that the community was once enslaved in Mbwaa, believed to be present-day Lamu before they migrated to their present location. The elders’ council said, however, the Merus' [rp[psotopm was ‘outrageous’ and its roots in Lamu. Council deputy chair and historian Mohamed Mbwana said the existence of the Ameru has never been mentioned in the history of Lamu. Mbwana cited the Swahili, Arabs, Portuguese and other foreign groups as having been documented in history books but not the Ameru. He urged the National Museums of Kenya and the two county governments to ensure Lamu elders are fully consulted before any decision to erect a monument is reached. “It’s something we can only consider preposterous. But if they can provide solid proof then we won’t have a reason to stop them from building the monument," Mbwana said. Elder Said Seif said they suspect a land-grabbing scheme considering Lamu has for decades suffered historical land injustices. “There is nothing like Ameru history in Lamu and so we expect the National Museums of Kenya to handle this matter with sensitivity ” he said. Ameru Community in Lamu chairperson Jacob Muroki said they were shocked at the elders' opposition to the move. He said they have enough evidence that the community was once enslaved at Mbwaa. “Let them not politicise this matter. We shall provide all the proof they want, even it if means going the legal way until we are allowed to put up a monument here,” Muroki said. Edited by R.Wamochie
