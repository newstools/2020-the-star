Following a deserved 2-1 win against in-form Sofapaka in a Kenyan Premier League match over the weekend, AFC Leopards captain Robinson Kamura has singled out coach Anthony Kimani for praise. Kamura observed that Kimani has been crucial to the team's revival and turn-around of results since taking over from Casa Mbungo a few months ago. â€œTogether with his technical bench, the coach has really inspired the players to do the right things in the simplest way possible," said Kamura. "It's a good thing to have assembled a team of young players who are very energetic and hungry for success and with this strong bond and fighting spirit, we stand a chance of going places." "We just need to remain patient and focused on taking each match at a time. We still have a chance in the title race. We are a big team with a rich history that needs to be restored by bringing back the lost glory. I believe we are on the right track to achieve this despite the challenges we are facing," added Kamura. The former Mathare United defender also praised fans and individuals who have stood with the club during these tough financial times. "The league is very tough and competitive and we need to remain in good shape physically and mentally. We have little time for mistakes as we focus on fighting to the end and pray for the fitness of all players," he said. "Internal competition among the players has also remained a major factor as everyone wants to be in the first 11," he added.
