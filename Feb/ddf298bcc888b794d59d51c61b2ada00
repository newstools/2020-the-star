Safaricom has announced the introduction of SIM cards with the 0110 and 0111 prefixes. The telecom said sim cards will be available free of charge at all Safaricom shops and dealer outlets countrywide with customers only required to activate their lines with a top-up of Sh50 airtime. Safaricom has also rolled out a new numbering system that provides its customers with the freedom to choose their own number rather than pre-assigned mobile phone numbers. “The new 0110 and 0111 prefixes alongside our new numbering system are part of our “For You” commitment to be Simple, Transparent and Honest. We continue to invest in additional enhancements and services to better meet the needs of our customers as they evolve and to also provide them with even more freedom and flexibility,” Chief Customer Officer, Safaricom. Sylvia Mulinge said. The new prefixes were allocated by the Communications Authority of Kenya in 2019 after the exhaustion of the 07XX prefixes. Other Safaricom prefixes include 070X, 071X, 072X, 074X, 0757, 0758, 0759, 0768, 0769 and 079X.
