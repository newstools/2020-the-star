Senior counsel Ahmednasir Abdullahi has donated Sh1 million to a family friend he met in a peculiar way. The lawyer welcomed Alfayo Omwenga on Friday in his office with his wife and a child. On January 23, the lawyer met Alfayo walking from his workplace to Lenana where he lives. The man works as a guard in Lavington, covering 15 kilometers daily to provide for his wife and the two children. He was given a drive by the lawyer and the conversation started. The senior counsel was moved by the security guard's life, who said he earns Sh12,000 a month. Alfayo was a happy man after receiving some cash from the lawyer, saying that at least his family would have something to eat. "My kids will have soup tonight," said Alfayo. The lawyer then gave him an appointment and promised to hand him Sh1 million to start a business of their choice. He said the money was contributed by his clients, family and from his pocket. Ahmednasir's action caught the attention of Kenyans in social media who lauded him for helping the needy.
