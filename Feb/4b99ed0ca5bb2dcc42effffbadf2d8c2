Boston Half Marathon champion Brilliant Jepkorir has shifted her focus to the World Half Marathon to be held in Gdynia, Poland in March. Jepkorir, who is also the reigning First lady Half Marathon champion, said she is even ready to sacrifice some local races she had planned for at the start of the season to concentrate on the Polish championships. If she makes the traveling Team Kenya to the March 29 world show, then it will be only her second time to represent the country after making her international debut at the 2011 World Cross Country Championships (junior race). “My focus has shifted to the World half marathon and I want to do my best for the country,” said Jepkorir, who trains in Iten. She has a personal best of 67:12 set during the 2019 Copenhagen Half Marathon, where she finished fifth. She also boasts of a silver medal won at the 2019 Houston Half Marathon.
