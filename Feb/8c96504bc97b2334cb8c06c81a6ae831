Nairobi MCAs have been told not to proceed with the impeachment motion of Governor Mike Sonko that was to be debated next week. In a meeting held on Saturday at State House, the MCAs were told to divert from issues that will be a hinderance to service delivery. Mover of the motion Peter Imwatok was, however, not present as he is attending a burial in Kisumu. Also absent was Minority leader David Mberia who is attending the BBI Rally in Meru. Roysambu MCA Peter Warutere confirmed that the meeting was for all 122 MCAs . “Our party leader, the President, has told us not to proceed with the impeachment motion. It is as good as dead now,” he said. Warutere, who was part of the anti-impeachment team, said if the mover does not withdraw the motion before Tuesday, it will automatically be discussed in the house. Imwatok however says he will proceed with the impeachment motion next week. “My motion is a private motion by Peter Imwatok Ward representative for Makongeni and it has not been affected by the meeting. I will still bring it next week on Tuesday," says Imwatok In attendance were assembly Speaker Beatrice Elachi , Speaker of the Senate Kenneth Lusaka and Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa.
