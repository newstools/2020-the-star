Kenya Airways has received a Sh5 billion loan from the government to facilitate engine overhaul of its E190 Embraer fleet. Chairman Michael Joseph on Friday said the loan on commercial terms from the Treasury will cater for the overhaul of 11 Embraer engines. This he said is required every eight years in order to uphold the highest levels of safety and maintain reliability and planned network schedules. He said the announcement was made public in accordance with capital market regulations. "....as an airline we need to be efficient across our operations but more importantly across our fleet," Michael Joseph said. He added, "The Embraer fleet is our largest and is the network's workhorse. We also plan on undertaking refurbishment on our two Boeing 737-700 aircraft". The chairman said the refurbishment on the Boeing will guarantee its passengers a better experience on their flights with the national carrier. "The airline commits to prudent utilisation of the funds to ensure value for money," he said. The newly appointed Group Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Allan Kilavuka said Kenya plays a vital role in the aviation industry in Africa and the capital injection will go a long way in enhancing KQ's operations and strengthening its fleet. "As a strategic national asset and a key driver of Kenya's economic development and GDP growth, it is important that the airline continues to operate optimally," Kilavuka said. He said, as a result, the airline has this year identified six key areas of focus including improving its customer experience, reduce costs and wastage, strengthen operational efficiency and stabilising the organisation. Other areas of focus are growing the airline's profitability and managing its relationships with its stakeholders. Kilavuka said various initiatives are already in place and progressing well across the areas.
