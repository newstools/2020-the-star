Two suspected thugs were killed early Monday in Likoni following an attempted robbery. Likoni police boss Jane Munywoki confirmed that two suspects  were set a blaze by a mob at 5am when they attempted to steal a motorbike from a boda boda operator. “Three suspected thugs approached a boda boda operator at Likoni ferry stage very early in the morning and requested the operator to take them home. On reaching Approved area,they ordered him to surrender his motorcycle,”  Munywoki said. Another  boda boda operator who was following the suspects closely raised the alarm and alerted residents who came out and surrounded the suspects, beat them up  and set them ablaze. Munywoki said that the boda boda operator was suspicious when he was approached by three men at Likoni ferry stage. He requested a colleague to escort him. The third suspect is said to have escaped but in critical condition. The bodies of the deceased were moved to Coast General Hospital mortuary awaiting identification. “We have not identified the suspects since they did not have any identification document with them. We call upon boda boda operators to be keen when operating at night because some of the passengers have bad intentions,”Munywoki said.
