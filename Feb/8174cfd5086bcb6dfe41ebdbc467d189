Education and Interior officials in Sameta subcounty in Kisii have traced 80 children who sat for KCPE last year but have not joined secondary school. Subcounty director of education Kenneth Wafula said his department worked with chiefs to trace the children. Wafula said among the 80, two girls who were found engaging in illicit business in Itumbe joined Kenyoro Secondary School. “Our ministry and that of Interior have since managed to trace 80 children who sat for last year’s KCPE but had not joined secondary as per the 100 per cent transition policy,” Wafula said in his office. “We are going to ensure that all of them are admitted despite financial constraints facing their families,” he added. Out of 1,649 candidates who sat for last year’s KCPE, Wafula said 1, 478 have been admitted in various secondary schools. “Some schools like St Mary’s Nyamagwa Girls and Bishop Mugendi Nyakegogi Mixed Secondary are facing challenges because of the high number of admissions,” the director said. “The two institutions lack enough classrooms and dormitories to accommodate the high number of children admitted,” Wafula said. He however advised school principals and boards to utilize well infrastructure money which the government gave to actualise the 100 per cent transition policy. Education CS George Magoha announced that 99 per cent of transition had been attained so far. The remaining learners will be taken to various secondary schools, he said. Magoha said the government is looking for 10,000 students who are scattered across Narok, Kajiado, Embu, Nyandarua and Tana River counties and are yet to report to school. In Nyanza, the CS said only about 200 pupils have not joined secondary school. He assured of plans to expand the schools infrastructure to accommodate the high enrollments.
