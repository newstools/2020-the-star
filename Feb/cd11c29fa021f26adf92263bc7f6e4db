The body of late and former President Daniel Moi on Tuesday morning left Lee Funeral Home and was taken to State House. The body was transported in a hearse and was escorted by a military band. Several heads of state went to State House to pay their last respects before heading to Nyayo Stadium for the funeral service. Mzee Moi's body will be driven through Processional Way to Kenyatta Avenue, through Uhuru Highway and taken to Nyayo Stadium. Later, the body will be flown to Kabarak and will spend the night at his homestead. On Wednesday, there will be a final service and Mzee Moi will then be buried next to his late wife Lena in Kabarak. In the initial programme, the body was to be taken to Parliament from the mortuary. However, the programme changed. A procession from Parliament to the funeral service at Nyayo Stadium was to be held in accordance with the military tradition.
