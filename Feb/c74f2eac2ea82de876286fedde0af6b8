The National Assembly Majority Leader Aden Duale has called for a special sitting of  Parliament on Monday, February 10. Duale said the legislators will use the sitting to consider a motion to alter the House calendar to propose resumption on the February 13 instead of February 11. This is in view of the Presidential Proclamation on February 4 regarding the demise of former President Daniel Moi. Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiangi has gazetted Tuesday as a holiday for Kenyans to mourn Moi. President Uhuru Kenyatta will lead Kenyans in viewing Moi's body at Parliament building on Saturday. Head of Public Service Joseph Kinyua said members of the public will view the body on Saturday, Sunday and Monday from 8 am to 5 pm Duale said the sitting will also be used to read Uhuru's message regarding the appointment of the new Cabinet Secretaries and the Principal Secretaries who were appointed while the House was on recess. In January, Uhuru made changes to his cabinet naming Mutahi Kagwe and Betty Maina as nominees to head the Health and Industrialisation ministries respectively. Other appointments made include John Weru (Trade PS), Jwan Ouma (PS Vocational and Technical Training), Mary Kimunye(Public Service PS), Simon Nabukwesi (University Education and Research PS), Solomon Kitungu (Transport PS) and Enoch Momanyi Onyango as Physical Planning PS. The president fired Mwangi Kiunjuri as Agriculture CS and replaced him with Peter Munya who was the Trade CS.
