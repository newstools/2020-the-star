Over 3,000 residents of Odioi village in Teso South subcounty have a reason to smile as Osia solar-powered community water project nears completion. The initiative is funded by the county government of Busia and will provide clean water for domestic use, with a pipeline of up to eight kilometers. The water is obtained from a high yielding spring that produces up to 37,000 litres per hour. It is transferred by a solar pumping system to an elevated plastic tank with a capacity of 20,000 litres that distributes the water to the Odioi community through water kiosks. During an inspection visit, the chief officer for water Moses Weunda said the project will ease the community's access to water and safe sanitation. The waterÂ  will also be supplied to institutions such as St Brigit School for the Deaf, Okook dispensary and Amairo market. Initially, the spring served a small percentage of the residents with the rest relying on river water that exposed them to waterborne diseases. Upon completion, the project will be handed over to the community under a trained management committee. Users will pay a service fee for general operations and maintenance of the equipment.
