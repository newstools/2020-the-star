The step taken by the government to allow China Southern flights to land at the JKIA has caused an uproar among Kenyans. The China Southern Airlines Flight touched down on Wednesday with 239 passengers on board. According to the Chinese Embassy to Kenya, all the passengers were screened and cleared before traveling. The Embassy said that all the passengers were advised to quarantine themselves for 14 days, a prevention method used in China. So far, 17 suspect cases have been recorded in the country and all have tested negative. The government has also asked Kenyans to avoid non-necessary travel to countries experiencing the outbreak. The China flight landed in Kenya at the time when about 100 Kenyan students are stranded in China due to the outbreak. Kenya's Ambassador to China Sarah Serem said Kenya will not risk further infection by jetting citizens from China due to the coronavirus scare. She said that the students are better safe in China and that both countries were working closely to ensure that they are all safe. Kenyans on Twitter raised concern over government preparedness concerning coronavirus.
