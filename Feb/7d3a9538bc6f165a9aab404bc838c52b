Lawrence Nginyo Kariuki, the former liberal leader has died at the Aga Khan University Hospital where he has been undergoing treatment. A statement from the family said Nginyo Kariuki died at 1:30am. Nginyo Kariuki was an astute and successful businessman. He will be remembered as a long standing politician who was instrumental in Kenya's quest for Multiparty Democracy. Nginyo was also the founder member of The National Alliance Party (TNA) and Jubilee party spokesperson in Kiambu county. He was a renowned golfer who pioneered African golf in Kenya. In August 2019, the multi-party democracy crusader presented his views to the Building Bridges Initiative. He said there was a need to expand the Executive in order to include a prime minister with two deputy prime ministers to foster inclusivity and harmony. Nginyo also told the team that the current set up of the President and his deputy is more of a two-man show that often creates disharmony. "For the sake of unity and cohesion, it is imperative that we expand the Executive since the current structure has remained contentious and has largely contributed to the polarisation of the country," Nginyo said. In 2018, ODM party leader Raila Odinga visited him at his Red Hill home to wish him a quick recovery after he fell ill.
