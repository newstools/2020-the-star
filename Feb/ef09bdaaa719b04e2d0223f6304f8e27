Director of Public Prosecution Noordin Haji has refuted reports that the corruption trial against former Treasury CS Henry Rotich has been suspended. Earlier on it had been reported that the High court had temporarily suspended the prosecution of Rotich and 28 others charged with corruption-related charges. The suspension came after one of the accused person's lawyer did an application arguing thatÂ his rights were violated when he was arrested. But Haji said what the high court suspended was the plea taking by one of accused Richard Malebe, an advocate, until an application he filed challenging his plea taking is heard & determined on March 2. The DPP said the case will be mentioned on March 26 to allow for the conclusion of the matter. "This is to clarify that the multi-billion Arror and Kimwarer Dams case against former CS Henry Rotich, PS Kamau Thugge & others has not been suspended as has been widely reported," Haji said. Trial magistrate Douglas Ogoti in his ruling had said that since the accused are jointly charged, the order obtained by Richard Malebe affects other accused persons. Rotich and Thugge were among 28 individuals implicated in the Arror and Kimwarer dams scandal. They are accused of conspiracy to defraud the government, failing to comply with procurement law and irregular procurement of insurance policy through single sourcing. The counts were read, with a few mistakes in the particulars, such as the name of the dam, which was being rectified. It is alleged they conspired to defraud the government of $244.4 million. The charges against Rotich and Thugge were contained in the first file and a total of 16 counts were readout. They denied the charges.
