The Insurance Regulatory Authority has released a list of all the newly licensed industry players in the insurance sector in Kenya for 2020. Amongst the hardest hit players in the industry were the insurance brokerage firms, where 82 firms were left out of the newly released list by IRA. In 2019, IRA had a total of 213 insurance brokerage companies listed but in the new list, only 131 firms made it. IRA began the crackdown and delisting of insurance brokerage companies due to the high number of unpaid premiums owed to insurance firms. As of 2018 outstanding premiums stood at Sh43 billion, an increase from Sh37 billion in 2017 with IRA pointing out that insurance brokerage firms accounted for 24 per cent (Sh10.68 billion) of the total outstanding premiums. IRA also said that the insurance brokerage firms that were delisted had not complied with the new tough license renewal conditions in the Insurance Act. Meanwhile, the list of insurance firms licensed by IRA remained intact from the one in 2019. Here is the List of Delisted Insurance Firms
