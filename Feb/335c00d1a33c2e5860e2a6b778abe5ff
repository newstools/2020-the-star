Layonn, real name Jonathan Chapuis, recently released the song 'You Are', his first official single in Kiswahili, which will be followed up by an EP early this year. "It is about love. It's a personal experience with my baby mama," he said. "People spoke a lot about us but I didn't reassure her, and that was my biggest mistake. She started to have doubts about it. Basically, this song is like a letter to her." The Switzerland-based artiste began as a hip hop dancer and became a teacher at age 16 before becoming a DJ for five years. In parallel, he developed a modelling career and posed for several well-known brands. In November 2016, Layonn brought fans the Kizomba remix of Sauti Solâ€™s 'Kuliko Jana'.
