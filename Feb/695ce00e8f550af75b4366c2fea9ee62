The government has ruled out possibility of evacuating students stuck in coronavirus epicenter in China. This contradicts an earlier directive that students trapped in China will be evacuated. The ministry of Health had said that the 85 Kenyans stuck in Wuhan city, where the coronavirus outbreak originated, will be brought home immediately China lifts the lock down over the city. The Ministry said the evacuation was being coordinated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. But in a turn of events, Foreign affairs PS Macharia Kamau told the media on Friday that the best place is where they are - China. "Let's not create an impression that most of the countries have evacuated their people," he said. "I understand there are young people who are in China and they are apprehensive of the situation but it is normal in a situation like this." Macharia said they are looking at all the options adding that the decision for the students to remain there is in the best interest of the students. He advised Kenyans in China who are not on 'essential business' trips to consider returning home. On her part, Health CS Sicily Kariuki said mandatory screening is ongoing in all points of entry to minimize the risk of importation of the virus from affected countries. "Additional health workers have been deployed at JKIA. We are advising Kenyans against non essential travel to affected countries," she said. Kariuki said reagents and kits for testing for the virus are expected to arrive in the country tomorrow.
