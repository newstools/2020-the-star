Agriculture CS Peter Munya has called out corrupt politicians accusing them of being responsible for the failing economy in Kenya. He said cartels who are killing agriculture in Kenya are still in power hence there can never be a change in the industry. He said the same governors who advocate for revamp of the industries are the same ones bringing them down. “When we are leaders who steal, the economy won't develop," Munya said in Meru. The CS was addressing residents at Kinoru Stadium where the sixth BBI rally was held on Saturday. Munya asked politicians to stop personalising the report. He accused them of using it to solicit votes in 2022. Munya asked governors to stop imposing high taxes on Miraa, asking them to stop discriminating against the crop saying it's protected by the government.
