FC Talanta team manager David Chweya is a happy man after gaming firm Betika delivered a new set of kits and footballs on Monday. The firm presented kit to all clubs plying their trade in the National Super League clubs at Camp Toyoyo as part of the sponsorship deal between them and the second-tier league. Chweya said the goodies will go along way in meeting the deficits they had in their stores, thanks to limited funds. The boost comes less than 3 months after an initial Sh90 million sponsorship deal with the Football Kenya Federation which aims to support the second-tier football teams through the 2019- 2022 season. “We will use the new kit in training and reserve the old ones for match days. The footballs are also quality and will be used both in training and in league matches,” he said. Speaking at Camp Toyoyo during the presentation ceremony, the firm’s head of business, John Mbatiah said: “We are happy to boost the Betika National Super League with an extra Sh2 million in addition to the Sh90m initially committed to the same course. We are also happy that we have set the pace for our peers to rise up to the challenge and support the community by giving back to worthy causes." FKF President, Nick Mwendwa, lauded Betika’s involvement in the league. " I would like to express my gratitude to Betika for the impact they have brought to the clubs in the NSL. They have handed teams two sets of football kit, two balls and an extra Ksh 100,000 each.”
