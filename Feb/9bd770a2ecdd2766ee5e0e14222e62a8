The FKF Electoral Board yesterday set the ball rolling towards next month’s on and off national elections as they started receiving nomination papers from aspirants interested in elective positions at the County level. The exercise will see aspirants submit their duly filled forms to the board, upon payment of the respective nomination fees as is stipulated in the FKF Electoral Code. Aspirants from coastal region counties (Mombasa, Kwale, Kilifi, Tana River, Lamu, Taita Taveta) as well as Garissa and Wajir handed in their nomination papers yesterday. Among candidates who submitted their documents are South Coast Branch secretary Lilian Kazungu, who will be contesting the chairperson’s position alongside Dickson Ang’ore and Hassim Akhoje, who also came before the board’s secretariat. “I believe I have what it takes to be the incoming FKF Mombasa County Branch Chairperson,” said Lilian Kazungu. “The nomination process has been flawless. I am confident that the board will conduct a free and fair election.” The deadline for submission of documents is February 18 after which the Board will publish a preliminary list of candidates three days later. Disputes around the nomination process and the preliminary list of candidates will be heard, by the Board, between February 26, and February 28 and if need be, by the Appeals Committee, between February 29 and March 1. The Board will then publish the final list of candidates, at both county and national level, on March 2, ahead of the repeat elections to be held on March 27.
