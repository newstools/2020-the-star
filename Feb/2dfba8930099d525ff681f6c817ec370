Actress Njambi says her daughter is by far her greatest achievement. The mother of two says the little star has changed her life since she was born. "My life has changed so much for the better since she came along, and oh my God, when I finally realised my mother was right, here came a daughter who always thinks that I'm wrong," she wrote on Instagram. In an earlier interview, Njambi explained why she broke up with the baby daddy. "We both messed up in the relationship as we were young and stupid and we didn't have the strength to fight for us," she said. Njambi has moved on and recently welcomed a son. She took to social media to share the good news with her followers, thanking God for safe delivery. "Twelve hours of labour but it was worth it. Heâ€™s finally here. We thank God. Julie and my sis-in-law Cynthia, thank you for being there hiyo journey yote," she said.
