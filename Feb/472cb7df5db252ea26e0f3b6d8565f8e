Africa under 20 walk race champion Dominic Ndigiti starts his 2020 season at the 1st Athletics Kenya track and field weekend meeting at the University of Eldoret this weekend. Ndigiti is hoping for a good start as he eyes to represent Kenya at the World Under 20 championships in Nairobi and the Tokyo Olympics later this year. Ndigiti, who finished his Form Four studies at Kiendege Secondary in Nyamira County last year, said: “I'm happy I'm now done with my 'O' level. I have had good preparations. I'm targeting a podium finish in Eldoret.” Ndigiti has been training in Eldoret since last week. He observed that competition will mainly come from All Africa Games champion Samuel Gathimba and Simon Wachira. Organisers moved the first track and field event from Kipchoge Keino Stadium, which is still undergoing renovations, to the University of Eldoret in Chepkoilel. The second meet will in Nairobi on March 5 and 6 while Embu will host the penultimate round on March 21 and 22. The last event will be held at Moi Stadium, Kisumu on April 4 and 5 and will be preceded by an athletes' seminar on April 3. However, concern is being raised over the readiness of Moi Stadium to host the event because the track is in a pathetic state. Athletics Kenya Nyanza North chairman Joseph Ochieng, said: “We hope the County will not close the stadium by April for renovations. The track is not in very bad shape.” He, at the same time, welcomed the appointment of former Jaramogi Oginga Odinga University of Science and Technology games tutor Valerie Kizito as the director in charge of sports and talent development centre in Kisumu County. “She has a special experience in athletics,” said Ochieng.
