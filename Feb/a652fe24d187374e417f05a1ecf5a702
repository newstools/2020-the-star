In a bid to seal the loopholes in the goalkeeping department, Nzoia Sugar head coach Collins Omondi has opened up on a plan to ditch his first choice keeper and skipper Benson Mangala for former national U-20 shot stopper Humprey Katasi. Omondi blamed the goalkeeping department following their last weekend one-all draw against Ulinzi Stars at the Sudi Stadium, where they squandered their lead to share spoils with the visiting team. Omondi said Mangala had conceded cheap goals against Gor Mahia losing 3-0 a week ago and was at fault against the soldiers last weekend. The former Kariobangi Sharks assistant coach revealed that Katasi, who had missed a couple of their matches on what he described as personal issues, had regained his form after training for the last three weeks. He tipped the youngster to make top drawer saves once they resume their league matches next month when they are scheduled to return to action  against Kakamega Homeboyz “The goalkeeping department has been our weak link in the past two matches. I will start with Katasi ahead of Mangal,  who has been quite erratic and has struggled in dealing with aerial balls in our last two matches. Katasi has regained his form and I think he will help us keep clean sheets going forward. If we can score and fail to leak in goals, then I believe we will be able to get out of the relegation zone,” he said Omondi further challenged his players to draw inspiration from the Ulinzi draw and take the remaining matches as a final. The sugar millers are among the five teams battling to beat the drop as they are placed 15 with 12 points. “Sharing points with a team of Ulinzi’s calibre is quite something and it should motivate the players. We have to build on that and take each match as a final as we have to survive the axe by all means," he added.
