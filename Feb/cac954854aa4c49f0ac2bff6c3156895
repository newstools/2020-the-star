Health officials in Bomet have reported an outbreak of malaria in parts of the South Rift county. Health executive Joseph Sitonik however said there was no cause for alarm since medical officers were conducting surveillance to contain the disease. Sitonik said in January four cases tested positive for the disease while in the last two weeks the numbers had increased. The worst hit area, he stated, is Sotik where by Tuesday this week the number had risen to 60 while 39 other cases had been recorded at Longisa hospital. Tenwek mission hospital reported 25 cases, with the number said to be growing daily. Saying the situation was not severe, the official urged the residents not to panic and instead seek treatment at the health facilities whenever they experience symptoms such as fever. "There should be no cause for panic. We are in control of the situation since we are aware of it and, in fact, our medical officers are closely monitoring the situation," Sitonik said on Wednesday when addressing the press in his office . He was accompanied by public health chief officer Zaddy Chepkorir and director Micah Koech. Sitonik further pointed out that they had mapped out all the health facilities across the county to establish those which had supply of medicine so as to help in emergencies. The outbreak of the disease, he stated, was due to heavy rains experienced in the region.
