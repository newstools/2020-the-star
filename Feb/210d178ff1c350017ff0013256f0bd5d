ODM Party leader Raila Odinga has hit back at Deputy President William Ruto for hiding behind the 'hustling' tag. Without naming names, Raila said it was unfortunate that some politicians have resorted to inciting their constituents when corrupt public officers are sacked. Ruto has previously insisted that he can account for his wealth but has refused to state how much he is worth. The DP has styled himself as a self made politician going by the 'hustler' brand. "The theft of public resources is now called hustling. The sacking of corrupt and incompetent individuals is now called targeting our people. Changing this pattern of events is not going to be easy," Raila said on his twitter account on Thursday. The African Union Special Envoy for Infrastructure said if stern measures are not put in place to stop looting, the entire country might be handed over to the dogs. "But it must and has to be done or we will have no nation to save," Raila said. More to follow
