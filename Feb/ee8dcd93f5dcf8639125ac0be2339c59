Jubilee Party secretary general Raphael Tuju has been admitted to ICU after he was flown to Karen Hospital following an accident on Wednesday morning. Sources told the Star that Tuju, who had chest pains, had to be taken to the Intensive Care Unit. Tuju was injured in a morning crash on his way to the late and former President Daniel Moi's funeral in Kabarak. He was airlifted to Nairobi for further treatment after complaining of chest pains. His driver was unconscious after the accident and was rushed to the Kijabe Mission Hospital. Tuju's car collided with a matatu belonging to Nuclear Sacco, which was heading towards Nairobi. Central police bossÂ  Mwarungu Kalimbo said the matatu rammed into a salon car at Magina as it slowed to negotiate a junction. He said the matatu driver lost control of the vehicle and swerved to the right side and collided with Tuju's Prado which was moving towards Nakuru. The matatu driver was put on life support. Three vehicles were involved in the accident. The other 12 matatu passengers who sustained minor injuries were also rushed to Kijabe Hospital. Earlier, Kijabe Hospital CEO Dr Ken Muma said Tuju had undergone surgery, but did not go into specifics. He said, "We cannot disclose anything about the surgery owing to the family and the hospital's confidentiality, but he had to undergo surgery." "It also remains a secret where these patients have been taken to. The hospitals are the choices of their families."
