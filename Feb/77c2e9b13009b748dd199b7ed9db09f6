The National government should own up and look way into compensating victims of banditry attacks in Kapedo and neighbouring villages in Turkana county that have for years born the brunt of attacks by criminal gangs. The Interior ministry through its regional coordinator George Natembeya, last year, disarmed National Police Reservists who for a long time defended the community from attacks. Unfortunately, the disarmament of the NPRs has not brought tangible changes but rather made the community more vulnerable to the attacks. Last week's attack at Lomelo village in Turkana East that left three people dead including a police officer and several injured should prompt the need for the confiscation of illegal arms in all areas in the North Rift region, especially the neighbouring Tiaty constituency where attacks have also been reported. Turkana South and West Pokot are currently enjoying a relative peace courtesy of disarmament that was done last year. The same needs to be replicated in Kapedo-Baringo corridor to end this menace. Insecurity has denied this region development programmes and government services for fear of attacks. Non-government organisations, on the other hand, have opted to invest their projects on the safer parts of Turkana. The government ought to use the same zeal and energy that they use on guarding companies like Tullow Oil Kenya that is domiciled in Turkana East to protect locals there. No Kenyan should die at the hands of bandits in this era when the government has invested enough on security apparatus. It's the cardinal duty of the government to protect the lives and property of its people.  Ministry officials need to move from their comfort zone and forcefully mop up illegal firearms from these criminals who have no human dignity.  They seem to kill for fun or have a hidden agenda that needs to be investigated.
