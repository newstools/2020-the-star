A labour court has stopped the Ministry of Health from transferring and deploying three senior pharmacists. Hezekiah Chepkwony, Pius Wanjala and George Wang’ang’a said the transfers were malicious and an abuse of discretion by the ministry. Employment and Labour Relations Court judge Onesmus Makau also awarded Chepkwony Sh500,000 compensation for violation of his right to due process. “I agree that Chepkwony’s right to fair administrative action was violated when his three-year contract as the Director National Quality Control Laboratory (NQCL) was terminated or threatened with dismissal by the ministry without consulting him and the board management,” the judge ruled. The judge said that Chepkwony's posting was made in contravention of the principles of national values. “For the avoidance of doubt, the petitioners maintain their current service and positions at the National Quality Control Laboratory without loss of benefits and status until any intended deployment is done in compliance with the constitution,” Justice Makau ruled. They further contended that the ministry subjected senior officers to their juniors in the profession. “Chepkwony and Wanjala were the senior-most at NQCL and it was a violation of the constitution to subject them to Charles Kandie who is junior in the service,” they said. They contended that their rights were violated by the ministry by transferring them from one office to another against the law. Ministry officials said the complainants were civil servants hence were bound to the terms of the contract, including transfer to any workstation. They added that the Constitution grants officers in the ministry to perform administrative functions including the deployment of officers in the ministry. “Chepkwony had accepted the transfer by his letter dated July 8, last year and Mathari Hospital confirmed by letter dated July 10 that he had reported on duty,” the ministry said.
