A Milimani court on Tuesday withdrew the hate speech charges against former Machakos Senator Johnson Muthama and Makadara MP George Aladwa. The ruling by chief magistrate Francis Andayi came following a High Court ruling that declared section 96A of the penal code unconstitutional. Justice Jessie Lessit, Luka Kimaru and John Mativo declared the section unconstitutional as it shifts the legal and evidential burden of proof to the accused. On January 29, the Director of Public Prosecutions was prohibited from charging Muthama with incitement to violence over the issue that happened in 2015. Muthama was in 2015 accused of making inflammatory utterances during a Coalition for Reforms and Democracy rally at Uhuru Park. The politician had questioned the governmentâ€™s willingness to deal with graft especially at the National Youth Service. It was alleged that the words he uttered were disrespectful to President Uhuru Kenyatta and Anne Waiguru, who was then the Devolution Cabinet Secretary. He was arrested and prosecuted but he argued in court through lawyer John Khaminwa that the incitement to violence was contrary to section 96 of the Penal Code and offended the right to a fair trial. In Aladwa's case, he was accused of making hate speech remarks in Kibera on Mashujaa Day in 2015.
