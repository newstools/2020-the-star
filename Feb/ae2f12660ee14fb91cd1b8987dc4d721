The Kenya Electricity Generating Company has posted 4.3 per cent growth in profit before tax in its half-year performance. KenGen on Friday announced its unaudited results for the half-year that ended on December 31, 2019, and full-year that ended on June 30, 2019. The company’s profit after tax for the period under review increased by 98 per cent from Sh4.12 billion to Sh8.17 billion. The growth has been attributed to capital allowances arising from the completion of the 165mw Olkaria V geothermal project. The project also saw the company record a tax credit of Sh1.89 billion compared to a tax expense of Sh1.9 billion in the previous period. Its net revenue of reimbursables increased by 4.8 per cent from Sh18.04 billion to Sh18.91 billion for the six months that ended December 31, 2019. Speaking during the release of the unaudited results, managing director and CEO Rebecca Miano said the growth was buoyed up by a 6.4 per cent increase in electricity revenue—from Sh15.04 billion in 2018 to Sh16 billion for the six-month period Miano said the company recorded 127 per cent growth in other income, from Sh211 million in 2018 to Sh479 million for the six months. “We can attribute this growth to the roll-out of our business diversification strategy, which has seen the company clinch two drilling contracts in Ethiopia,” she said. The growth realised during the half-year ended December 31, 2019, was impacted by lower finance costs following the final repayment of the public infrastructure bond. In October 2019, KenGen fully redeemed it's Sh25 billion Public Infrastructure Bond Offer (PIBO) issued in November 2009. KenGen’s PIBO, which received an overwhelming response from investors, remains the only corporate infrastructure bond to be issued and traded on the Nairobi Securities Exchange. Geothermal energy was the company's top earner, bringing in Sh9.3 billion, up from Sh8.6 billion, in the half-year period ending December 31, 2019. Miano said the company was continuing with its geothermal energy growth strategy, adding that the construction of Olkaria 1 Unit 6 was on course. “We have already started implementing our diversification strategy and have ongoing geothermal drilling and consultancy contracts in Ethiopia and Kenya,” she said. "These initiatives are expected to have a positive contribution to our future performance and the attainment of our Good-to-Great strategy, which focuses primarily on business sustainability." The revenue earnings from hydropower during the six-month period were Sh4.4 billion compared to Sh4.39 billion previously. The company’s operating profit remained steady, gaining by 1.1 per cent from Sh6.6 billion to Sh6.7 billion. In addition, the company's recorded net cash and cash equivalent was Sh8.76 billion compared to Sh5.23 billion due to a lower disbursement from borrowings of Sh1.9 billion, following the completion of Olkaria V and the payment of dividends of Sh1.85 billion.
