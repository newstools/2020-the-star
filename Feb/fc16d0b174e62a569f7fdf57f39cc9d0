 Nyeri Governor Mutahi Kahiga on Monday reorganized his government by realigning key departments for better services. ICT was moved from the department of education and sports to the office of the governor where it will be under the county secretary. Sanitation and Environment services were also moved from the water department to the county public service docket. The public service department under Beth Karimi will now include environment, sanitation and natural resources. Residents have often complained about delays in garbage collection. “The key reason for restructuring is because we feel that there is need to increase supervisory roles within that department and we felt none is better placed than the person in charge of the county public service,” Kahiga said. The governor said ICT was moved because it cuts across all departments hence can only be better managed from his office. Kahiga urged Karimi to ensure everything was moving and resources put to maximum use. He said the county must remain clean. Nyeri has been struggling with sanitation from last year and Kahiga said he was hoping services will improve. He said the county was focused on waste management and expected that Karimi will work closely with other departments to create proper waste management sites. The county has waste management sites in Othaya, Karatina and Mweiga and intends to put up another at Kiawara. Kahiga said budgetary provisions have been made. He asked Water and Irrigation executive Fredrick Kinyua to focus on service provision saying the county had promised boreholes to residents and most of them were dug close to a year ago but they have never been fully operational. Kahiga announced the changes after chairing a cabinet meeting. The changes were immediately gazetted.  edited by p. obuya
