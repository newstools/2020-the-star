Homa Bay county commissioner Yetich Kipkemei has threatened to replace chiefs and their assistants whose areas are experiencing runaway social ills. Kipkemei said there is a special team of officers who will assess the administrators in their jurisdictions and give a report on their ability to end the crimes. The commissioner cited some of the prevalent social ills as defilement, teen pregnancies, illicit brews, drug abuse and crime, among other offences. “I will not allow Homa Bay to continue rated high in issues of defilements and teen pregnancy. It’s upon the chiefs and their assistants to shape up or ship out,” Kipkemei said. He said the assessment would determine whether the chiefs and their assistants are capable of undertaking their work effectively. The chiefs who will be found and proven as incompetent will be replaced. He added that Homa Bay chiefs and their assistants must prove they are up to the tasks on the ground. Speaking on Friday at Asumbi market during public baraza in Rangwe constituency, the administrator said he has directed all chiefs to report all defilement cases to police. “We’re also not tolerating government officials who collude with criminals and settle defilement and sexual offences against children and women out of court,” he added. Kipkemei said at least 41 defilement cases have been reported at different police stations across the county.  Unfortunately, however, most of the suspects in the cases have not been arrested. He named Suba North, Rangwe, Ndhiwa and Suba South constituencies as areas with high cases of sexual offences. “Police officers must also prepare to go home should they collaborate with suspects in sexual offenders to avert arrest,” he said. He noted that his office is reviewing all ongoing defilement cases within the last year and will give necessary advice. “We will establish if the suspects have been arrested and charged. We believe there could be numerous cases that have numerous loopholes,” Kipkemei said.
