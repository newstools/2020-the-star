Police have arrested a woman linked to a bomb scare in Parklands, Nairobi on January 30. Meera Dinesh Patel was arrested in a manful forensic-led operation after crime scene processing was undertaken on Sunday. Last week, bomb experts conducted a search at Doctors Plaza, Parklands Avenue following a bomb scare. Nairobi police boss Philip Ndolo said a notice dropped near the building prompted the search. The note was claiming that the building would be bombed any time. The Hoax saw the evacuation of all the tenants from the residential building as the DCI Bomb Disposal Unit screened it for any explosives. DCI Director George Kinoti said on Monday that Patel issued the threat after she failed to get a Managerial Position she was eyeing. "This came two days after the former manager of the property retired and was replaced, "Kinoti said. "Patel (a tenant there) had expressed interest in taking up the manager's position but was not successful." Kinoti said CCTV reviews beefed up by other corroborative evidence has so far placed her at the core of the investigation. "She remains in custody pending arraignment. We warn each member of the public against engaging in any such hoax," he said.
