The Maendeleo Chap Chap Party wants Kenyans to elect the President, Deputy President and Prime Minister in proposals to the BBI. Party leader Alfred Mutua said all the three offices should be given a specific portfolio and mandate. The Machakos Governor reiterated that the president, DP and PM should all be elected as a team. "People should know if they are included in the executive arm of government when they elect the people they want in those offices," he added. Mutua further said the President should have the powers to fire the deputy and the PM. "You don't want the president to be stuck with a person who is a thief. However, there must be a procedure for this because we don't want a president who wakes up and just fires people," he added. In a presentation to the Yusuf Haji-led team, Maendeleo Chap Chap further called for the introduction of regional governments. Last month, Mutua said his party Maendeleo Chap Chap supports an all-inclusive government that will incorporate a president, his deputy, a prime minister and two deputies as proposed in the Building Bridges Initiative report. Mutua nevertheless stressed that BBI should never be a partisan discussion agenda but one that will eventually transform the economic gains of millions of Kenyans who are currently barely making it due to harsh economic conditions. “We want the BBI to factor in an economic plan that will ensure that our people from all corners of the country have money in their pockets. We want development to trickle down to the villages regardless of which government is in power,” Mutua said.
