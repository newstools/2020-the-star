The Tenwek Mission Hospital board has fired its long-serving chief executive officer Geoffrey Lang'and three senior managers. Others fired were administrative services director Raymond Byegon, risk and audit director John Sang' and maintenance manager Joseph Maiyo. The four had been suspended for two months. Current finance director Shem Tangus will be the acting chief executive officer until the position is filled. The hospital’s board chairman Robert Lang'at, in a memo to the staff, said it has opted to change the team and hire new managers. Lang'at, however, did not give any reasons the four were dismissed. They have opted to take voluntary early retirement, he said. “We confirm at the board level that we shall support staff and management to ensure that a smooth transition is witnessed throughout this period,” read the February 5 memo. He requested the staff to work with and support the management team to see the hospital flourish. “Kindly accord him [Tangus] all the necessary support needed. He will communicate on the management’s plan in handling the roles of the other three officers,” Lang'at said. Lang'at who doubles as the Africa Gospel Church, Kenya, bishop said the process to replace the four senior managers will start soon. The mission hospital which is one of the largest in the country is fully sponsored by the AGC church and receives support from donors in the United States. The hospital is in the process of a Sh4 billion facelift and installation of a new heart and chest unit. The board, Lang'at said, recently unveiled a five-year strategic plan which seeks to ensure the provision of best healthcare services to all. The dismissal of the four comes only a week after a visit by US Ambassador Kyle McCarter visited the facility.
