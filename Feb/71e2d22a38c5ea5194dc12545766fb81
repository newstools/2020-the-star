The star behind the viral hit 'Parte After Party' was in Kenya over the weekend. Bigtril has gone global with his hit single that even got Hollywood couple Cardi B and Offset dancing to the hit single. “Even before Cardi B danced to it, I had released the song, and there is this festival in Uganda called 'Nyege Nyege' that a lot of people from Kenya like to attend, and it became the theme song for the festival,” Bigtril said at a press conference. Since the song was released, he has been on tour — since December 21 last year. “What the song has done for me as a person is just stand out. I have been on tour, it's now my routine so it's crazy,” he said. Bigtril said Kenya was the first country to show crazy love for the song, and it is only right that he visits and gives fans a concert. “After like two weeks, my Instagram was still bombarded with freestyle videos, people dancing to the song,” he said.
