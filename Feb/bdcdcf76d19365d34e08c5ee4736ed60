Police in Ol Joro Orok, Nyandarua, are investigating the death of a man who is believed to have been assaulted in a bar at Kwa Ngara trading centre on Sunday. Nyandarua West subcounty police commander Isaac Ruto on Tuesday said Simon Mbogo, 42, was found lying outside Mwireri bar at 8.30pm with head and arm injuries. His brother Peter Muriithi, 45, carried him home on a motorcycle then took him to Nyahururu County Referral Hospital on Monday morning. At 4pm that same day the family received news Mbogo had died. Ruto said Margaret Mukami, 45, the owner of Mwireri bar, was arrested on Monday evening and taken in for investigations. Following reports of Mbogo’s death, residents converged at Kwa Ngara trading centre and locked Mukami inside her establishment, threatening to lynch her, but police arrived in time to save her. “I have directed the DCI to take over the matter to establish if she was involved. Whoever is found culpable will have to face the law," Ruto said. Edited by Josephine M. Mayuya
