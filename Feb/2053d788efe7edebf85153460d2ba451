The High Court has temporarily suspended the awarding of two tenders advertised by the County Government of Wajir. This is after a resident of Wajir South Constituency - Mohamed Abdikadir Mohamed - moved to court challenging the advertisement of the two tenders. In the petition filed at the Milimani law courts, Mohamed has sued the Wajir County Government and Governor Mohamed Abdi Mohamud. He argues that on February 6, 2020 the county advertised a tender in the Standard newspaper for the improvement of roads to bitumen standards in three constituencies in Wajir county. He further adds that on February 4, the county government advertised tenders for the water dams’ structures to improve water facilities in three constituencies. “The above tenders are mega development projects that all sub-counties and constituencies should get a portion of the Wajir County revenue in the spirit of non-discrimination,” he argued. According to Mohamed, despite Wajir South being the largest and most densely populated, it has been deliberately denied and locked out of the said projects in violation of the Constitution. It is his claim that the county and their agents have grossly abused their constitutional mandate contrary to the law. “The advertisement for tenders is unconstitutional because it is not keeping with the principles of good governance as enshrined in law,” read court papers. The case will be mentioned on March 3 and Mohamed has been directed to serve the petition to the respondents by February 25.
