GSU officers have been faulted for harassing and bullying residents in Mlolongo town, Athi River sub-county in Machakos. Residents allege that the officers have been harassing them at night without any formal arrests. Speaking in Mlolongo during a security meeting, the locals allege the harassments began in December when the GSU officers were brought to help fight crime during the festive season. The cops demand for money from the residents they arrest, until 5am in the morning. Led by Pastor Musa Mutua, they urged the security personnel to intensify security in the area and take the right measures against the corrupt cops. "This situation started at around December wehre the GSU officers wait until the usual patrol officers to leave, then raid the town, bullying and beating up anyone they find. They don't arrest but they make sure they put you in their vehicles and release you in the morning," said Mutua. He alleged that recently a man was brutally injured with one of his teeth removed. Athi River sub county police commander Catherine Ringera said they had received the claims from the public and the right measures have been taken to control the situation. "This behaviour is uncalled for and I will work to ensure that it is completely rooted out," she said. The police commander urged the locals to report any rogue police officer to the nearest police station and assured stern actions will be taken.
