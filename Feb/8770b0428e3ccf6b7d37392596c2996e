Baringo senator Gideon Moi has disclosed that his father, Daniel Moi, never feared death. Daniel Toroitich Arap Moi, Kenya's longest-serving President, died on February 4, 2020. He will receive top military and civilian honours in an elaborate state funeral at his Kabarak home. "Mzee always told me that to accept life, you must accept death. He never feared it because he knew there was another eternal life after death," Gideon said. "...he never feared death.... i am calmed with that.. i am calmed that Kenyans have given their love and affection during this time." Gideon was speaking on KTN when Standard editors visited their Kabarnet home in Nairobi on Wednesday. "I stand here with humility, that you have come to condole with the family. The family is large and cannot all be here," Gideon said. "I give my humble gratitude to all of you. He went well in peace, I was with him to the last second. I am gratified that I stayed with him all this time and did my best to possible look after him," he said. President Uhuru Kenyatta made a presidential proclamation confirming Moi's death on Tuesday  morning and outlined the plans for his funeral. The President ordered that flags be flown at half-mast as an expression of public sorrow from yesterday until sunset on the day of Moi’s burial. However, before the burial, the body would lie in state at a public place for wananchi to view it.
