The public viewing of the body of the late former President Daniel Moi has officially ended. The viewing ended on Monday 6 pm marking three days Moi's body lay-in-state. National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi said cumulatively some 213,000 Kenyans viewed the body over the three-day period. Muturi said it was unfortunate that the viewing was closed while more people flocked Parliament to pay their last respects. On Sunday over 55,000 Kenyans viewed the body compared to 24,000 who viewed the body on Saturday. “As at 5.35 pm today, it has been recorded that 213,000 Kenyans had the opportunity to pay their last respects to the retired former president Daniel Arap Moi. Out of these, 72,500 viewed the body today,” Muturi said. The body of Moi has been laying at parliament since Friday last week. President Uhuru Kenyatta officially opened the public viewing on Saturday. The body of Moi was taken back to the Lee Funeral Home at 6.35 pm. Parliament extended the viewing of Moi's body for an hour. The viewing was to end at 5 pm on Monday but Parliament extended the timing to 6 pm. "The time of viewing the body by the public has been extended to 6 pm ...that is the reason why we have this sitting," Muturi said on Monday during a special sitting in Parliament. Earlier, ODM party leader Raila Odinga arrived for the public viewing. Some Kenyans could not hold back tears and were overcome by grief and shock after viewing the body of the former President outside Parliament Buildings on the third day he lay in state. Some wailed uncontrollably while others fainted after queuing to view Mzee Moi's body on the last day of public viewing. It took the intervention of officials from St John Ambulance to help those who were engulfed in shock. Moi's son Baringo Senator Gideon Moi was seen later thanking those who were in the long queue as he made his way to his car outside Parliament Buildings.
