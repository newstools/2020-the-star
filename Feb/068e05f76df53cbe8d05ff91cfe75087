Military officers on Saturday pushed the coffin of former Kenya's President Daniel Arap Moi from the Lee Funeral home to parliament. The casket carrying the body was draped with the Kenyan flag and left the parlourÂ  at 7:15 am. The casket was draped by the Kenya Defence Forces. This practice is used by the military to affirm that the deceased is mourned by the nation and appreciated by the state. The procession moved at a slow pace as it made way to Parliament buildings where it is expected to Lie-in-State for public viewing. Military officers marched in a procession as they escorted the coffin along Valley road as Kenyans looked from afar. Traffic policemen were also seen directing the procession. The casket was wheeled by a carriage as happened with founding President Mzee Jomo Kenyatta in 1978. The soldiers were responsible for the body throughout its trip. Other dignitaries led by Deputy President William Ruto will have an hour to view the body before members of the public are allowed in. There will be protocol officers present to guide the public with Comesa Grounds at KICC designated as the holding area.
