TheÂ  Gertrude's Hospital's Charity Walk was launched at Serena Hotel on Tuesday. This marks the second edition of the walk, which aims to raise funds for children suffering from cancer. Present were foundation sponsors Makini Schools represented by Katya Nyangi, Gertrude's Foundations Manager Carol Waweru and haematologist/oncologist at the hospital Doreen Mutua. Mutua said, "It is very hard to diagnose cancer in children as it starts as a simple illness like malaria or infection. By the time you realise it, the cancer has already spread to other parts of the body."
