Former President Daniel arap Moi’s baton famously known as ‘fimbo ya Nyayo' has also been taken to Parliament. The rungu was brought to Parliament ahead of public viewing of former president Daniel Moi's body 'Fimbo ya Nyayo' was a symbol of power, leadership and national cohesion. The rungu was made of ivory and gold. Kenyans were used to see it when the president carried it but never saw it one on one. This is going to be the first time many Kenyans will see the symbol of power alongside the body of the late. The rungu, almost remained glued to his right hand for the 24 years he was in power. Moi never spoke publicly of the significance of the rungu but the origin is of young men of the Tugen community in Baringo, who were implored by their elders to carry an assortment of small weapons to protect themselves against wild animals. "From a young age Moi was always armed with a rungu, a bow and arrow, or occasionally a small sword, to ward off attacks by leopards, eagles or baboons,” biographer Andrew Morton said. He said in his book ''Moi, the Making of an African Statesman'', which was first published in 1998. Earlier, military officers pushed the coffin of former Kenya's President Daniel Arap Moi from the Lee Funeral home to parliament. The casket carrying the body was draped with the Kenyan flag and left the parlour  at 7:15 am. The procession moved at a slow pace as it made way to Parliament buildings where it is expected to Lie-in-State for public viewing.
