The Chinese who was caught on camera caning a Kenyan employee at a Nairobi restaurant does not have a work permit and visa to be in the country. Deng Hailan, a chef at Chez Wou restaurant, was recorded assaulting a  young Kenyan employee for being late in a video that has gone viral on social media. “The officers from DCI managed to arrest the perpetrator, one Deng Hailan, a Chinese national who works at the hotel as a chef but doesn’t have a work permit during a morning operation,” the DCI said in a statement. The video led to the public uproar with many Kenyans calling on the government to arrest the culprits for prosecution.  The one-minute short video shows Hailan questioning the Kenyan waiter and demanding which parts of the body he prefers to be whipped. "Following reports of an incident doing rounds in sections of the press depicting a man of Asian descent assaulting a male employee said to be working at a hotel, this morning detectives from Kilimani raided Chez Wou restaurant in Kileleshwa in pursuit of the matter," the DCI said. Others arrested were two other chefs - Chang Yueping and Ou Qiang - who hold expired visas and don't have work permits. Yu Ling, a cashier at the hotel holding a visitor’s visa but without a work permit, was also arrested. “Eight Kenyans who work at the hotel were also escorted to Kilimani police station for further interrogation,” the DCI said. Hailan, passport number ed8827901, will be charged with assault. He will also be charged with being in the country illegally, together with his three colleagues. The officers said Hailan was in the country on a visitor's visa that expires this year on March 29.
