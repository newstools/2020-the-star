Involvement of parents in the provision of comprehensive sexuality education is critical to ensuring reduced teenage pregnancy and unsafe abortion. Barriers to this involvement include a limited capacity of parents to address reproductive health issues of young people as well as cultural norms that make such conversations on sex taboo. When young people discuss sexuality issues with adults, they are able to make informed decisions about their health and wellbeing. When parents communicate openly on adolescent sexuality, prevention of STIs and unintended pregnancies, there is a promoted social behaviour change on youth and adolescents. Sexual and reproductive health also includes the prevention of drug and substance abuse and ensuring good mental health. Young people need information on mental health at an early age. This will help them address challenges of economic hardships, school dropout and unintended pregnancy that results in unsafe abortion. These discussions should start at the family level through to the health facilities. Accessibility to information on health is a human right and therefore, all areas should be able to access health information. We must build the capacity of health workers to provide friendly youth services that are non-judgmental.  Naya Kenya, Nairobi
