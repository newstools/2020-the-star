Radio Jambo breakfast presenter Gidi says stories of families whose marriages have hit rock bottom move him and co-presenter Ghost to tears sometimes. This is during 'Patanishoâ€™, a segment of his show, which is now almost seven years old. Speaking to Word Is yesterday, Gidi said the segment has touched many lives. "Patanisho stories are every day problematic. Sometimes we have very funny stories, while other days we have sad ones," he said. Gidi said people go through a lot of issues in relationships. "Some are so touching that we also at times get ourselves crying in the studio. Some even make us go silent in the studio because they are sad," he said. "There are other people who we try to reconcile but are just crying in studio, and so we also find ourselves crying. Others complain about why they are brought on the radio. I mean, it is different always." Asked how the idea of the segment came up, Gidi said it took him five years to come up with it. "I tried so many ideas but then after five years, we got Patanisho, which was motivated by people calling in and sharing their problems with us," he said, adding that many people now know about it. "For the last seven years, it has grown immensely but it has been a lot of work behind the scenes and building trust with people so they can be free to open up to you. We make them free with us and that is why many are free with us. Another reason why the segment is loved is that it is clean and no vulgar language is used." He says the greatest reward for him is when the duo (Gidi na Ghost) successfully reconciles couples. It makes him even happier when some call or text later with the news that they reconciled and are now much happier together. Gidi said he is enjoying his radio career and plans to continue entertaining Kenyans until when it will be enough for him.
