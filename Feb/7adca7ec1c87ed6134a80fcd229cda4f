At least 22 Football Kenya Federation Division Two referees have been axed after failing fitness tests. The officials were kicked out during a test conducted by FKF instructors at the Kapsabet showground on Monday and Tuesday. According to Caleb Amwayi, a fitness and endurance instructor, a total of 71 referees turned up for the exercise. "We are out to streamline and improve officiating right from the grassroots hence the need for competent and knowledgeable officials," said Amwayi. "Those who failed the test have to go back to the drawing board and train hard. They can still make it back next year, if they do what is necessary." "We also have some rogue individuals who are hell-bent on spoiling the good name of the referees by engaging in football activities without the required qualifications.  I want to serve them a notice that their days are numbered." "We are rooting out this kind of individuals, who normally run after locally organised tournaments. They either shape up or ship out,’’ warned Amwayi. Amwayi, who is also the FKF North-Western branch secretary general confirmed that they are currently taking over 40 match commissars through training. He added that the focus is laid on physical fitness, technical knowledge and also proper report writing. Amwayi is being assisted by Fifa instructors Stephen Oduor from Nairobi and Moses Osano from Siaya.
