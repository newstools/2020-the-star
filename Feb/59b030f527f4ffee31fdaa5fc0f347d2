About 60 per cent of road accidents in Matuga subcounty in Kwale are caused by the reckless boda boda riders, police records show. Speaking during a security meeting at Denyenye, Waa-Ng’ombeni police commander Ludwin Sasati said motorbikes had claimed so many lives through accidents within the past few years. He said most boda boda riders are inexperienced and flout traffic rules, making the roads unsafe for commuters. “A huge percentage of the boda boda riders are unqualified. This therefore risks the lives of the many road users,” Sasati said. “The majority of boda boda riders like speeding off with their unbuttoned shirts to show that they are heroes.” He added that they overtake carelessly and flout traffic rules. He asked the riders to observe traffic rules and value their lives and those of other road users. Lucy Muriithi, a traffic officer in Kwale, said boda boda riders must improve on  road safety. “All boda boda riders must acquire valid licenses and also go for refresher courses,” Muriithi said. Matuga assistant county commissioner Robert Shuneti urged boda boda to join Saccos and borrow loans from Uwezo Fund to help transform their lives. At the same time, the regional police boss Sasati said security has been beefed up in Denyenye. He commended the locals for their cooperation with the police. “For the past five months, we have not had any incident of insecurity in the area,” he said.
