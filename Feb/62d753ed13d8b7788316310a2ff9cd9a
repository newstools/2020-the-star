They may have left the public limelight but the 10 members of the Konoin traditional dancers' troupe have fond memories of their performances for former President Daniel Moi. The Konoin dancers say they were regular visitors to the President’s home in Kabarak and State House. Moi, who died last week aged 95, was known to love music, especially folk songs. The Star met the dancers at a small village on the slopes of Konoin. They described Moi as a man of great humility. Samuel Korgoren, 78, recalls moments in the 1980s when they sang for Moi outside State House in Nakuru until late in the night. “We left Moi a cheerful man that night and for us, we knew we shall be going back home with something for our children,” Korgoren says. Korgoren says despite having little to celebrate about now, they gained a lot from Moi during his time. “We were regular visitors there, Moi had a great passion for music and when he needed us he would ask the former MP Isaac Salat to come for us at home,” Korgoren says. During Moi’s visits to the Kipsigis region, they said, were among the groups that sang for him during his public functions. Chepkulul Arap Chepkeiyo, 71, who is the group’s vice chairman says that Moi could not hide his love for folk songs. “He loved songs that praised Kanu and those that promoted unity in the country,” Chepkoiyo says. As they pay tributes to Moi, the group is appealing to the government to support them financially because they have little to show for their toil. (edited by O. Owino)
