An Embu police canteen’s employee hanged himself with his vest in a police cell after being arrested and locked inside for stealing a colleague’s phone. The 25 year old Peter Kinyua who was a worker at a canteen within Itabua Police Station in Embu Town, Embu West Sub-county committed suicide on Friday night in the police station’s cell. He had allegedly been confined inside the cell alone on suspicion of stealing a mobile phone belonging to his workmate at the canteen. Embu West Sub-County’s Police Commander Charles Kinyua said the suspect was arrested after the phone which his workmate had complained of having been stolen was recovered on him. He said when the canteen worker complained about the loss of the phone, a search was done on Kinyua and it was found on him and thus he was arrested and locked inside the cell waiting to be charged with the offense. The police commander said after about 30 minutes of arrest a police officer who went to the cell to check on the suspect he found him hanging on his vest from the grills of the window after undressing and using it to commit suicide. He said it’s suspected the inmate committed suicide for unknown reasons as he was alone in the cell although more investigations were being carried out to establish what happened. The police boss said the body of the suspect was moved to the Embu Level Five Teaching and Referral Hospital Mortuary.
