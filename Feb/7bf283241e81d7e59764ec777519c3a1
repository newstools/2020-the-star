The German Bundesliga have launched a youth ambassador program in Kenya at Mathare Youth Sports Association, Komarock grounds. The partnership between Bundesliga club TSG 1899 Hoffenheim, Streetfootballworld and Transforming Stars of Africa (TYSA) will train the ambassadors on a 17-month program as part of long-term commitment to grow football. The program will mentor 35 ambassadors aged between 18 and 25 years old who were selected from street football world-affiliated organizations in the country. Present at the launch was FKF’s CEO Barry Otieno who gave full support to the program. “Football in the country has not been handled well in the past. We wish this program would run even for five years, and thus it has the full support of the federation,” he said. TSG 1899 Hoffenheim head of International Relations, Tony Mamodaly, said they were looking forward to working with young footballers in the country. “Kenya is known for athletics, particularly the long-distance races. This will be an opportunity to work with footballers, especially since Hoffenheim has the financial stability to give back, not just locally but internationally, he said. TYSA’s Carol Ndalila explained that there was a call for applications to organizations such as Mathare Youth Sports Association (MYSA) and Moving The Goal Posts (MTG) who are affiliated to streetfootball world.  The ambassadors were then selected based on their age, their impact on sports development and the time they are willing to put into the program. On the importance of the program, MYSA’s CEO George Nange said: “it will focus on integration and value of sports. It will also teach coaching skills and life skills while instilling the need for integrity to the young ambassadors.” There will be 18 girls and 17 boys in the Youth Ambassador Program. They are from Nairobi, Kilifi, Kisumu, Kitale, and Thika.
