The Lake Basin Development Authority wants Homa Bay government to channel public funds to projects that can empower residents. The agency's leadership said a lot of the county resources have not been prudently utilized since the onset of devolution in 2013. It argues that the county government and the majority of its elected leaders spend public funds on projects that do not help the common man. LBDA chairman Odoyo Owidi said misuse of public funds promotes poverty and underdevelopment among residents. “It’s high time leaders, especially Homa Bay government, came up with projects that can improve the lives of locals. A lot of funds have been spent on projects that don’t commensurate to the development expected,” Owidi said. Speaking on Saturday during a fundraiser at Wire SDA church in Kasipul constituency in company of contractor Tom Okoko, the chairman the current and future generation. He argued that Awiti may fail to realise his expected legacy if he does not change his leadership style. Owidi also called for collaboration between leaders to construct dykes on major rivers such as Miriu, Riana and Sondu to avoid over flooding. “We see our leaders use public funds on activities like donating umbrellas and buying salts to floods victims. Such activities don’t add value to the community,” he added. LBDA covers counties in Nyanza and Western regions. According to Owidi, denying residents a chance to develop is a violation of their constitutional right for economic empowerment. The chairman said most counties, especially those that border Lake Victoria experience, slow development process because their money utilization priorities are not right. “Development should also go to all residents without discrimination. A good leader should disregard partisanship after the election,” the chairman said.
