Police in Baringo North subcounty are pursuing a man who fatally shot another man with poisoned arrows. The shooting occurred on Tuesday at Chapin village in Bartabwa ward where the suspect, Stanley Chepyegon, 22, allegedly attacked Musa Kositany, 58,  with poisoned arrows. “Kositany, known as Okola, sustained an arrow injury to the chest and he was rushed to Kipsaraman health centre where he was pronounced dead on arrival,” subcounty police commander Frederick Odinga said on Wednesday. He said the cause of the attack has not been determined. The two men reportedly were in a drinking den and had a quarrel. The alleged assailant rushed to his nearby home and grabbed a bow and arrows. “He came back fully charged and quickly shot the man at the chest at about 5pm," a witness said. People heard the victim screaming, rushed to help and took him to the health centre on a boda boda.  He was dead on arrival. Bartwabwa ward MCA Reuben Chepsongol called on security agencies to crack down on illicit brew. “All this is happening because somebody somewhere is sleeping on his job while alcohol is taking over our people in the villages,” Chepsongol said. Odinga called on villagers to provide information leading to arrest of the killer. “We shall never rest until he is behind bars,” Odinga said, adding that liquor-related cases were on the rise. He urged residents to report unruly behaviour before it ends in bloodshed. (Edited by V. Graham)
