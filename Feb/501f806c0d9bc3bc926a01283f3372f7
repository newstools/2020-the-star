Jamaican reggae dancehall recording artist Buju Banton is in Nairobi ahead of his concert tomorrow the KICC. Buju landed on Thursday evening at JKIA and was warmly welcomed by his Kenyan fans who dressed him in a Masaai attire and gave him a rungu. Earlier on this week, he took to Instagram to announce the news, writing, "Kenya, I can't wait to see you this Saturday, the 15th of Feb at the KICC grounds. Get your Tickets. Get ready for an Experience like no other, I’m coming with my full band, So be ready! Get your tickets today!" This will be the Jamaican star’s first show in Africa after he was released from jail late in 2018 and he expressed his excitement at the trip upon landing at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport.“I have been really looking forward to coming to Kenya and it has been a long wait but I am finally here. I am very happy and looking forward to having a nice time,” he told the crowd that had gathered to welcome him at the airport. The most anticipated show was initially supposed to go down on New Year’s Eve in Mombasa but was rescheduled to February 8 at the KICC Grounds in Nairobi. Unfortunately, due to the death of former President Daniel Arap Moi, the venue was unavailable for security reasons as a public viewing of the body started on Saturday at Parliament buildings, which is adjacent to KICC. Other reggae stars who have been lined up to curtain raise for Banton among them DJ Kriss Darlin, DJ Moh, MC Teargas.Media personality Njambi Koikai is the official MC for the event.She has also been hyping the event on her social media. She wrote; "The Comeback!!!It's been 4 years since I was on stage. Tomorrow I will be on stage at the Buju Banton show. It's been a long journey for me." Buju was sentenced to ten years in prison in June 2011 after he was convicted of firearms and drugs charges but a judge subsequently dismissed the gun charge and reduced his time by two years.Some of his jams include; Destiny, Champion among others.
