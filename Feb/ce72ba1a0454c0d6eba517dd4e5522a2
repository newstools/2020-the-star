Isiolo residents say they fear loosing their land have as they lack help from government agencies even as the process of land adjudication and titling gathers momentum. Residents of Mwangaza, Kiwanjani, Tuluroba, Chechelesi, Mabatini and Kambi ya Juu are worried that if the process continues in the current state, a few wealthy individuals will rob them of their land. Led by group chairperson Paul Nkunja, the residents said the ongoing land adjudication and titling process should be stopped until all cases of disputed ownership are resolved. The process began after a legal gazette by Lands CS Faridah Karoney that established Isiolo county as an adjudication zone. Nkunja said residents have registered their complaints in various land offices at both the county and national levels but no help has been forthcoming. “The county administration is yet to respond to a letter from the National Land Commission regarding their predicament. They are now worried the ongoing process of land titling will effectively put an end to their quest for justice once it legalizes the parcels of land allegedly stolen from them by influential individuals,” he said. He accused the Isiolo county government of failure to honour court orders, arguing that several disputes remain unresolved in court even as the county administration moves on with the process of land adjudication.
