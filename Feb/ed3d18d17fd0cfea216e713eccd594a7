Citizens attending the Building Bridges Initiative forum at Kinoru Stadium in Meru have demanded copies of the BBI report. Some said they were confused and didn't know what was contained in the BBI report. They say leaders keep on shifting goal posts with new proposals. Peter Mainda said he wants to know exactly what the BBI report has for the common mwananchi. He said he thought citizens entering the stadium would be given free copies of the BBI report, but was shocked to realise none were available. “I came here very early in the morning with one mission, to learn, take keen note and pray I will get the facts about BBI. I don’t want a situation where I will be forced to vote in a referendum without making crucial decisions and analysis. We are struggling to put food on the table. What if this BBI will be detrimental to me? I want to know what it is all about because it may be a plan by leaders to push their own agenda,” Mainda said. The Kinoru rally was preceded by a meeting convened by leaders from 11 Mt Kenya counties at Kenya Methodist University on Friday to harmonise their memoranda for presentation in today’s forum. Leaders and representatives attending the rally are drawn from Embu, Meru, Tharaka Nithi, Nyeri, Laikipia, Kirinyaga, Nyandarua, Nakuru, Nairobi, Kiambu and Murang’a, The meeting, which started at 10.30am is expected to end at 4pm. Meru county police commander Patrick Lumumba told the Star security has been enhanced. Some people said they were paid to attend the meeting, others only got bus fares, while others did not get any money. Vendors selling scarfs, hats and snacks are making a killing. Benta Juma, a Nairobi-based trader, said business is booming. She is selling scarfs and hats written BBI.
