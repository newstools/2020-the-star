Kenyans on Saturday had a chance to view the body of former President Daniel Moi in Parliament. Long queues were witnessed outside Parliament Buildings with some seen carrying white handkerchiefs to wipe their tears while others just bowed at the body. The body will lie in state for three days as Kenyans view it before the burial on Wednesday in Kabarak. Some government officials also used the sign of the cross as they watched the body in a sombre mood. He was received by Deputy President William Ruto and Chief of the Defence Forces Samson Mwathethe amid tight security. Ruto arrived at Parliament buildings at around 9.50 am on Saturday accompanied by government officials. President Uhuru Kenyatta led the nation in viewing Mzee Moi's body after which government officials and diplomats had their chance to pay their last respect. Uhuru accompanied by First Lady Margaret Kenyatta arrived at exactly 10.15 am in a convoy accompanied by his security. He is going to be the first person to view the body of Moi before other Kenyans can be allowed to do so.
