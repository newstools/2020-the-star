High court Judge James Makau has declined to issue orders stopping Kiambu Governor James Nyoro from appointing a DG. The Judge on Monday said the appointment of a deputy governor is not a single act but a process. This was after former governor Ferdinand Waititu moved to court in a bid to stop the process last week. But judge Makau said today's proceedings cannot be turned into a hearing without giving the respondents an opportunity to be heard or even file their responses. "No order can be issued at this stage.. Waititu has not demonstrated what prejudice he will suffer," said the Judge. Nyoro through lawyer Kibe Mungai accused Waititu of amending his petition through the backdoor since there was no order stopping him from appointing a DG filed in court. More to follow
