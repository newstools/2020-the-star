@Waithaka06 Former Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Mwangi Kiunjuri has said that he will not be silenced by his sacking and will continue fighting for the rights of Mt Kenya people. Kiunjuri pledged on Sunday to persistently champion issues that affect residents by demanding for services from government and elected officials. He spoke at Nanyuki PCEA church where he was the chief guest during a funds drive. He urged all residents to demand effective services from all levels of government. Speaking his native Kikuyu laden with parables, Kiunjuri said that his tenure at the Agriculture ministry was excellent since he gave his best. "Let nobody point a finger at me saying that I did not perform at the ministry. I did the best I could. You do not accuse your wife of not cooking delicious meals yet you do not facilitate her to acquire the food you desire, "Kiunjuri said. The former Laikipia East MP said that Kenyans should be left to express their opinions freely, especially on matters of leadership and governance. "Just as we have freedom of religion in this country where all denominations preach to their congregation freely, Kenyans should also be free to express themselves as they with wish," Kiunjuri said. The former CS pledged he would not shy away from speaking his mind on issues affecting ordinary Kenyans. "I will not be afraid to speak to you today for the fear that tomorrow I might be asked to record a statement with the DCI or be summoned by the KRA," he said. Laikipia Senator John Kinyua, who was also present, urged Kiunjuri to fast-track the rollout of The Service Party (TSP) political outfit he is closely associated with. "I belong to a different political party but I believe TSP will steer this region to new heights politically, I urge you, Kiunjuri, to start popularising this party," he said. (Edited by V. Graham)
