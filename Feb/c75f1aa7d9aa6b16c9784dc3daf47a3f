The government now says all the passengers aboard a China Southern Airlines plane have been directed to self-quarantine for the next 14 days. Through the Ministry of Health, the government said the airline resumed its operations today after a temporary suspension and all the 239 passengers were screened and cleared on board. The response comes amid social media uproar on why a Chinese airline was cleared to land at JKIA amid the coronavirus outbreak. Kenyans on social media had asked whether the government was not mindful of its citizens. While some said it was still risky for the government to allow Chinese flights on its soil, others said the government should close its borders until the WHO declares the situation safe. A video went viral on social media capturing the airline land at the JKIA. The video showed some Chinese journalists wearing masks while KAA staff standing by side as they watched without any protection. According to the Ministry, it has so far investigated 17 alerts and all have tested negative for the Coronavirus. So far as at February 25, a total of 2,700 deaths have been reported with 80,239 cases being identified.
