Kitale RFC's founding patron Ben Amboko is confident of returning to the Kenya Rugby Union (KRU)  Championships next season. Speaking ahead of the Rift Valley Nationwide semi-final against Molo RFC this weekend, Amboko said: “We are heading back to KRU Championship. That is where we belong not Nationwide.” He added: “We played in KRU Championship for one season and we were relegated. However, this time, our target is to remain there and target the Kenya Cup. We are organised because we learnt our lessons.” Coach and player Alvin Odwako said his side is well prepared for the encounter against Molo. “We will definitely register a win this weekend,” said Odwako. Amboko thanked the club's patrons, sponsors and fans who have stood with the team in for the entire season. In the second Rift Valley semi-final, Kabarak University will host former KRU Championship side Moi University's Arsonists. In Western conference semis, Maseno University will welcome Jaramogi Oginga Odinga University of Science and Technology while CITAM Kisumu will entertain Bungoma RFC. In Nairobi, Shamas will be up against Administration Police as MKU Nairobi battle Daystar Falcons. Former KRU Championship side Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology will seek a comeback when they face off with MKU Thika in the Central region semi-finals. In the other semi, Kiambu face-off with Embu RFC. In coast, the Technical University of Mombasa and Malindi RFC will clash in the finals. TUM edged South Coast Buccaneers 30-0 while Malindi got a walkover after Shepherds failed to show up for the semi-final. Two teams will seek to replace relegated Kisii RFC in the KRU Championship.
