Nairobi Stima assistant coach Evans Mafuta yesterday backed Dennis Oalo to guide his team to the Kenya Premier League next season. Oalo returned to the club after six months stint at KPL champions Gor Mahia. “He will rediscover his form. He was only lacking playing time at Gor. He played during our game against Ushuru last weekend and he was brilliant for the 86 minutes he was on the pitch,” said Mafuta. He added: “If he plays like last season, then he will help us achieve our goal of qualifying to the Kenya Premier League. Oalo is a goal poacher and we thank Gor Mahia for loaning him back to us.” Oalo was top scorer in NSL last season, where he netted 24 goals—12 each for Kisumu All Stars and Nairobi Stima. He joined Gor Mahia where he signed a four-year contract but played less than six games for the KPL giants. Patrick Mugendi and Alex Luganji also returned to the power men on loan from Bandari. Other new signings are goalkeeper Edwin Mukolwe (Kangemi All Stars), Musa King'ori (Mt Kenya United), Philbert Ochieng (Shabana) and Ronals Okelo (Mathare United).  Those who departed are Jacob Osano, Eugene Wethuli, Daniel Opondo, Victor Ameno, Joshua Mahero, Francis Oduor, Fredrick Kimani and John Njoroge. “We didn't want to interfere with the team a lot because we remain on course for KPL promotion. We released players who we felt were not getting enough playing time. The new signings will give us an edge,” said Mafuta.
