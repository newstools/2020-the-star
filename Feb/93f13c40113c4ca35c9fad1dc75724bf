Former Nairobi Finance executive Pauline Kahiga on Monday dismissed claims she used her position to award tenders to a firm owned by her family. Kahiga, who was last Friday sacked in a cabinet reshuffle, is alleged to have used her position to award tenders to a company linked to her family â€“ Nanku Company (Kenya) Limited and other proxy companies. Nanku Limited is owned by Kahiga's mother Nancy Wanjiku Kahiga. It is said to be among companies listed to benefit from millions of shillings once the county clears its pending bills. Kahiga, however, confirmed to the Star that it was true that Nanku Ltd had contracts with City Hall but the almost 20 years engagements ended in 2017. "I came to the County Government of Nairobi in 2018 but the company completed its contract with City Hall in 2017. The company sought payments of Sh3.1 million for work done, was certified and confirmed in the financial year 2018-19. I was not serving in the finance docket then," she explained, terming the accusations malicious and ill-advised. Kahiga said she had declared her relations with Nanku Ltd before being vetted in 2018. "The company directors saw it best not to bid for any tenders at the county government to safeguard against the possibility of a conflict of interest," she stated. Since 2018 when Kahiga was vetted and approved by the county assembly, the company has not been awarded any new contracts by City Hall. Kahiga also rubbished claims that she has refused to hand over the Finance docket. She said there is a process that needs to be followed while transferring and gazetting Finance CECs prior to any handover.
