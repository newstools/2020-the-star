Turkana county has urged partners to involve them in their projects to avoid duplication of services. The Turkana ministry of health and sanitation has urged NGOs to cooperate with them and tell the county what they are working on. In that way services can be centralised, she said Turkana CEC for Health and Sanitation Jane Ajele said on Friday that if partners donâ€™t disclose their projects to them it could result in wastage and duplication of services. "Partners who don't disclose their projects to county government will undermine services. We may send our service teams to the same regions where partners are running the same projects," she said. She spoke during a meeting with partners working in the health sector. Ajele said more health workers will recruited to address the shortage of doctors and health workers. (Edited by V. Graham)
