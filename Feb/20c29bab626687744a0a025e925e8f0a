At least 13 pupils from Kakamega Primary School were killed during a stampede at the school on Monday evening. Another 39 students were injured andÂ rushed to the Kakamega County Referral Hospital. Kakamega Central police commander David Kabena confirmed the incident. Pupils reportedly started running out of the classrooms after a bell rung to go home. Some pupils said a teacher, who was behind the pupils, ordered them to leave quickly and they started running down the stairs. The pupils in front stumbled and fell and those behind also tripped. The staircase is narrow. Parents wailed as information about the deaths trickled in from the casualty department. Some of the pupils injured sustained fractures and soft tissue injuries while others suffered trauma. Two were critically injured.
