Sailors and Uganda's 'Parte After Parte' hitmaker Big Tril could be making a banger after Miracle baby said on Friday at the Ole Sereni Hotel that collaboration plans are underway. "Artistes talk to each other and when they meet, they attract each other, so a collabo is coming," said Sailors' lead singer Miracle Baby. Tril said he was impressed by the group's hitsong, 'Wamlambez'. "When it came out, it went viral and Ugandans were singing even without knowing what it means. Until I came to Kenya, that's when I knew what it meant," he said.
