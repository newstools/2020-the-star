A senator has asked residents of three counties where the Mau Mau road will pass to come out in large numbers for public participation. The 540km road is meant to honor Mau Mau freedom fighters and is designed to connect the four counties of Kiambu, Murang’a, Nyandarua and Nyeri. It is believed that the Mau Mau fighters used the route to hide from the British colonial police during the struggle for Independence. Senate Roads committee chairman Kimani Wamatangi said the road will cost Sh30 billion. The road will start at Gataka in Lari constituency, pass Kamburu and Nyanduma before entering Nyandarua and Murang'a counties all the way to Nyeri. "It is our request to people who live near or next to the earmarked areas where it will pass to come out in the public participation forums that have already started,” the senator said. “We appreciate all those who have participated in those meetings so far. There is no need for someone to be left with questions to ask their neighbours. It is better you ask the officials and leaders in a meeting." The public participation meetings are conducted by the Kenya National Highways Authority, which is in charge of the project. The senator said once the road is finished, it will help movement within the Mt Kenya region and support Central Economic Block. "The road is meant to honour the freedom fighters. It will mark out all the areas where our fighters passed," the senator said. He spoke in Lari constituency on Saturday when he visited the area.
