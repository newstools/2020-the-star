The body of Bishop Charles Oduor Awich who went missing in Ndere, Alego-Usonga sub-county in January this year, has been found at the Port Victoria Hospital mortuary in Busia County. The body of the bishop of Roho Judea Church who went missing amid reports that he had been abducted by unknown people from his home, was found on Friday. According to the Chairman of Siaya County Church leaders’ Forum Arch Bishop James Opiyo, his mutilated body which had several knife wounds has positively been identified by Awich’s wife Helen Auma Oduor. Bishop Opiyo told journalists that they got information that the body was taken to the mortuary by the police after it was found near the shores of the Lake Victoria. He faulted the manner in which the police had conducted investigations into the matter and petitioned the police to expedite the investigations, arguing that there was no way that they could claim to have been unable to give information more than one month since the cleric went missing. Siaya Sub-county Police Commander Justus Kucha confirmed the incident but said that they would be able to give more information regarding that matter later on. The Bishop went missing in early January 2020 amid claims that he had been abducted. His wife told detectives at the time that her husband had been involved in a land tussle with some of his relatives.
