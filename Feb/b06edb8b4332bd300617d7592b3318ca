The body of the former President Daniel Moi has left the Lee Funeral Home for Parliament Buildings ahead of the public viewing from today until Monday. The military truck carrying the body made its way from the Lee Funeral Home through Valley Road escorted in a military convoy. The casket was draped with the Kenyan flag. Military officers also walked side by side as motorbikes were seen accompanying them including the family members. KDF soldiers have lined up along the entire route to Parliament Buildings where the body is to lie in state for three days. It is expected that the casket will be wheeled by a carriage as happened with founding President Mzee Jomo Kenyatta in 1978. President Uhuru Kenyatta and First Lady Margaret will be the first to view the body at 1o.15 am. Other dignitaries led by Deputy President William Ruto will have an hour to view the body before members of the public are allowed in. There will be protocol officers present to guide the public with Comesa Grounds at KICC designated as the holding area. Mzee Moi's body which will be surrounded by KDF officers will be viewed from 8am to 5pm on Saturday, Sunday and Monday.
