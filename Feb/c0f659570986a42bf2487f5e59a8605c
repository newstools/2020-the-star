Jubilee secretary general Raphael Tuju underwent surgery at Kijabe Hospital before being airlifted to Karen Hospital in Nairobi, following an accident in Magina, Lari subcounty, along Nairobi-Nakuru highway. Kijabe Hospital CEO Dr Ken Muma said, "We cannot disclose anything about the surgery owing to the family and the hospital's confidentiality, but he had to undergo surgery." "It also remains a secret where these patients have been taken to. The hospitals are the choices of their families." Tuju was rushed to AIC Kijabe Hospital on Wednesday together with his bodyguard and driver by good Samaritans following an accident on their way to Kabarak to attend the burial of former late President Daniel Moi. They were later all airlifted separately to Nairobi. Tuju's car collided with a matatu belonging to Nuclear Sacco, which was heading towards Nairobi. Central police bossÂ  Mwarungu Kalimbo said the matatu rammed into a salon car at Magina as it slowed to negotiate a junction. He said the matatu driver lost control of the vehicle and swerved to the right side and collided with Tuju's Prado which was moving towards Nakuru. Witness Bedon Njonge said the matatu driver underestimated the speed at which the Prado was moving. Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua, CSs Amina Mohammed (Sports), Joe Mucheru (ICT) and James Macharia (Transport) visited Tuju in hospital.
