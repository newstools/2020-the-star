Home player Ayub Shitseswa changed the matrix in the second nine to win the Kenya Seed Golf Series title over the weekend on par 72 Kakamega Sports Club. Shitseswa carded 19 in the first nine and 21 points in the second top be Chrisandus Anyonyi on countback with both carding 40 points. Anyonyi played 22 in the first nine but dropped to 18 in the back nine. Shitseswa started badly with bogeys in the opening two holes par 5 and 4, dropped one in third par three, posted a double-bogeyed in 4 par 5 and dropped one in 5, 6 and 7 pars 3, 5 and 4. He further dropped two in 8 par 3 and concluded with a bogey in 9 par 4 for a total of 19 points. In the second nine, he dropped two on 10th par 5, one in 11th, 12th, 13th, 14th, 15th and 16th and sunk deep with a double bogey in 17th par 3. He recovered with a bogey in the 18th for 21 points to earn himself the title. Shitseswa, himself a greenkeeper who ensures that the grass is in good condition,  was a victim of fast running greens just like others. “I must say a win today came with luck following the hard course and fast-running greens. The greens were such that if you can't control the ball well, you lose,” said Shitseswa. Brisker Amusala won the junior title on 21 points with Edwin Ruto bagging staff prize and Ashaba Morris with 28 points taking the guest crown. Longest drive men title went to Nandi Bears' player Ely Barno while Faith Chemtai picked ladies title. Fred Oloibe was nearest to the pin winner.
