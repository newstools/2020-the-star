The Kirinyaga government has started to rehabilitate 200km of roads on the Mwea irrigation Scheme. The 16 roads within Mwea constituency have been in a sorry state for a long time, a situation which was compounded by the recent prolonged rains. Mwea Irrigation Scheme produces 80 per cent of the rice consumed in Kenya. The water canals that pass through the farms usually overflow, rendering the roads impassable. While launching the programme, Governor Anne Waiguru said the roads department is working day in, day out to ensure all the marked roads are graded or murramed before the long rains set in. The aim is to have well-drained all-weather roads across the county by 2022. The governor directed the engineers to repair at least 15 kilometres of roads every day. They are also to ensure that the quality of work is up to standard and that the roads will survive all seasons. Residents of Maruru A and Marura B who have witnessed progress on the road upgrade programme, have lauded the governor for heeding their cries. The residents from the two villages in Kangai ward narrated how they have been suffering, especially during the rainy seasons. “Water flowing over the road has always cut us off from walking across the village and no vehicle could pass through,” Margaret Waigumo said, adding that schoolchildren were the hardest hit by the poor state of the road. She said during the rains, parents have to wade through the floodwaters while carrying schoolchildren on their backs. Boda boda operators are optimistic that their businesses will thrive, and they will have an easy time transporting rice and other farm produce to the market. The county road improvement programme for this year covers 1,420km. Of the number, 220km will be murramed and 1,200km graded.
