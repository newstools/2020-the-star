Tanasha Donna has responded to trolls after she gave what fans termed as a 'terrible' performance during her EP launch on Friday. Tanasha said she did not have enough time to prepare for her performance. “Could be better, but for a first with only two days' rehearsals. I did my best! I know next time will keep getting better! ” read Tanasha’s response after a fan asked her what she thought about her performance. In another post, she thanked those who supported her. "Don't let bitter, judgemental & unhappy people drag you to their level. Instead, use their behaviour as an example of how not to behave and be grateful you are nothing like them. Leave all to God. Let him deal with them, he never disappoints." Her baby daddy Diamond Platnumz, who was scheduled to perform at the launch, flew back to his country to attend to a ‘family emergency’ and missed the event.
