@magatinews A primary school teacher who went missing in Kisii a week ago has been found dead. Peter Barongo went missing on Tuesday last week after a teachers' meeting at Ibacho. His body was retrieved from River Chirichiro in Masaba South with the help of villagers. Relatives claimed Barongo was murdered and his body dumped in the river at night. He was living alone at Friends shopping centre, a kilometre away from Emonga Primary in Kiamokama village where he was a teacher. Barongo was from Riangabi village in Nyaribari Chache. The villagers have been looking for him since he went missing. There were claims the teacher passed by some local bar on his way home where it is believed he was kidnapped by his killers. Neighbour Albert Onchonge said although Barongo loved drinking, he rarely caused trouble. "He was not known to harass other revellers," Onchonge said. He added, "He was a dedicated teacher serving the community's children with unwavering devotion." Onchonge said Barongo might have been killed after some disagreement in one of the dens where he often had his drink. "We are not ruling out murder in this, and we want the police to undertake investigations and bring to book those involved," he said. Kisii county police commander Jebel Munene said they had launched investigations. "We appeal to people to volunteer any information that can help in bringing the culprits to book, " Munene said.  edited by peter obuya
