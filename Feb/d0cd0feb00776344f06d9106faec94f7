The Kenya Red Cross was on Wednesday evening able to contain a fire at a 40-bed capacity dormitory housing Form Two students at Upper Hill High School in Nairobi. No casualties were reported. The cause of the fire is yet to be established. Principal Peter Mwea said students were having supper when the fire started. "We saw the fire and rushed to put it out with the students," he said. The affected dormitory was in Wing 8. Students were able to salvage bedding, but dozens of boxes with students belongings and beds were destroyed. The roof almost caved in as the timber supporting it was burnt.
