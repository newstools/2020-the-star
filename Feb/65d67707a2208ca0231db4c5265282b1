Good evening, A photo doing the rounds on social media purporting to be of ex-CS Rashid Echesa and DP William Ruto's daughter June is false. Meanwhile, 4,811 students have not been traced in the secondary school transition drive, and Kakamega stampede victims' parents are yet to receive compensation. These are the stories making headlines on the Star this evening. A photo of former Sports CS Rashid Echesa with Deputy President William Ruto's daughter June Ruto has gone viral on social media alleging that the two met in Poland to negotiate part of what has come out as the fake military arms deal. But are these claims true? The Education ministry has been unable to trace 4,811 candidates who sat last year's KCPE exam as it wraps up the secondary transition drive. CS George Magoha on Tuesday said, "We have achieved 99.8 per cent, which in my capacity as a government officer is 100 per cent because the 0.2 per cent is not statistically significant." A Milimani court on Tuesday withdrew the hate speech charges against former Machakos Senator Johnson Muthama and Makadara MP George Aladwa. The ruling by chief magistrate Francis Andayi came following a High Court ruling that declared section 96A of the penal code unconstitutional. The government in partnership with the World Bank has committed Sh 15 billionÂ  to improve energy access in 14 counties with low electrification rates. President Uhuru Kenyatta pointed out that through the off-grid solar access initiative, the government seeks to provide energy to 250,000 households and more than 800 public facilities in the 14 counties. Parents of the 15 Kakamega Primary School pupils who perished in a stampede will wait longer to receive money raised during a joint prayer service 10 days ago. The national government, teacher unions and Western leaders donated Sh5.3 million but some of the parents complained they had not received the donation despite the money having been raised to support funeral expenses.
