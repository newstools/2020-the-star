The late President Daniel Moi rewarded hardworking civil servants to improve services in the public sector. Senate Speaker Kenneth Lusaka, who is also a  former Baringo District Officer, said Moi was privy to developments in the public service sector. He spoke on Saturday at the late president’s home after he visited the family together with National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi. Lusaka said that Moi always reached out to the officers in the public service to congratulate,  support or guide them during his 24 years tenure as the country's head of state. “We first met when I was a small DO in his home district and he never forgot me. He promoted me to a District Officer in Kajiado following the good work I did in Baringo,” Lusaka said. "Moi knew us by name after we introduced ourselves." “He was a good leader,” Muturi told Moi’s son and Baringo Senator Gideon Moi. The visit comes a day after the family of the late retired President welcomed Deputy President William Ruto to mourn with them at their home. Moi will be buried on Wednesday at his Kabarak home. The first day of public viewing of Mzee Moi's body took place on Saturday. His body will lie in state for three days.
