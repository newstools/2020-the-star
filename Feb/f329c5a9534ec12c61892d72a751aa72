ODM leaders on Wednesday trooped to the late President Daniel Moi's residence in Kabarnet Gardens, Nairobi to console with the family of the country's second president. The leaders were led by Siaya Senator James Orengo. The Senate Minority Leader Orengo described the late Moi as a leader who used different aspects of leadership while in power. Orengo said Moi was a sensitive leader and made his decisions at the right time. "You need to paint Moi's legacy with a big brush and then you will see the substantial things he did to education but if you paint it with a small brush then you will begin to think about democracy and human right violations," Orengo said. The senator said the country could have been on the wrong side if Mzee Moi had not announced his intention to repeal Section 2(A) of the constitution which allowed multipartyism in the country. Migori governor Okoth Obado said Moi was a hardworking leader who encouraged Kenyans to be self-reliant. "We all remember how he used to encourage people of this country to go back to their farms and to be self-reliant," Obado said. Mzee Moi died on Tuesday at the Nairobi Hospital where he was being treated. His son Gideon Moi said Mzee Moi died peacefully at 5am while being surrounded by his family members. The former President will receive top military and civilian honours in an elaborate state funeral at his Kabarak home. The family of the country's second president on Tuesday said the State had taken over the funeral programme. According to the plan, there will be a public viewing of the body from Saturday to Monday next week. A funeral service will be held on Tuesday before the burial on Wednesday next week. The Head of the Public Service Joseph Kinyua will lead the arrangements for the funeral likely to be attended by continental and world leaders. More:
