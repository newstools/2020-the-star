Tejveer Singh Rai will pilot the latest super car on Kenyan soil ahead of the new rally season which gets underway in Stoni Athi this weekend. His new VW Polo R5, which is eligible to score WRC-2 points, will be among the cars to start at this Sunday’s KCB Guru Nanak Rally. The WRC-2, formerly known as Super 2000 World Rally Championship or S-WRC, is a companion rally series to the WRC, limited to production-based cars homologated under the Super 2000, N4, R5 rules. The new drive marks the start of Tejveer’s spirited wait for the 2020 WRC Safari Rally which will kick-start the second half of the FIA global rally series in July. The Kabras Sugar Racing ace driver is seeded third behind former S Class Champion Karan Patel and Eric Bengi as per the new KNRC rotational seeding system which will now revolve around the top 8 Premier Class drivers. Although no one knows what’s up Tejveer sleeves, the premier class man is anticipated to call the shots behind the wheel of a state-of-the-art R5, by and large, the sixth to hit Kenyan gravel. Tej, as he is amiably referred to, in rallying circles, will get his 2020 KNRC season going in a similar R5 contraption that his younger sibling Onkar Rai drove last season. Onkar won the 2019 season opening home event, sealing an unprecedented hat-trick of Nakuru Rally wins in the crowd-pleasing R5 Skoda Fabia. He later upgraded to a VW Polo R5, believed to be the fastest rally car on Kenyan soil at the present.
