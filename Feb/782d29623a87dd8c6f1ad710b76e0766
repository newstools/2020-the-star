Today is Valentine's Day, and media personality Julie Gichuru has come out to defend the boy child while also challenging the girl child to practise some of the equality we always hear so much about coming from the fairer sex. In a powerful post on her Instagram page, the former Citizen TV news anchor addressed men and women separately. To the men, Julie advised her “sons” not to bow to the pressure of delivering beyond their means. She said if a man feels pressured to spend beyond his means, he should seek a woman who is more understanding. “To my sons, there is no need to feel pressure to deliver what is beyond your means or even simply imprudent or impractical,” she wrote. "One rose and your time is more than enough, and any woman worth her salt would get it. If you feel pressured to live beyond your means, maybe you need to look for the woman who will be your friend, partner and equal. Give love, respect and attention every day. That is the true gift." And to her “daughters”, Julie challenged them to spoil their men if they can. “To my daughters, there is nothing more empowering than deciding to break the mould and take control. Get him a rose. Give him a gift. Take the driver's seat and spoil him if you can," she wrote.
