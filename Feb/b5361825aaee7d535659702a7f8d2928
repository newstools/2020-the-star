Kiambu county plans to build an animal feed manufacturing plant in Kirenga village, Lari Kirenga ward. It says the area has a lot of dairy cattle, pigs and poultry, hence the need to improve its farming activities. Area MCA Joseph Karichu said the factory will be built next to Kirenga Stadium for Sh300 million. He said the county will monitor the quality of feed. Residents approved the decision. "We have heard farmers complaining about using a lot of money with animal feed, but the quality of products is poor and little to realise profits," Karichu said. He spoke on Tuesday during a public-participation exercise in Kirenga Stadium. Karichu was accompanied by subcounty administrator Dominic Kariuki. Residents urged the county government to consider them when hiring employees. Dairy farmer Stephen Kuria said vacancies should be filled by residents. He also called for opportunities that can be utilised for self-employment in different sectors such as transport. "We need to see bodaboda working near and people cooking near the factory where workers can come and eat," he said.
