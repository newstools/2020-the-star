Mwamba coach Kevin Wambua is wary of the threat posed by the Nondies in their final pool match of the Kenya Cup on Saturday. Kulabu, as they are fondly known, sit fifth on the log with 38 points and just require a point to cement their place on the log. Mwamba upset Impala 15-11 last weekend to keep their playoffs alive and Wambua is demanding an improvement in their final pool match with the playoffs looming. The coach said the team should have sealed the game against the Sarries with a dominant performance in the second half where they created several try-scoring opportunities. “We made too many handling errors and if we can keep the ball longer in the opponents 22 in the attack, then we will score tries,” he added. Wambua, who is also the Kenya Sevens' assistant coach, was delighted with the set-piece especially the lineout and the scrum as well the line speed in defence. “I was happy with our lineout. We won almost all our throws and disrupted theirs and our scrum was solid to create a platform for our backs," noted Wambua. It was sweet revenge for Mwamba who had lost the first leg encounter last year and Wambua hailed the mentality of his players in the dying minutes. "The boys were tested mentally and physically in the closing stages but our character and never say die attitude kept us going,” he added. The Mwamba tactician asked his charges not to underestimate Nondies as the playoff race is still wide open. “ It will be a tough game. Nondies are strong up front and will test us. We need to have momentum before we go to the playoffs,” observed Wambua. Sixth-placed Menengai Oilers have to beat Quins to secure a playoff position while cross-town rivals Nakuru have to earn a bonus-point win and hope other results go their way to make it. Mwamba reached the semifinals last year, losing to Kabras 23-13 in Kakamega.
