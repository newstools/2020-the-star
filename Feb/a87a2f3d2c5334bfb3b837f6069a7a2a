Chapa Dimba Na Safaricom Youth tournament Eastern region will crown a new champion in Machakos this weekend after last season's winners were eliminated in the group stage. Last season’s winners Supersolico from Mwingi and St. Mary’s Ndovea from Makueni were eliminated from the group stage. Eight boys and girls’ teams will take part, hoping to emerge  champions and get a chance to represent the region at the national finals set for June. In the boys’ semis, Tumaini School from Makueni face Biashara from Moyale as Meru's Black Panthers  take on St. Daniels from Chuka. In the girls’ category, Isiolo Queens entertain Moyale's  Mabuu Queens as former champions Ngakaa Talent from Makueni play Chuka University. Ngakaa coach Boniface Ndambuki believes the tournament is ideal for the girls to express their talent as they seek to enhance their potential. “Through this competition, young players gain exposure and a chance to showcase their talent. "Football stakeholders watch the competition, increasing the chances of players getting scouted to play for top clubs and also the national team like we have seen with Harambee Starlets,” said Ndambuki. The three-day regional final will kick off with life skills and mentorship clinics for players today.  Semis and finals are slated for tomorrow and Sunday respectively. The winners will walk away with Sh200,000 while the losing finalists will pocket half the amount.
