US ambassador to Kenya Kyle McCarter was on Thursday stuck in an elevator, moments before he was about to deliver a speech on HIV. "Believe it or not I got stuck in an elevator just before giving a speech announcing good news of HIV success in Kenya," he said. "Never happened to me before but now I have a story to tell. Lesson is always take the stairs at a health event. Just makes sense!" In the picture shared by the ambassador, he was seen in the elevator with other officials as they took selfies. "...But none of us were overweight. All trim and healthy. Lol," he added via  Twitter. According to the new report launched, Kenya has cut new HIV infections by nearly half since 2017. About 36,000 adults were infected with HIV in 2018, compared to about 52,800 newly-infected people in 2017 and 101,560 in 2013. The sharp reduction was attributed to the use of prevention tools like condoms and high viral suppression levels among those infected.
