Two suspects of carjacking have been arrested in Ruiru. The two were arrested by DCI detectives following an incident where a car was hijacked within the area last week. The suspects are a 37-old Peter Irungu Maina and Eunice Masiado Nteita who is aged 18 years. Maina was arrested in Kinangop while Eunice was arrested in Suswa area. The sleuths managed to trace and recover the vehicle of registration number  KCX 750T. The two are waiting to be arraigned in court as efforts to trace the owner of the vehicle continue. In September last year, residents of Kiambu raised concerns over the rise in incidences of carjacking in the area. They claimed cases of carjacking and highway robbery could rise if Traffic police on the Nairobi-Nakuru highway are not allowed to inspect vehicles, especially in the Kiambu county section. Residents claimed they had not been boarding any public service vehicle at stages. They said that on two consecutive days, thugs used a Toyota Hiace car to rob them of their money and valuables. A victim, Mary Njeri said she was traveling to Kimende town and boarded a matatu at the Nyambare stage after the crew agreed to charge her Sh20. However, after moving less than a kilometre, she was asked to lock the door. She was seated at the front seat. She said the crew robbed her of two mobile phones and cash before slowing down the vehicle and asking her to collect her phone on the road. “I was so shocked. By the time I stepped out, the vehicle had sped off and I only read its plate number as KAM. I cannot recall the rest,” she said.
