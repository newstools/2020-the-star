Africa Cross Country champion Alfred Barkach will be seeking to defend his continental title when this year's edition set for Lome, Togo gets underway on April 8. Barkach is among 36 athletes selected following Saturdayâ€™s national cross country championships cum trials held at the Ngong Racecourse. World Under-20 cross country champion Beatrice Chebet leads the women's team following the withdrawal of Commonwealth Games 10,000m silver medalist Stacy Ndiwa. Athletics Kenya vice president in charge of competitions, Paul Mutwii, observed that the team is very competitive going by the performances of the individual athletes during the trials and the cross country circuit. "This is a very strong team despite the absence of some of the top runners like Geoffrey Kamworor and Sheila Chelangat, who finished second and first in the senior men and women's races respectively," said Mutwii. "We are used to winning at such championships and this will be no different. Despite the withdrawal of some of the top runners, we feel that this is a very strong team going by what we witnessed during the trials and the circuit." The team is expected to report to camp at the Kigari Teachers' Training College, Embu County, on March 22 before traveling to Togo on April 6.
