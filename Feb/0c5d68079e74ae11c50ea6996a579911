Two Al Shabaab militia believed to be the masterminds of the deadly attack at a KDF-US military base in Lamu have been killed. United States Africa Command on Tuesday said the duo, husband and wife wereÂ  Shabaab leaders who led the brazen assault in the Manda Bay base. The two were killed in an airstrike in Somalia on February 22. "The two terrorists were identified as a senior al Shabaab leader who was in charge of planning and directing terrorist operations on the Kenyan border region, including the recent attack on Manda Bay, and his wife, who was also a witting and active member of al shabaab responsible for facilitating a wide range of terrorist activities," US AFRICOM said in the statement. The command said the airstrike occurred in the vicinity of Saakow, located approximately 320 kilometers west of Mogadishu. The attack preceded another attack in Dujuuma on February 23, where three terrorists were wounded and another in Jilib where a terrorist was killed yesterday. The January 5 Manda Bay pre-dawn attack left three Americans dead other two wounded and six air crafts damaged. Kenyan and US commandos engaged the attackers and killed five of them and recovered 1 PKM gun, 4 RPG launchers, 4 AK 47 rifles, 1 hand grenade and assorted ammunition. Despite the government's efforts to counter-terrorism activities in the country, parts on North Eastern have continued to experience small-scale attacks which has claimed the lives of several people this year.
