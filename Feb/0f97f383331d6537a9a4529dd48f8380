Tanzanian singer Mzungu Kichaa marked a decade mark in the music industry last year with a Denmark tour. He is in the country to gift his fans with his new album, "Huyu Nani?" "I called it this name because even after 10 years in the game, people still don't know who Mzungu Kichaa is. I think I've tried my best in this album to talk about myself so fans know who I really am," he told Word Is on Monday. "I started making music in 2009 but in 1999, I helped to create Bongo Flava with Juma Nature. I shared the mic with TID and I have been doing this for a long time. I try to make Bongo Flava music. The cover song, 'Nani Huyu', has some old-school sound." On this album, Mzungu features legendary singer Lady Jaydee, King Kiki, FidQ and Sauti Sol. "I knew Sauti Sol when they were starting out. We connected with their first producer and we've been friends since then, and I did this collabo called 'Asha Wangu'. It is a rework of a classic song called 'Fanta Wangu'." "They have conquered various African markets and I respect that move. It's important to work on your local market," he said. He went on to tell the story of his nickname, Mzungu Kichaa. "I was coming from Mombasa and someone saw my T-shirt written Mzungu Kichaa and they thought it was very strange because it's not something you could choose to wear," he said. "I got the name at P Funk Majani's studio, while I was working behind the scenes. I didn't have a name, so Juma Nature started calling me Mzungu Kichaa. At first, I didn't like it but years later, I decided to embrace it." Mzungu has pointed out Octopizzo, Abbas Kubaf and Eric Wainaina as artistes he likes in Kenya.
