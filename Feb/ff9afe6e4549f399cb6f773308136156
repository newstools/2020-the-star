National League champions Ulinzi Warriors will enter two sides in next month’s Tom Munyama Memorial tournament. Coach William Balozi disclosed that this is the only way he will give all his charges ample playing time as they prepare for their title defence. “I want to go full blast when the Premier League starts in March and this tournament will help me assess all my players before the season tips off,” Balozi noted. He said he will be in charge of one team while ex-Warrior play-maker Esther Butali will take care of the other side. “We are coming from a two-week bonding session in Nakuru. The players are focused and their morale is sky-high. They are rearing to go,” he said. Balozi said he has plans to beef up the soldiers front court ahead of the new season set to throw off on March 21. The tactician revealed that he is in the process of acquiring two new players to beef up his frontcourt. “I have already identified the players who I have in mind for the job. Once all is sealed, I will release their names,” said Balozi. The duo, he said, together with David Ouma, who is returning to the side, will give the team extra strength during the rigorous season ahead. “We have welcomed Davy back after completing his training. The two others who finished together with him will start at the lower level,” he said. Balozi said he intends to build a strong side from the start to retain the league and also the lucrative Basketball Association League (BAL). “I want to have the squad ready from the start. We have a league title to defend and we are also eyeing the BAL qualifiers. We want to make a mark there as well,” he said. According to Kenya Basketball Federation (KBF) competitions secretary Joseph Amoko, the league starts March 21.
