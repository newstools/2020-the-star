Despite being tortured, detained and stripped of his Kenyan citizenship under the leadership of retired President Moi, Sheikh Khalid Balala holds no grudge. Popularly known as Ocampo, Salim was accused of treason in 1991. He was thrown in jail and later released before being stripped of his citizenship and deported. One would hold a grudge against his tormentors, but speaking to the Star Ocampo said Moi was a great leader who needs to be celebrated. He said he does not hold a personal grudge against Moi despite undergoing torture under his regime. "I  do not have grudges or vengeance," he said. Ocampo said alongside other democracy fighters, he fought for freedom of the people from the hands of Moi's regime. He said his personal life must be sieved from his style of ruling "which was brutal and full of human rights abuse." His personal life portrayed him as a good leader who cared for his people, especially children considering his introduction of free milk to all school-going children, Ocampo said. "Despite all that, it is not in my place to judge him. We cannot pay evil with evil." In 1991, Ocampo alongside others founded the Islamic Party of Kenya – a party that was perceived to be an opposition to Moi's rule This led to his arrest and charging at the Voi court where he was accused of treason for allegedly imagining the President's death. Two years later, he was acquitted and went back to his home to find that his documents had been stolen in a break-in. Upon renewal, his passport was withdrawn the same day it was issued by an official from the immigration office. Last year, Ocampo was awarded Sh6 million as compensation for torture. However, he said he had appealed the ruling as he feels he deserved more. Edited by R.Wamochie
