A woman was shot dead on Tuesday night in Mikindani within Jomvu subcounty and an undisclosed amount of money stolen. According to police reports, she had just closed a hardware shop when she was attacked by a gang of three people armed with a pistol. She was pronounced dead on arrival at Bomu Hospital in Mombasa. The suspects escaped on a motorcycle. Police in Changamwe are detaining a suspect caught trying to steal from an M-Pesa shop on Wednesday morning. Changamwe subcounty police commander Ali Ndiema confirmed that the suspect was in a group of three armed robbers that invaded the M-Pesa shop and ordered employees to surrender money. He was arrested by members of the public after they noticed the pistol did not have bullets. Ndiema said they are investigating to establish if the same pistol was used to murder the woman in Jomvu. The two other suspects escaped. Ndiema suspected the gang is responsible for attacks on M-Pesa shops in the past in Mombasa. Last week on Thursday, armed robbers invaded an M-Pesa shop in Chaani, Changamwe, and stole Sh1.2 million. They escaped on a motorbike. In one month, five people have been killed by armed robbers who took money. The victims include a Kenya Ports Authority employee who was shot at dockworkers office in Makupa. Some Sh1.5 million was stolen. Other incidents have been reported in Nyali, Kisauni and Jomvu and Changamwe subcounties. On Sunday, two suspected robbers were shot dead in Shanzu. Kisauni police boss Julius Kirago said they were part of a gang that has been stealing from M-Pesa shops in Mombasa. Police also recovered a pistol from them. Edited by R.Wamochie
