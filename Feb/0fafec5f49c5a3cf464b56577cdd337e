With their hopes of reclaiming a place in the top tier fading with each game, Ushuru coach James ‘Odijo’ Omondi has promised  to turn around things when they come up against Kibera Black Stars in one of nine National Super League matches lined up this weekend. The Taxmen lost 2-0 to Nairobi Stima last time out and will be aiming to bounce back against Black Stars if they are to revive their promotion hopes. Ushuru are currently at position six with 36 points from 22 matches, 19 shy of league leaders Nairobi City Stars. “We are happy with our progress despite losing our match against Nairobi Stima last time out,” said coach Omondi. “We were blunt. We had chances to kill the game but we didn’t. We are working on our attack and we are focused on our match against Black Stars this weekend,” he added. Ushuru FC top scorer, Brian Yakhama having scored a total of 13 goals this season, also exuded confidence in the team’s ability to make it to the Premier League next season. “We as a team are hopeful of winning the match against Kibera Black Stars and I am confident we can make it to the KPL next season,” said Yakhama. Mt Kenya United will also be up against APS Bomet in an early kickoff at Camp Toyoyo tommorow while on Sunday, City Stars will look to extend their lead at the top when they face Coast Stima.
