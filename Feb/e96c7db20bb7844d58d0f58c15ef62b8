Neno Evangelist Pastor Nganga camped in Kajiado last week, praying for the country. Speaking to Word Is on Friday, the man of God told Word Is he has been there for five days, praying for the country. "It is not normal that the country has been invaded by desert locusts and having rain in the month of January," he said. "I am here to repent our sins and ask God for forgiveness because something is wrong somewhere and also ask God for His visitation. God bless you all." Nganga said prayers will solve our problems. "Nyenyekeeni and may God bless you wherever you are. Call the Lord and he will hear your prayers," he said. He said the country needs to have real men of God to intervene for us. "If we had real men of God, they would have told us what God wants us to do. We are men of God, but not well embraced," Nganga said. "The people who have been embraced as men of God in this country are the wagangas and that is who even our politicians run to during elections." This is not the first time pastor Nganga has gone to pray in the wilderness. Last year, an undated video of him donning sackcloth and at some point pouring dust over his head as a sign of submission went viral. Nganga added that he is building a Jerusalem city-kind of church in Kajiado country. He said he wants to leave a positive legacy in Kenya by building a megachurch in Kajiado and the capital city. "I have started building another church in Kajiado, which will look like Jerusalem city," he said.
