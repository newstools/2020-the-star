 Former Moyale MP Mohamed Malicha Galgallo was laid to rest in Moyale town on Saturday following his death a day earlier after a long illness. Galgallo served as Moyale MP between 1983 and 1988 when he lost the seat toÂ Philip Galma Godana. He made a comeback in the 1992 general election and served as an assistant minister in former President Daniel Moi's government. Galgallo lost his seat again in the 1997 election but was nominated to Parliament by the Ford Kenya party between 1997 and 2002. Throughout his leadership, he was passionate about uplifting the livelihoods of residents of the marginalised north according to leaders who spoke at the funeral. Marsabit Governor Mohamud Ali said they lost an icon who stood for peace and unity of the communities in the region. He described the former MP as an educator, peace lover and defender of community interests. Ali said Galgallo was vocal on unity and peace even after retiring from active politics. The governor urged residents to fulfill his dream by embracing unity and love. Ali said Galgallo was among his political advisers before he fell sick. "Moyale people will celebrate his good service in fighting illiteracy and standing for peace," the governor said. He said the county government will pay for the funeral expenses. The burial was attended by Marsabit Senator Godana Hargura, MPs Qalicha Gufu (Moyale), Dido Ali Raso (Saku), Chachu Ganya (North Horr), Safia Sheik Adan (Marsabit), Rehema Jaldesa (Isiolo), Marsabit Deputy Governor Solomon Gubo, Isiolo county speaker Hussein Golicha and several MCAs. The leaders described Galgallo's loss as a blow to the upper eastern region. The former MP died at the age of 68 and was buried at the Butiye graveyard according to Muslim custom.  edited by peter obuya
