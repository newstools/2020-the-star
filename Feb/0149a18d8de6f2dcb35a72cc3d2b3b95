The Siaya County Assembly resumes sittings on Tuesday after a two-month recess. Discussion of the Siaya County Cooperatives Development Fund Bill, 2019 will be top of the assembly's agenda. The other legislations to be considered are the Siaya County Public Entertainment and Amenities Bill, 2017, the Siaya County Gender Equality and Women Empowerment Bill, 2017, the Siaya County Anti-Pornography Bill, 2017 and the Siaya County Fire and Rescue Services Bill, 2018. The assembly committees are also expected to receive a budget proposal from the executive for discussion. The assembly will also discuss the Finance, Trade, Industry and Cooperatives Development Bill to report on the county government's quarterly reports and financial statements for the quarters ending September 30, 2019 and December 2019. The watchdog committee is expected to report on its consideration of the Auditor General's report on the financial statements of Siaya Education Bursary Fund for the 15-month period ending June 30, 2017. Speaker George Okode said the county assembly will not deviate from its cardinal mandates of legislation, oversight and representation. He challenged the MCAs to deliver on their mandate with dedication and enthusiasm. “As we begin the new session, I hope that the great strides we made in the third session of the second assembly in entrenching parliamentary democracy will motivate all of us to achieve much more during this Session,” Okode said.
