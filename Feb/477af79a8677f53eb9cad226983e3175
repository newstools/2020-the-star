Embattled Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has called on political leaders to embrace national unity. Speaking on Sunday at Parliament Buildings, Sonko rooted for the quashing of tribal political affiliation and asked his fellow elected leaders to avoid aligning themselves and marshaling political support on tribal lines. "Every time, Mzee Moi spoke about unity, and he always did this in every corner of this country, actually we have done a lot on matters distributing free milk to schools in Nairobi,” he said. The county boss also stated that the late former President Moi had a way of inclusivity thus making all communities feel part of the government. As a result, the Governor called on his fellow 47 county bosses to emulate the late President Moi when they make public appointments. "Mzee Moi set a big precedence on matters of national unity and appointments that reflected the true face of Kenya and as leaders we have to consider everyone without looking at their tribe or political inclination and give them an equal opportunity,” Sonko said. This is the Governor’s first public appearance despite his dates with the courts. He was accompanied by a few MCAs where he joined Kenyans in paying the last respect to the second President of Kenya, whose body is lying-in-state at Parliament Buildings.
