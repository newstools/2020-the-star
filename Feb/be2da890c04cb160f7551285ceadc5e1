When she walked into the hospital to give birth to twins, Linda Kinya did not expect a nightmarish experience. Kinya delivered twins through caesarian section but suffered paralysis due to alleged negligence. She sued St John of God Hospital Tigania and its trustees. High Court judge Alfred Mabeya awarded her Sh25.6 million last year on September 19 after the hospital was found liable. However, Kinya will not receive the entire sum because the Appeal Court has suspended implementation of the award. allowing the hospital time to file an appeal. Appeal judges Martha Koome, Fatuma Sichale and Sankale Kantai allowed the hospital time to file its papers on condition that it deposits Sh12.8 million in an interest-earning joint account run by lawyers of both sides. Of the Sh12.8 million, Sh5 million is to be released to Kinya immediately. The money ought to be deposited within one month, the appeal judges held. They said they are persuaded the intended appeal by the hospital is arguable and allowed the plea for temporary suspension of execution of the payment. In its appeal, the hospital said the trial court erred in applying the law on the issue of liability and ended up giving two high awards which had not been pleaded or even proved. The hospital said its defence had not been properly considered. It is claimed that the judge erred in law and fact in awarding Sh3,240,000 as loss of earnings when there was no evidence to support the earning andÂ  further using too high a multiplier.
