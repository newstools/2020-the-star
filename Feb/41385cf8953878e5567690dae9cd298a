A Budalangi residents' lobby has called on area Member of Parliament Raphael Wanjala to resume construction of the stalled Sango Teachers Training College. Mau Mau Bunge La Mwananchi chairman Godfrey Wanjala said there was an urgent need to revive the facility because residents will get economic benefits once it is operational. The project was started under the former Budalangi CDF committee but has stalled. The committee allocated a total of Sh13.5 million during the financial years 2016 and 2017 but works are still incomplete. Wanjala said the existence of the teachers training institution in Bunyala South will attract investors who will provide employment opportunities for the youths. The investors will also create a conducive business environment for local traders, he said. Wanjala also called upon the area MP to liaise with the Ministry of Education to ensure the teachers training college is registered. “We want the youths from the area to join the TTC and train as teachers. I believe this would go a long way in addressing unemployment among the youths,” Wanjala said.
