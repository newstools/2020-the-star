Senate Speaker Kenneth Lusaka has suspended the planned investigations of the transfer of Nairobi County functions to the National Government. The speaker temporary halted the directive that was issued by his deputy Kithure Kindiki to two house committees to probe the deal after a four-hour debate on the floor. The debate was occasioned by Majority Leader Kipchumba Murkomen who sought an adjournment motion to discuss the matter. "This matter remains suspended until Tuesday 2.30pm when I will give a comprehensive ruling," he said. Lusaka's direction follows an intervention by Minority leader James Orengo. The Siaya Senator said Kindiki's ruling was unprocedural and went against the standing orders. According to Orengo adjournment motions should should not have resolutions at the end of a debate. "Mr.Speaker, I wish to urgent you to review this decision. The decision he (Kindiki) made was unprocedural," he said. Orengo was supported by Samuel Pogishio (West Pokot) and Ledama Olekina (Narok) who erred Kindiki for his directives. "I have been very surprised that a matter on a motion of adjournment will only be referred to any committee. It is crucial that we stick to procedures," he said.
