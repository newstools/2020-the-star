Joseph Irungu alias Jowie has been released on Sh2m cash bail over the murder of businesswoman Monica Kimani. Jowie who was given an alternative bond of Sh3m and released on Thursday by a Milimani Law court. Making the ruling, Justice James Wakiaga said there are no compelling reason to deny the accused bail. Noting that the circumstances have already changed, Justice Wakiaga said  witnesses under witness protection have already testified to his case. The judge further ruled that the strength of the prosecution case is not a ground alone to deny the accused person bail. But he ordered Jowie not to comment on the case on social media or anywhere. He was also asked to report to the chief every end month. Jowie was arrested on September 25, 2018 and spent Christmas in remand. In June 18, 2019, the High Court declined to grant Jowie bail for the second time. Justice Wakiaga dismissed Irungu’s application for bail review on grounds that it was premature and lacked merit. Fresh details emerged in the Monica Kimani murder case. A statement by Brian Kasaine showed why police believe that Joseph 'Jowie' Kuria and his then-fiancee,  TV Journalist Jacque Maribe – murdered Monica. Another statement by investigating officer Maxwell Otieno of the Directorate of Criminal Investigations also outlined events that could have led to the murder. Kasaine, who had been arrested and then released in connection with the murder, gives details of Jowie's activities on the night of the murder as well as the days that followed.
