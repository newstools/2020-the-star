Kisumu RFC's chances of surviving in Kenya Cup have been dealt a major blow after two key players were ruled out for the rest of the season due to injuries. Coach Brian Makalama said Evans Asilibwa is out for the rest of the season and so is Oscar Othonje. The two were among five players who were injured in an accident at Kinungi on the Nakuru-Nairobi Highway two weeks ago. He, however, said Ian Odongo, Gideon Magak and Walter Mikanga will be in contention for selection this weekend against Mwamba at Mamboleo Agricultural Society of Kenya grounds. During the game, the club will hold a fundraiser dubbed Kikao Nyama Choma where one will pay Sh2, 000 for three beers and roast meat. Makalama said he expects a tough match against Mwamba but wants his charges to give their all and win the game. “It is possible to beat Mwamba if we put it in our minds. Mwamba are fighters but my boys are ready for the game,” said Makalama. Kisumu is languishing at the bottom of the Kenya Cup table with only five points and a loss to Mwamba will all but condemn them back to the KRU Championship. Last week, Kisumu skipped their Enterprise Cup game against Mwamba to concentrate on the league.
