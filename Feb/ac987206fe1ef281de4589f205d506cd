He lived in a single room measuring approximately 15 by 10 meters at a servant’s quarter in Imara Daima Estate, Nairobi. That was where his lifeless body was found lying a few metres from the door with his Ceska pistol beside him. The floor had some dry blood, a sign that the officer could have died a few days before the body was discovered. That was the home of AP Sergeant Kipyegon Kenei who was attached to one of the most powerful offices in the land. He lived like a pauper. The officer's room was subdivided into two using a curtain to improvise a bedroom and sitting room - like many poor people live in Nairobi and other towns. A wooden bed stood on one side of the curtain while the other area had a three-seater sofa set and a small table. He had about five pairs of shoes, some placed under the bed while others were stored in the sitting room. Several suits hung on the wall, an indication that Kinei strived to look presentable despite his dismal circumstances. He worked at Deputy President William Ruto’s Harambee House Annex office in the city’s central business district. He had to look well-groomed. Nothing indicated that Kinei cooked in the home. The place had no cooking gear or utensils. He seemingly ate at restaurants and only went to the house to sleep. Neighbours told the Star the officer relied on a woman who does menial jobs within the estate to do his laundry. The bungalow in the same compound with the servant quarter is spacious and decent, while Kinei's room had only a window and door. The residence is well secured with three main gates, two manned by private security guards. The gated community secure and serene, which locals said is what attracted people with high income. Kinei’s door was open when the body was discovered.
