Kakamega Homeboyz striker Allan Wanga was feted by football fans from the western region under the umbrella of ‘Friends of Wanga’ who recognised him for stellar performances at the club last season. Wanga, who was chasing for the Kenya Premier League (KPL) Golden Boot before he lost to Enosh Ochieng, scored 17 goals and helped  Homeboyz finish the league in top five for the very first time. Led by Owen Omusuma and Faith Gitira, the fans rewarded the former AFC Leopards star with Sh41,000 cash prize as a token of appreciation for the good performances and challenged him to work even harder and fulfil his dream of bagging the Golden Boot this season. “We want to appreciate Wanga for leading from the front and sacrificing to help Homeboyz finish in a better position. “We, however, want to fault FKF for doing little to end the vice of match-fixing in our local football. “We want to warn those mandated with running football in the country to ensure that pertinent issues being raised during matches are handled with the seriousness they deserve and not through casual talk,” pointed out Omusuma. He challenged the Homeboyz team to maintain the fighting spirit and contest for the title as they have what it takes to wrestle it. On his part, Wanga thanked the fans for the good gesture and promised to work even harder to help Homeboyz win titles. “ I am so touched with the move which has come as a big surprise to me. It’s all about teamwork, players, fans and the technical bench. We want to maintain this good atmosphere and ensure that Homeboyz win the title.” Homeboyz are currently third on the KPL log with 41 points three shy of leaders Gor Mahia.
