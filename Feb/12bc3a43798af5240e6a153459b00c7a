The High Court has reinstated a marriage between a Muslim man and Christian woman that was dissolved in 2017. The woman converted to Islam and married her husband in 2008 under Islamic law. But years later she went back to Christianity. The couple had a child who is nine. Justice Aggrey Muchelule ruled on Friday that the Kadhi’s Court did not have the powers to grant the divorce. The judge said that since the woman was not Muslim anymore, Kadhi’s Court ought no to have heard the matter. “It had no jurisdiction over the marriage. It could not therefore dissolve the marriage,” he said. The judge also quashed the custody of the couple’s child that had been given to the man, with visitation rights. The man filed a petition before the Kadhi’s Court at Kibera in April 2017 seeking the dissolution of the marriage and custody of the child. He informed the court that the woman was a Christian when they met but she converted into Islam and was issued a certificate. He said after some time, his wife changed. She began wearing short dresses, including mini-skirts. “I also found out that she was attending prayers in a Catholic church. “When I confronted her, she responded that she had converted to Muslim to get a husband. Now that she had got him she had decided to go back to Christianity,” he testified. The woman did not defend herself during the trial and after three months the Kadhi dissolved the marriage. She filed an appeal and questioned the Kadhi’s court jurisdiction on a dispute relating to the marriage as she was herself a Christian and not a Muslim, and claims relating to the custody of the child. The Kadhi’s Court did not have jurisdiction over the marriage if both parties did not profess the Muslim religion. Justice Muchelule referred to a different case in Mombasa. “The High Court determined that the Kadhi’s court’s assumption of jurisdiction over the issue of custody of the children was unlawful. The court had exceeded its jurisdiction,” he said.
