The Kenya Airways staff member who was suspended for sharing a video of a Chinese airways plane landing at JKIA has said his life is in danger. Geri Ali was indefinitely suspended for sharing a video clip of China Southern airways landing at JKIA on Wednesday with 239 passengers on board. He claims he is now receiving threats from the Anti-Terrorism Police Unit. He is allegedly been accused of working with a terrorist organisation on the basis of his name - Ali. Through his lawyer Dunstan Omari Ali said he is scared for his life so much so that he wanted to be kept in a police cell for protection. He will move to court on Monday to challenge KQ's suspension and allow him to resume work. Omari said Ali's decision to film the plane landing was heroic. Ali has been working as an assistant security agent for KQ since January 2019.
