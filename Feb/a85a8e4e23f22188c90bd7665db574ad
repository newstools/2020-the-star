Police are piecing together information to find out circumstances leading to murder of an Asian tycoon at his Westlands home. Karandeep Singh Dhilon was shot dead on Friday night by a gunman in what police believe could be a case of business rivalry. Homicide detectives from Directorate of Criminal Investigations began the probe into the killing on Saturday. Yesterday, Nairobi police boss Philip Ndolo ruled out robbery saying the remote controlled gate was intact and there were no signs of break in. “Everything was in place when officers visited the scene. Even his phone was there. Nothing was stolen,” he said. Given the circumstances, Ndolo said that the killers could have been inside the house long before the killing. Asked if the murder could be a case of business rivalry he said: “Most probably it was planned …what else could.” The suspected motive is collaborated by a coincidence that close family members had travelled to India prior to the killing. He was alone in the house with only his dogs, which were poised for company. “Somebody was on a mission to kill. They were waiting for him in the house,” Ndolo said. He had a gunshot wound in his head an nobody has been arrested in connection with the murder yet. His body was taken to City mortuary pending postmortem. The murder is the latest on the controversial killings of the wealthy in the city. On September 2019, a Dutch tycoon Tob Cohen was found in a septic tank at his home in Lower Kabete after missing for nearly two months.
