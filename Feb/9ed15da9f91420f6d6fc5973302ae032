Promotion chasing Bidco United will be missing a couple of key players when they take on  Modern Coast Rangers in a National Super League clash on Saturday at the Serani grounds. Bidco, who stands second in the NSL with 48 points, will be without the duo of Antony Simasi and Jacob Onyango. Simasi will be missing in action having received a red card in the game against Muranga Seal. Onyango, meanwhile,  will be absent after accumulating five yellow cards this season. Victory for Bidco will move them to within four points of leaders Nairobi City Stars who will not be in action this weekend. The highlight of the weekend will, however, be a game pitting Kibera Black Stars against Shabana at the Camp Toyoyo grounds on Sunday. Shabana currently stand at position eleven with a total of 29 points while Kibera Black Stars hold position 16 with a total of 18 points. Struggling Kenya Police who will tackle  Talanta at the Karuturi grounds will be severely depleted with the absences of Dickson Omwenga, Michael Lyayuga and Silicho Simiyu. Omwenga received a straight red card in their game against Mt. Kenya United while Lyayuga received a red card in their game against Migori Youth. Simiyu accumulated five yellow cards this season. Ushuru’s forward Brian Yakhama meanwhile leads the NSL top scorers' chart with 14 goals with only two having come from the spot. Clinton Okoth, Erick Ombija and Eric Gichimu from Migori Youth, Coast Stima and Bidco United respectively, follow suit at positions two, three and four. Forwards Clement Masakidi and Junior Adeyefa from Mt. Kenya United and Vihiga United are tied at position five with 10 goals a piece.
