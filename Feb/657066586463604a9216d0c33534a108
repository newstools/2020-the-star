Thousands of KenyansÂ trooped to Nyayo Stadium early Tuesday morning for the memorial service of the late and former President Daniel Moi. Some started arriving as early as 4am and nearly all seats in the 30,000-capacity stadium were taken up by 8am. Different Heads of states are also expected to attend the ceremony. After the service, Moi's remains will be taken back to Lee Funeral home one last time. Later, the body will be flown to Kabarak and will spend the night at his homestead. On Wednesday, there will be a final service and Mzee Moi will then be buried next to his late wife Lena in Kabarak. In the initial programme, the body was to be taken to Parliament from the mortuary. However, the programme changed.
