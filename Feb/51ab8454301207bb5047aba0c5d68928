Former champions Kenya Police will be competitive this season despite lack of signings, coach Patrick Mugambi has declared. The law enforcers are the only Premier League side without new players. Seasoned rivals and defending champions Butali Warriors as well as runner up Wazalendo have made statement signings but Mugambi is unfazed. Police finished third last season and their performance was marred by injuries, inconsistency and concentration lapse, aspects the tactician said they are working on in training. Mugambi  said players who were unavailable last season due to work-related commitments are back in the frame and there was no need to recruit new ones. Police have an uphill task to bridge the 16-point gap with Butali. "We will need an injury-free season and the playing unit must punch above their weight if we are to have a successful season," said Mugambi. He added: "We are going to give teams a run for their money. We have rectified our mistakes and the returning players have crucial roles to play with their experience. Our midfield is among the strongest in the division and with a new strategy, we can match the best. We need to sharpen our forward line." Defenders Kevin Patrick and Richard Birir and utility player Brian Saina are back in training, according to the coach. Moses Cheplaiti returns to training next month and will be unavailable for the first few games. "The absence of new signings will not be a big deal for the team. We finished third with all the inadequacies last season and this  it means we are still strong," he noted. He observed: "We know Butali have assembled top crop players. We lost both legs against them last season with a one-goal margin and we can't allow that to happen this time round," promised  Mugambi. Police have lined up a number of friendlies to boost the fitness of players as the league serves off on February 29.
