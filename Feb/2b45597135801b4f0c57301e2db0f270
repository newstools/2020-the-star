Administration Police coach Samson Gitau is confident of avoiding relegation from the second tier league despite a poor run this season. Gitau said the 2-2 weekend draw against Shabana at Gusii Stadium is a morale booster for the law enforcers.  The team sits 17th in the National Super League log with 17 points from 23 games having won two games, lost 10 and drawn 11 so far. “We lost several first team players and we are currently rebuilding the team. We are not in a good position currently but the new signings are getting used to our system of play and I’m confident we will evade relegation,” said Gitau. At the same time, Shabana have vowed to strengthen their technical bench, according to vice chairman Nyandoro Kambi. “We urgently need a goalkeeper trainer and an assistant coach. We conceded easy goals after going 2-0 up,” said Kambi after the weekend game against AP. The club has been operating without a goalkeeper coach following the departure of Geoffrey Atuti while Nyaberi has been operating alone after head coach Andrew Kanuli left. Weekend matches also saw Bidco United narrow the gap on log leaders Nairobi City Stars to seven points. Coast Stima, coached by Paul Ogai, upset City Stars 3-1 while Bidco defeated Muranga Seal 2-1 at Thika Stadium. City Stars have 55 points while Bidco United have 48. Vihiga United maintained the third position with 42 points after beating Modern Coast Rangers 4-1 at Mumias Sports Complex. Promotion seeking Nairobi Stima succumbed 2-0 to Fortune Sacco at the Kianyaga Stadium. The power men, however, have a game at hand.   ”
