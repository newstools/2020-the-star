More than 150 chemists in six Rift Valley counties have been closed by the Pharmacy and Poisons Board because they were unregistered and run by quacks. The board has been carrying out inspections and a crackdown for a week. Director Jacinta Wasike of Inspectorate, Surveillance and Enforcement told the press on Friday that 54 cases have been filed in court. The accused face offences of operating unlicensed pharmacies among other charges. ''It is sad a private chemist was found stocking government medicines, selling reproductive health products and HIV testing kits at the expense of patients, thus posing a health risk," Wasike said. Wasike also said the chemists will be blacklisted and a notice will alert customers. Those found guilty will be fined Sh200,000 and sh100,000, adding that some professionals were selling their licenses to quacks. The crackdown was carried out in Trans Nzoia, Nandi, Uasin Gishu, West Pokot, Elgeyo Marakwet and Baringo counties, among others, to weed out pharmacies operating without following procedure. Uasin  Gishu county commissioner Jaldessa Adulrazack has warned the public to be cautious of the outlets where they buy medicines.  He urged people to report unmarked and unnamed chemists, suspect medicine and suspicious medicine handlers to the Pharmacists and Poisons Board. He said that people selling fake fertiliser and agrochemicals that their days are numbered. (Edited by V. Grahan)
