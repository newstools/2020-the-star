During the Building Bridges Initiative Forum in Narok County on Saturday., Olekina asked the community must stand firm to protect their land and territory as leaders from the Maa community. Protesting that members from the community were not from a lesser god, Olekina said they had been terrorized and stigmatized. “The community’s issues will be articulated by the Maasai people,” Olekina said. “We are very hospitable, we have invited everybody to this meeting. We must stand firm to protect our land and territory”. A group of Rift Valley leaders have demanded a public apology by the embattled governor over his remarks. While speaking to the media, the MCAs expressed their disgust in Olekina's tribal leadership. The senator was last week condemned by the NCIC for the statements he made on national television. During an interview in JKL, the senator said the upcoming Building Bridges Initiative rally in Narok will be about the Maa community. Olekina had said two groups held meetings separately to articulate on issues to be addressed during the rally. "In the morning, those who are non-Maasai held a meeting in Rongai. We held our meeting at the Maasai Lodge. We were there to articulate on our issues," Olekina said. "Maasai issues will be better articulated by Maasais and am not going to apologise for that." The senator further said that the meeting will only address issues affecting the entire Maa counties, which he alleged have been 'terrorised and stigmatised' for a long time.
